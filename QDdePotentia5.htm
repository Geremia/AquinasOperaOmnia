          <td>Et primo quaeritur utrum res conserventur in esse a Deo, an etiam circumscripta omni Dei actione, per se in esse remaneant. Et videtur quod sic.
          <td>THE question at issue is about the preservation of things in their being by God: and the first point of inquiry is whether they continue to exist independently of all divine action: and seemingly they do.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicitur enim Deut. XXXII, 4: Dei perfecta sunt opera. Ex hoc sic arguitur. Perfectum est cui nihil deest, secundum philosophum. Ei autem aliquid deest ad suum esse quod non potest esse nisi aliquo exteriori agente. Ergo huiusmodi perfectum non est; Dei ergo talia opera non sunt.
          <td>1. It is written (Deut. xxxii, 4): God’s <i>works are Perfect.</i> Accordingly it is argued thus. A perfect thing is that which lacks nothing, according to the Philosopher ( <i>Phys.</i> iii). Now a thing lacks something in its very being if it cannot exist without the assistance of an external agent. Such a thing therefore is not perfect, and consequently the works of God are not such.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed dicebat, quod opera Dei non sunt perfecta simpliciter, sed secundum suam naturam.- Sed contra, perfectum secundum suam naturam est quod habet illud cuius sua natura est capax. Sed quidquid habet totum illud cuius sua natura est capax, potest remanere in esse, omni Dei conservatione exteriori cessante. Ergo si creaturae aliquae sunt perfectae secundum suam naturam, possunt remanere in esse, Deo non conservante. Probatio mediae. Deus conservando res, aliquid agit: propter quod dicitur Ioan. V, 17: pater meus usque modo operatur, et ego operor, ut dicit Augustinus. Agente autem aliquid operante, effectus aliquid recipit. Ergo quamdiu Deus conservat res, semper res conservatae aliquid a Deo recipiunt: quamdiu ergo res conservatione indiget, nondum totum habet cuius est capax.
          <td>2. It may be said that God’s works are not simply perfect but only in regard to their nature.—On the contrary a thing is perfect as to its nature if it has all that its nature is capable of having. Now whatsoever has all that its nature is capable of having, is able to continue in existence, even if God cease to preserve it from without. If then some creatures are perfect in their nature they can continue to exist without God keeping them in existence. The minor premise is proved thus. The preservation of things is a work of God: hence is is said Jo. v. 17): <i>My Father works even till now, and I work</i> (cf. Augustine, <i>Gen. ad lit.</i> x): and when an agent works, the effect receives something. Wherefore as long as God preserves things the things preserved receive something from God, and thus whatsoever needs to be preserved has not all that it is capable of having.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, unumquodque non est perfectum nisi perficiat hoc ad quod est. Sed principia ad hoc sunt, ut rem in esse conservent. Si ergo principia creata rerum non possunt rem in esse tenere, sequitur ea esse imperfecta, et ita non esse Dei opera: quod est absurdum.
          <td>3. A thing is not perfect unless it fulfils its purpose. Now the principles of a thing are intended for the purpose of preserving the being thereof. If then the created principles of things are unable to keep things in existence, it follows that they are imperfect, and are not God’s works: which is absurd.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, Deus est causa rerum sicut efficiens. Sed cessante actione causae efficientis, remanet effectus; sicut cessante actione aedificatoris, remanet domus, et cessante actione ignis generantis, adhuc remanet ignis generatus. Ergo et cessante omni Dei actione, adhuc possunt creaturae in esse remanere.
          <td>4. God is the efficient cause of things. Now the effect remains when the action of the efficient cause ceases: thus the builder ceases to act yet the house remains; the flame that caused the fire may cease to bum yet the fire caused by it continues. Therefore even if God’s actions cease altogether, creatures can continue to exist.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed dicebat, quod agentia inferiora sunt causa fiendi et non essendi; unde esse effectuum remanet remota actione causarum fieri. Deus autem est causa rebus non solum fiendi, sed essendi. Unde esse rerum remanere non potest, divina actione cessante.- Sed contra, omnis res generata habet esse per suam formam. Si ergo causae inferiores generantes non sunt causae essendi, non erunt causae formarum; et ita formae quae sunt in materia, non sunt a formis quae sunt in materia secundum sententiam philosophi, qui dicit, forma quae est in his carnibus et ossibus, est a forma quae est in his carnibus et ossibus: sed sequitur quod formae in materia sint a formis sine materia, secundum sententiam Platonis, vel a datore formarum, secundum sententiam Avicennae.
          <td>5. But someone will say that lower agents are the causes of things becoming but not of their existence: so that the existence of an effect remains when the causes of its becoming have been removed: whereas God is the cause of things not only in their becoming but also in their being. Wherefore things cannot continue to exist if the divine action ceases. On the contrary every thing generated has being by its form. If then the lower generating causes do not cause existence, they will not be causes of forms: and consequently forms that are in matter are not produced by forms in matter, which is contrary to the opinion of the Philosopher ( <i>Metaph.</i> vii, 8) who asserts that a form which is in this or that flesh and bones is produced by a form that is in this or that flesh and bones: and it will follow that forms in matter are produced by forms outside matter, which was Plato’s view, or by the giver of forms, as Avicenna contended ( <i>Metaph.</i> ix, 4, 5).
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, ea quorum esse est in fieri, non possunt remanere cessante actione agentis, ut patet de motu et de agone, et similibus; illa vero quorum esse est in facto esse, possunt remanere etiam agentibus remotis. Unde Augustinus dicit: praesente lumine non factus est aer lucidus, sed fit; quia si factus esset, non fieret; sed absente lumine lucidus remaneret. Multae autem creaturae sunt quorum esse non est in fieri, sed in facto esse; ut patet de Angelis, et de corporibus etiam omnibus. Ergo, cessante actione Dei agentis, creaturae possunt remanere in esse.
          <td>6. Things whose being is as yet in the state of becoming cannot continue after the agent has ceased to act, as instanced in movement, fire and the like, whereas those in actual existence can continue even after the agent has been removed. Hence Augustine ( <i>Gen. ad lit.</i> viii, 12) says: By the presence of light the air is not made (permanently) lightsome, but is being made lightsome, for if it had been made (permanently) lightsome, it would not continue to be made lightsome, and if the light were removed it would remain, lightsome.” Now there are many creatures whose being is not in a state of becoming but of actual existence, such as the angels and all bodies. Therefore creatures can remain in existence after God has ceased to act.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, causae inferiores generantes sunt rebus generatis causae essendi, ut supra probatum est; non tamen sicut causae principales et primae, sed sicut causae secundae. Causa autem prima essendi, quae Deus est, rebus generatis non dat principium essendi, nisi mediantibus causis secundis praedictis. Ergo nec permanentiam in esse, quia eadem res per idem habet esse et in esse conservatur. Sed esse generatorum conservatur ex ipsis principiis essentialibus generatorum, cessantibus causis secundis agentibus. Ergo etiam cessante causa prima agente, quae Deus est.
          <td>7. Lower generating causes, as proved above, cause the existence of the things they generate; not, however, as principle and first, but as second causes. Now the first cause of existence which is God, does not give the things he produces the beginning of existence except through the second causes mentioned above. Wherefore neither does he give them continuance of existence, since one and the same thing derives both being and continuance of being from the same cause. Wherefore things generated are kept in existence by their essential principles, when second active causes have ceased: and consequently even when the first cause, namely God, withdraws his activity.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, si res aliqua deficit esse, aut hoc est propter materiam, aut propter hoc quod est ex nihilo. Materia autem non est causa corruptionis nisi secundum quod est subiecta contrarietati; non autem in omnibus creaturis est materia contrarietati subiecta. Ergo illa in quibus non est materia contrarietati subiecta, sicut sunt corpora caelestia et Angeli, non possunt deficere ratione materiae, nec iterum ratione eius quod sunt ex nihilo, quia ex nihilo nihil sequitur et nihilum nihil agit, et ita non corrumpit. Ergo cessante omni actione divina, huiusmodi res esse non deficerent.
          <td>8. If a thing cease to exist this is either by reason of its matter or because it is produced from nothing. But matter is not a cause of corruption except through being subject to contrariety; and there is not in all creatures matter subject to contrariety. Hence those things in which there is no matter subject to contrariety, such as the heavenly bodies and angels, cannot cease to exist by reason of matter. Nor can they cease to exist through being produced from nothing since from nothing nothing comes, and nothing has no action, and consequently does not cause a thing to be corrupted. Therefore if all divine action were to cease, such things would not cease to exist.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, forma incipit esse in materia in instanti quod est ultimum factionis, in quo res non est in fieri, sed in facto esse. Sed secundum Avicennae sententiam, formae rerum generatarum infunduntur in materia ab intelligentia agente, quae est datrix formarum. Ergo illa intelligentia est causa essendi, non tantum fiendi; et ita per actionem eius res possunt conservari in esse, etiam circumscripta Dei conservatione.
          <td>9. The form begins to be in matter in the last instant of a thing’s becoming when it is no longer in the state of becoming but of actual existence. Now in Avicenna’s opinion ( <i>Metaph.</i> ix, 4, 5) the forms of generated things are inserted in matter by an active intelligence which is the giver of forms. Wherefore that intelligence is the cause of being and not only of becoming so that by its action things can be kept in existence apart from God’s action.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, etiam forma substantialis est causa essendi. Si ergo causae essendi sunt quae conservant res in esse, ipsa forma rei sufficit ad hoc quod res in esse conservetur.
          <td>10. The substantial form also is a cause of existence so that if the cause of a thing’s existence also keeps it in existence, it follows that the form of a thing suffices to keep it in existence.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, res conservantur in esse per materiam, in quantum sustinet formam. Sed materia, secundum philosophum, est ingenita et incorruptibilis, et ita non est causata ab aliqua causa; et sic remanet, omni actione causae efficientis remota. Ergo adhuc res poterunt conservari in esse, cessante actione primae causae efficientis, scilicet Dei.
          <td>11. A thing is kept in existence by its matter inasmuch as this upholds the form. Now according to the Philosopher ( <i>Phys.</i> i, 82: <i>De Coelo et Mundo</i> , i, 20) matter is ungenerated and incorruptible., so that it is not produced by a cause, and, therefore remains even when all action of an efficient cause ceases. Wherefore it will be possible for things to remain in existence after the action of the, first efficient cause, namely God, has ceased.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, Eccli. XXXIII, 15: dicitur: intuere in omnia opera altissimi: duo contra duo, unum contra unum. Sed inter opera altissimi invenitur aliquid quod indiget Dei conservatione. Ergo etiam invenitur inter opera Dei eius oppositum, scilicet quod non indiget Dei conservatione.
          <td>12. It is written (Ecclus. xxxiii, 15): <i>Look upon all the works of the most High. Two and two, and one against another.</i> Now some of God’s works need his action to keep them in existence. Therefore as against these there must be some of God’s works which do not need to be kept in existence by him.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, appetitus naturalis non potest esse cassus et vanus. Sed quaelibet res naturaliter conservationem sui esse appetit. Potest ergo res per se ipsam conservari in esse; alias appetitus naturalis esset vanus.
          <td>13. The natural appetite cannot be null and void. Now everything has a natural appetence for the preservation of Its existence. Wherefore a thing is able of itself to remain in existence, else its natural appetite would be frustrated.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, Augustinus dicit, quod Deus fecit singula bona, simul autem omnia valde bona: propter quod dicitur Genes. I, 31: vidit Deus cuncta quae fecerat, et erant valde bona. Ipsa ergo creaturarum universitas est valde bona et optima; optimi enim est optima adducere, secundum Platonem in Timaeo. Sed melius est quod non indiget aliquo exteriori ad sui conservationem, eo quod indiget. Ergo universitas creaturarum non indiget aliquo exteriori conservante.
          <td>14. Augustine says ( <i>Enchir.</i> x) that God makes each thing good, and all things together very good; for which reason it is written (Gen. i, 31): God <i>saw all the things that he had made and they were very good.</i> Accordingly the universe of creatures is very good and the best of all since <i>best produces best</i> according to Plato (Tim.). Now it. is better not to need another thing for one’s preservation in existence, than to need another for that purpose. Therefore the universe of creatures needs no other to keep it in existence.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, beatitudo est aliquid creatum in natura beatorum. Sed beatitudo est status omnium bonorum congregatione perfectus, ut Boetius dicit; quod non esset, nisi in se includeret sui conservationem, quod est unum de maxime bonis. Ergo aliquid creatum est quod per se ipsum potest conservari in esse.
          <td>15. Heavenly bliss is something created in the nature of the blessed. Now heavenly bliss is a state rendered perfect by the accumulation of all goods according to Boethius ( <i>De Consol.</i> iii, 2): and this must needs include continuance in existence, which is one of the greatest goods. Therefore there is a creature that can of itself remain in existence.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, dicit Augustinus, quod Deus ita administrat res sua providentia, quod tamen sinit eas agere proprios motus. Sed proprius motus naturae ex nihilo existentis est ut in nihilum tendat. Ergo dominus permittit naturam quae est ex nihilo, in nihilum tendere. Non ergo conservat res in esse.
          <td>16. Augustine says ( <i>De Civ. Dei</i> vii, 30) that God so governs things by his providence that he allows them to exercise their own movements. Now the proper movement of nature since it proceeds from nothing is to return to nothing. Therefore God allows the nature that comes from nothing to return to nothing: and consequently he does not keep things in existence.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, recipiens quod est contrarium recepto, non conservat receptum, sed magis ipsum destruit. Videmus enim quod quae recipiuntur ab agentibus naturalibus per violentiam in suis contrariis, remanent ad horam, cessante actione naturalium agentium; sicut calor remanet in aqua calefacta, cessante actione ignis, ad horam. Effectus autem Dei non recipiuntur in aliquo contrario, sed in nihilo; quia ipse est auctor totius substantiae rei. Ergo multo magis remanebunt divini effectus vel ad horam, divina actione cessante.
          <td>17. A recipient that is contrary to what it has received does not preserve it but destroys it. Thus we observe that when a natural agency produces in a subject an effect by violence, this effect remains for a time in the subject opposed to it, after the natural agent has ceased to act: thus after the fire has ceased to act, heat remains in the water heated, but only for a time. Now God’s effects are received not in a contrary but in nothing, since he is the author of the whole substance of a thing. Much more then will the divine effects remain, be it only for a time, after God’s action has ceased.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, forma est principium cognoscendi, operandi et essendi. Sed forma absque exteriori adminiculo potest esse operandi principium et cognoscendi. Ergo et essendi; et ita cessante omni Dei actione res per formam potest conservari in esse.
          <td>Form is the principle of knowledge, operation and existence. Now a form without assistance from without can be a principle of operation and knowledge. Therefore It can also be a principle of existence, so that after all divine action has ceased, things can be kept in existence by their forms.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed contra. Est quod dicitur Hebr. I, 3: portans omnia verbo virtutis suae; ubi dicit Glossa: sicut ab eo creata sunt, ita per eum immutabilia conservantur.
          <td>On the contrary it is written (Heb. i, 8): <i>Upholding all things by , the word of his power:</i> and the gloss remarks “Even as all things were created by him, so by him are they preserved unchangeable.”
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, Augustinus dicit: creatoris potentia et omnipotentis virtus causa subsistendi est omni creaturae; quae virtus ab eis quae creata sunt regendis si aliquando cessaret, simul et illorum cessaret species, omnisque natura concideret. Et infra. Mundus nec in ictu oculi stare poterit, si ei Deus regimen suum subtraxerit.
          <td>Again, Augustine says ( <i>Gen. ad lit.</i> iv, 12): “The might of the Creator and the Power of the Almighty is the cause of existence in every creature; and if the ruling power of God were withdrawn from his creatures, their form would at once cease and all nature would collapse;” and further on: “The world would not stand for one instant, if God withdrew his support.”
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, Gregorius dicit, quod omnia in nihilum deciderent, nisi ea manus omnipotentis contineret.
          <td>Again, Gregory says ( <i>Moral.</i> xvi, 37) that all things would fall into nothingness were they not upheld by the hand of the Almighty.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, in Lib. de causis, dicitur: omnis intelligentiae fixio, id est permanentia et essentia, est per bonitatem quae est causa prima. Multo ergo fortius aliae creaturae non figuntur in esse nisi per Deum.
          <td>Again, in the book <i>De Causis</i> (prop. ix) it is said: “Every intelligence derives its immobility” i.e. stability and essence, “from that goodness which is the first cause.” A fortiori therefore, other creatures are not stabilised in existence save by God.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Respondeo. Dicendum quod absque omni dubio concedendum est, quod res conservantur in esse a Deo, et quod in momento in nihilum redigerentur, cum a Deo desererentur. Cuius ratio hinc accipi potest. Effectum enim a sua causa dependere oportet. Hoc enim est de ratione effectus et causae: quod quidem in causis formalibus et materialibus manifeste apparet. Quocumque enim materiali vel formali principio subtracto, res statim esse desinit, cum huiusmodi principia intrent essentiam rei. Idem autem iudicium oportet esse de causis efficientibus, et formalibus vel materialibus. Nam efficiens est causa rei secundum quod formam inducit, vel materiam disponit. Unde eadem dependentia rei est ad efficiens, et ad materiam et formam, cum per unum eorum ab altero dependeat. De finalibus autem causis oportet etiam idem esse iudicium quod de causa efficiente. Nam finis non est causa, nisi secundum quod movet efficientem ad agendum; non enim est primum in esse, sed in intentione solum. Unde et ubi non est actio, non est causa finalis, ut patet in III Metaph. Secundum hoc ergo esse rei factae dependet a causa efficiente secundum quod dependet ab ipsa forma rei factae. Est autem aliquod efficiens a quo forma rei factae non dependet per se et secundum rationem formae, sed solum per accidens: sicut forma ignis generati ab igne generante, per se quidem, et secundum rationem suae speciei non dependet, cum in ordine rerum eumdem gradum teneat, nec forma ignis aliter sit in generato quam in generante; sed distinguitur ab ea solum divisione materiali, prout scilicet est in alia materia. Unde cum igni generato sua forma sit ab aliqua causa, oportet ipsam formam dependere ab altiori principio, quod sit causa ipsius formae per se et secundum propriam speciei rationem. Cum autem esse formae in materia, per se loquendo, nullum motum vel mutationem implicet, nisi forte per accidens; omne autem corpus non agat nisi motum, ut philosophus probat, necesse est quod principium ex quo per se dependet forma, sit aliquod principium incorporeum; per actionem enim alicuius principii dependet effectus a causa agente. Et si aliquod principium corporeum est per aliquem modum causa formae, hoc habet in quantum agit virtute principii incorporei, quasi eius instrumentum; quod quidem necessarium est ad hoc quod forma esse incipiat, in quantum forma non incipit esse nisi in materia; non enim materia quocumque modo se habens potest subesse formae, quia proprium actum in propria materia oportet esse. Cum ergo est materia in dispositione quae non competit formae alicui, non potest a principio incorporeo, a quo forma dependet per se, eam consequi immediate; unde oportet quod sit aliquid transmutans materiam; et hoc est aliquod agens corporeum, cuius est agere movendo. Et hoc quidem agit in virtute principii incorporei, et eius actio determinatur ad hanc formam, secundum quod talis forma est in eo, actu (sicut in agentibus univocis) vel virtute (sicut in agentibus aequivocis). Sic igitur huiusmodi inferiora agentia corporalia, non sunt formarum principia in rebus factis, nisi quantum potest se extendere causalitas transmutationis, cum non agant nisi transmutando, ut dictum est; hoc autem est in quantum disponunt materiam, et educunt formam de potentia materiae. Quantum igitur ad hoc, formae generatorum dependent a generantibus naturaliter, quod educuntur de potentia materiae, non autem quantum ad esse absolutum. Unde et remota actione generantis, cessat eductio de potentia in actum quod est fieri generatorum; non autem cessant ipsae formae, secundum quas generata habent esse. Et inde est quod esse rerum generatarum manet, sed non fieri, cessante actione generantis. Si quae autem formae sunt non in materia, ut sunt substantiae intellectuales, vel in materia nullo modo indisposita ad formam, ut est in corporibus caelestibus, in quibus non sunt contrariae dispositiones; harum principium esse non potest nisi agens incorporeum, quod non agit per motum; nec dependent ab aliquo secundum fieri a quo non dependeant secundum esse. Sicut igitur cessante actione causae efficientis, quae agit per motum, in ipso instanti cessat fieri rerum generatarum, ita cessante actione agentis incorporei, cessat ipsum esse rerum ab eo creatarum. Hoc autem agens incorporeum, a quo omnia creantur, et corporalia et incorporalia, Deus est, sicut in alia quaestione ostensum est, a quo non solum sunt formae rerum, sed etiam materiae. Et quantum ad propositum non differt utrum immediate, vel quodam ordine, ut quidam philosophi posuerunt. Unde sequitur quod divina operatione cessante, omnes res eodem momento in nihilum deciderent, sicut auctoritatibus est probatum in argumentis sed contra.
          <td>I answer that without any doubt whatever it must be admitted that things are preserved in existence by God, and that they would instantly be reduced to nothing were God to abandon them. The proof of this may be expressed as follows. An effect must needs depend on its cause. This is part of the very nature of cause and effect; and is evidenced in formal and material causes, seeing that on the removal of any of its material or formal principles, a thing at once ceases to exist, because such principles enter into its essence., The statement applies to efficient causes even as to formal and material causes: since the efficient cause produces a thing by inducing the form or disposing the matter. Hence a thing depends equally on its efficient cause, its matter and its form since through the one it depends on the other. As to final causes the same is to be said of them as of efficient causes: because the end is a cause only for as much as it moves the efficient cause to act, since it comes first not in existence but in the intention. Consequently there is no action where there is no final cause ( <i>Metaph.</i> iii, 2). Accordingly the existence of a thing made depends on its efficient cause inasmuch as it depends on the form of the thing made. Now there can be an efficient cause on which the form of the thing made does not depend directly and considered as a form, but only indirectly: thus the form of a generated fire does not depend on the generating fire directly and by reason of its species, seeing that it occupies the same degree in the order of things, and the form of fire is in the same way in both the generated and in the generating fire, and is distinguished therefrom only by a material distinction, through being seated in another matter. Hence since the generated fire has its form from some cause, this same form must depend on some higher principle, that is the cause of that form directly and in respect of its very species. Now seeing that properly speaking the existence of a form in matter implies no movement or change except accidentally, and since no bodies act unless moved, as the Philosopher shows, it follows of necessity that the principle on which the form depends directly must be something incorporeal, for the effect depends on its active cause through the action of a principle. And if a corporeal principle be in some way the cause of a form, this is due to its acting by virtue of an incorporeal principle and as its instrument. In fact this is necessary in order that the form begin to exist, inasmuch as it does not begin to exist otherwise than in matter: because matter cannot be subject of a form unless it have a particular disposition, since the proper act should be in its proper matter. When, therefore, matter is in a disposition unsuitable to a particular form, it cannot directly receive that form from an incorporeal principle on which the form directly depends, so that there is need for something to .transmute the matter: and this will be a corporeal agent whose action consists in moving something. This corporeal agent acts by virtue of the incorporeal principal, and its action terminates in this or that form, inasmuch as this or that form is in the corporeal agent either actually (as in universal agents) or virtually (as in equivocal agents). Accordingly these lower corporeal agents are not the cause of the forms in things made, except to the extent of their causality in trans-muting matter, since they do not act except by transmuting, as stated above (Q. iii, AA. 7, 8): and this is by transmuting matter and educing the form from the potentiality of matter. Hence the form of the thing generated depends naturally on the generator <u>in</u> so far as it is educed from the potentiality of matter, but not as to its absolute existence. And, therefore, when the act of the generator ceases, the eduction of the form from potentiality into actual being, that is the <i>becoming</i> of the thing generated, ceases, whereas the form itself whereby the thing generated has its existence, does not cease. Hence it is that the existence of the thing generated, but not its becoming, remains after the action of the generator has ceased. On the other hand, forms that do not exist in matter, such as intellectual substances, or that exist in matter nowise indisposed to the form, such as the heavenly bodies wherein there are no contrary dispositions, must proceed from a principle that is an incorporeal agent that acts not by movement, nor do they depend on something for their. <i>becoming</i> without depending on it also for their <i>being.</i> Wherefore just as when the action of their efficient cause which acts by movement ceases, at that very instant the becoming of the thing generated ceases, even so when the action of an incorporeal agent ceases, the very existence of things created by it ceases. Now this incorporeal agent by whom all things, both corporeal and incorporeal are created, is God, as we have proved above (Q. iii, AA. 5, 6, 8), from whom things derive not only their form but also their matter. And as to the question at issue it makes no difference whether they were all made by him immediately, or in a certain order as certain philosophers have maintained. We conclude then that with the cessation of the divine operation, at the same instant all things would fall into nothingness, as we have proved by the authorities quoted in the arguments <i>On the contrary.</i>

Si autem ponamus formas substantiales educi de potentia materiae, secundum sententiam Aristotelis, agentia naturalia non solum erunt causae dispositionum materiae, sed etiam formarum substantialium; quantum ad hoc dumtaxat quod de potentia educuntur in actum, ut dictum est, et per consequens sunt essendi principia quantum ad inchoationem ad esse, et non quantum ad ipsum esse absolute.

The Platonists together with Avicenna through denying the eduction of forms from matter were obliged to hold that natural agents merely dispose matter, and that the form is induced by a principle that is separate from matter. On the other hand if with Aristotle we hold substantial forms to be educed from the potentiality of matter, natural agents will dispose not only matter but also the substantial form, only, however, in regard to its eduction from the potentiality of matter into actual existence, as stated above (Q. iii, AA. 9, 11): so that they will be principles of existence as considered in its inchoation but not as considered absolutely.

Quaedam vero formae producuntur quidem secundum perfectam rationem speciei, non autem secundum perfectum esse in materia, sicut calor qui est in aqua calefacta, habet perfectam speciem caloris, non tamen perfectum esse, quod est ex applicatione formae ad materiam, eo quod in materia remanet forma contraria tali qualitati. Et huiusmodi formae possunt ad modicum remanere post actionem agentis; sed prohibentur diu permanere a contrario principio, quod est in materia. Quaedam vero producuntur in materia et secundum imperfectam speciem et secundum imperfectum esse, sicut lumen in aere a corpore lucido. Non enim lumen est in aere sicut quaedam forma naturalis perfecta prout est in corpore lucido, sed magis per modum intentionis. Unde sicut similitudo hominis non manet in speculo nisi quamdiu est oppositum homini, ita nec lumen in aere, nisi apud praesentiam corporis lucidi: huiusmodi enim intentiones dependent a formis naturalibus corporum per se, et non solum per accidens; et ideo esse eorum non manet cessante actione agentium. Huiusmodi ergo propter imperfectionem sui esse, dicuntur esse in fieri; sed creaturae perfectae non dicuntur esse in fieri propter sui esse imperfectionem, quamvis actio Dei earum factionis indeficienter permaneat.
          <td><i>Reply to the Sixth Objection.</i> Some of the forms that begin to exist in matter through the action of a corporeal agent are when produced perfect both in their specific nature and in their being in matter, like the form of their generator: the reason being that the matter does not retain contrary principles: and such forms remain after the action of their generator, until the time of their corruption. Other forms however when produced are perfect in their specific nature, but have not perfect being in matter: thus heat in hot water has the perfect species of heat, but not perfect being which depends on the hold that the form has on the matter, inasmuch as the matter retains the form that is contrary to the quality of heat. Forms of this description can remain for a short time after the action of the agent, but are prevented from remaining for long by the contrary principle that is in the matter. Again other forms when produced in matter are imperfect both in species and in being: as for instance light which is produced in the air by a luminous body: for light in the air is not a perfect natural form as light in the luminous body, but rather after the manner of an <i>intention.</i> Hence just as a man’s likeness does not remain in a mirror save as long as the mirror is in front of him, even so neither does light remain in the air when the luminous body is no longer present. For these <i>intentional</i> beings depend on the natural forms of bodies directly and not only accidentally, so that they no longer remain in existence after the action of the agent has ceased. Wherefore suchlike things are said to be in a state of becoming on account of the imperfection of their being, whereas perfect creatures are not said to be in a state of becoming although they have an imperfect being, and God Who made them never ceases to uphold them.

Much less therefore can other creatures cease to exist otherwise than through some agency. If then God were to annihilate a creature, this would not be except through some kind of action. But this cannot be done through an action: since every action, proceeding as it does from an actual being, must terminate in an actual being, because every maker produces its like.

Now no active cause produces imperfection and corruption save accidentally, since nothing acts without intending a good, according to Dionysius ( <i>Div.

Now God cannot deprive a thing of what is essential to it, thus he cannot make a man not to be an animal and yet remain a man.

Now if a thing which has an intrinsic possibility not to exist, could be made by something else to exist of necessity, a corruptible thing might be changed into an incorruptible one.

If creatures have no necessity of existing except in so far as they depend on God, and if they depend on God in so far as he is their cause, their necessity of existing must correspond to the mode of causality whereby God is their cause. Now God is the cause of things not of necessity but by his will, as we have proved above (Q. iii, A. 15). Therefore necessity in things will be such as it is in things that are produced by the will. Now things effected by the will are not necessary simply and absolutely: their necessity is only conditional, inasmuch as the will is not determined by necessity, to one particular effect. It follows then that in things nothing is absolutely necessary, but only conditionally —even as it is necessary that Socrates move if he runs; or walk if he wishes to walk and is not prevented from so doing. Whence it would seem to follow that no creature is simply incorruptible, and that all are corruptible: which cannot be admitted.

          <td>Respondeo. Dicendum, quod in rebus a Deo factis dicitur aliquid esse possibile dupliciter. Uno modo per potentiam agentis tantum; sicut antequam mundus fieret, possibile fuit mundum fore, non per potentiam creaturae, quae nulla erat, sed solum per potentiam Dei, qui mundum in esse producere poterat. Alio modo per potentiam quae est in rebus factis; sicut possibile est corpus compositum corrumpi. Si ergo loquamur de possibilitate ad non esse ex parte rerum factarum, dupliciter circa hoc aliqui opinati sunt. Avicenna namque posuit, quod quaelibet res praeter Deum habebat in se possibilitatem ad esse et non esse. Cum enim esse sit praeter essentiam cuiuslibet rei creatae, ipsa natura rei creatae per se considerata, possibilis est ad esse; necessitatem vero essendi non habet nisi ab alio, cuius natura est suum esse, et per consequens est per se necesse esse, et hoc Deus est. Commentator vero contrarium ponit, scilicet quod quaedam res creatae sunt in quarum natura non est possibilitas ad non esse, quia quod in sua natura habet possibilitatem ad non esse, non potest ab extrinseco acquirere sempiternitatem, ut scilicet sit per naturam suam sempiternum. Et haec quidem positio videtur rationabilior. Potentia enim ad esse et non esse non convenit alicui nisi ratione materiae, quae est pura potentia. Materia etiam, cum non possit esse sine forma, non potest esse in potentia ad non esse, nisi quatenus existens sub una forma, est in potentia ad aliam formam. Dupliciter ergo potest contingere quod in natura alicuius rei non sit possibilitas ad non esse. Uno modo per hoc quod res illa sit forma tantum subsistens in esse suo, sicut substantiae incorporeae, quae sunt penitus immateriales. Si enim forma ex hoc quod inest materiae, est principium essendi in rebus materialibus, nec res materialis potest non esse nisi per separationem formae; ubi ipsa forma in esse suo subsistit nullo modo poterit non esse; sicut nec esse potest a se ipso separari. Alio modo per hoc quod in materia non sit potentia ad aliam formam, sed tota materiae possibilitas ad unam formam terminetur; sicut est in corporibus caelestibus, in quibus non est formarum contrarietas. Illae ergo solae res in sua natura possibilitatem habent ad non esse, in quibus est materia contrarietati subiecta. Aliis vero rebus secundum suam naturam competit necessitas essendi, possibilitate non essendi ab earum natura sublata. Nec tamen per hoc removetur quin necessitas essendi sit eis a Deo, quia unum necessarium alterius causa esse potest, ut dicitur in V Metaphysic. Ipsius enim naturae creatae cui competit sempiternitas, causa est Deus. In illis etiam rebus in quibus est possibilitas ad non esse, materia permanet; formae vero sicut ex potentia materiae educuntur in actum in rerum generatione, ita in corruptione de actu reducuntur in hoc quod sint in potentia. Unde relinquitur quod in tota natura creata non est aliqua potentia, per quam sit aliquid possibile tendere in nihilum.
          <td>I answer that things made by God may be said to be possible to, him in two ways. First with regard to the power of the agent alone: thus before the world was made, it was possible for the world to exist, not by a possibility inherent to the creature, which did not exist, but only by the power of God, who was able to bring the world into being. Secondly in respect of a possibility inherent to the thing made: thus it is possible for a composite body to be corrupted. Accordingly if we consider the possibility of non-existence in reference to things made, there have been two opinions on this point. Avicenna ( <i>Metaph.</i> viii, 6) held that all things except God have in themselves a possibility of being and of non-being. Because seeing that being is something besides the essence of a created thing, the very nature of a creature considered in itself has a possibility of being, while it only has necessity of being from another whose nature is its being, and which therefore by its nature exists of necessity; and this is God. On the other hand the Commentator ( <i>Metaph.</i> xi, text. 41: and <i>De Subst. Orb.)</i> holds a contrary opinion, to wit that certain things were created in whose nature there is no possibility of non-being inasmuch as a thing that has in its nature a possibility of non-being, cannot acquire everlastingness from without, so as to become by its very nature everlasting. The latter opinion would seem more reasonable. Because possibility of being and non-being does not belong to a thing save by reason of its matter which is pure potentiality. And matter since it cannot exist without a form cannot have a potentiality in respect of non-being, save as, while existing under some form it retains the possibility of receiving another form. Accordingly it may happen in two ways, that a thing’s nature does not include the possibility of non-being. First, because that thing is a pure form subsistent in its own being, such as incorporeal substances which are entirely immaterial. For if a form through being in matter is the principle of existence in material things, and a material thing cannot cease to exist save by losing its form, it follows that when a form subsists by itself it can nowise cease to exist, even as neither can existence be separated from itself. Secondly, because the matter has no potentiality in respect of another form, and the whole of its potentiality is determined by one form: such are the heavenly bodies in which there is no contrariety of forms. Accordingly a possibility of non-being is in the nature of those things alone whose matter is subject to contrariety of forms: whereas it belongs to other things by their nature to exist of necessity, all possibility of nonexistence being removed from their nature. And yet this does not imply that their necessity of existence is not from God: since one necessity may cause another ( <i>Metaph.</i> v). For the created nature to which everlastingness belongs is produced by God. Moreover in those things which contain a possibility of non-being the matter remains, while the forms change: thus, when things are generated, they are educed from potentiality into actuality by generation even as, when they are corrupted, they are reduced from actuality so as to return to a state of potentiality. It follows then that in all created natures there is no such potentiality whereby a thing is made to have the possibility of tending to nonexistence.

          <td>If on the other hand we consider the power of God the Maker of things, we must observe that a thing is said to be impossible to God in two ways. First, because it is impossible in itself, in that by its very nature it is outside the scope of any power whatsoever: such are things that involve a contradiction. Secondly, because the opposite of that thing is necessary: and this occurs in two ways with respect to an agent. First on the part of a natural active power that is confined to one effect: thus the power of a hot thing is confined to heating:, in this way God the Father begot the Son necessarily and cannot but beget him. Secondly, on the part of the ultimate end to which everything tends of necessity: thus man necessarily desires happiness and cannot possibly desire to be unhappy: and likewise God necessarily wills his goodness, and cannot possibly will things that are incompatible with it: for example we say that God cannot lie or wish to he. Now the simple non-existence of creatures is not in itself impossible as involving a contradiction (else they had existed from eternity: and the reason of this is that they are not their own being): thus in the statement, <i>The creature does not exist at all,</i> the predicate is not in conflict with the definition of the subject, whereas it is in the sentence, <i>Man is not a rational animal:</i> for sentences of the latter kind imply a contradiction and are impossible in themselves. Likewise God did not produce creatures by natural necessity, as though his power were determined to the existence of creatures, as we have proved above (A. 3). Likewise God’s goodness does not depend on creatures, as though it could not be without them: seeing that it gains nothing by them. It remains then that it is not impossible for God to reduce things to nothing: since he is not under the necessity of giving them being, except on the presupposition of his decree and fore-knowledge, in that he decreed and foresaw that he would keep things in existence for ever.

But seeing that even cessation from action cannot be in God save by his will, and that the will’s object is the end, it might be possible to ascribe an end even in the annihilation of things: so that as in the production of things, the end was the manifestation of God’s abundant goodness, so in the annihilation of things the end could be the sufficiency of his goodness, seeing that it is so self-sufficing as to need nothing from without.

          <td><i>Reply to the Fifth Objection.</i> The effect both follows its cause and derives its mode from the cause; wherefore effects consequent upon an act of the will, proceed from the will at the time appointed by the will; and not necessarily as soon as the will has decreed their existence. And thus since creatures proceed from God by his will, they come into being when it is God’s will that they should be, not of necessity or simultaneously with God’s will, otherwise they would have existed from eternity.

Unde cum principium factorum a Deo sit voluntas, secundum hoc in actione divina est ordo ad effectum, prout voluntas determinat. Et ideo quamvis actio Dei cessare non possit secundum suam substantiam, ordo tamen ad effectum cessare posset, si Deus vellet.
          <td><i>Reply to the Sixth Objection.</i> The action whereby God made things may be considered from a twofold point of view: it may be considered in its substance and in its relation to its effect. The substance of that action since it is the divine essence is eternal and cannot but be; whereas the relation to its effect depends on the divine will: because every action of a maker produces its effect according to the exigency of the principle of that action: thus fire imparts heat according to the measure of its own heat. Hence seeing that God’s will is the principle of the things made by him, his action bears a relation to his effects according as his will determines. Hence though God’s action cannot cease in its substance, its relation to his effects might cease, if he so willed.

Now it is not contrary to common sense that a rational soul cease to exist, as we have already made clear: but it is in common sense that the nature of the rational soul be incorruptible.

Thus by virtue of the union of the soul with its principle Adam’s body was in a way incorruptible through the grace attached to the state of innocence, and the bodies of the risen dead will be incorruptible by the grace belonging to the state of glory. On the other hand a nature which does not include the possibility of non-existence is not prevented from acquiring from another source the necessity of existence, since whatsoever perfection it has, it has received it from another: wherefore if its cause withdraw its action, it would cease to exist, not on account of its inherent potentiality to non-existence, but on account of God’s power to cease giving existence.

Accordingly just as he cannot cause an existing creature not to owe its existence to him, even so he cannot cause that creature not to be ordered to his goodness. Wherefore since the evil of sin removes the order of which he is the end, inasmuch as sin is aversion from the highest good; it follows that God cannot be the cause of the evil of sin, although he can be the cause of annihilation, by ceasing altogether to uphold a creature.

Voluntas enim Dei, quamvis, absolute considerata, ad opposita se in creaturis habeat, eo quod non magis ad unum quam ad alterum obligatur; ex suppositione tamen facta aliquam necessitatem habet. Sicut enim in creaturis aliquid quod se ad opposita habet, necessarium creditur positione aliqua facta, ut Socratem possibile est sedere et non sedere; necessarium tamen est eum sedere, cum sedet; ita voluntas divina, quae, quantum est de se, potest velle aliquid et eius oppositum, ut Petrum salvare, vel non, non potest velle Petrum non salvare, dum vult Petrum salvare. Et quia eius voluntas immutabilis est, si ponitur aliquando eum aliquid velle, necessarium est ex suppositione illud eum semper velle, licet non sit necessarium ut velit quod sit semper, quod vult esse aliquando. Quicumque autem vult aliquid propter se ipsum, vult ut illud sit semper, ex hoc ipso quod illud propter se vult. Quod enim aliquis vult quandoque esse et postmodum non esse, vult esse ut aliquid aliud perficiat; quo perfecto, eo non indiget quod propter illud perficiendum volebat. Deus autem creaturarum universitatem vult propter se ipsam, licet et propter se ipsum eam vult esse; haec enim duo non repugnant. Vult enim Deus ut creaturae sint propter eius bonitatem, ut eam scilicet suo modo imitentur et repraesentent; quod quidem faciunt in quantum ab ea esse habent, et in suis naturis subsistunt. Unde idem est dictu, quod Deus omnia propter se ipsum fecit, et quod creaturas fecerit propter earum esse, quod dicitur Sap. I, 14: creavit enim ut essent omnia. Unde ex hoc ipso quod Deus creaturas instituit, patet quod voluit eas semper durare; cuius oppositum propter eius immobilitatem nunquam continget.
          <td>In support of this solution to the question we may argue from a twofold source. First from the divine will, on which the existence of creatures depends. Although considered in itself God’s will about creatures is indifferent to opposite things, since it is not more bound to one alternative than to another, yet it is necessitated in a way of speaking through the granting of a supposition. For even as in creatures that which is indifferent to opposite things is necessitated through a supposition being made (thus it is possible for Socrates to sit or not to sit, but while he sits, it is necessary that he sit), so too the divine will which, considered in itself, can will either a certain thing or its opposite—for instance, to save or not to save Peter cannot will not to save Peter so long as he wills to save him. And whereas God’s will is unchangeable, if it be supposed that he wills a certain thing at some time, on that supposition it is necessary that he will it always, although it is not necessarily if he will a thing to last for a time, that he also will it to last for ever. Now he who wills a thing for its own sake, wills it to last for ever, for the very reason that he wills it for itself: because if he wills a thing to exist for a time, and afterwards not to exist, he wills that thing to exist for the perfection of something else, and when this latter is perfected, he no longer wills the thing that lie only willed that this other thing might be made perfect. Now God wills the created universe for its own sake, although he wills its existence for his own sake: for these two are not incompatible with each other. Because God wills creatures to exist for his goodness’ sake, namely that they may imitate and reflect it; which they do inasmuch as from it they derive their being, and subsist in their respective natures. Consequently it amounts to the same whether we say that God made all things for himself according to the text of Proverbs xvi, 4, <i>The Lord hath made all things for himself</i> , or that he made creatures that they might exist, according to Wisdom, i, 14, <i>He created all things that they might be.</i> Wherefore from the very fact that God made creatures it is to be inferred that he willed them to last for ever, and seeing that his will is unchangeable the opposite will never happen.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundo ex ipsa rerum natura; sic enim Deus unamquamque naturam instituit, ut ei non auferat suam proprietatem; unde dicitur Rom. XI, 24, in Glossa quod Deus, qui est naturarum conditor, contra naturas non agit, etsi aliquando in argumentum fidei in rebus creatis aliquid supra naturam operetur. Rerum autem immaterialium, quae contrarietate carent, proprietas naturalis est earum sempiternitas; quia in eis non est potentia ad non esse, ut supra ostensum est. Unde sicut igni non aufert naturalem inclinationem, qua sursum tendit, ita non aufert rebus praedictis sempiternitatem, ut eas in nihilum redigat.
          <td>Secondly, from the very nature of things. God fashioned each nature in such a way as not to deprive it of its property. Hence on the words of Romans xi, 24, <i>Contrary to nature thou wert grafted,</i> a gloss says that <i>God who is the author of nature does not act contrary to nature,</i> although at times in support of the faith he performs in creatures works that surpass nature. Now it is a natural property of those immaterial things which have no contrary that they last for ever, since in them there is no potentiality to non-existence, as we have shown above. Thus even as he does not deprive fire of its natural inclination to rise, so neither does he deprive the aforesaid things of their everlastingness by reducing them to nothing.

Nam quantum unicuique inest de forma, tantum inest ei de virtute essendi; unde et in I caeli et mundi philosophus vult quod quaedam habeant virtutem et potentiam ut semper sint. Et ideo aliter dicendum, quod ex infinitate temporis non ostenditur habere infinitatem nisi illud quod tempore mensuratur vel per se, sicut motus, vel per accidens, sicut esse rerum quae motui subiacent, quae aliqua periodo motus durant, ultra quam durare non possunt. Esse autem corporis caelestis nullo modo attingitur nec a tempore nec a motu, cum sit omnino invariabile. Unde ex hoc quod caelum est tempore infinito, esse eius nullam infinitatem habet, sicut omnino extra continuitatem temporis existens; propter quod a theologis dicitur mensurari aevo. Unde non requiritur in caelo aliqua virtus infinita ad hoc quod sit semper.
          <td><i>Reply to the First Objection.</i> According to the Commentator ( <i>Metaph.</i> xi, comm. 41) although all potentiality residing in a body is finite it does not follow that every body has a finite potentiality to exist: seeing that bodies that are actually corruptible have no potentiality, finite or infinite, to exist but only to be moved. This solution however apparently does not solve the difficulty. Potentiality to exist may be taken not only in the sense of a passive potentiality that is on the side of matter, but also in the sense of an active power which is on the part of the form which cannot be lacking to incorruptible things: because power of existence is proportionate to the degree in which a form is in a thing: wherefore the Philosopher ( <i>De Coelo et Mundo</i> , i) holds that certain things have the virtue and power to last for ever. Accordingly we reply otherwise as follows. From the fact that a thing lasts for an infinite time we cannot infer that it has an infinite potentiality to exist, unless it be itself measured by time either directly, as movement, or indirectly, as the existence of things that are subject to movement, and are for a certain period of time, beyond which they cannot last. Now the existence of a heavenly body is not affected by time or movement, since it is utterly unchangeable. Wherefore from the fact that the heaven lasts for an infinite time, it does not acquire infinity of existence, seeing that it is altogether outside the continuance of time: for which reason theologians say that it is measured by eviternity. Therefore the heaven does not require an infinite power in order to last for ever.

And yet even if it were in the genus of accident nothing prevents it from lasting for ever, seeing that proper accidents are of necessity in their respective substances, so that nothing hinders them from being in them for ever. On the other hand accidents that adhere to their subjects accidentally are nowise everlasting by nature: but the substantial existence of a thing cannot be an accident of this kind, because it is the act of its essence.

Primo, quia illa iustitia non haberet aliquid misericordiae admixtum, cum nihil remaneret cui posset misericordia adhiberi: dicitur autem in Psal. XXIV, 10, quod universae viae domini misericordia et veritas. Secundo, quia ista iustitia congruentius respondet culpae in duobus. In uno quidem, quia in culpa voluntas contra Deum agit, non autem natura quae ordinem sibi a Deo inditum servat; et ideo talis debet esse poena quae voluntatem affligat, naturae nocendo, qua voluntas abutitur. Si autem creatura omnino in nihilum redigeretur, esset tantum nocumentum naturae, et non afflictio voluntatis. In altero vero, quia cum in peccato duo sint, scilicet aversio ab incommutabili bono et conversio ad bonum commutabile, conversio post se aversionem trahit: nullus enim peccans intendit a Deo averti, sed quaerit frui temporali bono, cum quo simul Deo frui non potest. Unde cum poena damni aversioni culpae respondeat, conversioni vero eius poena sensus pro actuali culpa, conveniens est ut poena damni non sit sine poena sensus. Si autem in nihilum creatura redigeretur, esset quidem poena damni aeterna, sed non remaneret poena sensus.
          <td><i>Reply to the Sixth Objection.</i> Although in justice God could deprive of existence and annihilate a creature that sins against him, yet it is a more becoming justice that he keep it in existence to punish it: and this for two reasons. First, because in the former case justice would have no admixture of mercy, since nothing would remain to which he might show mercy: and yet it is written (Ps. xxiv, 10) that <i>all the ways of the Lord are mercy and truth.</i> Secondly, because in the second case justice is more in proportion with sin, and this in two respects. In the first place, when a sin is committed the will rebels against God, whereas nature does not, but observes the order assigned to it by God: so that the punishment should be such as to afflict the will by hurting the nature which the will had abused: whereas if the creature were utterly annihilated, nature would be hurt indeed, but the will would not be afflicted. In the second place, seeing that sin contains two things, aversion from the incommutable good, and conversion to transient good, aversion results from conversion, since no sinner intends to turn away from God, but seeks the enjoyment of a temporal good which is incompatible with the enjoyment of evil. Wherefore as the pain of loss corresponds to the aversion of sin, while the pain of sense corresponding to the conversion is inflicted for the actual sin, it is fitting that the pain of loss should not be without the pain of sense: whereas if the creature were annihilated there would be eternal pain of loss, but the pain of sense would cease.

It might be said that the passage quoted refers to the earth as serving man in his present state of life, wherein by sowing and reaping he gathers a harvest for the support of his animal life; but not as serving him in the state of glory, when it will last for ever for the greater enjoyment of the good.—On the contrary it is written (Jer. xxxi, 35, 36): <i>Thus says the Lord who gives the sun for the light of the day, the order of the moon and of the stars for the light of the night, who stirs up the sea and the waves thereof roar, the Lord of hosts is his name. If these ordinances shall fail before me: then also the seed of Israel shall fail so as not to be a nation</i> <i>before me for ever.</i> Now this does not refer to Israel in the flesh, seeing that by reason of their dispersion they can no longer be called a nation. Wherefore it must refer to the spiritual Israel, who will be in the truest sense a nation before the Lord, when they shall see God in his essence. Therefore in the state of beatitude the laws aforesaid which are consequent upon the movement of the heavens, will not cease, and consequently neither will the movement of the heavens.

          <td>3. According to the Philosopher ( <i>Phys.</i> ii) anything that is rendered necessary by something that is already necessary, is itself absolutely necessary; thus an animal’s death is necessary being necessitated by matter. Now the operations of incorruptible things, among which we must reckon the heavenly movement, are for the sake of the substances of those things whose operations they are, so that apparently they are rendered necessary by something that is already necessary; while the contrary obtains in corruptible things, whose substance is for the sake of their operations, so that their necessity depends on something subsequent to them, as the Commentator remarks (ibid.) therefore the heavenly movement is necessary absolutely and so it will never cease.

Now the heavens, inasmuch as they are incorruptible, are of more account than things subject to generation and corruption.

Now in this given instant in which it was stated that heaven was at rest, it was natural to the heaven to be in motion, since rest and motion apply to the same subject: and this instant belongs to the preceding time inasmuch as it is its term. Therefore heaven would be moved in that instant. Yet it was agreed that it was at rest therein. Therefore in the same instant it would be at rest and in motion, which is impossible. On the other hand if this cessation be in time, it follows that there will be time after the celestial movement. But there is no time without movement of heaven: wherefore the heavenly movement will continue after it has ceased, and this again is impossible.

Now the only thing we can seize on in time is an instant, and this is the beginning of the future and the end of the past: so that time is ever in’its beginning and end.

There is this difference, however, that elemental bodies exercise their natural movement only when they are outside their proper place, whereas the heaven is moved even while it is in its proper place. Whence we may infer that the relation of an elemental body to its natural movement when it is outside its proper place is like the relation of the heaven to its natural movement when it is in its proper place. Now an elemental body when outside its proper place does not rest unless it be forced. Therefore the heavenly body cannot rest unless it be forced. But this is inadmissible. For since nothing violent can endure for ever, it would follow that this heavenly rest does not last for ever,’and that at length the heavens would begin again to be moved, which is ridiculous. Therefore we must not say that the heavenly movement will cease at some time.

Now the second act is more excellent than the first; thus consideration is better than knowledge. Therefore the heaven’s likeness to God in respect of its second act which is to cause things in this lower world is more excellent than its likeness in respect of brightness which is its first act.

          <td>Respondeo. Dicendum quod secundum documenta sanctorum ponimus motum caeli quandoque cessaturum; quamvis hoc magis fide teneatur quam ratione demonstrari possit. Ut autem manifestum esse possit in quo huius quaestionis pendeat difficultas, attendendum est quod motus caeli non hoc modo est naturalis caelesti corpori sicut motus elementaris corporis est sibi naturalis; habet enim huiusmodi motus in mobili principium, non solum materiale et receptivum, sed etiam formale et activum. Formam enim ipsius elementaris corporis sequitur talis motus, sicut et aliae naturales proprietates ex essentialibus principiis consequuntur; unde in eis generans dicitur esse movens in quantum dat formam quam consequitur motus. Sic autem in corpore caelesti dici non potest. Cum enim natura semper in unum tendat determinate, non se habens ad multa, impossibile est quod aliqua natura inclinet ad motum secundum se ipsum, eo quod in quolibet motu difformitas quaedam est, in quantum non eodem modo se habet quod movetur; uniformitas vero mobilis est contra motus rationem. Unde natura nunquam inclinat ad motum propter movere, sed propter aliquid determinatum quod ex motu consequitur; sicut natura gravis inclinat ad quietem in medio, et per consequens inclinat ad motum qui est deorsum, secundum quod tali motu in talem locum pervenitur. Caelum autem non pervenit suo motu in aliquod ubi, ad quod per suam naturam inclinetur, quia quodlibet ubi est principium et finis motus; unde non potest esse suus motus naturalis quasi sequens aliquam inclinationem naturalis virtutis inhaerentis, sicut sursum ferri est motus naturalis ignis. Dicitur autem motus circularis esse naturalis caelo, in quantum in sua natura habet aptitudinem ad talem motum; et sic in seipso habet principium talis motus passivum; activum autem principium motus est aliqua substantia separata, ut Deus vel intelligentia vel anima, ut quidam ponunt; quantum enim ad praesentem quaestionem nihil differt. Ratio ergo permanentiae motus non potest sumi ex natura aliqua caelestis corporis, ex qua tantum est aptitudo ad motum; sed oportet eam sumere ex principio activo separato. Et quia agens omne propter finem agit, oportet considerare quis est finis motus caeli; si namque fini eius congruat quod motus aliquando terminetur, caelum quandoque quiescet; si autem fini eius non competat quies, motus eius erit sempiternus; non enim potest esse quod motus deficiat ex mutatione causae moventis, cum voluntas Dei sit immutabilis sicut etiam natura; et per eam immobilitatem consequantur, si quae sunt causae mediae moventes.
          <td>I answer that following the teaching of holy men we hold that at some time the celestial movement will cease, although this be a matter of faith rather than of demonstration by reason. In order to make clear wherein this question offers difficulty, it must be observed that the heavenly movement, is not natural to the heavenly body in the same way as the elemental body’s movement is natural to the elemental body. The latter movement has in the thing movable its principle not only material and receptive but also formal and active: because the form of the elemental body follows that movement, even as other natural properties result from essential principles: wherefore in these things the generator is said to be the mover inasmuch as it gives the form that results from the movement. But this does not apply to a heavenly body. Because as nature ever tends to one definite effect through not being indifferent to many, it is impossible that any nature tend to movement as such, since, in every movement there is a certain absence of uniformity, inasmuch as the thing moved passes from one mode of being to another, and uniformity in the thing moved is contrary to the definition of movement. In consequence nature never inclines to movement for the sake of movement, but for the sake of some definite result to be obtained by movement: thus a heavy body is inclined by nature to rest in the centre, wherefore it, tends to a downward motion, for the reason that by such a movement it will reach that place. On the other hand the heaven by its movement does not reach a ‘whereabouts’ to which it is inclined by nature, because every ‘whereabouts’ is the beginning and end of a movement: so that its natural movement cannot result, so to say, from a tendency of a natural inherent power, in the same way as the natural movement of fire has an upward tendency. Now circular movement is said to be natural to the heaven, in so far as it has a natural aptitude for that kind of movement, so that it contains in itself the passive principle of that movement, while the active principle of this movement is some separate substance, such as God, or an intelligence, or a soul according to some; as to which of these it may be it matters not to the question at issue. Accordingly no argument for the permanence of this movement can be taken from the nature of a heavenly body wherein there is only aptitude for movement: and we seek one from a separate active principle. And seeing that every agent acts for an end, we must consider what is the end of the heaven’s movement: because if this end be such as to require that this movement should cease at some time, then the heavens will at length cease to be moved; while if rest is inconsistent with that end, then its movement will last for ever: for it cannot be said that it will cease through a change in its moving cause, since God’s will like his nature is unchangeable, and through it whatever intermediate causes produce the heavenly movement may have become unchangeable likewise.

          <td>In hac autem consideratione tria oportet vitare: quorum primum est, ne dicamus caelum moveri propter ipsum motum; sicut dicebatur caelum esse propter ipsum esse, in quo Deo assimilatur. Motus enim, ex ipsa sui ratione, repugnat ne possit poni finis, eo quod motus est in aliud tendens; unde non habet rationem finis, sed magis eius quod est ad finem. Cui etiam attestatur quod est actus imperfectus, ut dicitur in III de anima. Finis autem est ultima perfectio. Secundum est, ut non ponatur motus caeli esse propter aliquid vilius; nam cum finis sit unde ratio sumitur, oportet finem praeeminere his quae sunt ad finem. Potest autem contingere quod vilior sit terminus operationis rei nobilioris; non autem ut sit finis intentionis: sicut securitas rustici est terminus quidam, ad quem operatio regis gubernantis terminatur; non tamen regimen regis est ordinatum ad huius rustici securitatem sicut in finem sed in aliquid melius, scilicet in bonum commune. Unde non potest dici, quod generatio istorum inferiorum sit finis motus caeli, etsi sit effectus vel terminus, quia et caelum his inferioribus praeeminet, et motus eius motibus et mutationibus horum. Tertium est, ut non ponatur finis motus caeli aliquid infinitum, quia, ut dicitur in II Metaphys., qui ponit infinitum in causa finali destruit finem et naturam boni. Pertingere enim quod infinitum est, impossibile est. Nihil autem movetur ad id quod impossibile est ipsum consequi, ut dicitur in I caeli et mundi. Unde non potest dici, quod finis motus caeli sit ut consequatur in actu ubi ad quod est in potentia, licet hoc Avicenna dicere videatur. Hoc enim impossibile est consequi, cum infinitum sit; quia dum in uno ubi fit in actu, erit in potentia ad aliud ubi, in quo prius actu existebat.
          <td>Now in making this observation three things must be avoided. In the first place we must not say that the heaven is moved for the sake of being moved: as we have said that it exists for the sake of existing, wherein it is like God. The reason is that movement by its very nature cannot be regarded in the light of an end, since it is a tendency to something else: so that it answers to the definition of means rather than of an end. This is confirmed by the fact that movement is the act of that which is imperfect ( <i>De Anima</i> iii, 7; <i>Phys.</i> iii): while the end is the ultimate perfection.—Secondly, we must not say that the heavenly movement is for the sake of something less excellent than the heavens: because since the end specifies the means it ought to be more worthy than the means. Now the action of a more noble agent may happen to terminate in a less noble effect, but not as the end intended by that action: thus the safety of a peasant is an end secured by the king’s government, yet the king’s government does not seek that peasant’s safety as its end, for it seeks something better, namely the common good. Consequently it cannot be admitted that the generation of beings in this lower world is the end of the heavenly movement, although it is its effect and term: since both heaven itself is more excellent than this lower world, and its movement than the movements and changes that take place here below.—Thirdly, we must not suppose the end of the heaven’s movement to be something indefinite, since to take the indefinite as a final cause is to destroy the end and the very nature of good ( <i>Metaph.</i> ii). Because it is impossible to reach the indefinite; and nothing is moved to that which it cannot obtain ( <i>De Coelo et Mundo</i> , i). Wherefore it cannot be said that the end of the celestial movement is to attain to that for which it has no potentiality: although Avicenna would seem to say so. But this it cannot possibly obtain: since while it is actually in one position it is in its previous position potentially.

Uno modo ut ponatur finis motus caeli aliquid in ipso caelo, quod simul cum motu existit; et secundum hoc a quibusdam philosophis ponitur, quod similitudo ad Deum in causando est finis motus caeli; quod quidem fit ipso motu durante; unde secundum hoc non convenit quod motus caeli deficiat, quia deficiente motu, finis ex motu proveniens cessaret. Alio modo potest poni finis motus caeli aliquid extra caelum, ad quod pervenitur per motum caeli; quo cessante illud potest remanere: et haec est nostra positio. Ponimus enim quod motus caeli est propter implendum numerum electorum. Anima namque rationalis quolibet corpore nobilior est, et ipso caelo. Unde nullum est inconveniens, si ponatur finis motus caeli multiplicatio rationalium animarum: non autem in infinitum, quia hoc per motum caeli provenire non posset; et sic moveretur ad aliquid quod consequi non potest; unde relinquitur quod determinata multitudo animarum rationalium sit finis motus caeli. Unde ea habita motus caeli cessabit.
          <td>This admits of a twofold solution. The first is that we assign as the end of the heavenly movement something in the heavens themselves and coexistent with movement. With this in view some philosophers held that the end of the heavenly movement is its likeness to God in causing, which takes place during the movement. In this view it is not becoming for this movement to cease, since were it to cease the end resulting from the movement would cease also. The second solution is that we assign as the end of the heavenly movement something outside heaven that is obtained by that movement, and which can remain when that movement ceases: and this is the view that we adopt. We hold then that the movement of the heavens is for the completion of the number of the elect. For the rational soul is more excellent than any body whatsoever, even than the heavens: wherefore there is nothing unreasonable in supposing that the end of the heavenly movement is the multiplication of rational souls; not indeed indefinitely, since this could not result from the movement of the heavens; and it could in that case be moved to something that it could not obtain. Therefore it is a definite number of souls that is the end of the heavenly movement: and when this is reached the movement will cease.

          <td>Licet autem utraque positionum praedictarum possit rationabiliter sustineri, tamen secunda, quae fidei est, videtur esse probabilior propter tres rationes. Primo quidem, quia nihil differt dicere finem alicuius esse assimilationem ad Deum secundum aliquid, et illud secundum quod assimilatio attenditur; sicut supra dictum est, quod finis rerum posset dici vel ipsa assimilatio divinae bonitatis, vel esse rerum, secundum quod res Deo assimilantur. Idem ergo est dictu, finem motus caeli esse assimilari Deo in causando et causare. Causare autem non potest esse finis, cum sit operatio habens operatum et tendens in aliud: huiusmodi enim operationibus meliora sunt operata, ut dicitur in principio Ethic.; unde huiusmodi factiones non possunt esse fines agentium, cum non sint perfectiones facientium, sed magis factorum; unde et ipsa facta sunt magis fines, ut patet IX Metaph., et in I Ethic. Ipsa autem operata non sunt fines, cum sint viliora caelo, ut supra dictum est. Unde relinquitur non convenienter dici, quod finis motus caeli sit assimilari ad Deum in causando. Secundo vero, quia cum caelum moveatur in ipso existente sola aptitudine ad motum, principio vero activo existente extra, ut dictum est; movetur et agit sicut instrumentum haec est enim dispositio instrumenti, ut patet in artificialibus, nam in securi est sola aptitudo ad talem motum; principium autem motus in artifice est. Unde et secundum philosophos, quod movet motum, movet ut instrumentum. In actione autem quae est per instrumentum, non potest esse finis aliquis in ipso instrumento nisi per accidens, in quantum instrumentum accipitur ut artificiatum et non ut instrumentum; unde non est probabile quod finis motus caeli sit aliqua perfectio ipsius, sed magis aliquid extra ipsum. Tertio, quia si similitudo ad Deum in causando est finis motus caeli, praecipue attenditur haec similitudo secundum causalitatem eius quod a Deo immediate causatur, scilicet animae rationalis, ad cuius causalitatem concurrit caelum et per motum suum materiam disponendo. Et ideo probabilius est quod finis motus caeli sit numerus electorum quam assimilatio ad Deum in causalitate generationis et corruptionis, secundum quod philosophi ponunt. Et ideo concedimus quod motus caeli completo numero electorum finietur.
          <td>Now though either of these views can be upheld, the second, which is of faith, seems the more probable, and this for three reasons. First because it differs not whether we say that a certain thing’s end is its likeness to God in some particular respect, or the thing itself with this likeness: just as we have said above that the end of things may be said to be either their being made like to God’s goodness, or their nature as likened to God. Wherefore to say that the end of things is to be like God in causing is the same as to say that their end is to cause. Now to cause cannot be an end since it is an operation which implies an effect and tends to something else. Moreover in operations of this kind the effect is better than the operation ( <i>Ethic.</i> i, i), so that suchlike operations cannot be the end of the operator, for they do not perfect the maker but the thing made: and thus the thing made is more correctly the end ( <i>Metaph.</i> ix: <i>Ethic.</i> i, i). Now the things that are produced by the heavenly movement cannot be the end of that movement since they are less excellent than the heavens, as stated above. Wherefore it is unreasonable to hold that the end of the heavenly movement is likeness to God in causing. Secondly, since the heavenly movement is produced by an external active principle, while the heavens themselves have merely the natural aptitude for that movement, as stated above, it follows that the heavens are moved and act as an instrument: for such is the disposition of an instrument, as may be seen in the productions of art: thus the axe has nothing more than the aptitude for its particular movement, while the principle of this movement is in the craftsman. Hence as philosophers say, that which moves through being itself moved, moves as an instrument. Now in the instrumental action there cannot be an end in the instrument save accidentally in so far as the instrument is considered as a thing made and not as an instrument. Consequently it is not probable that the end of the heavenly movement is a perfection of the heavens: rather is it something outside the heavens.—Thirdly, if likeness to God in causing is the end of the heavenly movement, this likeness will be found chiefly in the production of that which is produced by God immediately, to wit the rational soul: to the production of which the heavenly movement conduces by disposing the matter. So that it is more probable that the end of the heavenly movement is the number of the elect than a likeness to God in causing generation and corruption as the philosophers say. For this reason we grant that the heavens will cease to be in motion when the number of the elect is complete.

Accordingly the celestial movement, if we refer it to that which is in motion, is not necessitated thereby as by its efficient cause, as we have proved, but it is necessitated by its mover: which being a voluntary mover necessitates the movement according as it is determined by the order of divine wisdom, and not so that it last for ever.

          <td><i>Reply to the Sixth Objection.</i> According to the teaching of faith the completion of the number of the elect is not the secondary but the principal end of the heaven’s movement. It is not, however, its ultimate end because the ultimate end of everything is the divine goodness, inasmuch as creatures in some way attain thereto either by likeness or by rendering the service they owe God.

          <td>Ad septimum dicendum, quod res non dicitur esse imperfecta, quacumque potentia in ipsa non reducta ad actum, sed solum quando per reductionem in actum res suum consequitur complementum. Non enim homo qui est in potentia ut sit in India, imperfectus erit, si ibi non fuerit; sed imperfectus dicitur, si scientia vel virtute careat, qua natus est perfici. Caelum autem non perficitur per locum, sicut corpora inferiora, quae in proprio ubi conservantur. Unde licet potentia qua potest esse in aliquo ubi, nunquam reducatur ad actum, non tamen sequitur quod sit imperfectum. Nam si secundum se consideretur, non maior est sibi perfectio quod sit in uno situ quam in alio, sed indifferenter se habet ad omnia ubi, cum ad quodlibet moveatur naturaliter. Ipsa autem indifferentia magis inducit ad quietem quam ad perpetuitatem motus, nisi consideretur voluntas moventis et intendentis finem; sicut etiam quidam philosophi assignaverunt causam quietis terrae in medio, propter indifferentiam eius, respectu cuiuslibet partis circumferentiae caeli.
          <td><i>Reply to the Seventh Objection.</i> It is not true that a thing is to be described as imperfect by reason of any potentiality therein that has not been given actuality: this is true only when actuality makes the thing complete. A man is not imperfect because being potentially in India he is not actually there: but he will be imperfect if he lack knowledge or virtue which are his natural perfections. Now heaven is not perfected by its position as these lower bodies which are preserved by occupying their proper positions. Wherefore although its potentiality to be in this or that position be never given actuality, it does not follow that it is imperfect. In fact if we consider heaven in itself it does not acquire greater perfection by being in one position than by being in another: it is indifferent to all positions, since it is moved naturally to any one. Now this indifference conduces to rest rather than to perpetual movement, unless we take into account the will of Him who moves it and intends its end. Thus certain philosophers explained the earth’s rest in the centre by assigning as its cause the equidistance of the centre to each part of the heaven’s circumference.

Unde etiam secundum Commentatorem, sempiternitas essendi in caelo est ex principiis suae naturae, non autem sempiternitas motus, sed ab extrinseco. Unde etiam secundum eos qui dicunt motum nunquam deficere, causa durationis motus caeli et eius sempiternitatis, est voluntas divina; quamvis eius immobilitas non de necessitate concludere possit sempiternitatem motus caeli, ut ipsi volunt. Non enim est mobilis voluntas, si velit quod diversa sibi invicem succedant secundum quod exigit finis quem immobiliter vult. Et ideo potius est inquirenda ratio sempiternitatis motus ex fine quam ex immobilitate moventis.
          <td><i>Reply to the Ninth Objection.</i> The heaven’s capacity of perpetual movement is not to be confused with its capacity of existing for ever. Its existence depends on its natural principles, from which it acquires the necessity of existing, in that they exclude the possibility of non-existence, as we have shown above: whereas its nature does not include perpetual movement but only an aptitude thereto, and the necessity of that movement being perpetual depends on its mover. Hence also according to the Commentator ( <i>Metaph.</i> ii: <i>De Subst. Orb.</i> ) the, heaven has everlasting movement which it receives from an intrinsic principle. Wherefore even those who hold that this movement will never cease, say that the cause of its duration and everlastingness is God’s will. And yet the unchangeableness of God’s will does not, as they contend, necessarily prove the everlastingness of the celestial movement: because his win is not shown to be changeable if he wish different things to succeed one another according to the exigency of the end which he wills unchangeably. We must, therefore, Seek the reason for an everlasting movement in the end rather than in the unchangeableness of the mover.

          <td><i>Reply to the Tenth Objection.</i> The heavenly movement will end in an instant: and in that instant there will be neither movement nor rest, but the end of movement and the beginning of rest. The subsequent rest will not be in time, because rest is measured by time not directly, but indirectly ( <i>Phys.</i> iv): so that the rest of a body not subject to any kind of movement is in no way measured by time. Yet, not to draw the line too fine, one might say that after movement there will be not rest but a certain immobility in the heavens.

The last instant of all time will indeed be the end of the past, but not the beginning of the future: because that an instant be at once both the end of the past and the beginning of the future obtains in a continuous circular movement in which every point is both beginning and end in respect of different parts.

          <td><i>Reply to the Thirteenth Objection.</i> If the celestial movement were not for the sake of something else, we should expect to find some kind of proportion between that movement, and the subsequent rest, in the supposition that the movement is not everlasting. But whereas it is ordinated to another end, this proportion must be referred to the end and not to the subsequent rest. Accordingly we are to understand that God in bringing all creatures into being out of nothing, himself instituted the first perfection of the universe, consisting in the principal parts thereof, and the various species of things: and that in order to give it its final perfection, consisting in the completion of the ranks of the blessed, he ordained the various movements and operations of creatures, some of which are natural, for instance, the movement of the heavens and the activities of the elements, whereby matter is prepared to receive rational souls, while others are voluntary such as the ministrations of the angels who are <i>sent to minister for them who shall receive the inheritance of salvation.</i> Wherefore when this consummation has been attained to remain for ever without change, those things that were ordained thereto will cease for ever.

And Augustine says ( <i>Ep. ad Oros.</i> ) that each one will appear at the judgement as he was in death: so that there is the same reason fox concealing the day of one’s death as for hiding the day of judgement.

Ergo non potest sciri quocumque numero annorum dato, vel decem millium, vel viginti millium, vel duorum, vel trium, utrum infra illud tempus finis mundi futurus sit.
          <td>Again, Augustine says ( <i>Ad Hesych. ep.</i> cxcix): “Can we, I ask you, define the time of his coming, in such a way that at least we can say that he will come within, for instance, the next hundred years, or within any number of years greater or less?” But we are entirely ignorant about this. Therefore we cannot know whether the end of the world will be within any given number of years, whether ten thousand or twenty thousand, or two or three.

          <td>Respondeo. Dicendum, quod tempus determinatum finis mundi omnino nescitur, nisi a solo Deo et ab homine Christo. Cuius ratio est, quia duplex est modus quo possumus praescire futura: scilicet, per cognitionem naturalem, et per revelationem. Naturali quidem cognitione aliqua futura praenoscimus per causas quas praesentes videmus, ex quibus futuros expectamus effectus: vel per certitudinem scientiae, si sint causae quas de necessitate sequitur effectus, vel per coniecturam, si sint causae ad quas sequitur effectus ut in pluribus, sicut astrologus praescit eclypsim futuram, et medicus mortem futuram. Hoc autem modo non potest praecognosci tempus determinate finis mundi, quia causa motus caeli et cessationis eius non est alia quam divina voluntas, ut prius ostensum est; quam quidem causam naturaliter cognoscere non possumus. Alia vero quorum causa est motus caeli vel quaecumque alia causa sensibilis, possunt naturali cognitione praecognosci, sicut particularis destructio alicuius partis terrae, quae prius fuit habitabilis, et postea fit inhabitabilis. Per revelationem vero licet sciri possit, si Deus vellet revelare, non tamen congruum esset quod revelaretur nisi homini Christo. Et hoc propter tres rationes. Primo quidem, quia finis mundi non erit nisi completo numero electorum; cuius completio est quasi quaedam executio totius divinae praedestinationis; unde non competit revelationem fieri de fine mundi nisi ei cui fit revelatio de tota praedestinatione divina, scilicet homini Christo, per quem tota divina praedestinatio humani generis quodammodo adimpletur. Unde dicitur Ioan. V, 20: pater diligit filium, et omnia demonstrat ei quae ipse facit. Secundo, quia per hoc quod ignoratur quamdiu iste status mundi durare debeat, utrum ad modicum vel ad magnum tempus, habentur res huius mundi quasi statim transiturae; unde dicitur I Cor. VII, 31: qui utuntur hoc mundo, sint tamquam non utantur; praeterit enim figura huius mundi. Tertio, ut homines semper sint parati ad Dei iudicium expectandum, dum omnino determinatum tempus nescitur; unde dicitur Matth. XXIV, 42: vigilate, quia nescitis qua hora dominus vester venturus sit. Et ideo, ut dicit Augustinus, ille qui dicit se ignorare quando dominus sit venturus, utrum ad breve tempus vel ad magnum evangelicae sententiae concordat. Inter duos autem qui scire se dicunt, periculosius errat qui dicit in proxime Christum venturum, vel finem mundi instare, quia haec potest esse occasio ut omnino desperaretur esse futurum, si tunc non erit quando futurum esse praedicitur.
          <td>I answer that the exact time of the end of the world is utterly unknown, except to God and to Christ as man, The reason of this is that there are two ways in which we can know the future, by natural knowledge and by revelation. By natural knowledge we foresee certain future events in their causes which we see present, and from which we look forward to their effects—either with the certainty of science if the causes be such as to produce their effects of necessity, or by conjecture, if the causes be such as to produce their effects in the majority of cases, as an astronomer foresees a future eclipse, and a physician future death. In this way it is impossible to foreknow the exact time of the end of the world, because the cause of the heaven’s movement and its cessation is no other but the will of God, as we have shown; and we cannot by our natural powers know that cause. Other results of the heaven’s movement or of any other sensible cause can be foreknown by natural knowledge, such as the destruction of some particular part of the earth, which was hitherto inhabitable and afterwards becomes uninhabitable. By revelation however, though it be possible for it to be known if such were God’s will, it is not becoming that it should be revealed except to Christ as man: and this for three reasons. First, because the world will not come to an end until the number of the elect is complete, which completion is as it were the fulfilment of the whole of divine predestination; wherefore it is not fitting that the end of the world should be revealed except to him who has received the revelation of the whole of divine predestination, that is to Christ as man, through whom the whole predestination of the human race is in a manner fulfilled. Wherefore it is said (Jo. v, 20) <i>: The Father loves the Son and shows him all things which himself</i> doth.—Secondly, because through our not knowing how long the present state of the world will last, whether for a short or for a long time, we look upon the things of this world as though they were soon to pass away: wherefore it is said (1 Cor. vii, 3 1) <i>They that use this world</i> (let them be) <i>as if they used it not, for the fashion of this world passes away</i> .—Thirdly that men may ever be prompt to look forward to God’s judgement, through being in utter ignorance of its exact time, wherefore it is written (Mt. xxiv, 42): Watch ... because you <i>know not what hour your Lord will come.</i> Hence, as Augustine says ( <i>Ad Hesych. ep.</i> cxcix) <i>he who says</i> that <i>he knows</i> not <i>when the Lord will come whether after a short or after a long time is in agreement with the words of the Gospel. And of two who say that they know, his is the more dangerous statement who says that Christ will come soon or that the end of the world is at hand,</i> since this might occasion men to disbelieve in the end of the world if it fails to happen when it was foretold.

          <td><i>Reply to the First Objection.</i> As Augustine says (QQ. lxxxiii, qu. 57)) the last age of the world corresponds to the last stage in a man’s life, which does not last for a fixed number of years as the other stages do, but lasts sometimes as long as all the others together, and even longer.

          <td><i>Reply to the Third Objection.</i> Man is naturally solicitous not only for himself but also for the good estate of the community whereof he is a part, for instance, of the household, or city or even of the whole world.

Now essential principles cause the proper accidents. Since then the active and passive qualities are the proper accidents of the elements, it would seem, as long as the essential principles remain, without which the substance cannot exist, that the active qualities must also remain.

But, it will be said, this will be done by the power of God, so that the elements will remain without their active and passive qualities, though is impossible naturally.—On the contrary, as nature was established at the beginning of the world, so will it be consummated at the end of the world. Now, in speaking of the beginning of the world, according to Augustine ( <i>Gen. ad lit.</i> ii) we must consider not what God can do but what nature requires. Therefore this is also to be considered in discussing the end of the world.

And a gloss of Bede on the text of Peter quoted above says that the fire which will be kindled at the end of the world <i>will entirely engulf two of the elements, and will restore the others to a better fashion.</i> Therefore the destruction of the elements cannot refer to their active and passive qualities, since in that case it would not be said that only two elements would be consumed.

On the contrary at the end of the world the elements will be bettered, according to Augustine ( <i>Gen. ad lit.</i> xii, 16). Now the agent is more noble than the patient. Therefore those elements should remain in which active qualities are prominent, rather than those which betray passive qualities.

          <td>7. Augustine ( <i>Super Gen.</i> iii, 10) says that water and earth are passive, while fire and air are active. Therefore if certain elements are to be absorbed on account of their active power, it would seem that these should be fire and air rather than earth and water.

Elementa autem mutabuntur de mutabilitate in immutabilitatem, ut patet per Glossam quae super illud Matth. cap. V, 18: donec transeat caelum et terra, etc., dicit: donec transeat a mutabilitate ad immutabilitatem. Ergo ista natura elementorum non remanebit.

If then a thing be transformed from mutability to immutability, it would seem that it no longer remains in its natural genus. Now the elements will be changed from mutability to immutability because the (interlinear) gloss on Matthew v, 18, <i>Till heaven and earth pass</i> , says: “Till they pass from mutability to immutability.” Therefore the elements will not retain their present nature.

Now that which is unnatural and violent cannot last for ever, according to the Philosopher ( <i>De Coelo el Mundo</i> , ii: iii). Consequently this latter disposition cannot remain for ever in the elements, and they would return to the former, which would seem inadmissible. Therefore the elements in their substance will cease to exist, and not only their disposition, their substance remaining.

XXI, vers. 1: vidi caelum novum et terram novam, sub caeli nomine tribus comprehensis, scilicet igne, aere et aqua. Sed ista positio est impossibilis. Elementa enim non sunt in potentia ad formam caeli, eo quod forma caeli contrarium non habet, et sub forma caeli sit tota materia quae est in potentia ad ipsam. Sic enim caelum esset generabile et corruptibile; quod philosophus ostendit esse falsum. Ratio etiam, qua hoc asseritur, frivola est: quia in Scriptura, sicut Basilius in Hexameron dicit, per extrema, media intelliguntur, ut Genes. I, 1, cum dicitur: in principio creavit Deus caelum et terram. Nam per creationem caeli et terrae etiam elementa media intelliguntur. Quandoque etiam sub terrae nomine omnia inferiora comprehenduntur, ut patet in Psalm. CXLVIII, 7: laudate dominum de terra; et postea subditur: ignis, grando, et cetera. Unde nihil prohibet dicere, quod per innovationem caeli et terrae Scriptura innovationem etiam mediorum elementorum intellexit, vel quod sub nomine terrae omnia elementa comprehendat.
          <td>Some have maintained that all the elements will remain as regards their matter, but that some will receive a higher form, namely water and fire, which will receive the form of the heavens. Thus it will be possible to give the name of heaven to three of the elements, namely to air (which by reason of its nature is sometimes called the heaven in Scripture) and to water and fire which will assume the form of the heavens. Hereby would be verified the words of Apocalypse xxi, i, <i>I saw a new heaven and a new earth,</i> because <i>heaven</i> would include the three elements, fire, air and water. However this view is impossible: because the elements are not in potentiality to receive the form of the heaven, inasmuch as the latter has no contrary, and all the matter that has a potentiality for the heavens’ form underlies that form. Moreover it would follow that the heavens could be generated and corrupted: which the Philosopher proves to be false ( <i>De Coelo et Mundo</i> , i). Again the argument in support of this view is frivolous: because as Basil says ( <i>Hom. in Hexaem.</i> ) “Scripture in mentioning the extremes includes those that come between.” Thus when we read (Gen. i, i) that <i>In the beginning God created heaven and earth,</i> the creation of heaven and earth includes the intermediate elements. Moreover sometimes all the lower things are comprised in the word <i>earth.</i> Thus in Psalm cxlvii, 7, the words <i>Praise the Lord from the earth</i> are succeeded by these, <i>Fire, hail,</i> etc. Hence there is no reason why we should not say that by the renewal of heaven and earth Scripture intended also the renewal of the intermediate elements, or that <i>earth</i> includes all the elements.

          <td>Et ideo alii dicunt, quod omnia elementa manebunt secundum substantiam non solum quantum ad materiam, sed etiam quantum ad formas substantiales. Sicut enim, secundum opinionem Avicennae, remanent formae substantiales elementorum in mixto, qualitatibus activis et passivis non remanentibus in suis excellentiis, sed ad medium redactis, ita possibile erit quod in ultimo statu mundi absque praedictis qualitatibus remaneant elementa; cui videtur consonare quod Augustinus dicit: in illa conflagratione mundana, elementorum corruptibilium qualitates, quae corporibus nostris congruebant, ardendo penitus interibunt, atque ipsa substantia eas qualitates habebit quae corporibus immortalibus mirabili mutatione convenient. Sed hoc non videtur rationabiliter dictum. Primo quidem, quia cum qualitates activae et passivae sint per se elementorum accidentia, oportet quod a principiis essentialibus causentur; unde non potest esse quod principiis essentialibus manentibus in elementis praedictis, qualitates deficiant, nisi per violentiam; quod non potest esse diuturnum. Et ideo nec opinio Avicennae videtur esse probabilis, quod formae elementorum actu maneant in mixto; sed solum virtute, ut philosophus dicit; quia oporteret quod diversorum elementorum formae, in diversis partibus materiae conservarentur; quod non esset, nisi essent etiam situ distinctae; et sic non esset vera commixtio, sed solum secundum sensum; et tamen in mixto impediuntur qualitates unius elementi per qualitates alterius; quod non potest dici in mundi consummatione ubi omnino cessabit violentia. Secundo autem, quia cum qualitates activae et passivae sint de integritate naturae elementorum, sequeretur quod elementa imperfecta remanerent; unde auctoritas Augustini inducta non loquitur de qualitatibus activis et passivis, sed de dispositionibus eorum quae generantur et corrumpuntur et alterantur.
          <td>Wherefore others hold that all the elements will remain as to their substance, not only in respect of their matter but also as regards their substantial forms. For just as, in the opinion of Avicenna, the elemental forms remain in a mixed body, while their active and passive qualities remain not in full force but reduced to a mean; so will it be possible in the last state of the world for these elements to remain without these qualities. This would seem in agreement with what Augustine says ( <i>De Civit. Dei</i> xvi): In this world-conflagration the qualities of the corruptible elements that were suitable to our bodies will be entirely destroyed by fire, and the elemental substance wig have those qualities which by a wondrous change will be suitable to immortal bodies. But this does not seem a reasonable view. First because, since the active and passive qualities are proper accidents of the elements, they must needs be caused by the essential principles of the latter, so that as long as the essential principles remain, it is impossible for these qualities to cease, save by violence, in which case they would not cease for long. Wherefore neither does the opinion of Avicenna seem probable, when he asserts that the elements retain their forms actually in a mixed body although they do retain them but only virtually as the Philosopher says: since it would follow that the various elemental forms remain in the various parts of matter. Now this would not happen unless they were also distinct as to position, so that the mixture would not be real but only apparent. Moreover in a mixed body the qualities of one element counteract the qualities of another: and this cannot apply to the final consummation of the world, when all violence win cease.—Secondly because, since the active and passive qualities belong to the integrity of the elements’ nature, it would follow that the elements will remain in a state of imperfection. Hence Augustine in the passage quoted refers not to the active and passive qualities, but to the dispositions of things subject to generation, corruption and alteration.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et ideo videtur dicendum, quod elementa in sua substantia remanebunt, et etiam in suis qualitatibus naturalibus; sed mutuae generationes et corruptiones et alterationes cessabunt; per huiusmodi enim elementa ordinantur ad completionem numeri electorum, sicut et caelum per motum suum; sed substantiae elementorum manebunt, sicut et substantia caeli. Cum enim universum in perpetuum remaneat, ut supra ostensum est, oportet quod ea quae sunt de perfectione universi, primo et per se remaneant. Hoc autem competit elementis, cum sint essentiales partes universi ipsius, ut philosophus probat. Si enim est corpus circulare, oportet esse centrum ipsius, quod est terra. Posita autem terra, quae est simpliciter gravis, utpote in medio constituta, oportet ponere contrarium eius, scilicet ignem, qui sit simpliciter levis; quia si unum contrariorum est in una natura, et reliquum. Suppositis autem extremis, necesse est poni et media; unde oportet ponere aerem et aquam, quae sunt ad ignem quidem levia, ad terram autem gravia, quorum unum est propinquius terrae. Unde ex ipso situ universi patet quod elementa sunt essentiales partes universi. Quod patet esse manifestum, ordine causarum et effectuum considerato. Nam sicut caelum est universale activum eorum quae generantur, ita elementa sunt eorumdem universalis materia. Unde ad perfectionem universi requiritur quod elementa secundum suam substantiam maneant; et ad hoc etiam habent ex sui natura aptitudinem. Corruptio autem aliter accidit in corporibus mixtis et elementis; in corporibus enim mixtis inest corruptionis activum principium, propter hoc quod sunt ex contrariis composita; in elementis vero, quae contrarium exterius habent, ipsa autem non sunt ex contrariis composita, non inest principium corruptionis activum, sed passivum tantum, in quantum habent materiam cui inest aptitudo ad aliam formam qua privantur. Et ab hoc principio generatio et corruptio in elementis sunt motus vel mutationes naturales; et non propter principium activum ut dicit Commentator. Sicut ergo quia corpus caeleste principium sui motus activum habet extra, potest esse quod eius motus cesset ipso manente, absque violentia, ut supra dictum est; ita potest esse ut corruptio elementorum cesset eorum substantiis manentibus, exteriori corruptivo cessante, quod oportet reducere in motum caeli sicut in primum generationis et corruptionis principium.
          <td>Seemingly then the question is best solved by saying that the elements will remain in their substance with their natural qualities, but that generation, corruption and alteration. resulting from their action on one another will cease, because it is by means of these that the elements are ordinated to the completion of the number of the elect, even as the heaven by means of its movement. The substance, however, of the elements will remain even as the substance of heaven. The reason is that since the universe win remain for ever, as we have proved already, it follows that whatsoever belongs to the perfection of the universe must remain as to its substance. Now this applies to the elements inasmuch as they are essential parts of the universe, as the Philosopher proves ( <i>De Coelo et Mundo</i> , ii). For if the universe is a circular body it must have a centre, and this is the earth: and given the earth which is heavy absolutely as occupying the centre, there must be its contrary namely fire which is light absolutely: because if one contrary exists in nature, the other must exist also. Now given the extremes, we must posit the middle: wherefore we must posit air and water, which are heavy in comparison with, fire, and light in comparison with earth: one of which is nearer to the earth than the other. Hence from the very conformation of the universe it is evident that the elements are essential parts thereof.—This is also made clear if we consider the order of causes to their effects. Thus even as heaven it the universal active cause of things that are generated, so the elements are their universal matter. Hence the perfection of the universe requires that the elements remain in their substance. Moreover by their very nature they have an aptitude to remain thus. The reason is that corruption occurs in mixed bodies otherwise than in the elements. Mixed bodies contain within themselves the active Principle of corruption, through being composed of contraries: whereas the elements have an outside contrary but are not composed of contraries, wherefore they do not contain an active principle of corruption, but only a passive principle, inasmuch as their matter has an aptitude to receive another form than that which they actually have. It is due to this principle that generation and corruption in the elements are natural movements or changes, and not to any active principle as the Commentator says ( <i>Phys.</i> ii). Accordingly even as it is possible for the movement of a heavenly body to cease without suffering violence, while the body itself remains, because the active principle of its movement is external to it, as stated above; so too is it possible that the elements cease to be corrupted and remain in their substance, when the external cause of their corruption ceases, which cause must be reduced to the heavenly movement which is the first principle of generation and corruption.

          <td>Respondeo. Dicendum quod, sicut habetur in libro de causis, quando causa prima retrahit actionem suam a causato, oportet etiam quod causa secunda retrahat actionem suam ab eodem, eo quod causa secunda habet hoc ipsum quod agit, per actionem causae primae, in cuius virtute agit. Cum autem omne agens agat secundum quod est in actu, oportet secundum hoc accipere ordinem causarum agentium, secundum quod est ordo earum in actualitate. Corpora autem inferiora minus habent de actualitate quam corpora caelestia, nam in corporibus inferioribus non est tota potentialitas completa per actum, eo quod materia substans uni formae remanet in potentia ad formam aliam; quod non est in corporibus caelestibus, nam materia corporis caelestis non est in potentia ad aliam formam; unde sua potentialitas tota est terminata per formam quam habet. Substantiae vero separatae sunt perfectiores in actualitate quam etiam corpora caelestia, quia non sunt compositae ex materia et forma, sed sunt formae quaedam subsistentes; quae tamen deficiunt ab actualitate Dei, qui est suum esse, quod de aliis substantiis separatis non contingit; sicut etiam videmus quod elementa etiam se superant invicem secundum gradum actualitatis, eo quod aqua habet plus de specie quam terra, aer quam aqua, et ignis quam aer; ita etiam est in corporibus caelestibus, et in substantiis separatis. Elementa ergo agunt in virtute corporum caelestium et corpora caelestia agunt in virtute substantiarum separatarum; unde cessante actione substantiae separatae, oportet quod cesset actio corporis caelestis; et ea cessante oportet quod cesset actio corporis elementaris.
          <td>I answer that according to the book <i>De Causis</i> when the first cause withdraws its action from the effect, the second cause must needs withdraw its action therefrom, inasmuch as the second cause acts only by reason of the action of the first cause by virtue of which it acts. And since every agent acts for as much as it is actual, the order of active causes will be according to the order of their actuality. Now the lower bodies are less actual than the heavenly bodies, because their potentiality is not made wholly complete by act, inasmuch as their matter underlying one form retains a potentiality to another form. This does not obtain in the heavenly bodies, since their matter has no potentiality to another form, so that their potentiality is wholly terminated by the form that they have. Again, the separate substances have yet more perfect actuality than even the heavenly bodies, because they are not composed of matter and form, but are subsistent forms, falling short however of God’s actuality who is his own being, which does not apply to other separate substances. Thus it is to be observed that as the elements also surpass one another in their degrees of actuality, water being more specific than earth, air more than water, and fire more than air, even so is it in the heavenly bodies and in separate substances. Accordingly the elements act by virtue of the heavenly bodies, and the heavenly bodies by virtue of separate substances: so that when the separate substances cease to act, the action of the heavenly body must cease also, and when this ceases the action of the elemental body must also cease.

          <td>Sed sciendum quod corpus habet duplicem actionem: unam quidem secundum proprietatem corporis, ut scilicet agat per motum (hoc enim proprium est corporis, ut motum moveat et agat); aliam autem actionem habet, secundum quod attingit ad ordinem substantiarum separatarum, et participat aliquid de modo ipsarum; sicut naturae inferiores consueverunt aliquid participare de proprietate naturae superioris, ut apparet in quibusdam animalibus, quae participant aliquam similitudinem prudentiae, quae propria est hominum. Haec autem est actio corporis, quae non est ad transmutationem materiae, sed ad quamdam diffusionem similitudinis formae in medio secundum similitudinem spiritualis intentionis quae recipitur de re in sensu vel intellectu, et hoc modo sol illuminat aerem, et color speciem suam multiplicat in medio. Uterque autem modus actionis in istis inferioribus causatur ex corporibus caelestibus. Nam et ignis suo calore transmutat materiam, ex virtute corporis caelestis; et corpora visibilia multiplicant suas species in medio, virtute luminis, cuius fons est in caelesti corpore. Unde si actio utraque corporis caelestis cessaret, nulla actio in istis inferioribus remaneret. Sed cessante motu caeli, cessabit prima actio, sed non secunda; et ideo cessante motu caeli, erit quidem actio in istis inferioribus illuminationis et immutationis medii a sensibilibus; non autem erit actio per quam transmutatur materia, quam sequitur generatio et corruptio.
          <td>It must be observed however that a body has a twofold action: one according to a property of a body, inasmuch as it acts by movement (for it is proper to a body that it be moved so as to move and act), the other by attaining to the order of separate substances and receiving a share in their mode of operation: thus lower natures are wont to share in a property of a higher nature, for instance certain animals share in a certain likeness to prudence which is proper to man. This latter action of a body does not aim at the transformation of matter, but at communicating a certain likeness to its form to the ‘medium,’ which may be compared to the spiritual ‘intention’ which things impress on the senses or intelligence: thus the air receives the light of the sun, and the ‘medium’ receives a reflection of coloured images. Now both these actions are caused here below by the heavenly bodies. Thus fire by its heat transforms matter by virtue of a heavenly body; and visible bodies reflect their images in the medium by the power of light, the source whereof is in a heavenly body. Hence if both these actions on the part of a heavenly body were to cease, no action would remain in this lower world. But if the heavens were to cease to be in motion, the first action would cease, but not the second: and consequently when the heavenly movement ceases, in this lower world the action whereby the ‘medium’ is illumined and affected by sensible things will continue, but not the action whereby matter is transformed and which results in generation and corruption.

Now this will not be true if animals and plants cease to exist, because in no point do the elements attain to human perfection, whereas certain animals do in a measure: and plants come near to animals, and minerals which are immediately above the elements approach to the plants. Therefore at the end of the world, seeing that nothing should be destroyed belonging to the order of divine wisdom, it would seem that animals and plants should not cease to exist.

Ad huius autem rationem sumendam, procedendum est ordine quem docet philosophus, ut scilicet prius consideretur causa finalis, et postmodum principia materialia et formalia et causae moventes. Finis autem mineralium corporum et plantarum et animalium duplex potest considerari: primus quidem completio universi, ad quam omnes partes universi ordinantur sicut in finem; ad quem quidem finem res praedictae non ordinantur sicut per se et essentialiter de perfectione universi existentes, cum nihil in eis existat quod non inveniatur in principalibus partibus mundi (quae sunt corpora caelestia et elementa) sicut in principiis activis et materialibus. Unde res praedictae sunt quidam particulares effectus causarum universalium, quae sunt essentiales partes universi; et ideo de perfectione sunt universi secundum hoc tantum quod a suis causis progrediuntur, quod quidem fit per motum. Unde pertinent ad perfectionem universi sub motu existentis, non autem ad perfectionem universi simpliciter. Et ideo cessante mutabilitate universi, oportet quod praedicta cessent. Alius autem finis est homo; quia, ut philosophus in sua politica, dicit, ea quae sunt imperfecta in natura, ordinantur ad perfecta sicut ad finem: unde, sicut ibidem dicit, cum animalia habeant vitam imperfectam respectu vitae humanae, quae simpliciter perfecta est, et plantae respectu animalium; plantae sunt propter animalia, praeparatae eis in cibum a natura; animalia vero propter hominem, necessaria ei ad cibum et ad alia auxilia. Ista autem necessitas est, vita animalis hominis durante; quae quidem in illa rerum innovatione tolletur, quia corpus resurget non animale, sed spirituale, ut dicitur I Corinth. XV, 44; et ideo tunc etiam animalia et plantae cessabunt.
          <td>I answer that in that renewal of the world no mixed body will remain except the human body. In support of this view we shall proceed in the order prescribed by the Philosopher ( <i>Phys.</i> ii) namely by considering first the final cause, then the material and formal principles and lastly the moving causes. The end of minerals, plants and animals is twofold. One is the completion of the universe, to which end all the parts of the universe are ordained: yet the aforesaid things are not ordained to this end as though by their very nature and essentially they were required for the universe’s perfection, since they contain nothing that is not to be found in the principal parts of the world (namely the heavenly bodies and the elements) as their active and material principles. Consequently the things in question are particular effects of those universal causes which are essential parts of the universe, so that they belong to the perfection of the universe only in the point of their production by their causes, and this is by movement. Hence they belong to the perfection of the universe not absolutely speaking but only as long as the latter is in motion. Wherefore as soon as movement in the universe ceases these things must cease to exist.—The other end is man, because as the Philosopher says ( <i>Polit.</i> i, 5) things that are imperfect in nature are ordained to those that are perfect, as their end, with the result that as he says ( <i>ibid.</i> ) since an animal’s life is imperfect as compared with a man’s which is perfect simply, and a plant’s life as compared with an animal’s: it follows that plants are for animals being prepared by nature to be the latter’s food; and animals are for man, to whom they are necessary as food and for other purposes. Now this necessity lasts as long as man’s animal life endures. But this life will cease in that final renewal of the universe, because the body will rise not natural but spiritual (1 Cor. xv, 44): hence animals and plants will also cease to exist then.

          <td>Et ad hoc idem habent aptitudinem praedictarum rerum materia et forma. Cum enim sint ex contrariis composita, habent in se ipsis principium activum corruptionis. Unde si a corruptione prohiberentur ab exteriori principio tantum, hoc esset quodammodo violentum et non conveniens perpetuitati, quia quae sunt violenta non possunt esse semper, ut patet per philosophum in libris caeli et mundi. Interius autem principium non habent quod possit a corruptione prohibere, quia eorum formae sunt per naturam corruptibiles, utpote nec per se subsistentes, sed esse habentes a materia dependens: unde non possunt in perpetuum remanere eadem numero, nec eadem specie, generatione et corruptione cessante.
          <td>Again this is consistent with the matter and form of these things: for since they are composed of contrary elements, they contain within themselves an active principle of corruption. Wherefore if they were prevented from corrupting by an external, principle only, this would be in a manner violent and inconsistent with perpetuity, since that which is violent cannot last for ever according to the Philosopher ( <i>De Coelo et Mundo</i> , i). Nor have they an internal principle to preserve them from corruption, because their forms are in themselves corruptible through not being self-subsistent but depending on matter for their being. Consequently they cannot remain for ever identically the same; nor specifically the same when generation and corruption cease.

Unde motu caeli cessante, non poterit in eis motus remanere, nec vita. Et sic patet quod in illa mundi innovatione res praedictae non poterunt remanere.
          <td>The same conclusion follows from the consideration of the moving cause. In plants and animals to be is to live, and in corporeal things this cannot be without movement. Hence animals die when the heart ceases to beat, and plants when they lack nourishment. Now these things have no moving principle that is not dependent on the first movable: since the very souls of animals and plants are wholly subject to the influence of the heavenly bodies. Therefore when the heavenly movement ceases it will be impossible for them to retain movement or life. It is evident then that at the renewal of the world the aforesaid things will be unable to remain.

We may consider the universal in one way as apart from any kind of being: and thus it is true that the universal lasts for ever, rather by abstraction of the cause determining it to a definite duration than by assigning the cause of its perpetuity: for it does not belong to the nature of a universal to exist at one time more than at another. In this way also primal matter is said to be one. Secondly, we may consider the universal in respect of the being it has in individuals: and thus again it is true that it exists always, since whenever the individual exists its universal exists. In the same way it is said to be everywhere, because it is wherever its individual exists, even though there are many places where its individual is not: so that neither is the universal there. Thirdly, the universal may be considered in respect of the being it has in the mind: and thus again it is true that the universal is everlasting, especially in the mind of God.

          <td>Respondeo. Dicendum, quod sicut Augustinus dicit, Porphyrius ponebat, ad perfectam beatitudinem humanae animae, omne corpus fugiendum esse; et sic, secundum eum, anima in perfecta beatitudine existens, corpori unita esse non potest. Quam opinionem tangit Origenes in suo periarchon dicens: quosdam opinatos fuisse, sanctos corpora in resurrectione resumpta quandoque deposituros, ut sic ad Dei similitudinem in perfecta beatitudine vivant. Sed haec positio praeter hoc quod est fidei contraria, ut ex auctoritatibus inductis et pluribus aliis patere potest, etiam a ratione discordat. Non enim perfectio beatitudinis esse poterit ubi deest naturae perfectio. Cum autem animae et corporis naturalis sit unio, et substantialis, non accidentalis, non potest esse quod natura animae sit perfecta, nisi sit corpori coniuncta; et ideo anima separata a corpore, non potest ultimam perfectionem beatitudinis obtinere. Propter quod etiam dicit Augustinus in fine super Genes. ad Litt., quod animae sanctorum, ante resurrectionem, non ita perfecte fruuntur divina visione sicut postea; unde in ultima perfectione beatitudinis oportebit corpora humana esse animabus unita. Positio autem praemissa procedit secundum opinionem illorum qui dicunt: animam accidentaliter uniri corpori, sicut nautam navi, aut hominem indumento. Unde et Plato dixit quod homo est anima corpore induta, ut Gregorius Nyssenus narrat. Sed hoc stare non potest, quia sic homo non esset ens per se, sed per accidens; nec esset in genere substantiae, sed in genere accidentis, sicut hoc quod dico vestitum, et calceatum.
          <td>I answer that as Augustine states ( <i>De Civ. Dei</i> xxii, 26) Porphyry held that the human soul in order to be perfectly happy must avoid all bodies, so that in his opinion the soul cannot be united to the body in the state of perfect bliss. Origen ( <i>Peri Archon</i> ) refers to this opinion when he says that some maintained that the saints would eventually lay aside the bodies resumed at the resurrection, so that being made like God they might live in perfect happiness. This opinion, besides being contrary to faith (as may be gathered both from the authorities quoted and from many others), is also contrary to reason. For there can be no perfect happiness where nature itself is not perfect. And since the union of soul and body is natural, besides being substantial and not accidental, the soul’s nature cannot be perfect unless it be united to the body: wherefore the soul separated from the body cannot have the ultimate perfection of beatitude. For this reason Augustine ( <i>De Gen. ad lit.</i> xii, 35) says that the souls of the blessed do not as perfectly enjoy the sight of God before the resurrection as after: wherefore the human body will need to be united to the soul in the final state of beatitude. The above-mentioned opinion is a sequel to the position of those who hold that the soul is united to the body accidentally, as a sailor to his ship or a man to his clothes. For this reason Plato, as Gregory of Nyssa relates ( <i>De Anima</i> x), said that man is a soul clothed with a body. But this cannot stand: for man would not be a <i>per se</i> being but an accidental being: nor would he be in the genus of substance but in that of accident, as being something clothed or shod.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Patet etiam quod rationes supra inductae de corporibus mixtis, non habent locum in homine, nam homo ordinatur ad perfectionem universi ut essentialis pars ipsius, cum in homine sit aliquid quod non continetur virtute nec in elementis nec in caelestibus corporibus, scilicet anima rationalis. Corpus etiam hominis ordinatur ad hominem, non secundum animalem vitam tantum, sed ad perfectionem naturae ipsius. Et quamvis corpus hominis sit ex contrariis compositum, inerit tamen principium incorruptibile, quod poterit praeservare a corruptione absque violentia, cum sit intrinsecum. Et hoc poterit esse sufficiens principium motus, motu caeli cessante, cum a motu caeli non dependeat.
          <td>Moreover it is evident that the arguments given above which refer to mixed bodies, cannot apply to man: because man is ordained to the perfection of the universe as an essential part thereof, since there is in him something that is not even virtually contained either in the elements or in the heavenly bodies, namely the rational soul. Again man’s body is ordained to him, not only in his animal life but for the perfection of his nature. And although his body is composed of contrary elements it will contain an incorruptible principle, that Will be able to preserve it without violence, inasmuch as it is intrinsic to him. And it will suffice as a principle of movement when the heavenly movement ceases, since it does not depend on the latter.

          <td>Ad quartum dicendum, quod sensibilitas in homine est a principio incorruptibili, scilicet ab anima rationali; in brutis autem est a principio corruptibili; et ideo corpus sensibile hominis in perpetuum potest remanere, non autem corpus sensibile bruti.
          <td><i>Reply to the Fourth Objection.</i> In man the sensitive faculty derives from an incorruptible principle, namely the rational soul: whereas in dumb animals it derives from a corruptible principle. Wherefore man’s sensitive body can last for ever while that of the dumb animal cannot.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad quintum dicendum, quod anima corpori unita plus assimilatur Deo quam a corpore separata, quia perfectius habet suam naturam. Intantum enim unumquodque Deo simile est, in quantum perfectum est, licet non sit unius modi perfectio Dei et perfectio creaturae.
          <td><i>Reply to the Fifth Objection.</i> The soul is more like God when united to the body than when separated from it, because its nature is then more perfect. For a thing is like God forasmuch as it is perfect, although God’s perfection is not of the same kind as a creature’s.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad sextum dicendum, quod anima corpori unita non multiplicatur per modum formarum materialium quae sunt divisibiles divisione subiecti, sed in se remanet simplex et una; unde eius operatio non impedietur ex corporis unione, quando corpus omnino erit subiectum animae; nunc autem impeditur ex corporis unione, propter hoc quod anima non perfecte dominatur in corpus.
          <td><i>Reply to the Sixth Objection.</i> The human soul is not capable of being multiplied in the same way as material forms which can be divided if their subject be divided: but remains in itself in its simplicity and unity. Hence its operation will not be hindered by its union with the body when the body will be wholly subject to it. Now indeed it is hindered by its union with the body, because its power over the body is not perfect.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad septimum dicendum, quod appetitus naturalis elementorum tendendi in propria loca, per dominium animae in corpus retinebitur, ne dissolutio elementorum fiat, quia elementa perfectius esse habebunt in corpore hominis quam in suis locis haberent.
          <td><i>Reply to the Seventh Objection.</i> The elements’ natural inclination towards their proper places will be retained in the body through the power of the soul, lest the elements be destroyed: because the elements will have a more perfect place in the human body than in their own places.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad octavum dicendum, quod motus cordis in homine causabitur ex natura animae rationalis, quae a motu caeli non dependet; et ideo motus ille non cessabit, motu caeli cessante.
          <td><i>Reply to the Eighth Objection.</i> The movement of the heart will result in man from the nature of the rational soul which is independent of the celestial movement: wherefore it will not cease when that of the heavens ceases.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad nonum dicendum, quod omnia membra corporis remanebunt, non propter usus animalis vitae, sed propter perfectionem naturae hominis.
          <td><i>Reply to the Ninth Objection.</i> All the body’s members will remain, not indeed for the purposes of the animal life, but from the perfection of human nature.
