      <h3 align="center">The First Article</h3>
      <p>
        The question concerns the union of the Incarnate Word. First it is asked
        whether this union took place in the person or the nature. It seems that
        it took place in the nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        1. For Athanasius says that "as a rational soul and flesh are one man,
        so God and man are one Christ." But a rational soul and flesh are united
        in one human nature. Therefore God and man are united in one nature of
        Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Furthermore, Damascene says in book III, "this produces an error of
        the heretics because they say that nature and hypostasis are the same
        thing." But this does not seem to be false because in whatever is
        simple, especially in God, supposit and nature are the same. Therefore
        what the heretics say is not false, namely that if the union took place
        in the person it is in the nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Furthermore, Damascene says in book III that the two natures of
        Christ are unchangeably and unalterably united to each other. But a
        union of natures seems to signify a natural union. Therefore the union
        took place in the nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. Furthermore, in all those things in which the supposit has something
        beyond the nature of the species, whether an accident or individual
        matter, it is necessary that the supposit differ from the nature, as is
        clear from the Philosopher in book VII of the <i>Metaphysics</i>. But if
        the union of human nature to the Word did not take place in the divine
        nature, it would not pertain to the nature of the species of the Word
        Himself; therefore it would follow that the supposit of the Word should
        be something other than the divine nature of the Word, which is
        impossible. Therefore it seems that the union should be in the nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. Furthermore, every union terminates in a unity which is posterior to
        that union. But the unity of the person of the Word, since it is
        eternal, is not posterior to the union which took place "in the fullness
        of time." Therefore the union did not take place in the person.
      </p>
      <p>
        6. Furthermore, union signifies a certain addition; hence a union cannot
        take place in something which is perfectly simple. But the person of the
        Word, since He is truly God, is perfectly simple. Therefore a union
        cannot come to be in the person of the Word.
      </p>
      <p>
        7. Furthermore, two things which do not belong to the same genus cannot
        be united in something, for a single thing is not made out of a line and
        whiteness. But human nature differs from divine nature much more than
        those things which differ by genus. Therefore the union of human and
        divine nature cannot take place in one person.
      </p>
      <p>
        8. Furthermore, the person and the nature of the Word differ only
        according to the mode of understanding, insofar as relation of origin is
        signified in the person of the Word but not in the nature. But through
        the relation of origin the Word is not referred to the human nature but
        to the Father. Therefore the person of the Word and His nature are
        related in the same way to the nature assumed. Therefore if the union
        took place in the person it would have taken place in the nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        9. Furthermore, the Incarnation inspires us to love God Incarnate. But
        we ought not to love one divine person more than another because love
        should be the same for those whose goodness is the same. Therefore the
        union of the Incarnation took place in the nature common to the three
        persons.
      </p>
      <p>
        10. Furthermore, according to the Philosopher in book II of
        <i>On the Soul</i>, "for living things, to live is to be." But in Christ
        life is twofold, namely human and divine. Therefore there is in Christ a
        twofold act of existence and consequently a twofold person, for an act
        of existence belongs to a supposit or a person. Therefore the union did
        not take place in the person.
      </p>
      <p>
        11. Furthermore, as the form of a part is compared to matter, so the
        form of the whole is compared to a supposit. But the form of a part
        cannot exist except in its own matter. Therefore the form of the whole,
        which is a nature, cannot exist except in its own supposit, which is a
        human person. In the same way the divine nature is in the divine person.
        Therefore if there were two natures it would be necessary that there be
        two persons.
      </p>
      <p>
        12. Furthermore, everything that is truly predicated of something can
        stand in place of it. But divine nature is truly predicated of the
        person of the Word; therefore it can stand in its place. Therefore if
        the union took place in the person, it can truly be said that the union
        took place in the nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        13. Furthermore, everything which is united to something is united to it
        either essentially or accidentally. But human nature is not united to
        the Word accidentally because it would thus retain its own personhood
        and there would be two persons. For every substance being joined to
        another retains its own singularity as clothes to the wearer or a horse
        to its rider. Therefore the human nature is joined to the Word
        essentially, as pertaining to the essence or nature of the Word.
        Therefore the union took place in the nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        14. Furthermore, nothing which is comprehended by another thing extends
        itself to anything outside that thing, as what is confined to a place is
        not outside that place. But a supposit of any nature is comprehended by
        that nature; hence it is called a thing of nature. Thus an individual
        thing is comprehended by the species just as the species is comprehended
        by the genus. Therefore since the Word is a supposit of the divine
        nature, it cannot extend itself to any other nature so that it would be
        a supposit of that nature, unless a single nature is produced.
      </p>
      <p>
        15. Furthermore, a nature is related to a supposit through a more
        formal, simpler and constitutive mode. But human nature cannot be
        related to the person of the Word in this way. Therefore the person of
        the Word cannot be the person of the human nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        16. Furthermore, according to the Philosopher an action is attributed to
        a supposit or person, because actions belong to individuals. But in
        Christ there are two actions, as Damascene shows in book III. Therefore
        there are two persons. And therefore the union did not take place in the
        person.
      </p>
      <p>
        17. Furthermore, person is determined to be distinct by uniqueness of
        nature. Therefore if the union were in the person, it would follow that
        the union should be in the nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        But on the contrary Augustine says in the book,
        <i>On the Faith to Peter</i>, "the truth of the two natures in Christ
        remains belonging to the one person."
      </p></a

    <p>
      <a name="1" id="1"
        >2. Furthermore, <i>To Orosius</i> says, "We know there are two natures
        in the one person</a
      >
      <a href="QDdeUnione5.htm#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="" id="_ftnref1"
        >[1]</a
      >
      of the Son."
    </p>
    <p>
      Response. It must be said that to clarify this question it is necessary to
      consider first what a nature is, second what a person is and third in what
      way the union of the Incarnate Word took place in the person, not in the
      nature. Now it should be observed that the word "nature" is taken from
      "nascendo"-"to be born."
      <a href="QDdeUnione5.htm#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="" id="_ftnref2"
        >[2]</a
      >
      Hence nature was said first of all to mean the very "being born"
      itself-the birth of living things, namely animals and plants. Afterwards
      the word "nature" was applied to the principle of the aforementioned
      birth. Because the principle of this kind of birth is intrinsic, the word
      "nature" was further employed to signify the more interior principle of
      motion, according to what is said in book II of the <i>Physics</i>, that
      nature is a "principle of motion in that in which it is essentially, not
      accidentally." And since natural motion especially in generation
      terminates in the essence of the species, the essence of the species which
      the definition signifies is further called "nature." Hence also Boethius
      says in the book <i>On the Two Natures</i> that nature is "the specific
      difference informing each thing." Concerning our question, nature is taken
      in this way.
    </p>
    <p>
      To understand what a person is, it must be considered that if there is any
      thing in which there is nothing other than the essence of the species, the
      very essence of the species will be an individually self-subsisting thing.
      Thus in this kind of thing, the supposit and the nature will be really the
      same, differing only logically, namely insofar as it is appropriately said
      that nature is the essence of the species but a supposit insofar as it
      subsists through itself. But if there is a thing in which there is some
      other thing, beyond the essence of the species which the definition
      signifies, whether an accident or individual matter, then the supposit
      will not be altogether the same as the nature but will have something in
      addition to nature, as appears particularly in those things which are
      composed of matter and form. And what was said concerning a supposit must
      also be understood concerning a person in a rational nature, since a
      person is nothing other than a supposit of a rational nature as Boethius
      says in the book <i>On the Two Natures,</i> that "a person is an
      individual substance of a rational nature." Therefore it is clear that
      nothing precludes things from being united in a person which are not
      united in nature. For an individual substance of a rational nature can
      have something which does not pertain to the nature of the species, and
      this is united to it personally, not naturally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore that a human nature was united to the Word of God in the person,
      not in the nature, must be taken in this way: namely that it does not
      pertain to the divine nature but pertains to His person insofar as the
      person of the Word joined a human nature to Himself by assuming it. But
      doubt and discord arise concerning the mode of this conjoining.
    </p>
    <p>
      For we see that in creatures one thing is joined to another in two ways,
      namely accidentally and essentially. So Nestorius and before him Theodore
      of Mopsuestia maintained that a human nature was conjoined to the Word
      accidentally, namely according to the indwelling of grace. They held that
      the Word of God had been united to the man-Christ as someone dwelling in
      him as in His own temple. But we see that every substance conjoined to
      another accidentally, retains its own proper singularity separately, as
      clothes being put on a man or a house containing an inhabitant; hence it
      follows that such a man would have his own singularity which is his
      personhood. Therefore it follows according to Nestorius that in Christ the
      person of the man was distinct from the person of the Word and that one
      should be one son of man and the other the Son of God; hence he did not
      confess the Blessed Virgin to be the mother of God but the mother of a
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this is altogether absurd. Firstly, sacred Scripture speaks in one way
      about men in whom the word of God dwelt by grace and in another way about
      Christ. For it says about others that the word of the Lord came to such
      and such a prophet, but about Christ it says, "the Word became flesh,"
      that is, man, as if the Word Himself personally were a man. Secondly, the
      Apostle's letter to the Philippians (2:7) calls this union an emptying of
      the Son of God. But it is manifest that the indwelling of grace does not
      suffice to explain an emptying, otherwise an emptying would not only be
      fitting to the Son but also to the Father and the Holy Spirit, about Whom
      the Lord says (John 14), "He will remain with you and will be in you;" and
      of Himself and the Father, "We will come to him and make our dwelling with
      him." For this reason and many others, the aforementioned error was
      condemned at the Council of Ephesus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certain men, maintaining with Nestorius that the human nature had been
      accidentally united to the Word, wanted to avoid the duality of persons
      which Nestorius held. They asserted that the Word assumed to Himself a
      soul and body not united to each other, so that a human person, of body
      and soul, would thus not be constituted. But from this follows the greater
      incoherence that Christ was not truly man, since the essence of man
      consists in the union of soul and body. And therefore this error too was
      condemned under Alexander III at the Council of Tours.
      <a href="QDdeUnione5.htm#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="" id="_ftnref3"
        >[3]</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Others accepted the opposite, maintaining that the human nature was united
      to the Word essentially so that one nature or essence was, as it were,
      conflated from the divine nature and the human nature. For this reason,
      Apollinarius of Laodicea asserted three teachings, as Pope Leo says in a
      certain letter to the Constantinopolitans. The first of these teachings
      was that a soul was not united in Christ, but the Word had been united to
      flesh in place of the soul so that thus one nature was made from the Word
      and flesh, as in us one nature comes to be from the soul and the body. In
      this teaching, Apollinarius followed Arius. Now since the Gospel writings
      explicitly speak about the soul of Christ, as in John 11,
      <a href="QDdeUnione5.htm#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="" id="_ftnref4"
        >[4]</a
      >
      "I have the power of laying down my soul," the second teaching arises in
      which Apollinarius maintains that there is a sensitive soul in Christ, but
      not a rational one-the Word was in place of the intellect for the
      man-Christ. But this is unfitting because according to this account, the
      Word would not have assumed a human nature but a bestial one, as Augustine
      argues against him in the <i>Book of Eighty-Three Questions</i>. His third
      teaching was that the flesh of Christ "was not taken from a woman but was
      made from the Word having been changed and converted into flesh." But this
      is absolutely impossible because the Word of God, since He is truly God,
      is altogether unchanging. Hence on account of this teaching, Apollinarius
      was condemned at the Council of Constantinople and Eutyches, who followed
      Apollinarius' third teaching, was condemned at the Council of Chalcedon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus if the union did not take place in the person but only through
      indwelling, as Nestorius maintained, then nothing new happened in the
      Incarnation of Christ. But it is altogether impossible that the union took
      place in the nature, as Apollinarius and Eutyches held. Since the species
      of things are like numbers, in which things added or subtracted vary the
      species, as is said in book VIII of the <i>Metaphysics</i>, it is
      impossible that any nature perfect in itself should receive the addition
      of another nature; if it were to receive it, it would not be the same
      nature but another. Now the divine nature is most perfect, and similarly
      human nature has the perfection of its own species. Hence it is impossible
      that one should be joined to the other by a natural union. And if it were
      possible, what would be constituted from the two would be neither divine
      nature nor human. Thus Christ would be neither man nor God, which is
      unfitting. Therefore it follows that the human nature was united to the
      Word neither accidentally nor essentially, but substantially insofar as
      substance signifies hypostasis, hypostatically or personally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among created things, no example of this union is closer than the union of
      the rational soul to the body, as Athanasius sets forth. It is not an
      example insofar as the soul is the form of the body, since the Word cannot
      be a form in matter, but insofar as the body is the instrument of the
      soul, not an extrinsic or adventitious one, but a proper and conjoined
      one. Hence Damascene says that human nature is an instrument of the Word.
      But it would be more similar still as Augustine says in
      <i>Against Felicianus</i>: "If we should imagine, as most people would, a
      universal soul to be in the world, which forming changeable matter to its
      own uses, would make a person one with itself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless all examples of this kind are deficient because the union of
      an instrument is accidental, but in Christ there is a certain singular
      union above all modes of union known to us. For just as God is His very
      own goodness and His own existence, so also He is unity itself through His
      Essence. Therefore just as His power is not limited to these kinds of
      goodness and existence which are in created things, but He can create new
      kinds of goodness and existence unknown to us, so also by the infinity of
      His power He can create a new mode of union, so that a human nature is
      united to the Word personally, not accidentally, although for this reason
      no sufficient example may be found in created things. Hence Augustine says
      in a letter <i>To</i> <i>Volusianus</i> concerning this mystery, "If an
      explanation is sought it is not surprising, if an example is demanded, it
      is not singular; let us give to God the power to do whatever we
      acknowledge we cannot investigate. For in such cases the whole
      intelligibility of the created thing is the power of the creator." Also
      Dionysius says in chapter two of <i>On the Divine Names</i>, "According to
      us Jesus is a divine composition," that is, union, "which is ineffable to
      every word and unknown to the mind, even to him foremost among the most
      august angels."
    </p>
    <p>
      1. To the first objection therefore it should be said that the similitude
      is not in the fact that from a soul and flesh there is one nature of man
      but in the fact that one person is constituted.
      <a href="QDdeUnione5.htm#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="" id="_ftnref5"
        >[5]</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      2. To the second objection it should be said that although in divine
      things nature and supposit or person do not differ really, they do
      nevertheless differ logically, as was said. Since there is one same thing
      subsisting in the human nature and the divine nature but not one same
      essence composed from the two, so it is that the union took place in the
      person to whose meaning it pertains to subsist, and not to the nature
      which signifies the essence of the thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. To the third objection it should be said that the natures are indeed
      united in Christ, not in a nature but in a person. This is apparent from
      the very fact that the natures are said to be united unchangeably and
      unalterably.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. To the fourth objection it should be said that the heretics, arguing
      that if the union took place in the person then consequently it took place
      in the nature, did not consider the person to be one thing and the nature
      another thing, either in reality or in the mind. Therefore they were
      deceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. To the fifth objection it should be said that something is properly
      said to be united with respect to a union, just as it is said that
      something is one with respect to a unity. Therefore a union is not
      understood to terminate in the divine person insofar as it is one in
      itself from eternity, but insofar as it was united to a human nature in
      time. So the union according to the mode of understanding precedes the
      person, not inasmuch as it is one but inasmuch as it is united.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. To the sixth objection it should be said that union is not said to take
      place in the divine person as if the divine person Himself were
      constituted from two things themselves united to each other. For this
      would contravene His most perfect simplicity. But the union is said to
      have taken place in the person insofar as the divine person, simple,
      subsists in two natures, divine and human.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. To the seventh objection it should be said that two things which are
      different according to genus are not united in one essence or nature.
      Nevertheless nothing prohibits them from being united in one supposit,
      just as an essence is not made out of a line and whiteness but still they
      are found in one supposit.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. To the eighth objection it should be said that the person of the Son of
      God can be considered in two ways: in one way, according to a common
      meaning of person, as it signifies a certain subsisting thing. And
      according to this way, the union took place in the person according to the
      meaning of person just mentioned. In another way, the person of the Son
      can be considered with respect to that which is proper to the person of
      the Son, namely the relation by which He is referred to the Father. But
      the union of two natures is not considered according to the meaning of
      this relation.

    <p>
      9. To the ninth objection it should be said that just as the Incarnation
      adds no goodness to the divine person, so also it adds no lovability to
      Him. Hence the person of the Incarnate Word is not to be loved more than
      the person of the Word simply, although he is to be loved for another
      reason. In any case, this reason is included under the universal goodness
      of the Word. For this reason it does not follow that if the union of the
      Incarnation took place in one person and not in another that therefore one
      person ought to be loved more than another.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. To the tenth objection it should be said that an act of existence
      belongs both to the subsisting person and to the nature in which the
      person subsists, as it were having existence according to that nature.
      Therefore the act of existence of the person of the Incarnate Word is one
      on the part of the person subsisting, and not on the part of the nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. To the eleventh objection it should be said that nature is not related
      to supposit in the same way as form is related to matter. For matter is
      not constituted into existence except through a form, and therefore a form
      requires determinate matter which it makes to be in act. But a supposit is
      not only constituted through the nature of a species but can also have
      certain other things. Therefore nothing prohibits a nature from being
      attributed to a supposit of another nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. To the twelfth objection it should be said that divine nature is
      predicated of a divine person on account of the identity of the thing and
      not according to the propriety of the mode of signifying. Therefore it is
      not necessary that when one is supposed so also is the other, because
      although it is true that in divine things "person generates," it is not
      true that "essence generates."
    </p>
    <p>
      13. To the thirteenth objection it should be said that a human nature was
      united to the Word neither accidentally nor even essentially as pertaining
      to the divine nature of the Word, but substantially, that is,
      hypostatically, as pertaining to the hypostasis or person of the Word.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. To the fourteenth objection it should be said that the person of the
      Word is included under the nature of the Word and cannot extend itself to
      something beyond it. But the nature of the Word by reason of its infinity
      comprehends every finite nature. Therefore when the person of the Word
      assumes a human nature it does not extend itself beyond the divine nature
      but rather takes what is within. Hence it is said in the letter to the
      Philippians 2:6-7 that "Although He was in the form of God, the Son of God
      emptied Himself," not laying aside the greatness of the form of God but
      assuming the smallness of human nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      15. To the fifteenth objection it should be said that just as the nature
      of the Word is infinite, so also the person of the Word is infinite.
      Therefore the divine nature of the Word corresponds as an equal to the
      very person of the Word in Himself, but human nature corresponds to the
      Word insofar as He became man. Hence it is not necessary that the nature
      be simpler and more formal than
      <a href="QDdeUnione5.htm#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="" id="_ftnref6"
        >[6]</a
      >
      the Word in Himself. But it is simpler and more formal than that man who
      is the Word made flesh, and it constitutes him insofar as he is man.
    </p>
    <p>
      16. To the sixteenth objection it should be said that an action belongs to
      a supposit according to some nature or form. Therefore not only are
      actions diversified according to the diversity of supposits but also
      according to the diversity of nature or form, just as also in one and the
      same man it is one action to see and another to hear, on account of
      diverse powers. Hence in Christ there are two actions on account of two
      natures, although there is only one person or hypostasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      17. To the seventeenth objection it should be said that a person is indeed
      substance distinct by uniqueness pertaining to dignity, not insofar as a
      substance signifies an essence or nature but insofar as it signifies a
      hypostasis.

        >1. Augustine says in the book <i>Against Felicianus</i>, "In the
        mediator between God and men, the Son of God is one thing and the son of
        man is another." But nothing which is one according to supposit or
        hypostasis is one thing and another. Therefore Christ is not one
        according to supposit or hypostasis.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="2" id="2"
        >2. Furthermore, Augustine says in the book <i>On the Trinity</i> that
        in Christ "God is both on account of God assuming and man is both on
        account of the man assumed." But nothing which is one according to
        supposit or hypostasis is two such that it could be called both.
        Therefore in Christ there is not only one hypostasis or supposit.</a

    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="2" id="2"
        >3. Furthermore, the human nature in Christ is a certain substance. But
        it was not a universal substance because a universal substance is not
        outside the soul.</a
      >
      <a href="QDdeUnione5.htm#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="" id="_ftnref7"
        >[7]</a
      >
      Therefore it was a particular substance. But a particular substance is a
      hypostasis. Therefore the human nature in Christ was a hypostasis. But the
      human nature in Christ is something beyond the hypostasis of the Word of
      God. Therefore in Christ there is another hypostasis beyond the hypostasis
      of the Word of God and so in Christ there is more than one hypostasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Furthermore, the word "man" is said univocally of Christ and Peter. But
      when it is said of Peter, it signifies nothing other than something
      composed of a rational soul and body. So also when it is said of Christ.
      But beyond the soul and body there is in Christ a hypostasis or supposit
      of the Word of God. Therefore in Christ there is one hypostasis or
      supposit of the human nature and another hypostasis or supposit of the
      divine nature. Thus in Christ there is not only one hypostasis or
      supposit.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Furthermore, nothing infinite can be contained in a finite nature. But
      the supposit or hypostasis of the Word of God has infinity. Therefore it
      cannot be contained in a human nature which is finite. But every supposit
      is contained in the nature of which it is a supposit. Therefore the
      supposit which is the Word of God cannot be the supposit of the human
      nature, but is necessarily His own supposit. Therefore in Christ there is
      some other supposit beyond the supposit which is the Word of God.
      Therefore in Christ there are two supposits or hypostases.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Furthermore, just as genus is related to species, so species is related
      to individuals. But the same species cannot be in different genera.
      Therefore one individual cannot be in different species. But a hypostasis
      is an individual substance and likewise a supposit. Therefore there cannot
      be one hypostasis or supposit of human nature and divine nature, which are
      not of one species.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Furthermore, just as in the Trinity there is one nature in three
      persons, so in Christ there are two natures in one person. But the three
      persons are one on account of the unity of nature, according to John
      10:30, "I and the Father are one." Therefore Christ is two on account of a
      duality of natures. But it cannot be said about anything which is one
      according to supposit or hypostasis, that it is two. Therefore Christ is
      not one according to supposit or hypostasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Furthermore, Christ, insofar as he is the Son of God, has something in
      common with the Father, but insofar as he is called the son of man has
      nothing in common with the Father. Therefore in Christ the Son of God is
      one thing and the son of man is another. Therefore Christ is not one
      according to supposit or hypostasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. Furthermore, that which is of itself incommunicable does not seem of
      itself to be able to become communicable, just as neither can what is of
      itself impossible become possible, as the Commentator says in book X of
      the <i>Metaphysics</i>. But human nature insofar as it is in Christ is of
      itself incommunicable since it is something particular. Therefore it
      cannot be communicated to a supposit of divine nature. Therefore there
      cannot be one same supposit of human and divine nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. Furthermore, every single thing is reduced to those things of which it
      consists. If, granting an impossibility, it were given that the Word of
      God laid aside His human nature, the human nature would at that moment
      have its own hypostasis and supposit. Therefore, still united, it has its
      own hypostasis and supposit. Therefore in Christ there is not only one
      hypostasis or one supposit.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. Furthermore, nature does not depend more on supposit than supposit on
      nature. But a supposit of human nature could not be assumed by the Word of
      God unless human nature itself were assumed. Therefore neither could human
      nature be assumed unless a supposit of human nature were assumed. Now the
      one assuming is not the one assumed. Therefore the supposit of human
      nature is not the very supposit of the Word of God. Therefore in Christ
      there are two supposits.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. Furthermore, the soul and body in Christ were not of lesser virtue or
      dignity than in us. But in us the hypostasis or supposit is constituted
      from a composition of soul and body. So also in Christ, but not the
      supposit or hypostasis of the Word of God, which is eternal, whereas the
      aforementioned union is temporal. Therefore in Christ there are two
      supposits or two hypostases.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. Furthermore, in Christ there are three substances: a body, a soul and
      God. But the soul is not a supposit of the body. Therefore God is not a
      supposit of human nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. Furthermore, according to Porphyry, an aggregation of particular
      properties, which are impossible to find in another thing, makes an
      individuation. But in Christ there was an aggregation of particular
      properties pertaining to his human nature which cannot be found in another
      thing. Therefore they made an individuation, but not an individuation of
      the Word of God, which is not receptive of accidents. Therefore in Christ
      there is an individual or supposit other than the supposit of the Word of
      God. Therefore in Christ there are two supposits.
    </p>
    <p>
      15. Furthermore, one thing cannot be made from things among which there is
      no proportion. But there is no proportion between the divine nature, which
      is infinite, and the human, which is finite. Therefore one hypostasis or
      one supposit cannot be made from two natures.
    </p>
    <p>
      16. Furthermore, generation terminates in a supposit; for a particular is
      what is generated. But in Christ there is a twofold birth, namely temporal
      and eternal. Therefore in Christ there is a twofold supposit and not only
      one.
    </p>
    <p>
      17. Furthermore, the Word of God assumed a body and soul, not as separated
      but as united. But a supposit of human nature is nothing other than a soul
      and body inasmuch as they are united. Therefore in Christ there is another
      supposit beyond the supposit of the Word of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      18. Furthermore, the same thing cannot be simple and composed. But a
      supposit of human nature is composed because human nature is composed. For
      a supposit cannot be more simple than the nature of which it is a
      supposit. Therefore since the supposit of divine nature is simple, there
      is in Christ another supposit beyond the supposit of divine nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on the contrary Damascene says in book III, "In the Lord Jesus Christ
      we recognize one hypostasis."
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Furthermore, among things that differ by supposit, one thing is not
      predicated about the other. Therefore if in Christ there were one supposit
      of man and another of God, it could not be said that man is God or God is
      man: this is erroneous. Therefore in Christ there is not one supposit of
      God and another of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Response. It should be said that certain men, wanting to avoid the heresy
      of Nestorius, who maintained that there are two persons in Christ,
      asserted that in Christ there is one person but two hypostases or two
      supposits. They said that this man, referring to Christ, is a supposit and
      a hypostasis of human nature but of not divine nature, because what is
      called "this man" signifies nothing other than a certain particular
      substance composed of soul and flesh. Nevertheless they said that the
      human hypostasis or supposit pertained to the person of the Word because
      it was assumed by the Word. And this is the opinion which is given first
      in the sixth distinction of the third book of the <i>Sentences</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But firstly those who maintained this were ignorant of proper linguistic
      expression. For a hypostasis is nothing other than an individual substance
      which is also signified by the word "supposit." Boethius says in the book
      <i>On the Two Natures</i> that "person is an individual substance of a
      rational nature." Therefore it is clear that there cannot be a hypostasis
      of a rational nature unless it is a person. But it is manifest that human
      nature is a rational nature. Hence if in Christ there were a proper
      hypostasis of a human nature or a proper supposit beyond the hypostasis or
      supposit of the Word of God, it follows that there would be a proper
      person of a human nature in Christ beyond the hypostasis of the Word. And
      this position does not differ from the position of Nestorius.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly if it is given that person adds, above hypostasis even in a
      rational nature, some uniqueness pertaining to dignity, just as some are
      said to have a persona as if having a dignity, it would follow that the
      union of human nature to the Word took place only in something accidental,
      that is, in some uniqueness pertaining to dignity-which Nestorius also
      held. Hence it must be observed that this is a heresy condemned at the
      fifth council celebrated at Constantinople, where it was written thus: "If
      anyone attempts to introduce two subsistences or two persons into the
      mystery of Christ and says one person is according to dignity and honor
      and adoration, as Theodore and Nestorius being foolish wrote, let him be
      anathema. For the Holy Trinity did not receive an addition of person or
      subsistence when the Word of God, one of the Holy Trinity, was
      incarnated."
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore so that it can be known what ought to be affirmed in such
      questions and what ought to be denied, it should be considered that words
      pertaining to individuation are either words of primary meaning, such as
      "person" or "hypostasis," which signify things themselves, or they are
      words of secondary meaning, such as "individual," "supposit" or words of
      this kind, which signify the intention of individuation. Certain of these
      pertain to the genus of substance alone, such as "supposit" and
      "hypostasis," which are not predicated of accidents. Examples of these
      would include both a person of a rational nature and even a thing of
      nature according to the understanding of Hilary. But certain words pertain
      to individuation in each genus, such as "individual," "particular" and
      "singular" which are even said to be in accidents.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is proper to a substance that it subsist in and through itself, whereas
      it is proper to an accident to exist in another. And therefore those words
      which pertain to the individuation of substance only have reference to
      those things which subsist in and through themselves. For this reason they
      are not predicated of parts of substances because these exist not in
      themselves but in a whole, although they might not be in a subject.
      Nevertheless some words pertaining to individuation can be predicated of
      parts universally, in substances as well as in accidents. For it cannot be
      said that this hand is a person or hypostasis or supposit, but it can be
      said that it is a particular, singular or individual thing. For although a
      hand pertains to the genus of substance, because it is not a complete
      substance subsisting in itself, it is not called a hypostasis or supposit
      or person. Thus because the human nature in Christ does not subsist
      through itself separately but exists in another, that is, in the
      hypostasis of the Word of God-not however as an accident in a subject, nor
      properly as a part in a whole, but through an ineffable
      assumption-therefore the human nature in Christ can be called an
      individual or particular or singular thing. But it cannot be called either
      a hypostasis or a supposit, just as it cannot be called a person. Hence it
      is affirmed that in Christ there is only one hypostasis or supposit,
      namely of the divine Word.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. To the first objection it should be said that both human things and
      divine things are predicated of Christ. Concerning that about which they
      are predicated, he is one and the same. But considering that according to
      which they are predicated, he is one and another, as Augustine says in the
      first book of <i>On the Trinity</i>, because divine things are predicated
      of Christ according to the divine nature but human things according to the
      human nature. Therefore when it is said that in Christ the Son of God is
      one thing and the son of man another, the difference must not refer to
      that about which both are predicated, which is the one supposit of both
      filiations, but to that according to which it is predicated. Therefore
      Augustine adds in the same work, "I say another thing by reason of the
      difference of substance," that is, of nature, "and not another thing by
      reason of the unity of person."
    </p>
    <p>
      2. To the second objection it should be said that divine nature is
      predicated of Christ but human nature cannot be predicated of him, as
      neither can it be predicated of Peter with whom Christ is univocally man.
      <a href="QDdeUnione5.htm#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="" id="_ftnref8"
        >[8]</a
      >
      Hence it cannot be said that Christ is two or both, as if he were two
      natures. But a supposit of human nature is indeed predicated of Christ
      though it does not add to the number of the supposit of the divine nature,
      as has been shown. Hence it follows that when Christ is said to be both,
      it is understood materially, just as when it is said that "a wall and a
      roof are a house" because both come together in one house. So also
      Augustine says in the book <i>Against Felicianus</i> that "one and the
      same man is taught to be both body and soul."
    </p>
    <p>
      Or it can be said that what is said to be "both" must refer to the number
      of words signifying two natures. For the man-Christ is called both God and
      man just as also God the Word is called God and man. And this is what is
      meant by "God is both on account of God assuming," because this word "God"
      is predicated of both God and of man. And this is what is meant by "man is
      both on account of the man assumed," because this word "man" is predicated
      of both.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. To the third objection it should be said that it does not suffice for
      the meaning of hypostasis or supposit that something be a particular in
      the genus of substance, but it is required further that it be complete and
      subsisting in itself, as has been said.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. To the fourth objection it should be said that univocation and
      equivocation are understood insofar as the meaning of a word is the same
      or not the same. But the meaning of a word is that which the definition
      signifies. And therefore equivocation and univocation are understood
      according to signification and not according to supposition. Therefore
      this word "man" is said univocally of Christ and Peter because in both
      cases it signifies one nature, namely human, composed of soul and body.
      But in Christ an eternal supposit is supposed that is not supposed in
      Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. To the fifth objection it should be said that it belongs to the
      supposit or hypostasis of the Word of God to be infinite according to the
      divine nature. But according to the human nature it is fitting for it to
      be within human nature. Hence Dionysius says in chapter I of
      <i>On the Divine Names</i> that "He Who supersubstantially exceeds every
      order according to every nature was made within our nature."
    </p>
    <p>
      6. To the sixth objection it should be said that the name of a species
      signifies a nature as does also the name of a genus. Hence if one species
      were in different genera, it would follow that one nature would be two
      natures. But an individual signifies something which does not pertain to
      nature, and therefore it is not contrary to the meaning of an individual
      that the same individual be a supposit of two natures.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. To the seventh objection it should be said that the divine nature is
      altogether really the same as any of the three persons, and therefore the
      three persons can be said to be one. But human nature is not altogether
      really the same as its own supposit, and therefore human nature cannot be
      predicated of the supposit. Thus Christ cannot be said to be two on
      account of two natures.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. To the eighth objection it should be said that the Son of God has
      divine nature in common with the Father but not hypostasis or person. Now
      the son of man has neither hypostasis nor nature in common with God the
      Father. So from this it does not follow that between the Son of God and
      the son of man there is a distinction in person or hypostasis, but only in
      nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. To the ninth objection it should be said that the human nature assumed
      by the Word of God, insofar as it is individual, cannot be in many things.
      And in this way it is said to be incommunicable. But from the very fact
      that it is a nature, it may be in any supposit 10. To the tenth objection
      it should be said that as long as the human nature is united to the Word,
      it does not have its own supposit or hypostasis beyond the person of the
      Word since the human nature does not exist of itself. If it were separated
      from the Word, it would have not only its own hypostasis or supposit but
      also its own person because it would already exist through itself, just as
      also a part of a continuous body, while it is not divided from the whole,
      exists in potency, not in act unless a division is made.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. To the eleventh objection it should be said that nature is included in
      a supposit but not vice versa. Therefore a supposit could not be assumed
      unless a nature were assumed. But the converse could occur.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. To the twelfth objection it should be said that the union of soul and
      body in Christ is more noble than in us from the very fact that the union
      in Christ does not terminate in a created supposit but in the eternal
      supposit of the Word of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. To the thirteenth objection it should be said that the soul is united
      to the body as its form to constitute human nature. But in Christ divinity
      is not united to humanity because the union did not take place in the
      nature, as was said above. Therefore the same argument does not apply.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. To the fourteenth objection it should be said that an aggregation of
      proper accidents sufficiently proves the individuation of the human nature
      in Christ, but not that it has the notion of a supposit or hypostasis,
      because it does not exist through itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      15. To the fifteenth objection it should be said that the union of human
      nature to the person or hypostasis of the Word in Christ did not take
      place in such a way that the human nature is made equal to the person of
      the Word as if comprehending it, or in such a way that the human nature is
      exceeded by the person of the Word according to some certain proportion,
      because it still remains that the person of the Word exceeds human nature
      into infinity. Nevertheless He Who is an infinite remove from us did not
      separate Himself from us, but rather in a certain ineffable way, a divine
      person joined a human nature to Himself in the unity of a hypostasis.
      Indeed the infinite power of the One assuming works more efficaciously to
      a greater union.
    </p>
    <p>
      16. To the sixteenth objection it should be said that generation
      terminates in a supposit as to what is generated and in a nature as to
      that which is received through generation. Hence form is called the
      terminus of generation. And because generations and movements are
      distinguished according to termini, there are thus two births of Christ
      according to two natures but one who is born on account of the unity of
      the supposit.
    </p>
    <p>
      17. To the seventeenth objection it should be said that the soul and body
      united constitute a supposit and hypostasis, if what is composed from both
      exists through itself, which does not happen in the case proposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      18. To the eighteenth objection it should be said that Christ is simple
      according to the divine nature but composed according to human nature, as
      is clear from chapter I of Dionysius' <i>On the Divine Names</i>.

        form of God assumes the form of man, God is both and man is both." But
        both cannot be said to be in that which is only one thing. Therefore
        Christ is not only one.</a

    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="3" id="3"
        >2. Furthermore, just as in three divine persons there is one nature, so
        in one person of Christ there are two natures. But three divine persons
        are called one on account of the unity of nature. Therefore Christ ought
        to be called two on account of two natures.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="3" id="3"
        >3. Furthermore, Augustine says in <i>Against Felicianus,</i> "The Son
        of God is one thing and the son of man is another." But wherever there
        is one and another, there are two. Therefore Christ insofar as he is Son
        of God and son of man is two.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="3" id="3"
        >4. Furthermore, that which is one in supposit becomes qualitatively
        different of its very self, successively on account of different
        accidents, just as the aged Socrates came from a very boy himself. But
        just as an accidental difference makes qualitatively different, so a
        substantial difference makes another thing. Therefore if the same
        supposit could be changed into another thing by one substantial
        difference, it would be one thing and another. So for the same reason if
        the same supposit has two substantial differences simultaneously, it
        will be one thing and another simultaneously. But to have two natures is
        to have two substantial differences since nature is the specific
        difference informing each thing, as Boethius says in the book
        <i>On the Two Natures</i>. Therefore Christ is simultaneously one thing
        and another. So he is two simultaneously.</a

        the word "man" predicates one thing of Christ and the word "God"
        predicates something else. For both words predicate what they signify.
        Just as the word "white" signifies nothing other than a quality,
        according to the Philosopher, so the word "man" signifies nothing other
        than humanity, which is other than deity which the word "God" signifies.
        Therefore Christ is one thing and another and so is two.</a

      said that the word "man" includes in its signification a supposit of
      humanity, which is not other than a supposit of divinity. And therefore
      Christ insofar as he is God and man is not one thing and another. But on
      the contrary, it is not required for the diversity of things that they be
      diverse according to everything that is in them. Rather it suffices that
      they be diverse according to anything. For a man and an ass belong to the
      genus of animal but differ as rational and irrational. Therefore in order
      for the word "man" to predicate one thing about Christ and the word "God"
      another, it suffices that the nature signified be one thing and another,
      even should it be the same supposit.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Furthermore, insofar as he is God, Christ is one thing by an uncreated
      unity, but insofar as he is man he is another one thing by a created
      unity. But a created unity and an uncreated unity are two unities.
      Therefore Christ is two.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Furthermore, it follows: if Christ is only one, then he is this thing
      and not another thing. Now from the refutation of the conclusion, it
      follows that if it cannot be said that Christ is man and not another thing
      then it cannot be said that Christ is only one. But it is false to say
      that Christ is only man. Therefore Christ is man and something else, and
      so Christ is two.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. Furthermore, the proposition, "Christ is God and man," is a complex
      proposition since it involves a compound predicate. But every such
      proposition predicates a plurality. Therefore Christ is not only one but
      more than one.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. Furthermore, according to the Philosopher in book VIII of the
      <i>Metaphysics</i>, out of a plurality of things of which one thing is not
      in potency to another, there comes not some one thing but many. Hence when
      I say, "man is a two-footed animal," one thing is predicated about man,
      but not when it is said, "Socrates is a white and musical." But humanity
      and divinity are not related as potency and act. Therefore when it is
      said, "Christ is God and man," not one thing but many are predicated. And
      so Christ is not one but two.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. Furthermore, a supposit is said to be that which is subsisting. But a
      different way of subsisting belongs to the son of man and to the Son of
      God. Therefore there is one and another supposit, and so Christ is not one
      but two.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. Furthermore, difference leads to plurality. But there is the greatest
      difference between human nature and divine nature. Therefore Christ is
      most certainly two.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. Furthermore, no one thing can participate in incompatible properties.
      But incompatible properties belong to Christ, such as to be eternal and
      born in time, infinite and circumscribed by place and other things of this
      kind. Therefore Christ is not one but two.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. Furthermore, Christ is a man. But a man is humanity because the
      essence of a thing is the same as that thing whose essence it is, as is
      said in book VII of the <i>Metaphysics</i>. Therefore Christ is his own
      humanity. He is also his own divinity. Therefore since humanity is not
      divinity, it follows that Christ is not one but two.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on the contrary, Christ is not two persons, nor two hypostases, nor
      two supposits, as is clear from what has been said above. Nor is he two
      natures, because human nature is not predicated of Christ. Therefore
      Christ is not two.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Furthermore, according to Boethius every single thing is, because it is
      one in number. If therefore Christ is not one, it follows that he is not a
      being.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Furthermore, those things which are predicated of each other are not
      numerically different. But man and God are predicated of each other in
      Christ. Therefore Christ is not two insofar as he is God and man.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Furthermore, the union of divine and human nature in Christ is greater
      than the union of accident and subject, as was mentioned above. But an
      accident and a subject are one in number according to the Philosopher.
      Therefore much more is Christ one insofar as he is God and man.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Furthermore, Athanasius says about Christ that "although he is God and
      man, nevertheless Christ is not two but one."
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Furthermore, what was made one is one just as what was made white is
      white. But according to Hugh in the book <i>On the Sacraments</i>, the
      Word of God was made one with man. Therefore Christ existing as God and
      man is one.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Furthermore, a unity is that by which each thing is said to be one. But
      after the unity of the Trinity, the greatest unity is the Incarnate Word.
      Therefore Christ is most certainly one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Response. It should be said that the masculine gender, because it is
      formed, usually refers to a person.
      <a href="QDdeUnione5.htm#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="" id="_ftnref10"
        >[10]</a
      >
      Therefore it is manifest that Christ is not two in the masculine but one,
      because in Christ there are not two persons but one. Now certain men,
      maintaining that there is one person in Christ, asserted that in Christ
      there are two supposits or hypostases, one of the Son of God and another
      of the son of man. Hence although they did not say that Christ was two in
      the masculine on account of the unity of person, they nevertheless said
      that he was two in the abstract on account of the duality of supposits.
      But because this opinion contravenes the truth of the faith, as was
      mentioned above, once this opinion has been set aside, it should be
      considered, given that in Christ there is one hypostasis and one supposit,
      whether Christ ought to be said to be two in the abstract or one.
    </p>
    <p>
      To clarify this question it should be considered that "one" is said
      denominatively of that which has unity, just as "white" of that which has
      whiteness or of that which is the subject of whiteness. And for the same
      reason "many" is denominatively said of a multitude and "two" of a
      duality. Because "one" is converted with "being," just as being is
      accidental and substantial, so something is said to be one or many, either
      according to accidental form or according to substance. According to
      accidental forms something is said to be many which is the subject of
      different accidental forms, whether successively or simultaneously:
      successively, just as Socrates sitting is different from himself standing;
      hence Socrates, insofar as he is first standing and afterwards sitting, is
      successively many: simultaneously, as Socrates, insofar as he is white and
      musical, is many. For that "a two-footed animal," which is predicated of
      Socrates, is one and not many, derives from the fact that one of the terms
      is compared to the other as potency to act, as is said in book VIII of the
      <i>Metaphysics</i>. But white and musical are not thus related to each
      other. Therefore Socrates insofar as he is white and musical is many, not
      simply but relatively, just as according to accidents something is said to
      be, relatively and not simply. Now according to substance something is
      said to be one or many simply, just as being is. But according to the
      Philosopher in book V of the <i>Metaphysics</i>, "substance" is predicated
      in two ways: namely of a supposit, which is not predicated of another
      thing, and of a form or nature of a species, which is predicated of a
      supposit. And this, simultaneously one and many, in mere creatures
      <a href="QDdeUnione5.htm#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title="" id="_ftnref11"
        >[11]</a
      >
      is not indeed a single essence of different supposits. Nor again is there
      found in mere creatures any one supposit having two natural substances;
      this is singular in Christ. And a single essence of different supposits is
      singular in the three divine persons. Therefore it is manifest that Christ
      can be in some way one because he is one supposit and in some way many or
      two because he has two natures-much more than Socrates of whom one is
      predicated insofar as he is one subject and many insofar as he is white
      and musical.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it should be considered which of these is said simply and which is
      said relatively. It should be observed that something is said simply and
      properly to be such which is such in its very self. But something is said
      to be in its very self according to the whole more than according to a
      part, because a part is not simply the same as the whole. And since the
      whole is a reciprocal term, it has reference to identity. Therefore what
      belongs to something according to the whole belongs to it more simply than
      what belongs to it according to a part. Hence if a thing were born to
      belong to something according to the whole and a part, if it belongs to it
      only according to the part, it is said to belong relatively and not
      simply, just as if an Ethiopian who has white teeth were called white. But
      it is different concerning that which was not born to be in something
      except according to a part, just as someone is called curly simply if he
      has curly hair.
      <a href="QDdeUnione5.htm#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title="" id="_ftnref12"
        >[12]</a
      >
      It is manifest then that a supposit is signified by way of the whole and
      nature by way of a formal part, as is clear from what has been said.
      Therefore since one and many can refer both to a supposit and a nature, it
      is manifest that if any one supposit has many substantial natures, it will
      be one simply and many relatively-a sign of which is that those things
      which differ by supposit, and are one in that which in itself pertains to
      nature, are many simply but one with respect to genus or species. So
      conversely if one supposit should have many natures, it would be one
      simply and many relatively. Therefore because Christ is one supposit
      having two natures, it follows that he is one simply and two relatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. To the first objection it should be said that what Augustine says, "God
      is both and man is both," must not refer to a duality of supposit
      according to which Christ would be said to be two simply, but to the
      duality of natures signified by two words "God" and "man"-namely because
      human and divine things are predicated of God, and these divine and human
      things are predicated of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. To the second objection it should be said that each of the divine
      persons is altogether really the same as the divine essence, and nothing
      is added by a person beyond the divine nature which would introduce some
      substantial diversity. Therefore because three persons belong in the
      divine nature, they are one simply. But the human nature is not similarly
      related to the divine person. Hence the same argument does not apply.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. To the third objection it should be said that in Christ the son of man
      is said to be one thing and the Son of God another because each name
      predicates a different nature-not because there are different supposits,
      in which case it would follow that Christ was two simply. For since a
      human supposit and a divine supposit are different, it would be necessary
      that they differ substantially.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. To the fourth objection it should be said that different forms inhering
      either at the same or different times do not make another thing simply, if
      the same supposit remains. They only make another thing simply on account
      of the supposit, when the supposit is different.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. To the fifth objection it should be said that in the word "white" is
      understood whiteness and the subject of whiteness. But whiteness is
      understood determinately and the subject of whiteness indeterminately. For
      when we say "white," we understand something informed with whiteness, but
      it is not determined what that thing is as determined by form. Similarly
      when I say that "man" or some other thing is said substantially, one
      having humanity is understood. But because something is determined to a
      species by its own essence or nature and not by its own accidents,
      something having humanity is more determinately understood in the word
      "man," than something having whiteness is understood in the word "white."
      And because that which is determinately understood by a word is properly
      the thing signified by the word, the word "man" signifies a supposit of
      humanity more than the word "white" signifies a subject of whiteness.
      Nevertheless the word "man" does not signify a supposit of humanity
      insofar as it is determined in its singularity, but only insofar as it is
      determined in the nature of a species. Therefore because the supposit of
      the human nature and the divine nature in Christ-though separated insofar
      as it is taken in its own singularity-is one and the same in two
      determined natures, it is one simply in its very self but two relatively,
      insofar as it has two natures.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. To the sixth objection it should be said that regarding the fact that
      something be other than another thing, it is not necessary that it be
      distinguished according to the whole. But regarding the fact that
      something be other than another thing simply, it is necessary that it be
      distinguished according to itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. To the seventh objection it should be said that from the fact that a
      created unity is not an uncreated unity, it cannot be concluded that
      Christ is two, but that he subsists in a twofold unity, just as he
      subsists in a twofold nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. To the eighth objection it should be said that if Christ were one thing
      which is man and not something other than man, it would follow that he
      would be one altogether, that is, both according to nature and according
      to supposit. But from the fact that Christ is one thing which is man and
      another thing which is God, it follows that he is two according to nature,
      but not that he is altogether and simply two, on account of the unity of
      the supposit.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. To the ninth objection it should be said that that about which many
      things are predicated, in a proposition which involves a compound
      predicate, is not necessarily many simply. Otherwise Socrates would be
      many simply if he should be white and musical. Therefore it is not
      necessary that if Christ is God and man that he be two simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. To the tenth objection it should be said that according to nature, a
      single thing does not come to be from the divine nature and human nature.
      Nevertheless they come together in one supposit, on account of which
      Christ is one.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. To the eleventh objection it should be said that just as it is not
      necessary that Christ be two sons because he was born in one way from his
      Father and in another way from his mother,
      <a href="QDdeUnione5.htm#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title="" id="_ftnref13"
        >[13]</a
      >
      so also it is not necessary that he be two according to supposit because
      of a diverse way of subsisting, by which he subsists insofar as he is God
      and insofar as he is man.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. To the twelfth objection it should be said that the great difference
      between human nature and divine nature shows that there cannot be one
      nature of God and man. But from this it does not follow that there cannot
      be one supposit of both natures.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. To the thirteenth objection it should be said that nothing prohibits
      contrary and incompatible differences from being in the same thing in
      different ways, just as man with respect to his soul is incorruptible and
      with respect to his body is corruptible. And so also in Christ certain
      opposites come together, such as a human nature and a divine nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. To the fourteenth objection it should be said that it is false to say,
      "a man is humanity." For the same thing is not altogether signified by
      both, because as the Philosopher says in book VII of the
      <i>Metaphysics</i>, what a thing is, namely the essence of each thing, is
      the same as that thing in the case of those things which exist through
      themselves but not in the case of those things which exist through
      accidents. Therefore whatever thing there is, to which something can be
      added beyond the nature of its own species, is not altogether the same as
      its own essence. But many things add to a man beyond the essence of the
      species. Hence it is clear that a "man" and "humanity" are not altogether
      the same. For "humanity" is said to be that by which someone is a man, and
      thus it includes in its signification those things alone which pertain to
      the essence of the species. But a "man" is said to be he who has humanity,
      in whom there are also many other things beyond the essence of the
      species.

        God, he took the form of a slave, as is said in

        life is twofold, namely human which was taken away through death, and
        divine which cannot be taken away through death. Therefore in Christ
        there is not only one act of existence but two.</a

    <p>
      <a name="4" id="4"
        >But on the contrary whatever is one simply is one according to the act
        of existence. But Christ is one simply, as was shown above. Therefore in
        him there is one act of existence.</a

    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="4" id="4"
        >Response. It should be said that in a certain way the argumentation of
        this question and the previous one are the same because something is
        said to be one and a being, in the same way. For an act of existence is
        properly and truly predicated of a subsisting supposit. For accidents
        and non-subsisting forms are said to exist insofar as something exists
        through them, just as whiteness is called a being insofar as through it
        something is white. Now it should be considered that some forms are
        those through which something is a being not simply but relatively, as
        are all accidental forms. But some forms are those through which a
        subsisting thing has an act of existence simply, because they constitute
        the substantial act of existence of the subsisting thing. Now in Christ
        the subsisting supposit is the person of the Son of God, which is a
        substance simply through the divine nature. But it is not a substance
        simply through the human nature because the person of the Son of God
        existed before the assumed humanity; nor was the person in any way
        augmented or more perfect by the human nature assumed. But the eternal
        supposit is a substance through the human nature insofar as he is "this
        man". Therefore just as Christ is one simply because of the unity of the
        supposit, and two relatively because of the two natures, so he has one
        act of existence simply because of one eternal act of existence of an
        eternal supposit. But there is also another act of existence belonging
        to this supposit, not insofar as He is eternal but insofar as He became
        man temporally. Although it is not an accidental act of existence,
        because "man" is not predicated accidentally of the Son of God, as was
        shown above, nevertheless it is not the principal act of existence of
        his own supposit but a secondary one. If in Christ there were two
        supposits, then each supposit would have a principal act of existence
        proper to itself, and thus in Christ there would be a twofold act of
        existence simply.</a

    <p>
      <a name="4" id="4"
        >1. To the first objection it should be said that the act of existence
        of the human nature is not the act of existence of the divine.
        Nevertheless it should not be said that Christ is two simply, according
        to the act of existence, because the eternal supposit does not regard
        both acts of existence equally.</a

        having become man, associated with us by a certain new operation of God
        and man." But there would be no new operation of God and man unless
        there were one and the same operation of both. Therefore in Christ there
        is only one operation of God and man.</a

    <p>
      <a name="5" id="5"

        do not diversify the operation. But divinity and humanity in Christ come
        together in the same operation, just as divine power and a bodily touch
        come together in the healing of leprosy.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="5" id="5"
        >3. Furthermore, an action proceeds from an agent through some principle
        of action, just as heating proceeds from fire through heat. Therefore it
        is necessary that the multiplicity and the unity of an action be
        considered either on the part of the agent or on the part of the
        principle by which the agent acts. But the number of actions in Christ
        is not taken according to the principle by which an agent acts since
        thus there would be many more actions of Christ than two, according to
        the diversity of powers of the soul. Therefore it should be said that
        there is one action in Christ on account of one supposit acting.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="5" id="5"
        >4. Furthermore, one and the same action belongs to a principal agent
        and its instrument, just as to saw is an action of the carpenter and a
        saw. But the humanity in Christ was the instrument of the divinity in
        Christ, as Damascene says in book III. Therefore there is one and the
        same action of humanity and divinity in Christ.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="5" id="5"
        >5. Furthermore, it belongs to supposits to act. But in Christ there is
        no other supposit except the eternal supposit, about which it cannot be
        said that it acts by the power of human nature, since thus it would
        accept something from the human nature and would have existence and
        actuality through the human nature, since each thing acts insofar as it
        is a being in act. Therefore there is no action in Christ except that
        which is by the power of the divine nature. Therefore there are not two
        actions in Christ according to two natures, namely human and divine.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="5" id="5"
        >6. Furthermore, a supposit is more conjoined to a nature than an
        operation is. But the human nature in Christ does not have its own
        supposit because of union to the divine. Therefore much less does it
        have its own operation. Therefore in Christ there are not two
        operations.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="5" id="5"
        >7. Furthermore, operations belong to something conjoined. Hence the
        Philosopher says in book I of <i>On the Soul</i> that "if someone said
        that the soul knows, it would be like saying that it constructs and
        builds." But Christ is one person in whom humanity is conjoined to
        divinity. Therefore in Christ there is only one operation.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="5" id="5"
        >8. Furthermore, the first and primary operation of an intellectual
        nature is understanding itself. But understanding is not an operation
        which goes outside of the nature, but remains in the agent itself. Now
        to act belongs to a supposit. But in Christ there is only one uncreated
        supposit which is simple. Since therefore there cannot be a twofold
        intellection in one simple thing, it seems that in Christ there could
        not be two intellectual operations.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="5" id="5"
        >9. Furthermore, the operation of any thing follows its own property.
        But according to Damascene, the two natures in Christ communicate their
        own idioms to each other, that is, their own properties, on account of
        the unity of the supposit. For the same reason then there is a
        communication of operations, and so there are not distinct operations
        according to a distinction of natures.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="5" id="5"
        >10. Furthermore, all operations in one man are reduced to one first
        principle, namely the will, which moves all other powers to act.
        Similarly in Christ there is one first principle, namely his divinity by
        which his humanity is moved. And so the operations of the humanity are
        referred in him to the divinity just as to a first principle. Therefore
        in Christ there is only one operation.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="5" id="5"
        >11. Furthermore, just as a rational soul and flesh are one man, so God
        and man are one Christ, as Athanasius says. But an operation of the
        human body or rational soul is said to be a human operation. Therefore
        an operation of the divinity as well as of the humanity of Christ ought
        to be called a Christian operation. Thus there would only be one
        operation in Christ, just as there is one Christ.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="5" id="5"
        >12. Furthermore, every operation proceeds from some form or power. But
        a principal agent does not give any form or power to an instrument.
        Therefore an instrument does not have an operation insofar as it is an
        instrument. But the human nature in Christ was an instrument of the
        divinity, as Damascene says. Therefore the human nature in Christ does
        not have any operation. Thus in Christ there is only one operation, of
        divinity.</a

    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="5" id="5"
        >13. Furthermore, an action informs an agent. But in Christ there is
        only one supposit, namely the eternal supposit, which cannot be informed
        by a created operation. Since therefore it belongs to a supposit to act,
        it seems that in Christ there is not any created operation, and so there
        is only one uncreated operation.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="5" id="5"

        simply speaking, as was said above. Therefore in Christ there is only
        one operation.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="5" id="5"
        >But on the contrary, in the declaration of the Sixth Synod, it is said
        that "We glorify two natural operations, that is, a divine operation and

        inseparably in the same Lord Jesus Christ, our true God."</a

      <a name="5" id="5"

        consubstantial with the Father and an action of human nature as one

    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="5" id="5"
        >3. Furthermore, just as in the Trinity there is one nature in three
        persons, so in Christ there are two natures in one person. But one
        operation belongs to the whole Trinity on account of the unity of
        nature. Therefore in Christ there are two operations on account of a
        duality of natures.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="5" id="5"
        >4. Furthermore, Boethius says in the book
        <i>On the Two Natures</i> that nature is that which can act and suffer.
        So an action follows nature. But in Christ there are two natures,
        therefore also two actions.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="5" id="5"
        >5. Furthermore, operation follows power, but power follows essence
        which is the nature of a thing. Therefore where there are two natures,
        there are two powers and consequently two operations. Thus in Christ
        there is not only one operation but two.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="5" id="5"
        >Response. It should be said that the unity and plurality of an action
        can be considered in two ways. In one way they can be considered on the
        part of the acting subject, and in this way the unity or plurality of an
        action is considered according to number, just as any other occurrence
        has unity or plurality counted on the part of the subject. For the
        vision or hearing of Socrates is different in number from the vision or
        hearing of Plato.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="5" id="5"
        >In another way the unity and plurality of an action can be considered
        on the part of the principle by which an agent operates. And in this way
        an action is said to be one or several according to species, just as
        vision and hearing are operations differing by species. For an action
        proceeds from an agent according to the nature of the power by which it
        acts. It does not matter that actions receive their species according to
        objects, because powers regard determined objects determinately.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="5" id="5"
        >Nevertheless it should be considered that if a power which is the
        principle of an action is moved by another superior power, the operation
        proceeding from it is not only an action but also a passion, namely
        insofar as it proceeds from a power which is moved by a superior power.
        But in man all powers of the sensitive part are moved in a certain way
        by the will as by a certain first principle. Therefore to hear, to see,
        to imagine, to desire and to get angry are all not only operations but
        also certain passions, proceeding from the motion of the will insofar as
        man progresses from his own will to the aforesaid. Therefore although in
        one man there might seem to be many actions differing specifically
        according to diverse powers and habits, nevertheless because all proceed
        from one first action of the will, it is said to be one action of a man.
        For instance, if one craftsman operates by many instruments, it would be
        said to be one operation of his.</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="5" id="5"
        >So in this way some men maintained that in Christ there is only one
        operation so that the human nature in him is subjected to the divine and
        is moved by it.</a

        >[14]</a
      >
      And thus the action of the human nature in comparison to the divine has
      more the nature of a passion. Hence on account of the unity of the divine
      action they said that in Christ there is only one action. But this was
      said irrationally for two reasons: firstly because not every single power
      has dominion over its own acts, as what is moved by a superior does not
      act itself but rather is acted upon. Hence also the Philosopher says in
      book VI of the <i>Ethics</i> that sense is not the principle of any
      action. But the power which does have dominion over its own acts, namely
      the will, is moved by a superior, namely by God, and is not only acted
      upon but also acts. Because in Christ, according to his human nature,
      there is the created power of the will as well as a created intellect,
      since there is nothing lacking to him of those things which pertain to the
      perfection of human nature, it follows that the movement of the human will
      in Christ is an action and not only a passion. Otherwise he could not have
      merited according to his human nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, since the operation of any thing has species and unity from a
      first principle pertaining to the same nature, such as the will, from
      which all human actions have a unity, there is a certain intrinsic
      principle of human nature. And there are no actions that have a unity
      because of the fact that they are reduced to some first principle of
      another nature. Otherwise it would follow that there would be one action
      of everything because there is one first principle moving all things,
      namely God. Therefore although the human nature in Christ is moved by the
      divine, since there are two distinct natures, it is also necessary that
      there be two actions. Therefore if someone asserts that there is one
      action in Christ, it follows that there would be only one nature and only
      one will. Therefore this position was condemned as heretical at the Sixth
      Synod.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. To the first objection it should be said that the operation of Christ
      according to humanity is said to be theandric, that is, of the God-man,
      insofar as the humanity of Christ acted by divine power. And because of
      this, the action of the humanity was a saving action, just as an
      instrument acts by the power of the agent. Thus it is said that a new
      action took place because it was a new thing that the humanity of Christ
      should be an instrument conjoined to divinity in the unity of a person-and
      not because from two actions there should be one composed action.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. To the second objection it should be said that the divinity and
      humanity of Christ came together in the same operation without mixture
      because each nature did what is proper to itself in communion with the
      other nature, as is said in Pope Leo's letter. For example divine power
      healed leprosy, coexisting with the touch of a human body, which received
      its efficacy from the divine power.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. To the third objection it should be said that in Christ all actions
      pertaining to human nature are reduced to one action on account of the
      unity of a connatural principle, namely the will. But the same argument
      does not apply to humanity and divinity, as has been said.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. To the fourth objection it should be said that the human nature in
      Christ is not such an instrument that it is only acted upon, but is also a
      principle of action insofar as it has dominion over its own acts.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. To the fifth objection it should be said that something acts by the
      power of another in two ways: in one way insofar as it is moved by that
      power, as natural heat acts in the power of the soul; in another way
      insofar as some agent uses the power of some instrument, as the soul sees
      by the power of the eye. And it is in the latter way that the eternal
      supposit acted by the power of the human nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. To the sixth objection it should be said that a supposit is what is
      distinct from other things. Therefore if a human nature had a supposit of
      itself, it would resist personal union. But an operation does not signify
      any distinction, and therefore that conclusion does not follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. To the seventh objection it should be said that operations belong to
      something conjoined through many things coming together into one nature.
      But the conjoining of divinity and humanity in Christ is not so. Hence the
      conclusion does not follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. To the eighth objection it should be said that to understand is itself
      intrinsic to the intellect. But in Christ there are two intellects, namely
      the created and the uncreated. Therefore there is also a twofold
      understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. To the ninth objection it should be said that in Christ there is a
      communication of idioms-not that there is a mixture of natural properties
      but because the properties of both natures are predicated of the same
      supposit. And the communication of operations is the same because it is
      the same supposit to which the same divine and human operation is
      attributed.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. To the tenth objection it should be said that the will is the
      connatural principle to the other powers of the soul, but divinity is not
      connatural to humanity. Hence the same argument does not apply.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. To the eleventh objection it should be said that that similitude of
      which Athanasius speaks is considered with regard to the unity of person
      not with regard to the unity of nature. For soul and body come together in
      one person and in one nature, and therefore it is called one human
      operation. Now divine nature and human nature come together in one person,
      but not in one nature, and consequently not in one action.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. To the twelfth objection it should be said that an agent does not
      always give to an instrument a new form or power resting in itself. Still
      the instrument, insofar as it is moved by the agent, attains a certain
      intentional power through the influence of the agent, which moves through
      the instrument into the effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. To the thirteenth objection it should be said that just as vision
      informs a man through the eye's mediation, so also a created action
      informs an eternal supposit through the created nature's mediation.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. To the fourteenth objection it should be said that Christ is one
      simply on account of the supposit. Nevertheless there are two natures in
      him. Therefore Christ is one agent, but there are two actions in him.

      "...[F]or the neuter gender signifies something unformed and imperfect,
      whereas the masculine signifies something formed and perfect" (<i>ST</i>

      Marietti's
      <i>haec quidem in creaturis puris, non sunt simul unum et multa</i>
      (Indeed in mere creatures these are not one and many at the same time)
      seems to be the <i>lectio facilior</i> vs. Dondaine's:
      <i>hoc quidem in creaturis puris, simul autem unum et multa</i>.

      <i>ST</i> III, q. 16, a. 8, <i>responsio</i>: Things "observed to exist in
      a part, are not predicated of the whole simply, i.e. without
      qualification, for we do not say that the Ethiopian is white but that he
      is white as regards his teeth; but we say without qualification that he is
      curly, since this can only belong to him as regards his hair." This
      argument points out a difference in word usage between English and Latin:
      one does not say that an Ethiopian who has white teeth is white [albus],
      but he does say that an Ethiopian is "curly" [crispus] who has curly hair
      because "curly" can only refer to hair.

      Marietti has <i>ea</i>, giving "moved by <i>it</i>," which seems necessary
      vs. Dondaine's <i>eo</i>, which would give, "moved by <i>him</i>."
