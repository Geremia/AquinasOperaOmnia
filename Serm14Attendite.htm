              Duo esse in verbis istis sibi invicem contrariantia apostolus
              testatur. <i>Spiritus</i>, inquit,
              <i>concupiscit adversus carnem, et caro adversus spiritum</i>:
              Gal. 5, 17: et cum in utroque, vel ex utroque contingit esse
              peccatum; ex infirmitate carnis est alium peccatum, et alium per
              ignorantiam spiritus. Unde apostolus 2 ad Corinth. 7, 1:
              <i>emundemus nos ab omni inquinamento carnis et spiritus</i>. Et
              sicut peccatum ex carne provenit ex carnis infirmitate; unde in
              Matth. 26, 41:
              <i>spiritus quidem promptus est, caro autem infirma</i>; sic
              peccatum spiritus provenit ex ignorantia spiritus, scilicet quando
              spiritus decipitur. Et ideo in ista dominica munimur contra
              utrumque peccatum. Contra peccatum ex infirmitate carnis munimur
              per apostolum in epistola qui dicit:
              <i>debitores sumus carni, non ut secundum carnem vivamus</i>, Rom.
              8, 12. Contra peccatum ex deceptione spiritus munimur in
              Evangelio, ubi dicitur: <i>attendite a falsis prophetis</i> et
              cetera.

              [1] The Apostle points out two contentious [desires] by these
              words: <i>The spirit</i>, he says,
              <i>strives against the flesh and the flesh against the spirit</i>,
              and yet sin arises from both: sometimes it arises from the
              weakness of the flesh and at other times through ignorance of the
              spirit;' therefore the Apostle says to the Corinthians:
              <i
                >Let us cleanse ourselves from every defilement of body and
                spirit.</i
              >
              And just as sin arises from the flesh, out of the weakness of the
              flesh, thus in Matthew:
              <i>The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</i>, so
              the sin of the spirit arises through ignorance of the spirit,
              namely when the spirit is deceived. And so on this Sunday we are
              strengthened against both kinds of sin. We are strengthened
              against that sin which arises from the weakness of the flesh by
              the words of the Apostle who says in his letter:
              <i
                >We are debtors to the flesh, not so that we may live according
                to the flesh;</i
              >
              and we are strengthened against sin that arises from the deception
              of the spirit, where it says in the Gospel:
              <i>Beware of false prophets</i>, etc.

              insidiosum et dolosum habemus hostem. Unde in Eccl. 11, 31:
              <i>multae insidiae dolosi. Sedet in insidiis cum divitibus</i>.
              Psalm. 10, 8, idest cum superbis. Istas insidias explicat
              apostolus 2 Cor. 11, 14, dicens quod Satanas transfigurat se in
              Angelum lucis, et ministros ejus in ministros injustitiae. Contra
              ministros ejus reddit nos dominus cautos in verbis propositis. In

              [3] The responsibility of a good leader is to train his troops to
              be on guard against ambushes. To be sure we have a cunning and
              deceptive enemy, hence we read in Ecclesiasticus:
              <i>Many are the ambushes of the deceitful.</i> The Psalmist
              writes: <i>He sits in ambush with the rich</i>, that is to say,
              with the proud. The Apostle explains these ambushes, saying that
              <i>Satan disguises himself as an angel of light</i>
              and
              <i
                >his servants also disguise themselves as servants of
                righteousness</i
              >. Through these words the Lord makes us wary of Satan's servants
              by teaching us four things.

              Angeli boni sunt nobis necessarii et utiles. Unde in Prov. 26, 18:
              <i>cum deficit prophetia dissipabitur populus</i>. De falsis
              prophetis dicitur Jer. 23, 15:

              [5] These enemies are false prophets, and being extremely
              dangerous must be avoided, because they are as dangerous to us as
              good angels are necessary and helpful to us, hence we read in
              Proverbs:
              <i>When prophecy fails the people will be scattered.</i>
              Jeremiah says this about false prophets:
              <i
                >From the prophets of Jerusalem corruption has gone forth into
                all the land.</i
              >
              And in order that we may discern who the false prophets are, let
              us first of all consider what the definition of a prophet is, and
              how he becomes a false prophet.

              Dico quod quatuor sunt de ratione prophetiae. Primum est revelatio
              divina: unde in Amos 3, 7:

              [6] There are four defining points of a prophet. The first is
              divine revelation, as we read in Amos:
              <i
                >The Lord God does nothing without revealing his secret to his
                servants the prophets.</i

              Aliquando revelantur alicui aliqua divinitus, sed non intelligit,
              sicut Nabuchodonosor vidit statuam, Dan. 2, 31, et Pharaoni
              aliquid est revelatum, scilicet quod vidit spicas et boves, sed
              non intellexit, Gen. 41, 5. Propter quod requiritur secundo
              intellectus. Unde in Daniel. 10, 1:
              <i>verbum revelatum est Danieli et intellexit sermonem</i>. Unde

              [7] Sometimes certain divine things are revealed to someone who
              does not understand them, as when Nebuchadnezar saw a statue, and
              something was revealed to Pharaoh, namely ears of grain and cows,
              though he did not understand it. For this reason understanding is
              the second thing that is required, as we read in Daniel:
              <i
                >A word was revealed to Daniel and he understood the word, hence
                understanding was needed in the visions.</i

              ut alteri annuntiet. Isa. 21, 10:
              <i>quae audivi a domino exercituum Deo Israel, annuntiavi vobis</i

              [81 If a man were to receive a revelation from God and though he
              understood it nonetheless kept it to himself, no benefit would be
              derived from that; for this reason a third thing is required so
              that those things which are revealed to a man, which he himself
              also understands, will be announced to another. As it says in
              Isaiah:
              <i
                >What I have heard from the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, I

              Primo dicuntur aliqui falsi prophetae ex falsitate doctrinae, ut
              quando falsa annunciant et docent. Ad officium prophetae pertinet
              vera nunciare et dicere. Unde in Daniel. 10, 1, verbum revelatum
              est Danieli, et est verbum verum; et dominus dicit:
              <i>si quis annunciat sermones meos loquatur vere</i>. Sed multi
              annunciant false: unde in canonica 1 Joan. 4: fiunt in populo
              pseudoprophetae sicut et in vobis; erunt magistri mendaces qui non
              metuunt sectas inducere praedicationis nomine. Mendax fuit Arius
              et consimiles sibi, qui voluerunt corrigere doctrinam Christi.
              Unde in threnis 2, 14:
              <i>prophetae tui ludunt falsa et stulta</i>. Sed quae stulta? Qui
              falsa loquitur libenter dicet ea quae placent. Isa. 30, 10:
              <i>loquimini nobis placentia, videte nobis errores</i>.
              Interrogatus quae falsa prophetae viderunt, dicit:
              <i
                >non aperiebant iniquitatem tuam, ut te ad poenitentiam
                provocarent</i
              >. Si aliqui dicunt bonum malum et malum bonum, sunt falsi
              prophetae. Jer.:
              <i>viderunt falsas assumptiones, et ejectiones</i>, Thren. 2, 14.
              Illud quod assumitur elevatur et quod ejicitur damnatur. Quando
              igitur extollenda deprimuntur, et deprimenda extolluntur, tunc
              vides falsas assumptiones.

              [17] Now, in the first place some are called false prophets by
              reason of their deceptive teaching, as when he proclaims and
              teaches spurious things. It is a prophet's duty to announce and to
              teach truths, hence we find in Daniel:
              <i>A word was revealed to Daniel, and it was a true word.</i>
              And the Lord says:
              <i>If anyone proclaims my words, let him speak truly.</i>
              But many make false claims, and therefore we read in the Catholic
              Epistle:
              <i
                >There were false prophets among the people, even as there will
                be among you lying teachers</i
              >, who are not afraid to introduce a ruinous heresy. Was not Arius
              a liar and those like him who sought to correct Christ's teaching?
              Thus we find in Lamentations:
              <i>Your prophets have seen false and foolish things.</i>
              But what are these foolish things? Whoever speaks false things
              gladly, speaks pleasing things. We read in Isaiah:
              <i>Speak to us pleasant things: see errors for us.</i>
              Asked what false things the prophets saw, Jeremiah responds:
              <i
                >They have not laid open your iniquity in order to incite you to
                penance.</i
              >
              If anyone calls good evil and evil good: they are false prophets.
              As Jeremiah says:
              <i>They have seen false revelations and banishments</i>; what is
              accepted is approved and what is rejected is disapproved.
              Therefore when esteemible things are disdained and detestible
              things are esteemed, then you are witnessing false conclusions.

              [18] It is evident through the Lord's teaching what is to be
              esteemed and what is to be detested. Living according to the ways
              of the world and leading a worldly life must be detested. If
              anyone says that it is better to fast without a vow, and leads
              others away from religious life where they are fasting under a
              vow, and persuades them to fast in the world without a vow, then
              he holds a spurious teaching. The Prophet says:
              <i>Make a vow and perform it.</i>
              He says this because it is better to fast under a vow than without
              a vow; otherwise he would only have said: "Make it". Anselm offers
              us an example in his book,
              <i>De similitudinibus</i>, explaining that whoever gives an apple
              tree gives more than someone who gives only apples; in the same
              way whoever makes a vow and performs it acts better than someone
              who performs a good deed without a vow.

              [22] We find that others, who study philosophy and advance some

              themselves do not assert this, but rather they are only repeating
              the words of the Philosopher. Such a person is a false prophet or
              a false teacher, for it is the same thing to instill doubt and not
              to resolve it, as it is to affirm the doubt. This point is

              which belong to faith opens a pit; he does not cover the pit who
              does not resolve the doubt, even though he himself possesses sound
              and clear understanding and is not deceived. Nonetheless the other
              person who does not possess such clear understanding is truly
              deceived, and so that man who instilled the doubt is held
              accountable for restitution, since it was through him that the
              other man fell into the pit.

              [23] Consider this dear brothers: there were many philosophers who
              spoke many things belonging to faith, and you will scarcely find
              two philosophers agreeing upon one opinion; and any one of them
              that did say something true, did not speak without an admixture of
              error. A little old woman now knows more about what belongs to
              faith than all the philosophers once knew. We read that Pythagoras
              began as a boxer; he heard his teacher discuss the immortality of
              the soul, asserting that the soul was immortal, and he was so
              enthralled that after having forsaken everything, he dedicated
              himself to the study of philosophy. But what little old woman is
              there today who does not know that the soul is immortal? Faith is
              capable of much more than philosophy, consequently if philosophy
              contradicts faith, it must not to be accepted, as the Apostle to
              the Colossians says:

              [24] Others are called false prophets by reason of their deceptive
              intention. But what is a prophet's true intention? Certainly it is
              the welfare of the people, as the Apostle says in his letter to
              the Corinthians:
              <i
                >He who prophesies speaks to men for their edification and
                encouragement and consolation</i

              devout; for their encouragement so that they may become ready to
              perform good deeds; for their consolation so that they may become
              patient in adversity. If anyone seeks anything from a teaching
              other than the welfare of the people, he is a false prophet.

              [25] Every bishop who takes up the duty of governing and preaching
              must look to the welfare of his people. But if he is seeking
              anything else, namely temporal gain and empty glory, he is a false
              prophet, because he does not keep an upright intention; for this
              reason Chrysostom says that many priests are not concerned with
              how people live, but with how much they give. Therefore, in
              Ezekiel the Lord deplores such men:
              <i
                >And they violated me among my people for a handful of barley
                and a piece of bread.</i
              >
              Against whom the Apostle says:
              <i>For we are not as many, adulterating the word of God.</i>
              Gregory also says that "that servant is guilty of adulterous
              thoughts, if he desires to please the eyes of the bride when the
              bridegroom sends gifts by him to her. An adulterer is not looking
              to sire a child with his mistress, but he is only looking for a
              moment of pleasure. Likewise, that person adulterates the word of
              God, who is not looking to sire a spiritual child, but is only
              looking for temporal gain and empty glory.

              [27] I have already spoken today about the enemies of the
              Christian people, namely about false prophets; now we must
              consider how they entrap us. The Apostle to the Corinthians
              exposes their traps, and likewise the Lord in the Gospel when he
              says:
              <i
                >Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's
                clothing</i
              >, etc. Here the meaning of hypocrisy is understood because
              hypocrisy is the hiding place of false prophets. Therefore the
              Apostle in his letter to Timothy says:
              <i>The Spirit manifestly says: in the last days</i>
              mockers will come, departing
              <i
                >from the faith by giving heed to deceitful spirits and
                doctrines of demons, speaking lies in the hypocrisy.</i
              >
              If anyone were to consider the life and character of others, those
              who lead an austere life by abstaining from marriage and
              extravagant foods will appear to him as good, but in fact they
              answer to the spirits of delusion and the teachings of demons.

              <i>oves meae vocem meam audiunt</i>. Nostra caula ovium sunt

              [28] Turn your attention now to what he says:
              <i>They come to you in sheep's clothing.</i>
              The sheep are Christ's faithful who obey Christ, hence in John:
              <i>My sheep hear my voice.</i>
              Sheep's clothing are the moral examples of Christ. Thus it is that
              the Apostle says:
              <i

                truth.</i

              Here he touches upon two points, because justice seems outwardly
              to belong to our neighbors, and holiness of truth seems to belong
              to the interior disposition of the soul. Hence that saying of
              Proverbs is fulfilled:
              <i>Her entire household is clothed with double garments</i>,
              namely, inwardly with the virtues of the soul and outwardly with
              good works.

              Istam vestem assumunt hypocritae propter duo; scilicet propter

              eam publice et manifeste orando. Unde in Evangelio Matth. 6, 4:

              scribatur:
              <i>benedicite domino omnes Angeli ejus?</i>
              Dicit Chrysostomus quod non tantum tangit locum quam animum. In
              occulto orat qui animum non ad homines sed ad Deum habet. Si solus
              oraret quis in camera et vellet videri ab hominibus, publice
              oraret. Quid igitur prohibetur? Scilicet ne homines animum habeant
              ad hoc quod videantur ab hominibus orare: ab hoc vitandum est
              Christianis. Unde Chrysostomus: orans nihil novum faciat ut ab
              hominibus videri possit in clamando, neque pectus percutiendo,
              neque manus elevando: sed si oras in societate sicut alii, in
              secreto oras: novos autem gestus et modos quaerere pertinet ad hoc
              quod dicit in synagogis orare. Debet homo in orando conformis esse
              aliis, non novos modos quaerere, sicut hypocritae qui publice
              orant propter inanem gloriam, et item orant publice propter
              lucrum. Unde in Evangelio Matth. 23, 14:
              <i
                >vae vobis, Scribae et Pharisaei, qui devoratis domum viduarum,

              orationes, ut eas reddant devotas, et ab eis dona recipiant. Sed
              numquid malum est prolixe orare? Respondit Augustinus et dicit:
              absit ab oratione multa loquutio; sed non desit multa precatio, si
              fervens perseveret intensio; nam hoc negotium plerumque plus

              [32] Hypocrites assume this clothing for two reasons, namely for
              empty praise and money. For the sake of vainglory they put it on
              by praying publically and openly, hence in the Gospel it says:
              <i
                >They love to pray in the synagogues and corners of the streets,
                that they may be seen by men</i
              >; in the synagogues, that is to say publically. But is it a bad
              thing to do this, since it is written:
              <i>All you angels, bless the Lord</i>, etc.?" Chrysostom says that
              this has not so much to do with the place than with the soul. The
              one who prays in secret directs his attention, not to men, but to
              God. If someone prays alone in his room and he wants to be seen by
              men, he should pray in public. What then is being forbidden?
              Namely, that people should not intend to be seen by others when
              they pray; for this reason Christians must avoid this. Therefore
              Chrysostom gives this advice: "Let the one praying do nothing
              unusual so that he may not be able to be seen by men, neither by
              crying aloud, nor by beating his breast, nor by raising his
              hands." But if you are praying in the same manner as the others in
              your community, then you are praying in secret; however, looking
              for new methods and gestures applies to what is said about praying
              in synagogues. When praying, a person ought to pray in unison with
              others, and not look for novel methods as the hypocrites do who
              pray publically for the sake of vainglory. And moreover, they pray
              long prayers for money, thus it says in the Gospel:
              <i
                >Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you
                devour the houses of widows praying long prayers</i
              >, namely, they pray in order to obtain money. Some, in a most
              shameful way, obtain money from defenseless women: they pray
              <i>long prayers</i>
              so that they may become devout women and receive gifts from them.
              But is there anything evil in praying long prayers? Augustine
              answers by saying: "Verboseness should be absent from prayer, but
              much prayer should not be lacking, if only the intention continues
              steadfastly; for very often this work is accomplished more by
              sighs than by words, more by tears than by speaking".

              [33] Another clothing of Christ's sheep is the clothing of justice
              and mercy, about which Job says:
              <i
                >I was clothed with justice, as with a robe, I was an eye to the
                blind and afoot to the lame; I was the father of the poor.</i

              The hypocrites assume this clothing, therefore we read in the
              Gospel:
              <i
                >Beware of practicing your piety before others in order to be
                seen by them; when you give alms, sound no trumpet, as the
                hypocrites do.</i
              >
              Chrysostom says that the trumpet is every deed or word by which
              boasting is shown. For example: you give alms, but you would not
              give it except to a more reputable person who can repay you: this
              is a trumpet. Moreover, you act like a trumpet when you wish to
              give alms secretly so as to appear more praiseworthy.

              perniciosiorem, quod sub nomine servitutis domini decipit.

              [34] The third clothing of Christ's sheep is the clothing of
              penitence, about which the Psalmist says:
              <i>I made haircloth my garment.</i>
              The hypocrites use this clothing, namely a deceptive and austere
              way of life, thus we find in the Gospel:
              <i
                >When you fast, do not look sad, like the hypocrites, for they
                disfigure their faces that their fasting may be seen by men.</i
              >
              They seek and crave this so that their fasting may be seen by men.
              Augustine writes: "In this chapter we must turn our attention to
              the fact that it is possible to boast not only of the splendor of
              material things, but even of filthy squalor, and that this is all
              the more dangerous when it is disingenuously done in the name of
              the Lord's service." The Philosopher says that [if] a man were to
              wear apparel that is beneath his station in life, this can be
              considered a form of boasting. These exterior things act as
              certain kinds of insignias: in an army every battle line carries
              its own standard; this is not presumptuous. In whatever state of
              life a person finds himself, he should be content with ordinary
              things and not seek too much after worthless objects, for as
              Augustine says: "We should neither make too much use of expensive
              things nor of cheap things". And why is this? Because we are able
              to seek glory in these two ways. Concerning this cheap clothing it
              is said in Zechariah:
              <i>They shall not put on a garment of sackcloth</i>, namely, so
              that they do [not] pretend.

              The hypocrites assume this clothing, namely by feigning piety and
              purity, as we read in the Gospel:
              <i>Woe to you hypocrites who are like whitewashed sepulchres</i>,

                filthiness</i
              >, that is, violent theft and indecency. And Chrysostom says: "If
              it is vile to appear to be, it is even more vile actually to be
              so; if it is beautiful to appear, it is even more beautiful
              actually to be so." Such as these come in sheep's clothing.

              one plays the part of a thief, another of a wolf, another of a
              shepherd, and another of a mercenary, since a shepherd seeks the

              The Lord says:

              But what does it mean to scatter? Certainly when someone departs
              from what the Church teaches, he is scattered.

              gain one penny would be called extremely cruel; this is the way
              hypocrites act. Since the life of the soul is more precious than
              the life of the body, hypocrites seduce souls in order that they

              Alius fructus ovium Christi (est) in locutione, quia boni
              loquuntur bonum, et de bono. Unde apostolus ad Heb.:
              <i
                >per ipsum offeramus hostiam, fructum labiorum confitentium
                nomini ejus</i
              >. Si aliquis dicat aliquid quod dissonat ejus operibus, non habet
              vestes similes fructui. Unde in Prov. 18, 20:
              <i>de fructu oris viri replebitur venter ejus</i>. Difficile est
              quod cor plenum invidia non eructet quandoque aliquid ex illo,
              quia <i>ex abundantia cordis os loquitur</i>. Unde Gregorius:
              pravi dum recta praedicant, valde difficile est ut quandoque et ea
              quae tacite ambiunt non eructent.

              [45] Another fruit of Christ's sheep is in their speech, since
              good men always say something good and speak about good; thus the
              Apostle to the Hebrews says:
              <i>By him let us offer the sacrifice, the fruit of lips</i>
              corresponding
              <i>to his name.</i>
              If anyone says something that is incongruent with his actions,
              then his clothes do not correspond to his fruit, thus we read in
              Proverbs:
              <i>Of the fruit of a man's mouth will his belly be satisfied.</i>
              It is difficult for a heart filled with jealousy not to let
              anything slip out from it at any moment, since
              <i>out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.</i>
              Therefore Gregory says: "While depraved people do speak openly
              about suitable topics, it is only with the greatest difficulty
              that they do not let roving secrets spew forth."

              Tertius fructus ovium Christi ex quo deprehenduntur hypocritae,
              est bonae operationis, quia in bonis est fructus bonus. Apostolus
              Rom. 1, 13:
              <i>habetis fructum in sanctificatione</i>. In malis autem fructus
              est malus. Unde in Prov. 10, 16: <i>fructus impii ad peccatum</i>,
              idest ad operationem peccati. Augustinus in quodam sermone dicit:
              qui sub perfectione Christianitatis insolito squallore aut
              sordibus in se oculos hominum convertit, cum id voluntate faciat,
              non necessitate patiatur, ex ceteris ejus operibus cognosci potest
              utrum id ad contemptum ornatioris habitus aut ambitione faciat.
              Quandoque potest contingere ex humilitate quod homo splendidum
              habitum accipiat, quandoque autem ex ambitione. Considera in aliis
              ejus operibus, si in illis contemptus ambitionis, tunc ex
              humilitate facit. Dicit, ex operibus ejus cognosci potest; quia
              qui vile habitum portant ex una parte, et alia parte proferunt
              signa poenitentiae et mansuetudinis, oves Christi sunt. Si non;
              simulatores sunt. Unde facile, inquit, hypocritae deprehendi
              possunt. Viam per quam jussi sumus ambulare laboriosa est.
              Hypocritae laborare non eligunt.

              [46] The third fruit of Christ's sheep by which we can identify
              hypocrites belongs to good actions, because in good actions there
              is good fruit, as the Apostle says:
              <i>You have your fruit unto sanctification.</i>
              However, in bad actions there is bad fruit, as we read in
              Proverbs:
              <i>The fruit of the wicked is to sin</i>, that is to the work of
              sin. In a certain sermon Augustine says: 'When anyone in the
              profession of Christianity draws men's eyes upon himself by an
              unusually filthy and foul garment, if this is done voluntarily and
              is not suffered out of necessity, then by his other activities it
              can be determined whether he is doing this out of contempt for
              stylish dress or whether he is doing it for adulation." It
              sometimes happens that a man will put on an attractive garment out
              of humility, but at other times he will do it for adulation.
              Consider his activities among other men: if he is among other men
              and spurns their adulation, then he is doing it out of humility;
              if not, as Augustine says, it can be determined from his
              activities: because those, who on the one hand wear cheap
              garments, but on the other hand prefer the signs of penitence and
              gentleness are the sheep of Christ; if not, they are frauds.
              "Therefore it is said that a hypocrite is easily recognized. The
              way through which we have been commanded to walk is an arduous
              one; and the hypocrite does not choose it".

              Item hypocritae ostendunt se mites, sed cum occasionem habent
              persequendi, tunc maxime persequuntur. Unde Gregorius: si qua vero
              fidei tentatio erumpat, statim lupi mens rabida habitu se ovinae
              pellis expoliat; quantumque contra bonos saeviat persequens
              demonstrat.

              [47] Again, hypocrites make a display of their meekness, but when
              they have the opportunity of persecuting, then they do their
              utmost to persecute, hence Gregory says: "If any trial of faith
              occurs, immediately the wolf ravenous at heart strips himself of
              his sheep's skin; and shows by persecuting how great his anger is
              against the good".

              Quartum signum quo deprehenduntur hypocritae est tempore
              tribulationis. Unde in Prov. 15, 6:
              <i
                >pro fructibus impii conturbatio; doctrina viri per prudentiam
                noscitur</i
              >. Augustinus in sermone domini de monte dicit de hypocritis: cum
              coeperint, inquit, aliquibus tentationibus subtrahi vel negari
              quae isto velamine consequuti sunt, vel consequi cupiunt, necesse
              est appareat utrum lupus in pelle ovina sit, aut ovis in sua.
              Propter hoc dicit apostolus 2 Tim. 2, 21:
              <i
                >si quis se emendaverit ab istis, scilicet peccatis, erit vas ad
                honorem paratum omnino</i
              >: quod nobis praestare dignetur qui cum patre et cetera.
            </td>
            <td>
              [48] A fourth sign by which hypocrites are recognized is in time
              of tribulation, therefore as it says in Proverbs:
              <i
                >In the fruits of the wicked is trouble: the learning of a man
                is known by patience.</i
              >
              Augustine commenting on the Lord's Sermon on the Mount, describes
              hypocrites this way: "For when by any temptations those things
              began to be withdrawn or denied, which they either attained or
              desired to attain under this cover, it must appear to be either a
              wolf in sheep's clothing, or a sheep in its own." For this reason
              James says in his canonical letter:
              <i
                >If any man therefore will clean himself from these, he will be
                a vessel unto honor, prepared to the Lord.</i
              >
              May he grant us to stand before him who with the Father, etc.
