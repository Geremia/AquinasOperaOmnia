                            intelligere est operatio animae et corpori communis;
                            dicit enim philosophus in I de anima, quod dicere
                            animam intelligere, simile est ac si dicatur texere
                            vel aedificare. Ergo anima post mortem non potest

                            1. No activity common to soul and body can remain in
                            the soul after death. But understanding is an
                            activity common to soul and body. For the
                            Philosopher says: “To say that the soul understands
                            is like saying that it weaves or builds.” Therefore,
                            after death the soul cannot understand.

                                Sed dicebat, quod philosophus loquitur de actu
                                intelligendi qui competit animae secundum faciem
                                inferiorem, non autem de illo qui sibi competit
                                secundum faciem superiorem.- Sed contra: facies
                                superior animae est secundum quam ad divina
                                convertitur. Sed homo, etiam cum intelligit
                                aliquid ex divina revelatione, suum intelligere
                                dependet a corpore, quia oportet quod
                                intelligere etiam illud sit per conversionem ad
                                phantasmata, quae in organo corporali sunt. Ut
                                enim dicit Dionysius I cap. caelestis
                                hierarchiae: impossibile est nobis aliter lucere
                                divinum radium nisi varietate sacrorum velaminum
                                circumvelatum; et appellat velamina ipsas
                                corporales formas sub quibus spiritualia,
                                revelantur. Ergo intelligere quod animae
                                competit secundum superiorem faciem, a corpore
                                dependet; et sic nullo modo intelligere in anima
                                post mortem manet.

                                2. It was said that the Philosopher is speaking
                                of the act of understanding which befits the
                                soul in its lower aspect, but not about the act
                                which befits it in its higher aspect.—On the
                                contrary, the higher aspect of the soul is that
                                according to which it turns to the things of
                                God. However, even when man understands
                                something by reason of divine revelation, his
                                understanding depends on the body, because he
                                must understand through conversion to phantasms,
                                which are in a bodily organ. For, as Dionysius
                                says: “It is impossible for the divine radiance
                                to shine on us unless it is shrouded with a
                                variety of sacred veils. For him, veils are the
                                bodily forms under which spiritual things are
                                revealed. Therefore, the act of understanding
                                which belongs to the soul according to its
                                higher aspect depends on the body. Consequently,
                                understanding in no way remains in the soul
                                after death.

                                    post mortem vel nihil cognoscat, si ly
                                    amplius temporaliter sumatur, vel quod

                                    3. In Ecclesiastes (9:5) it is said: “For
                                    the living know that they shall die, but the
                                    dead know nothing more.” The Gloss reads:
                                    “For they make no more progress.”Therefore,
                                    it seems that after death the soul either
                                    knows nothing, if we take “more” in a
                                    temporal sense, or at least that it can
                                    understand nothing it did not understand
                                    before. For it thus would make more
                                    progress, which is contrary to the Gloss.

                                        de anima, sicut se habet sensus ad
                                        sensibilia, ita se habet anima
                                        intellectiva ad phantasmata. Sed sensus
                                        nihil potest sentire nisi sensibilia ei
                                        praesententur. Ergo nec anima humana
                                        aliquid potest intelligere nisi
                                        praesententur ei phantasmata. Sed
                                        phantasmata non praesentabuntur ei post
                                        mortem; quia illa non praesentantur nisi
                                        in aliquo organo corporali. Ergo anima
                                        post mortem non potest intelligere.

                                        4. According to the Philosopher, the
                                        understanding is related to phantasms as
                                        the senses are to sensible things. But
                                        sense can have sensation only when
                                        sensible things are presented to it.
                                        Therefore, neither can the human soul
                                        understand anything unless phantasms are
                                        presented to it. But they are not
                                        presented to it after death, because
                                        they are presented only in a bodily
                                        organ. Therefore, after death the soul
                                        cannot understand.

                                            loquitur de anima secundum statum
                                            quo est in corpore.- Sed contra:
                                            obiectum determinatur potentiae
                                            secundum naturam ipsius potentiae.
                                            Sed eadem est natura animae
                                            intellectivae ante mortem et post.
                                            Ergo, si anima intellectiva ante
                                            mortem ordinatur ad phantasmata

                                            post mortem similiter; et sic idem
                                            quod prius.

                                            5. It was said that the Philosopher
                                            is speaking of the soul according to
                                            the state in which it is in the
                                            body.—On the contrary, the object of
                                            a power is determined by the nature
                                            of the power itself. But the nature
                                            of the intellective soul is the same
                                            before and after death. Therefore,
                                            if the intellective soul has an
                                            ordination to phantasms as objects
                                            before death, it seems that it will
                                            likewise have it after death. We
                                            conclude as before.

                                                its union with the body. For, if
                                                it were not united to the body,
                                                it would not have these powers,

                                                    Therefore, there will be no

                                                        are in it by reason of
                                                        its union with the body.
                                                        And this union ceases

                          concreatas, aut per species acquisitas. Non autem per
                          acquisitas, quia in intellectiva parte animae non
                          recipiuntur species singulares, sed universales; et
                          hoc solum animae genus separatur a corpore, sicut
                          perpetuum a corruptibili, secundum philosophum.
                          Similiter nec per species concreatas, quia cum
                          singularia sint infinita, oporteret ponere infinitas
                          species ei esse concreatas, quod est impossibile. Ergo
                          anima separata singularia non cognoscit.

                          1. If it knows singulars, it knows them either through
                          species created with the soul, or through species it
                          has acquired. But it does not know them through
                          species which it has acquired, because the species
                          received in the intellective part of the soul are not
                          singular but universal. And it is only this part of
                          the soul which is separated from the body, “as the
                          perpetual from the corruptible,” according to the
                          Philosopher. Similarly, it does not know them through
                          species created with the soul, for, since singulars
                          are countless, there would have to be an infinite
                          number of species created with the soul. But this is
                          impossible. Therefore, the separated soul does not
                          know singulars.

                              species universalis est indistincta; cognitio

                              universal species. —On the contrary, an indistinct
                              species cannot be the source of distinct
                              knowledge. But the universal species is
                              indistinct, and knowledge of singulars is
                              distinct. Therefore, separated souls cannot know
                              singulars through universal species.

                                  3. It was said that the separated soul
                                  conforms itself to the singular when the
                                  singular is present to it and thus knows the
                                  singular.—On the contrary, when the singular
                                  thing is present to the soul, either something
                                  passes over from the singular into the soul,
                                  or nothing passes over. If something passes
                                  over, the separated soul receives something
                                  from singulars, which seems unfitting, but, if
                                  nothing passes over, the species existing in
                                  the soul remain general, and, so, nothing
                                  singular can be known through them.

                                      4. Nothing which is in potency reduces
                                      itself from potency to act. But the
                                      cognoscitive soul is in potency to things
                                      which can be known. Therefore, it cannot
                                      reduce itself to act, and so conform
                                      itself to them. Consequently, it seems
                                      that the separated soul does not know
                                      singulars when they are present to it.

                                              living. There fore, the separated
