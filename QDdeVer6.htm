              Quia, ut dicit Augustinus in Lib. de praedestinatione sanctorum,
              praedestinatio est propositum miserendi. Sed propositum est
              voluntatis. Ergo et praedestinatio.

              1. As Augustine says,’ predestination is the intention of being
              merciful. But intention belongs to the will. Consequently,
              predestination also belongs to the will.

              Praeterea, praedestinatio videtur idem esse cum electione aeterna,
              de qua dicitur Ephes., I, 4: elegit nos in ipso ante mundi
              constitutionem, quia idem dicuntur electi et praedestinati. Sed
              electio, secundum philosophum in VI et X Ethicorum, magis est
              appetitus quam intellectus. Ergo et praedestinatio magis ad
              voluntatem, quam ad scientiam pertinet.

              2. Predestination seems to be the same as the eternal election
              referred to in the Epistle to the Ephesians (1:4): “He chose us in
              him before the foundation of the world”—because the chosen are the
              same as the predestinated. Now, according to the Philosopher,
              choice belongs rather to appetite than to intellect. Hence,
              predestination belongs more to the will than to knowledge.

              Sed dicebat, quod electio praedestinationem praecedit, nec est
              idem ei.- Sed contra, voluntas sequitur scientiam, et non

              praedestinationem praecedit, praedestinatio non potest ad
              scientiam pertinere.

              3. But it was said that election comes before predestination and
              is not the same as it.—On the contrary, will comes after
              knowledge, not before it. But choice pertains to the will. If,
              therefore, choice comes before predestination, then predestination
              cannot belong to knowledge.

              praesciret salutem alicuius, praedestinaret illum. Sed hoc est
              falsum. Prophetae enim praesciverunt salutem gentium, quam non

              4. If predestination belonged to knowledge, then it would seem to
              be the same as foreknowledge; and thus whoever foreknew the
              salvation of a person would predestine him. Now, this is false;
              for the prophets foreknew the salvation of the Gentiles; yet they
              did not predestine it. Therefore.

              5. Predestination implies causality. Now, causality does not have
              the nature of knowledge, but rather the nature of will.
              Consequently, predestination belongs more to the will than to
              knowledge.

              Praeterea, voluntas in hoc a potentia differt quod potentia
              effectus respicit tantum in futuro (non enim est potentia respectu
              eorum quae sunt vel fuerunt), voluntas vero respicit aequaliter
              effectum praesentem et futurum. Sed praedestinatio habet effectum
              in praesenti et in futuro; unde et ab Augustino dicitur, quod
              praedestinatio est praeparatio gratiae in praesenti, et gloriae in
              futuro. Ergo praedestinatio ad voluntatem pertinet.

              6. The will differs from a passive potency in this respect, that
              the latter refers only to effects taking place in the future, for
              we, cannot speak of passive potency in relation to things that are
              or have been, whereas the will extends equally to both present and
              future effects. Now, predestination has both present and future
              effects; for, as Augustine says: “Predestination is the
              preparation of grace in the present and of glory in the future.”
              Therefore, it belongs to the will.

              7. Knowledge is not related to things in so far as they are made
              or to be made but in so far as they are known or to be known. Now,
              predestination is related to a thing as something that must be
              effected. Consequently, it does not belong to knowledge.

              Praeterea, effectus magis denominatur a causa proxima quam a causa

              est causa prior et remotior quam voluntas. Ergo praeparatio magis
              pertinet ad voluntatem quam ad scientiam. Sed praedestinatio est
              praeparatio alicuius ad gloriam, ut Augustinus dicit. Ergo et

              8. An effect receives its name from its proximate cause rather
              than from its remote cause. For example, we say that a man is
              begotten by a man, instead of saying by the sun, which also begets
              him. Now, preparation is the effect of both knowledge and will,
              but knowledge is prior to the will and more remote than it.
              Consequently, preparation belongs more to the will than to
              knowledge. But, as Augustine says: “Predestination is the
              preparation of someone for glory.” Therefore, predestination
              pertains rather to the will than to knowledge.

              Praeterea, quando multi motus ordinantur ad unum terminum, tota

              ad aliquid praeparandum ordinatur primo motus scientiae et
              deinceps motus voluntatis. Ergo totum debet voluntati attribui; et

              9. When many motions are ordered to only one term, then the entire
              co-ordinated complex of motions takes the name of the last motion.
              For example, in the drawing out of a substantial form from the
              potency of matter, the following order is had: first, alteration,
              then generation. But the whole is called generation. Now, when
              something is prepared, this order is had: first, movements of
              knowledge, then movements of the will. Consequently, the whole
              should be attributed to the will; therefore, predestination seems
              to be especially in the will.

              10. If he of two contraries is appropriated to something, then the
              other contrary is removed from it in the highest possible degree.
              Now, evil is appropriated especially to God’s foreknowledge, for
              we say that the damned are known beforehand. Consequently, His
              foreknowledge does not have good things as its object.
              Predestination, however, is concerned only with those good things
              that lead to salvation. Therefore, predestination is not related
              to foreknowledge.

              Praeterea, illud quod proprie dicitur, glosatione non indiget. Sed

              glossatur pro approbatione, ut patet in I Cor., cap. VIII, 3: si
              quis diligit Deum, hic cognitus est ab eo id est approbatus: et II
              Tim. II, 19: novit dominus qui sunt eius, id est approbat. Ergo

              11. When a word is used in its proper sense, it does not need a
              gloss. But; whenever the sacred Scripture speaks of knowledge of
              good, a gloss is added saying that this means approval. This is
              evident from the Gloss on the first Epistle to the Corinthians
              (8:3): “‘If any man love God, the same is known by him’—that is,
              he is approved by God”; and from the Gloss on the second Epistle
              to Timothy (2:19): “‘The Lord knows who are his’—that is, God
              approves him.” In its proper sense, therefore, knowledge is not
              related to good things. But predestination is related to good
              things. Therefore.

              will, not to knowledge. Consequently, divine preparation is
              similar; and the conclusion is the same as before.

              Consequently, something said of God should be reduced to that
              attribute to which this effect is appropriated. Now, grace and
              glory are the effects of predestination, and they are appropriated
              either to His will or His goodness. Therefore, predestination also
              belongs to His will, not to His knowledge.

              1. The Gloss on the Epistle to the Romans (8:29), “For whom he

              Now, the element of knowledge always belongs to predestination,
              because foreknowledge always accompanies it. The granting of
              grace, however, which takes place through the will, does not
              always accompany predestination, since predestination is eternal
              while the bestowal of grace takes place in time. Predestination,
              therefore, should be placed in the genus of knowledge rather than
              in that of will acts.

              4. The Philosopher places habits of knowing and doing among the
              intellectual virtues, for they belong more to reason than to
              appetite. This is clearly what he does in the case of art and
              prudence, as can be seen in his
              <i>Ethics.”</i>
              Now, predestination implies a principle of doing and of knowing,
              since, as is evident from the definition given, predestination is
              both foreknowledge and preparation. Predestination, therefore,
              belongs more to knowledge than it does to the will.

              an end, we are said to destine what we decide. For example,
              Eleazar (2 Maccabees 6:19) is said to have “destined” in his heart
              not to do “any unlawful things for the love of life.”

              predestination is placed under providence as one of its parts,
              namely, because direction to an end, as pointed out in the
              preceding question,” pertains to providence, and because
              providence—even according to Cicero—includes a relation to the
              future. In fact, some define providence by saying that it is
              present knowledge bearing upon future event.

              Sed tamen praedestinatio quantum ad duo a providentia differt:

              Differt etiam alio modo. In qualibet enim ordinatione ad finem est

              ordinis: non enim omnia quae ad finem ordinantur, finem

              ordinantur. Sed praedestinatio respicit etiam exitum vel eventum

              igitur se habet providentia ad impositionem ordinis, ita se habet

              On the other hand, predestination differs from providence in two
              respects. Providence means a general ordering to an end.
              Consequently, it extends to all things, rational or irrational,
              good or bad, that have been ordained by God to an end.
              Predestination, however, is concerned only with that end which is
              possible for a rational creature, namely, his eternal glory.
              Consequently, it concerns only men, and only with reference to
              those things that are related to salvation. Moreover,
              predestination differs from providence in a second respect. In any
              ordering to an end, two things must be considered: the ordering
              itself, and the outcome or result of the ordering, for not
              everything that is ordered to an end reaches that end. Providence,
              therefore, is concerned only with the ordering to the end.
              Consequently, by God’s providence, all men are ordained to
              beatitude. But predestination is also concerned with the outcome
              or result of this ordering, and, therefore, it is related only to
              those who will attain heavenly glory. Hence, providence, is
              related to the initial establishment of an order, and
              predestination is related to its outcome or result; for the fact
              that some attain the end that is eternal glory is not due
              primarily to their own power but to the help of grace given by
              God.

              Unde, sicut de providentia, supra dictum est, quod consistit in

              rationis est dirigere vel ordinare; ita etiam et praedestinatio in

              Therefore, just as we said above that providence consists in an
              act of reason, like prudence, of which it is a part, because it
              belongs to reason alone to direct and to ordain, so now we say
              that predestination also consists in an act of reason, directing
              or ordering to an end. However, the willing of an end is required
              before there can be direction to an end, because no one directs
              anything to an end which he does not will. This is why the
              Philosopher says that a perfect prudential choice can be made only
              by a man of good moral character, because moral habits strengthen
              one’s affections for the end which prudence dictates. Now, the one
              who predestines does not consider in a general way the end to
              which his predestination directs him; he considers it, rather,
              according to the relation it has to one who attains it, and such a
              person must be distinct in the mind of the one predestining from
              those persons who will not achieve this end. Consequently,
              predestination presupposes a love by which God wills the salvation
              of a person. Hence, just as a prudent man directs to an end only
              in so far as he is temperate or just, so God predestines only in
              so far as He loves.

              incitare: quia cum nondum nati essent aut aliquid boni egissent

              praesupponit electionem et dilectionem; electio vero dilectionem.
              Ad praedestinationem vero duo sequuntur: scilicet consecutio
              finis, quod est glorificatio, et collatio auxilii ad consequendum
              finem, quod est appositio gratiae, quae ad vocationem pertinet;
              unde et praedestinationi duo effectus assignantur, scilicet gratia
              et gloria.
            </td>
            <td>
              Another prerequisite of predestination is the choice by which he
              who is directed to the end infallibly is separated from others who
              are not ordained to it in the same manner. This separation,
              however, is not on account of any difference, found in the
              predestined, which could arouse God’s love; for, as we read in the
              Epistle to the Romans (9:11-13): “When the children were not yet
              born nor had done any good or evil... it was said... ‘Jacob I have
              loved, but Esau I have hated.’” Consequently, predestination
              presupposes election and love, and election presupposes love.
              Again, two things follow upon predestination: the attainment of
              the end, which is glory, and the granting of help to attain this
              end, namely, the bestowal of the grace that pertains to the call
              to be among the predestined. Predestination, therefore, has two
              effects: grace and glory.

              inconsistency in election’s coming before predestination, which
              implies the existence of direction. As election is taken here,
              however, it pertains to one who is directed to an end; and the
              acceptance of one who is to be directed toward an end comes before
              the direction itself. In the case stated, therefore, election

              4. Even though predestination is placed under the genus of
              knowledge, it adds something to knowledge and foreknowledge,
              namely, direction or an order to an end. In this respect, it
              resembles prudence, which also adds something to the notion of
              knowledge. Consequently, just as every person who knows what to do
              is not thereby prudent, so also not every one who has
              foreknowledge thereby predestines.

              8. In its proper sense, preparation implies a disposing of a
              potency for act. There are, however, two kinds of potencies:
              active and passive; consequently, there are two kinds of
              preparations, There is a preparation of the recipient, which we
              speak of when we say that matter is prepared for a form. Then
              there is a preparation of the agent, which we speak of when we say
              that someone is preparing himself in order to do something. It is
              this latter kind of preparation that predestination implies; for
              it asserts simply this, that in God there exists the ordering of
              some person to an end. Now, the proximate principle of ordering is
              reason, and, as is clear from above, its remote principle is will.
              Consequently, for the reason given in the difficulty,
              predestination is attributed more to reason than to will.

              14. When treating a divine attribute, we should not consider only
              its effect but also its relation to the effect; for, while the
              effects of knowledge, power, and will are the same, still, as the
              names of these attributes imply, their relations to them are not.
              Now, in so far as predestination is directive, the relation
              implied by predestination to its effect is more logically said to
              be a relation of knowledge than a relation of power or will.
              Consequently, predestination is reduced to a type of knowledge.

              election, for He who chooses accepts one and rejects another and
              this is called reprobation. Consequently, as the word itself
              shows,
              <i>reprobation</i>
              pertains more to the will. For to reprobate is, as it were, to
              reject—except that it might be said that to reprobate means the
              same as to judge unworthy of admittance. However, reprobation is
              said to belong to God’s foreknowledge for this reason, that there
              is nothing positive on the part of His will that has any relation
              to sin. He does not will sin as He wills grace. Yet reprobation is
              said to be a preparation of the punishment which God wills
              consequent to sin—not antecedent to it.

              Quia Rom., IX 15, super illud, miserebor cui misereor etc., dicit

              errorem toto corde reversurum ad me. Hoc est dare illi cui dandum
              est et non dare illi cui dandum non est; ut eum vocet quem sciat
              obedire, illum vero non quem sciat non obedire. Sed obedire et
              toto corde ad dominum reverti ad meritum pertinet; contraria vero
              ad demeritum. Ergo praescientia meriti vel demeriti est causa
              quare Deus proponat alicui misericordiam facere vel aliquem a
              misericordia excludere; quod est praedestinare vel reprobare.

              1. In his gloss on the verse in Romans (9:15), “I will have mercy
              on whom I will have mercy,” Ambrose writes as follows: “I will
              give mercy to him who I know will return with his whole heart to
              Me after his error. This is to give mercy to him to whom it should
              be given, and not to give it to one to whom it should not.
              Consequently, He calls him who He knows will obey, not him who He
              knows will disobey.”’ Now, to obey and to return to God with all
              one’s heart are meritorious; the opposite actions are
              demeritorious. Foreknowledge of merit or of demerit is therefore
              the cause of God’s intention of being merciful to some and of
              excluding others from His mercy. This is equivalent to
              predestination and reprobation.

              said that it includes only His antecedent will, because, according
              to this will—as is said in the first Epistle to Timothy (2:4):
              “God wills all men to be saved”; hence, it would follow that all
              are predestined. It remains, therefore, that predestination
              includes only His consequent will. Now, “We are the cause,” as
              Damascene says, “of God’s consequent will,” according as we merit
              salvation or deserve damnation. Our merits foreknown by God are
              therefore the cause of predestination.

              3. Predestination means primarily God’s will with respect to man’s
              salvation. But men’s merits are the cause of their salvation.
              Moreover, knowledge causes and specifies the act of the will,
              since that which moves the will is a desirable thing which is
              known. Consequently, foreknowledge of merits is a cause of
              predestination, since two of the things which foreknowledge
              contains cause the two things contained in predestination.

              7. Concerning the passage in Numbers (3:12), “1 took Levites...,”

              firstborn. Because what they intended to do was in their hearts,
              and this was clear to God before they were born or did any good or
              evil, It was said of them:‘Jacob have I loved, Esau have I
              hated.’” Now, this love, the saints commonly explain, pertains to
              Jacob’s predestination. Consequently, God’s foreknowledge of the
              intention Jacob was going to have in his heart was the reason for

              8. Predestination cannot be unjust, since the ways of the Lord are
              always the ways of mercy and truth. Nor can there be any form of
              justice between God and men other than distributive justice. There
              is no place for commutative justice, since God, who needs none of
              our good things, receives nothing from us. Now, distributive
              justice rewards unequally only those that are unequal. But the
              only cause of inequality among men is difference in merit.
              Therefore, the reason why God predestines one man and not another
              is that He foreknows their different merits.

              “the will of God,” by which He chose one and rejected the other

              hidden merits can enter into an intention only in so far as they

              died without grace. Moreover, the fact that he did not have grace
              when he died was not due to God’s unwillingness to give it but to
              his unwillingness to accept it—as both Anselm and Dionysius point

              4. If foreknowledge of merits were the cause of predestination,
              then no one would be predestined who did not merit. But some
              predestined never merit, as is evidently the case of children.
              Consequently, foreknowledge of merits is not the cause of
              predestination.

              Now, we must distinguish two aspects of predestination, the
              eternal predestination itself and its twofold temporal effect,
              grace and glory. Glory has human acts as its meritorious cause,
              but grace cannot have human acts as its meritorious cause; human
              acts can act only as a certain material disposition to grace,
              inasmuch as through these acts men are prepared for the acceptance
              of it. It does not follow from this, however, that our acts,
              whether they precede or follow grace, are the cause of
              predestination.

              Now, to discover the cause of predestination we must recall what
              we have said previously, namely, that predestination is a certain
              direction to an end, and this direction is brought about by
              reason, moved by the will. Consequently, a thing can be the cause
              of predestination if it can move the will. However, a thing can
              move the will in two ways, first, as something due, secondly, as
              something not due. Now, as something due, a thing can move the
              will in two ways, namely, either absolutely or on the supposition
              of something else. The ultimate end, which is the object of the
              will, moves absolutely; and it moves the will in such a fashion
              that the will cannot turn away from it. For example, as Augustine
              says, no man is capable of not willing to be happy. But that
              without which an end cannot be had is said to move as something
              due “on the supposition of something else.” If an end can be had,
              however, without a certain thing which contributes merely to the
              well-being of the end, then that thing does not move the will as
              something due. In this case, the will inclines to it freely; but
              when the will is already inclined to it freely, the will is
              thereby inclined to all the things without which it cannot be had,
              as to things that are due on the supposition of that which was
              first willed. For example, out of liberality a king makes a person
              a soldier; but, because one cannot be a soldier without a horse,
              on the supposition of the afore-mentioned liberality, giving the
              soldier a horse becomes due and necessary.

              Now, the end-object of the divine will is God’s own goodness,
              which does not depend on anything else. God needs nothing to help
              Him possess it. Consequently, His will is inclined first to make
              something freely, not something due, inasmuch as it is His
              goodness that is manifested in His works. But, supposing that God
              wishes to make something, it follows as something due from the
              supposition of His liberality that He make those things also
              without which those that He has first willed cannot be had. For
              example, if He wills to make a man, He must give him an intellect.
              But if there is anything which is not necessary for that which God
              wills, then that thing comes from God, not as something due, but
              simply as a result of His generosity. Now, the perfection of grace
              and glory are goods of this kind, because nature can exist without
              them inasmuch as they surpass the limits of natural powers.
              Consequently, the fact that God wishes to give grace and glory is
              due simply to His generosity. The reason for His willing these
              things that arise simply from His generosity is the overflowing
              love of His will for His end-object, in which the perfection of
              His goodness is found. The cause of predestination, therefore, is
              nothing other than God’s goodness.

              According to these principles, a solution can be found to the
              controversy that has been taking place between certain groups.
              Some have asserted that everything comes from God’s simple
              pleasure, while others say that everything which comes from God is
              due. Both opinions are false. The former ignores the necessary
              order that exists between the things God causes, and the latter
              asserts that everything arises from God because of a natural
              necessity. A middle course must therefore be chosen so that it may
              be laid down that those things which are first willed by God come
              from His simple pleasure, but those that are required for this
              first class of things come as something due, although on the basis
              of a supposition. This “debt” does not, however, make God obliged
              to things but only to His own will; for what is said to come from
              God as something due is due simply in order that His will be
              fulfilled.

              return to me with his whole heart,” cannot be understood as
              meaning that a perfect change of heart inclines God’s will to give
              grace but that His will ordains that the grace given be accepted
              by the person and that he be turned completely toward God.

              capable of receiving. But this is not required for superabundant
              perfections such as grace and glory. Hence, the argument proves

              7. God’s foreknowledge of what lay in the heart of Jacob was not
              the reason for His willing to give grace to him. Instead, the
              intention in Jacob’s heart was a good for which God ordained the
              grace to be given to him. It is for this reason that God is said
              to have loved him “because his heart’s intention was known by
              Him.” For God loved him in order that he might have such an
              intention in his heart or because He foresaw that his heart’s
              intention was a disposition for the acceptance of grace.

              for reprobation [in the present] is the fact of original sin in
              man—for reprobation in the future, the fact that mere existence
              gives man no claim to grace. For I can reasonably deny something
              to a person if it is not due to him.

              1. No cause whose effects can vary can be certain of its effects.
              But the effects of predestination can vary, for one who is
              predestined may not attain the effect of his predestination. This
              is clear from the commentary of Augustine on the words of the
              Apocalypse (3:1 1), “Hold fast that which thou hast, that no man
              take...” in which he says: “If one person will not receive glory
              unless another loses it, then the number of the elect is
              certain.”’ Now, from this it seems that one could lose and another
              receive the crown of glory, which is the effect of predestination.

              natural effects that are produced necessarily by their causes

              contingently from its proximate causes, it seems that the ordering
              of predestination is not certain.

              3. If a cause has certitude with respect to some effect, that
              effect will necessarily follow unless there is something that can
              resist the power of the agent. For example, dispositions in bodies
              here below are sometimes found to resist the action of celestial
              bodies; and, as a consequence, these celestial bodies do not
              produce their characteristic effects, which they would produce
              were there not something resisting them. But nothing can resist
              divine predestination, because, as we read in the Epistle to the
              Romans (9:19): “Who resists his will?” Therefore, if divine
              predestination is ordered with certitude to its effect, its effect
              will necessarily be produced.

              4. The answer was given that the certitude which predestination
              has of its effect presupposes the second cause.—On the contrary,
              any certitude based on the supposition of something is not
              absolute but conditional certitude. For example, it is not certain
              that the sun will cause a plant to bear fruit unless the
              generative power of the plant is in a favorable condition; and,
              because of this, the certitude of the sun’s producing this effect
              presupposes the power of the plant as though the latter were a
              second cause. Consequently, if the certitude of divine
              predestination includes the presupposition of a second cause, that
              certitude will not be absolute but merely conditional—like the
              certitude I have that Socrates is moving if he runs, and that he
              will be saved if he prepares himself. Therefore, God will have no
              more certitude about those who are to be saved than I have. But
              this is absurd.

              7. Sometimes one who is predestined is in mortal sin. This was
              clearly true of Paul when he was persecuting the Church. Now, he
              can stay in mortal sin until death or be killed immediately. If
              either happens, predestination will not obtain its effect.
              Therefore, it is possible for predestination not to obtain its
              effect.

              8. But it was said that, when it is stated that one predestined
              may possibly die in the state of sin, the proposition is taken
              compositely and so is false; for its subject is taken as
              simultaneously having the determination
              <i>predestined.</i> But if its subject is taken without this
              determination, then the proposition is taken in a divided sense
              and is true. —On the contrary, with those forms which cannot be
              removed from the subject, it does not matter whether a thing is
              attributed to the subject with those qualifying determinations or
              without them. For example, taken either way, the following
              proposition is false: “A black crow can be white.” Now,
              predestination is the kind of form that cannot be removed from the
              one predestined. In the matter at hand, therefore, there is no
              room for the afore-mentioned distinction.

              There are two kinds of certitude: certitude of knowledge and
              certitude of ordination. Now, certitude of knowledge is had when
              one’s knowledge does not deviate in any way from reality, and,
              consequently, when it judges about a thing as it is. But because a
              judgment which will be certain about a thing is had especially
              from its causes, the word
              <i>certitude</i>
              has been transferred to the relation that a cause has to its
              effect; therefore, the relation of a cause to an effect is said to
              be certain when the cause infallibly produces its effect.
              Consequently, since God’s foreknowledge does not imply, in all
              cases, a relation of a cause to all the things which are its
              objects, it is considered to have only the certitude of knowledge.
              But His predestination adds another element, because it includes
              not only His foreknowledge but also the relation of a cause to its
              objects, since predestination is a kind of direction or
              preparation. Thus, not only the certitude of knowledge, but also
              the certitude of ordination is contained in predestination. Now we
              are concerned only with the certitude of predestination; the
              certitude of knowledge, found also in predestination, has been
              explained in our investigation of God’s knowledge.

              It should be known that, since predestination is a particular type
              of providence, not only its notion adds something to providence,
              but also its certitude adds something to the certitude of
              providence. Now, the ordering of providence is found to be certain
              in two respects. First, it is certain with relation to a
              particular thing, when God’s providence ordains things to some
              particular end, and they attain that end without failure. This is
              evident in the motions of celestial spheres and in all things in
              nature that act necessarily. Second, providence is certain in
              relation to things in general, but not in particular. For example,
              we see that the power of beings capable of generation and
              corruption sometimes falls short of the proper effects to which it
              has been ordered as its proper ends. Thus, the power that shapes
              bodies sometimes falls short of forming members completely. Yet,
              as we saw above when treating providence, these very defects are
              directed by God to some end. Consequently, nothing can fail to
              attain the general end of providence, even though it may at times
              fall short of a particular end.

              and determinate end. For one who is ordained to salvation by
              predestination never fails to obtain it. Moreover, the ordering of
              predestination is not certain with reference to a particular end
              in the way in which the ordering of providence is; for, in
              providence, the ordering is not certain with respect to a
              particular end unless the proximate cause necessarily produces its
              effect. In predestination, however, there is certitude with
              respect to an individual end even though the proximate cause, free
              choice, does not produce that effect except in a contingent
              manner.

              Hence, it seems difficult to reconcile the infallibility of
              predestination with freedom of choice; for we cannot say that
              predestination adds nothing to the certitude of providence except
              the certitude of foreknowledge, because this would be to say that
              God orders one who is predestined to his salvation as He orders
              any other person, with this difference, that, in the case of the
              predestined, God knows he will not fail to be saved. According to
              this position, one predestined would not differ in ordination from
              one not predestined; he would differ only with respect to [God’s]
              foreknowledge of the outcome. Consequently, foreknowledge would be
              the cause of predestination, and predestination would not take
              place by the choice of Him who predestines. This, however, is
              contrary to the authority of the Scriptures” and the sayings of
              the saints. Thus, the ordering of predestination has an infallible
              certitude of its own—over and above the certitude of
              foreknowledge. Nevertheless, the proximate cause of salvation,
              free choice, is related to predestination contingently, not
              necessarily.

              This can be considered in the following manner. We find that an
              ordering is infallible in regard to something in two ways. First,
              an individual cause necessarily brings about its own effect
              because of the ordering of divine providence. Secondly, a single
              effect may be attained only as the result of the convergence of
              many contingent causes individually capable of failure; but each
              one of these causes has been ordained by God either to bring about
              that effect itself if another cause should fail or to prevent that
              other cause from failing. We see, for example, that all the
              individual members of a species are corruptible. Yet, from the
              fact that one succeeds another, the nature of the species can be
              kept in existence; and this is how God keeps the species from
              extinction, despite the fact that the individual perishes.

              A similar case is had in predestination; for, even though free
              choice can fail with respect to salvation, God prepares so many
              other helps for one who is predestined that he either does not
              fall at all or, if he does fall, he rises again. The helps that
              God gives a man to enable him to gain salvation are exhortations,
              the support of prayer, the gift of grace, and all similar things.
              Consequently, if we were to consider salvation only in relation to
              its proximate cause, free choice, salvation would not be certain
              but contingent; however, in relation to the first cause, namely,
              predestination, salvation is certain.

              1. The word crown as used in the Apocalypse (3:11) may mean either
              the crown of present justice or the crown of future glory. No
              matter which meaning is taken, however, one person is said to
              receive the crown of another when that other person falls in the
              sense that the goods of one person help another, either by aiding
              him to merit or even by increasing his glory. The reason for this
              is that all the members of the Church are connected by charity in
              such a way that their goods are common. Consequently, one receives
              the crown of another when that other falls through sin and does
              not achieve the reward of his merits; and another person receives
              the fruits of the sinner’s merits, just as he would have benefited
              from the sinner’s merits had the latter persevered. From this,
              however, it does not follow that predestination is ever in vain.

              3. A celestial body, taken in itself, imposes a kind of
              determinism in its action on bodies here below. Consequently, its
              effect necessarily takes place, unless something resists it. But
              God does not act on the will in the manner of one necessitating;
              for He does not force the will but merely moves it, without taking
              away its own proper mode, which consists in being free with
              respect to opposites. Consequently, even though nothing can resist
              the divine will, our will, like everything else, carries out the
              divine will according to its own proper mode. Indeed, the divine
              will has given things their mode of being in order that His will
              be fulfilled. Therefore, some things fulfill the divine will
              necessarily, other things, contingently; but that which God wills
              always takes place.

              6. The comparison Anselm makes holds good in this respect, that

              predestination [does not take away the contingency of
              predestination]. But, in another respect, the comparison is weak.
              For a proposition about the future is related to the future in so
              far as it is future, and, under this aspect, it cannot be certain.
              As we pointed out previously, however, the truth of predestination

              8. Blackness and whiteness are, in a sense, examples of forms that
              exist in a subject said to be white or black. Consequently,
              nothing can be attributed to the subject, either according to
              potency or according to act, as long as blackness remains, if it
              is repugnant to this form of blackness. Predestination, however,
              is a form that exists, not in the person predestined, but in the
              one predestining, just as the
              <i>known</i>
              gets its, name from knowledge in the knower. Consequently, no
              matter how fixed predestination may remain in the order of
              knowledge, yet, if we consider only the nature [of the
              predestined], we can attribute something to it which is repugnant
              to the ordering of predestination. For, considered this way,
              predestination is something other than the man who is said to be
              predestined, just as blackness is something other than the essence
              of a crow, even though it is not something outside the crow, but,
              by considering only the essence of a crow, one can attribute to it
              something that is repugnant to its blackness. For this reason, as
              Porphyry says, one can think of a white crow. Similarly, in the
              problem being discussed, one can attribute something to a
              predestined person taken in himself which cannot be attributed to
              him in so far as he is predestined.

              converso, quia mutabilis esse non potest; et ita non sequitur quod

              10. Absolutely speaking, it is possible for God to predestine or
              not to predestine each and every person, and it is possible for
              Him to have predestined or not to have predestined. For, since the
              act of predestination is measured by eternity, it never is past
              and never is future. Consequently, it is always considered as
              issuing from His will as something free. Because of the
              supposition, however, certain things are impossible: He cannot
              predestine if He has predestined, and He cannot predestine if He
              has already not predestined—for God does not change. Hence, it
              does not follow that predestination can change.

              1. No number is certain if something can be added to it. But
              something can be added to the number of the predestined, because
              Moses’ petition for such an increase is described in Deuteronomy
              (1:11) where he says: “The Lord God of your fathers add to this
              number many thousands.” And the Gloss comments: “This number is
              fixed by God, who knows who belong to Him.” Now, unless such an
              addition were possible, Moses would have asked in vain.
              Consequently, the number of the predestined is not certain.

              2. As we are prepared for grace through the disposition of natural
              perfections, so are we prepared through grace for the attainment
              of glory. Now, grace is found in whomsoever there is sufficient
              preparation of natural gifts. Similarly, then, glory will be found
              wherever grace is found. But one not predestined may, at one time,
              possess grace. Therefore, he will possess glory and so be
              predestined. Consequently, one not predestined may become
              predestined. In this way, the number of the predestined can be
              increased; hence, it is not certain.

              3. If one who has grace is not to have glory, his loss of glory
              will be due to a failure either on the part of grace or on the
              part of the one giving glory. However, this loss cannot be due to
              a failure on the part of grace, for, in itself, it sufficiently
              disposes for glory; nor can it be due to a failure on the part of
              the one giving glory, for, on His part, He is ready to give it to
              all. Consequently, whoever has grace will necessarily have glory.
              Thus, one who is foreknown [as lost] will have glory and be
              predestined. Accordingly, our original argument stands.

              beginning and an end, and which is without succession, is not

              Treating this question, some have distinguished, saying that the
              number of the predestined is certain if we mean number understood
              actively or formally, but not certain if we mean number understood
              passively or materially. For example, one could say that it is
              certain that one hundred have been predestined, but it is not
              certain who these one hundred are. The occasion for such a
              position seems to be the words of Augustine mentioned previously.
              Augustine seems to imply that one can lose and another receive the
              predestined crown without the number of the predestined at all
              varying. But, if those holding this opinion are speaking about
              certitude of predestination in its relation to the first cause,
              that is, to God who predestines, then the opinion is entirely
              absurd, because God Himself has definite knowledge of the number
              of the predestined, whether the number be taken formally or
              materially. He knows exactly how many and who are to be saved,
              and, with respect to both, His ordination is infallible.
              Consequently, with respect to both numbers, God has certitude, not
              only of knowledge, but also of ordination.

              On the other hand, if we are speaking about the certitude that can
              be had about the number of the predestined from its relation to
              the proximate cause of man’s salvation (to which predestination is
              ordained), then our judgment about the formal number and the
              material number will not be the same. For, since the salvation of
              each individual has been produced through free choice as through
              its proximate cause, in some way the material number is subject to
              man’s will, which is changeable. Consequently, the material number
              in some way lacks certainty. But the formal number is not
              determined in any manner by man’s will, because by no kind of
              causality does the human will affect the number of the predestined
              taken as a whole. Consequently, the formal number remains
              completely certain. In this way the aforementioned distinction can
              be sustained, as long as we concede, without any qualifications,
              that both numbers are certain as far as God is concerned.

              It should be noted, moreover, that the number of the predestined
              is certain in this respect, that it cannot be increased or
              diminished. The number could be increased if one who was foreknown
              [as lost] could be predestined; but this would be contrary to the
              certainty of foreknowledge or of reprobation. Again, the number
              could be diminished if it were possible for one who is predestined
              to become non-predestined; but this would be contrary to the
              certainty of predestination. Thus, it is clear that the certitude
              about the number of the predestined is made up of two certitudes,
              the certitude of predestination and the certitude of foreknowledge
              or reprobation. These two certitudes differ, however; for, as has
              been said, the certitude of predestination is the certitude of
              knowledge and of direction to an end, while the certitude of
              foreknowledge is merely the certitude of knowledge. For God does
              not preordain the reprobate to sin as He ordains the predestined
              to merit.

              1. That quotation from Deuteronomy should be understood as
              referring, not to the number of the predestined, but to the number
              of those who are in the state of present justice. This is clear
              from the
              <i>Interlinear Gloss,</i>
              which adds: “In number and in merit.” Now, this number of those in
              present justice is both increased and diminished; but God’s
              appointment, which predefines this number, too, is never wrong,
              because it is He who decrees that there be more of these at one
              time and fewer at another. Or we could even answer that God
              defines a certain number in the manner of a judgment in harmony
              with inferior reasons, and this limitation can be changed; but He
              predestines another number in the manner of an election in harmony
              with superior reasons, and this limitation cannot be changed. For
              Gregory says: “He changes His judgment but never His election.”

              2. No preparation disposes anything to have a perfection at a time

              his childhood, but in the days of his manhood. Now, the time when
              one obtains grace is simultaneous with the time when nature is
              prepared. Consequently, no barrier can come between them. Thus,
              when the preparation of nature is found in a person, grace is also
              found in him. But the time when one obtains glory is not
              simultaneous with the time when he has grace. Consequently, a
              barrier can come between these two. For this reason, one who is
              foreknown to possess grace will not necessarily possess glory

              8. As is clear from what was said previously, while it may be
              granted with reference to a determined person that God, absolutely
              speaking, can predestine or not predestine him, nevertheless,
              supposing that God has predestined him, He cannot not predestine
              him. Nor is the opposite possible, because God cannot change.
              Consequently, it is commonly said that the following proposition,
              “God can predestine one who is not predestined or not predestine
              one who is predestined,” is false if taken in a composite sense,
              but true if taken in a divided sense. All statements, therefore,
              which imply that composite sense are absolutely false. Thus, we
              must not concede that the number of the predestined can be
              increased or diminished, because addition presupposes something
              which is increased, and subtraction, something which is
              diminished. For the same reason, we cannot concede that God can
              predestine more or fewer than He has already predestined.

              9-10. The answer to these arguments is clear, for they are based
              on an understanding of God’s power as absolute, not as modified by
              a supposition of predestination or non-predestination.

              Ad undecimum dicendum, quod Glossa illa intelligenda est hoc modo
              quod non intrant tot de Iudaeis, quot sunt omnes qui sunt
              praeordinati ad vitam, quia non soli Iudaei sunt praedestinati.
              Vel potest dici, quod non loquitur de praeordinatione
              praedestinationis, sed praeparationis, qua per legem disponebantur
              ad vitam. Vel potest dici, quod non intraverunt tot in primitiva
              Ecclesia, quia cum plenitudo gentium intraverit, tunc et omnis

              11. That Gloss should be understood as meaning this: the number of
              Jews entering is not as large as the total number of all those who
              have been preordained to life, for it is not only Jews who have
              been predestined. Or one could reply that the Gloss is not
              speaking about the preordination of predestination but about the
              preordination of preparation by which the Jews were disposed for
              life by means of the Law. Or, finally, one could reply that not as
              many Jews entered the early Church as are predestined, because, as
              we read in the Epistle to the Romans(11:25-26): “When the fulness
              of the Gentiles should come in... all Israel will be saved” in the
              Church at the end of time.

              Quia, ut dicitur I Ioan. cap. II, 27: unctio docet nos de omnibus:
              et intelligitur de omnibus pertinentibus ad salutem. Sed
              praedestinatio maxime pertinet ad salutem, quia est causa salutis.

              1. The words of St. John, “His unction teaches you of all things”
              (1 John2:27), are understood as referring to all things pertaining
              to salvation. But predestination pertains very much to salvation,
              since it is the cause of salvation. Consequently, through an
              unction they receive, all men are made certain of their
              predestination.

              possible way. Now, the best possible way seems to be that each and

              person who is predestined is given assurance that he will come to

              There is nothing inconsistent in the revelation to some person of
              the fact of his predestination; but, in view of His general law,
              it would be inconsistent if He revealed this to all the
              predestined for the following two reasons. The first reason may be
              found by considering those who are not predestined. Now, if all
              the predestined knew that they were predestined, then all those
              not predestined would know that they were not predestined from the
              very fact that they did not know if they were predestined. This
              would, in some way, lead them to despair. The second reason may be
              found by considering those who are predestined. Now, security is
              the mother of negligence; and if the predestined were certain,
              about their predestination, they would be secure about their
              salvation. Consequently, they would not exercise so great care in
              avoiding evil. Hence, it has been wisely ordained by God’s
              providence that men should be ignorant of their predestination or
              reprobation.

              prepared, namely, that the reward will be given him unless he
              fails on his part. This kind of assurance is given to all the
              predestined through the infusion of the virtue of hope.

              meriting, although he can know, by conjecture, that this is
              probably the case. For a habit never can be known except through
              its acts, and the acts of the infused supernatural virtues greatly
              resemble the acts of the acquired natural virtues. Consequently,
              it is not easy to be certain that acts of this kind have their
              source in grace, unless, by a special privilege, a person is made
              certain of it through a revelation. Moreover, he who is enrolled

              4. As is clear from the first Epistle to the Corinthians (12:12),
              the members of the mystical body resemble the members of a natural
              body. Now, in a natural body, a member does not acquire its
              perfection by means of another member. Consequently, the same is
              true [of members] in the mystical body. But the members of the
              mystical body receive their greatest perfection through the
              effects of predestination. Therefore, one man is not aided in
              obtaining the effects of predestination by the prayers of another.

              Est quod dicitur Genes. cap. XXV, 21: quod Isaac rogavit dominum
              pro Rebecca uxore sua, eo quod sterilis esset; qui exaudivit eum,
              et dedit conceptum Rebeccae; et ex illo conceptu natus est Iacob,
              qui ab aeterno praedestinatus fuerat; nec unquam fuisset
              praedestinatio impleta, nisi natus fuisset. Quod oratione Isaac
              est impetratum; ergo praedestinatio orationibus iuvatur.

              1. We read in Genesis (25:2 1): “Isaac besought the Lord for his
              wife because she was barren; and he heard him, and made Rebecca to
              conceive.” As a result of this conception Jacob was born, who had
              been predestined from all eternity; and this predestination would
              never have been fulfilled had he not been born. But it was
              effected by the prayer of Isaac. Consequently, predestination is
              helped by prayers.

              That predestination can be helped by the prayers of the saints can
              be understood in two ways. First, it can mean that the prayers of
              the saints help one to be predestined. This, however, cannot be
              true of prayers, either as they exist in their own proper
              condition, which is temporal while predestination is eternal, or
              as they exist in God’s foreknowledge, because, as explained above,
              foreknowledge of merits is. not the cause of predestination,
              whether the merits be one’s own or those of another. On the other
              hand, that predestination is furthered by the prayers of the
              saints can mean that their prayers help us obtain the effect of
              predestination as an instrument helps one in finishing his work.
              The problem has been considered in this way by all those who have
              studied God’s providence over human affairs. Their answers,
              however, have been different.

              Others said that sacrifices and prayers help to this extent, that
              they change the preordination made by those who have the power to
              determine human acts. This is said to have been the opinion of the
              Stoics, who taught that all things are ruled by certain spirits
              whom they called gods; and, even though something had been
              pre-established by them, according to the Stoics, such a
              prearrangement could be changed by placating their souls through
              prayers and sacrifices. Avicenna seems to have fallen into this
              error, too; for he asserts that all human actions whose principle
              is the human will can be reduced to the wills of celestial souls.
              He thought that the heavenly bodies had souls, and, just as a
              heavenly body influences a human body, so, according to him, the
              celestial souls influence human souls. In fact, what takes place
              in things here below is according to the notions of these
              celestial souls. Consequently, he thought that sacrifices and
              prayers helped these souls to conceive what we wished to take
              place.

              These theories, however, are opposed to the Faith. For the first

              predestination. Consequently, we must answer the problem
              differently, and must say that, while God’s predestination never
              changes, prayers and other good works are nevertheless effective
              in obtaining the effect of predestination. Now, when considering
              any order of causes, we must consider not only the order of the
              first cause to the effect but also the order of the second cause
              to the effect and the order of the first cause to the second
              cause, since the second cause is ordered to an effect only through
              the direction of the first cause. For, as is clear from
              <i>The Causes</i>, the first cause gives to the second cause the
              power of influencing the effect.

              I say, therefore, that the effect of predestination is man’s
              salvation, and this comes from it as from its first cause. It can
              have, however, many other proximate and, as it were, instrumental
              causes, which are ordered by divine predestination for man’s
              salvation, as tools are used by a craftsman for completing a
              product of his craft. Consequently, the effect of God’s
              predestination is not only that an individual person be saved but
              also that he be saved by certain prayers or certain merits.
              Gregory also said this: “What holy men effect by their prayers is
              predestined to be obtained by prayer.” Consequently, Boethius
              says: “If we pray well, our prayers cannot be without effect.”

              Ad tertium dicendum, quod quamvis praedestinatio et gratia finalis
              convertantur, tamen non oportet quod quidquid est causa gratiae
              finalis, quocumque modo, sit etiam causa praedestinationis, sicut
              patet ex supra dictis.

              3. Although predestination and final grace are interchangeable, it
              does not necessarily follow that whatever is the cause of final
              grace in any manner whatsoever is also the cause of
              predestination. This is clear from what has been said previously.

              Ad quartum dicendum, quod quamvis Traianus esset in loco
              reproborum, non tamen erat simpliciter reprobatus; praedestinatum
              enim erat quod precibus Gregorii salvaretur.

              4. Although Trajan was in the place of the damned, he was not
              damned absolutely; for he was predestined to be saved by the
              prayers of Gregory.
