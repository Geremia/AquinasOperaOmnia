            <td>Of things that exist, some exist by nature, some from other causes. 'By nature' the animals and their parts exist, and the plants and the simple bodies (earth, fire, air, water)—for we say that these and the like exist 'by nature'. All the things mentioned present a feature in which they differ from things which are not constituted by nature. Each of them has within itself a principle of motion and of stationariness (in respect of place, or of growth and decrease, or by way of alteration). On the other hand, a bed and a coat and anything else of that sort, qua receiving these designations i.e. in so far as they are products of art—have no innate impulse to change. But in so far as they happen to be composed of stone or of earth or of a mixture of the two, they do have such an impulse,
          <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
            <td style="font-family:" palatino="">ὡς οὔσης τῆς φύσεως ἀρχῆς τινὸς καὶ αἰτίας τοῦ κινεῖσθαι καὶ ἠρεμεῖν ἐν ᾧ ὑπάρχει πρώτως καθ' αὑτὸ καὶ μὴ κατὰ συμβεβηκός (λέγω δὲ τὸ μὴ κατὰ συμβεβηκός, ὅτι γένοιτ' ἂν αὐτὸς αὑτῷ τις αἴτιος ὑγιείας ὢν ἰατρός· ἀλλ' ὅμως οὐ καθὸ ὑγιάζεται τὴν ἰατρικὴν ἔχει, ἀλλὰ συμβέβηκεν τὸν αὐτὸν ἰατρὸν εἶναι καὶ ὑγιαζόμενον· διὸ καὶ χωρίζεταί ποτ' ἀπ' ἀλλήλων). ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ τῶν ἄλλων ἕκαστον τῶν ποιουμένων· οὐδὲν γὰρ αὐτῶν ἔχει τὴν ἀρχὴν ἐν ἑαυτῷ τῆς ποιήσεως, ἀλλὰ τὰ μὲν ἐν ἄλλοις καὶ ἔξωθεν, οἷον οἰκία καὶ τῶν ἄλλων τῶν χειροκμήτων ἕκαστον, τὰ δ' ἐν αὑτοῖς μὲν ἀλλ' οὐ καθ' αὑτά, ὅσα κατὰ συμβεβηκὸς αἴτια γένοιτ' ἂν αὑτοῖς. φύσις μὲν οὖν ἐστὶ τὸ ῥηθέν·
            <td>and just to that extent which seems to indicate that nature is a source or cause of being moved and of being at rest in that to which it belongs primarily, in virtue of itself and not in virtue of a concomitant attribute. I say 'not in virtue of a concomitant attribute', because (for instance) a man who is a doctor might cure himself. Nevertheless it is not in so far as he is a patient that he possesses the art of medicine: it merely has happened that the same man is doctor and patient—and that is why these attributes are not always found together. So it is with all other artificial products. None of them has in itself the source of its own production. But while in some cases (for instance houses and the other products of manual labour) that principle is in something else external to the thing, in others those which may cause a change in themselves in virtue of a concomitant attribute—it lies in the things themselves (but not in virtue of what they are). 'Nature' then is what has been stated.
          <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
            <td style="font-family:" palatino="">φύσιν δὲ ἔχει ὅσα τοιαύτην ἔχει ἀρχήν. καὶ ἔστιν πάντα ταῦτα οὐσία· ὑποκείμενον γάρ τι, καὶ ἐν ὑποκειμένῳ ἐστὶν ἡ φύσις ἀεί.
            <td>Things 'have a nature'which have a principle of this kind. Each of them is a substance; for it is a subject, and nature always implies a subject in which it inheres.

            <td>The term 'according to nature' is applied to all these things and also to the attributes which belong to them in virtue of what they are, for instance the property of fire to be carried upwards—which is not a 'nature' nor 'has a nature' but is 'by nature' or 'according to nature'. What nature is, then, and the meaning of the terms 'by nature' and 'according to nature', has been stated.

            <td>That nature exists, it would be absurd to try to prove; for it is obvious that there are many things of this kind, and to prove what is obvious by what is not is the mark of a man who is unable to distinguish what is self-evident from what is not. (This state of mind is clearly possible. A man blind from birth might reason about colours. Presumably therefore such persons must be talking about words without any thought to correspond.)

        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Dicimus autem esse a natura quaelibet animalia, et partes ipsorum, sicut carnem et ossa, et etiam plantas et corpora simplicia, scilicet elementa, quae non resolvuntur in aliqua corpora priora, ut sunt terra, ignis, aer et aqua: haec enim et omnia similia a natura dicuntur esse.
          <td>Now we say that the following things are from nature: every sort of animal, and their parts, such as flesh and blood, and also plants and simple bodies, i.e., the elements, such as earth, fire, air and water, which are not resolved into any prior bodies. For these and all things like them are said to be from nature.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Et differunt haec omnia ab his quae non sunt a natura, quia omnia huiusmodi videntur habere in se principium alicuius motus et status; quaedam quidem secundum locum, sicut gravia et levia, et etiam corpora caelestia; quaedam vero secundum augmentum et decrementum, ut animalia et plantae; quaedam vero secundum alterationem, ut corpora simplicia et omnia quae componuntur ex eis.
          <td>All of these things differ from the things which are not from nature because all things of this sort seem to have in themselves a principle of motion and rest; some according to place, such as the heavy and the light, and also the celestial bodies, some according to increase and decrease, such as the animals and plants, and some according to alteration, such as the simple bodies and everything which is composed of them.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sed ea quae non sunt a natura, sicut lectus et indumentum et similia, quae accipiunt huiusmodi praedicationem secundum quod sunt ab arte, nullius mutationis principium habent in seipsis nisi per accidens, inquantum scilicet materia et substantia corporum artificiatorum sunt res naturales. Sic igitur inquantum artificialibus accidit esse ferrea vel lapidea, habent aliquod principium motus in seipsis, sed non inquantum sunt artificiata: cultellus enim habet in se principium motus deorsum, non inquantum est cultellus, sed inquantum est ferreus.
          <td>But things which are not from nature, such as a bed and clothing and like things, which are spoken of in this way because they are from art, have in themselves no principle of mutation, except <i>per accidents</i>, insofar as the matter and substance of artificial bodies are natural things. Thus insofar as artificial things happen to be iron or stone, they have a principle of motion in them, but not insofar as they are artifacts. For a knife has in itself a principle of downward motion, not insofar as it is a knife, but insofar as it is iron.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sed videtur hoc non esse verum, quod secundum quamlibet mutationem rerum naturalium, principium motus sit in eo quod movetur. In alteratione enim et generatione simplicium corporum, totum principium motus videtur esse ab extrinseco agente: puta cum aqua calefit, vel aer in ignem convertitur, principium mutationis est ab exteriori agente.
          <td>143. But it does not seem to be true that in every change of natural things a principle of motion is- in that which is moved. For in the alteration and the generation of simple bodies, the whole principle of motion seems to be from an external agent. For example, when water is heated, or air is converted into fire, the principle of the change is from an external agent.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Dicunt ergo quidam quod etiam in huiusmodi mutationibus principium activum motus est in eo quod movetur; non quidem perfectum, sed imperfectum, quod coadiuvat actionem exterioris agentis. Dicunt enim quod in materia est quaedam inchoatio formae, quam dicunt esse privationem, quae est tertium principium naturae; et ab hoc principio intrinseco generationes et alterationes corporum simplicium naturales dicuntur.
          <td>Therefore, some say that even in changes of this sort an active principle of motion is in that which is moved, not perfectly, but imperfectly, which principle helps the action of the external agent. For they say that in matter there is a certain inchoateness of form, which they say is privation, the third principle of nature. And the generations and alterations of simple bodies are said to be from this intrinsic principle.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sed hoc non potest esse: quia, cum nihil agat nisi secundum quod est in actu, praedicta inchoatio formae, cum non sit actus, sed aptitudo quaedam ad actum, non potest esse principium activum. Et praeterea, etiam si esset forma completa, non ageret in suum subiectum alterando ipsum: quia forma non agit, sed compositum; quod non potest seipsum alterare, nisi sint in eo duae partes, quarum una sit alterans et alia alterata.
          <td>But this cannot be. Since a thing acts only insofar as it is in act, the aforesaid inchoate state of form, since it is not act, but a certain disposition for act, cannot be an active principle. And furthermore, even if it were a complete form, it would not act on its own subject by ‘changing it. For the form does not act, rather the composite acts. And the composite cannot alter itself unless there are two parts in it, one of which alters, the other of which is altered.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Et ideo dicendum est quod in rebus naturalibus eo modo est principium motus, quo eis motus convenit. Quibus ergo convenit movere, est in eis principium activum motus; quibus autem competit moveri, est in eis principium passivum, quod est materia. Quod quidem principium, inquantum habet potentiam naturalem ad talem formam et motum, facit esse motum naturalem. Et propter hoc factiones rerum artificialium non sunt naturales: quia licet principium materiale sit in eo quod fit, non tamen habet potentiam naturalem ad talem formam.
          <td>144. And so it must be said that a principle of motion is in natural things in the way in which motion belongs to them. Therefore in those things to which it belongs to move, there is an active principle of motion. Whereas in those things to which it belongs to be moved, there is a passive principle, which is matter. And this principle, insofar as it has a natural potency for such a form and motion, makes the motion to be natural. And for this reason the production of artificial things is not natural. For even though the material principle is in that which comes to be, it does not have a natural potency for such a form.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Et sic etiam motus localis corporum caelestium est naturalis, licet sit a motore separato, inquantum in ipso corpore caeli est potentia naturalis ad talem motum.
          <td>So also the local motion of the celestial bodies is natural, even though it is from a separated mover, inasmuch as there is in the celestial body itself a natural potency for such a motion.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>In corporibus vero gravibus et levibus est principium formale sui motus (sed huiusmodi principium formale non potest dici potentia activa, ad quam pertinet motus iste, sed comprehenditur sub potentia passiva: gravitas enim in terra non est principium ut moveat, sed magis ut moveatur): quia sicut alia accidentia consequuntur formam substantialem, ita et locus, et per consequens moveri ad locum: non tamen ita quod forma naturalis sit motor, sed motor est generans, quod dat talem formam, ad quam talis motus consequitur.
          <td>However in heavy and light bodies there is a formal principle of motion. (But a formal principle of this sort cannot be called the active potency to which this motion pertains. Rather it is understood as a passive potency. For heaviness in earth is not a principle for moving, but rather for being moved.) For just as the other accidents are consequent upon substantial form, so also is place, and thus also ‘to be moved to place’. However the natural form is not the mover. Rather the mover is that which generates and gives such and such a form upon which such a motion follows.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit: est igitur natura etc., concludit ex praemissis definitionem naturae hoc modo.
          <td>145. Next where he says, ‘... nature is...’ (192 b 22), he concludes from the above the definition of nature in the following manner.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Naturalia differunt a non naturalibus inquantum habent naturam; sed non differunt a non naturalibus nisi inquantum habent principium motus in seipsis; ergo natura nihil aliud est quam principium motus et quietis in eo in quo est primo et per se et non secundum accidens.
          <td>Natural things differ from the non-natural insofar as they have a nature. But they differ from the non-natural only insofar as they have in themselves a principle of motion. Therefore, nature is nothing other than a principle of motion and rest in that in which it is primarily and <i>per se</i> and not <i>per accidens</i>.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Ponitur autem in definitione naturae principium, quasi genus, et non aliquid absolutum, quia nomen naturae importat habitudinem principii. Quia enim nasci dicuntur ea quae generantur coniuncta generanti, ut patet in plantis et animalibus, ideo principium generationis vel motus natura nominatur. Unde deridendi sunt qui volentes definitionem Aristotelis corrigere, naturam per aliquid absolutum definire conati sunt, dicentes quod natura est vis insita rebus, vel aliquid huiusmodi.
          <td>Now ‘principle’ is placed in the definition of nature as its genus, and not as something absolute, for the name ‘nature’ involves a relation to a principle. For those things are said to be born which are generated after having been joined to a generator, as is clear in plants and animals, thus the principle of generation or motion is called nature. Hence they are to be laughed at who, wishing to correct the definition of Aristotle, tried to define nature by something absolute, saying that nature is a power seated in things or something of this sort.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Dicitur autem principium et causa, ad designandum quod non omnium motuum natura est eodem modo principium in eo quod movetur, sed diversimode, ut dictum est.
          <td>Moreover, nature is called a principle and cause in order to point out that in that which is moved nature is not a principle of all motions in the same way, but in different ways, as was said above [#144].
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Dicit autem movendi et quiescendi, quia ea quae naturaliter moventur ad locum, similiter vel magis naturaliter in loco quiescunt: propter hoc enim ignis naturaliter movetur sursum, quia naturaliter ibi est, et propter quod unumquodque et illud magis. Non tamen intelligendum est quod in quolibet quod movetur naturaliter, natura sit etiam principium quiescendi; quia corpus caeleste naturaliter quidem movetur, sed non naturaliter quiescit: sed hoc pro tanto dicitur, quia non solum motus, sed etiam quietis principium est.
          <td>Moreover, he says that nature is a principle ‘of motion and rest’. For those things which are naturally moved to a place, also or even more naturally rest in that place. Because of this, fire is naturally moved upward, since it is natural for it to be there. And for the same reason everything can be said to be moved naturally and to rest naturally in its place. This, however, must not be understood to mean that in everything which is moved naturally nature is also a principle of coming to rest. For a heavenly body is indeed moved naturally, but it does not naturally come to rest. But on the whole it can be said that nature is not only a principle of motion but also of rest.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Dicit autem in quo est, ad differentiam artificialium, in quibus non est motus nisi per accidens.
          <td>Further he says ‘in which it is’ in order to differentiate nature from artificial things in which there is motion only <i>per accidens</i>.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Addit autem primum, quia natura, etsi sit principium motus compositorum, non tamen primo. Unde quod animal movetur deorsum, non est ex natura animalis inquantum est animal, sed ex natura dominantis elementi.
          <td>Then he adds ‘Primarily’ because even though nature is a principle of the motion of composite things, nevertheless it is not such primarily. Hence that an animal is moved downwards is not because of the nature of animal insofar as it is animal, but because of the nature of the dominant element.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Quare autem dicat per se et non secundum accidens, exponit consequenter cum dicit: dico autem non secundum accidens.
          <td>He explains why he says ‘ <i>per se</i> and not <i>per accidens</i> ’ where he says, ‘I say “not in virtue of...”’ (192 b 24).
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Contingit enim aliquando quod aliquis medicus est sibi ipsi causa sanitatis; et sic principium suae sanationis est in eo, sed per accidens: unde principium sanationis in eo non est natura. Non enim secundum quod sanatur habet medicinam, sed secundum quod est medicus; accidit autem eundem esse medicum et sanari; sanatur enim secundum quod est infirmus. Et ideo, quia per accidens coniunguntur, aliquando per accidens dividuntur: contingit enim alium esse medicum sanantem et alium infirmum qui sanatur. Sed principium motus naturalis est in corpore naturali quod movetur, inquantum movetur: inquantum enim ignis habet levitatem, fertur sursum. Nec dividuntur ad invicem, ut aliud sit corpus quod movetur sursum et aliud leve, sed semper unum et idem. Et sicuti est de medico sanante, ita est de omnibus artificialibus. Nullum enim eorum habet in seipso suae factionis principium: sed quaedam eorum fiunt ab extrinseco, ut domus et alia quae manu inciduntur; quaedam autem fiunt a principio intrinseco, sed per accidens, ut dictum est. Et sic dictum est quid sit natura.
          <td>It sometimes happens that a doctor is the cause of his own health, and so the principle of his own coming to health is in him, but <i>per accidens</i>. Hence nature is not the principle of his coming to health. For it is not insofar as he is cured that he has the art of medicine, but insofar as he is a doctor. Hence the same being happens to be a doctor and to be cured, and he is cured insofar as he is sick. And so because these things are joined <i>per accidens</i>, they are also at times separated <i>per accidens</i>. For it is one thing to be a doctor who cures, and another thing to be a sick person who is cured. But the principle of a natural motion is in the natural body which is moved insofar as it is moved. For insofar as fire has lightness, it is carried upward. And these two things are not divided from each other so that the lightness is different than the body which is moved upward. Rather they are always one and the same. And all artificial things are like the doctor who cures. For none of them has in itself the principle of its own making. Rather some of them come to be from something outside, as a house and other things which are carved by hand, while others come to be through an intrinsic principle, but <i>per accidens</i>, as was said [#142]. And so it has been stated what nature is.

Et quod hoc contingat aliquibus, manifestum est. Aliquis enim caecus natus aliquando syllogizat de coloribus: cui tamen non est per se notum id quo utitur ut principio, quia non habet intellectum rei, sed utitur solum nominibus; eo quod cognitio nostra ortum habet a sensu, et cui deficit unus sensus, deficit una scientia. Unde caeci nati, qui nunquam senserunt colorem, non possunt aliquid de coloribus intelligere; et sic utuntur non notis quasi notis. Et e converso accidit his qui volunt demonstrare naturam esse: quia utuntur notis ut non notis. Naturam autem esse, est per se notum, inquantum naturalia sunt manifesta sensui.

          <td>He says that it is ridiculous for anyone to attempt to demonstrate that nature exists. For it is manifest to the senses that many things are from nature, which have in themselves the principle of their own motion. To wish, moreover, to demonstrate the obvious by what is not obvious is the mark of a man who cannot judge what is known in itself and what is not known in itself. For when he wishes to demonstrate that which is known in itself, he uses that which is known in itself as if it were not known in itself. And it is clear that some people do this. A man who is born blind may sometimes reason about colours. But that which he uses as a principle is not known to him <i>per se</i>, because he has no understanding of the thing. Rather he only uses names. For our knowledge has its origin from the senses, and he who lacks one sense, lacks one science. Hence those who are born blind, and who never sense colour, cannot understand any thing about colour. And so they use the unknown as if it were known. And the converse applies to those who wish to demonstrate that nature exists. For they use the known as if it were not known. The existence of nature is known <i>per se</i>, insofar as natural things are manifest to the senses. But what the nature of each thing is, or what the principle of its motion is, is not manifest.

          <td>Unde patet per hoc quod irrationabiliter Avicenna conatus est improbare Aristotelis dictum, volens quod naturam esse possit demonstrari, sed non a naturali, quia nulla scientia probat sua principia. Sed ignorantia principiorum moventium non impedit quin naturam esse sit per se notum, ut dictum est.
          <td>Hence it is clear from this that Avicenna, who wished that it were possible to prove the existence of nature, unreasonably attempted to disprove what Aristotle has said. However Avicenna did not wish to prove this from natural things, for no science proves its own principles.

            <td>Some identify the nature or substance of a natural object with that immediate constituent of it which taken by itself is without arrangement, e.g. the wood is the 'nature' of the bed, and the bronze the 'nature' of the statue. As an indication of this Antiphon points out that if you planted a bed and the rotting wood acquired the power of sending up a shoot, it would not be a bed that would come up, but wood—which shows that the arrangement in accordance with the rules of the art is merely an incidental attribute, whereas the real nature is the other, which, further, persists continuously through the process of making. But if the material of each of these objects has itself the same relation to something else, say bronze (or gold) to water, bones (or wood) to earth and so on, that (they say) would be their nature and essence. Consequently some assert earth, others fire or air or water or some or all of these, to be the nature of the things that are. For whatever any one of them supposed to have this character—whether one thing or more than one thing—this or these he declared to be the whole of substance, all else being its affections, states, or dispositions. Every such thing they held to be eternal (for it could not pass into anything else), but other things to come into being and cease to be times without number. This then is one account of 'nature', namely that it is the immediate material substratum of things which have in themselves a principle of motion or change.

            <td>Another account is that 'nature' is the shape or form which is specified in the definition of the thing. For the word 'nature' is applied to what is according to nature and the natural in the same way as 'art' is applied to what is artistic or a work of art. We should not say in the latter case that there is anything artistic about a thing, if it is a bed only potentially, not yet having the form of a bed; nor should we call it a work of art. The same is true of natural compounds. What is potentially flesh or bone has not yet its own 'nature', and does not exist until it receives the form specified in the definition, which we name in defining what flesh or bone is. Thus in the second sense of 'nature' it would be the shape or form (not separable except in statement) of things which have in themselves a source of motion. (The combination of the two, e.g. man, is not 'nature' but 'by nature' or 'natural'.) The form indeed is 'nature' rather than the matter; for a thing is more properly said to be what it is when it has attained to fulfilment than when it exists potentially.

The 'nature' in this sense is not like 'doctoring', which leads not to the art of doctoring but to health. Doctoring must start from the art, not lead to it. But it is not in this way that nature (in the one sense) is related to nature (in the other). What grows qua growing grows from something into something. Into what then does it grow?

          <td>149. Having shown what nature is, the Philosopher here points out the number of ways in which the name ‘nature’ is used. He shows first that nature is predicated of matter, secondly that it is predicated of form, where he says, ‘Another account...’ (193 a 30 #151).
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Circa primum, sciendum est quod antiqui philosophi naturales, non valentes usque ad primam materiam pervenire, ut supra dictum est, aliquod corpus sensibile primam materiam omnium rerum ponebant, ut ignem vel aerem vel aquam: et sic sequebatur quod omnes formae advenirent materiae tanquam in actu existenti, ut contingit in artificialibus; nam forma cultelli advenit ferro iam existenti in actu. Et ideo similem opinionem accipiebant de formis naturalibus, sicut de formis artificialibus.
          <td>Concerning the first point we must note that the ancient natural philosophers, being unable to arrive at primary matter, as was said above [I, L12 #108], held that some sensible body, such as fire or air or water, is the first matter of all things. And so it followed that all forms come to matter as to something existing in act, as happens in artificial things. For the form of knife comes to iron already existing in act. And so they adopted an opinion about natural forms similar to that which is true of artificial forms.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Dicit ergo primo quod quibusdam videtur quod hoc sit substantia et natura rerum naturalium, quod primo inest unicuique, quod secundum se consideratum est informe: ut si dicamus quod natura lecti est lignum, et natura statuae est aes; nam lignum est in lecto, et secundum se consideratum non est formatum. Et huius signum dicebat Antiphon esse hoc, quod si aliquis proiiciat lectum ad terram, et ligna putrescendo accipiant potentiam ut aliquid ex eis germinet, illud quod generatur non erit lectus, sed lignum. Et quia substantia est quae permanet, et naturae est sibi simile generare, concludebat quod omnis dispositio quae est secundum quamcumque legem rationis vel artem, sit accidens: et illud quod permanet sit substantia, quae continue patitur huiusmodi dispositionum immutationem.
          <td>He says, therefore, first that it seems to some that that which is primarily in each thing and which considered in itself is unformed is the substance and nature of natural things, as if we would say that the nature of a bed is wood, and the nature of a statue is bronze. For wood is in the bed and is, when considered in itself, not formed. And Antiphon said that the following is a sign of this: if one should bury a bed in the earth and if the wood by rotting should acquire the potency to germinate something, that which is generated will not be a bed, but wood. Now since the substance is that which remains permanent, and since it belongs to nature to generate what is like itself, he concluded that every disposition in respect to any law of reason [ratio] or art is an accident. And that which remains permanent is substance, which continually undergoes change of dispositions of this sort.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Supposito igitur quod rerum artificialium formae sint accidentia, et materia sit substantia, assumebat aliam propositionem, quod sicut se habent lectus et statua ad aes et lignum, ita et quodlibet horum se habet ad aliquid aliud quod est materia ipsorum; ut aes et aurum ad aquam (quia omnium liquefactibilium materia videtur esse aqua), et ossa et ligna ad terram, et similiter est de quolibet aliorum naturalium. Unde concludebat quod illa materialia subsistentia formis naturalibus, sint natura et substantia eorum. Et propter hoc quidam dixerunt terram esse naturam et substantiam omnium rerum, scilicet primi poetae theologizantes; posteriores vero philosophi vel ignem vel aerem vel aquam, vel quaedam horum, vel omnia haec, ut ex superioribus patet. Quia tot de numero eorum dicebant esse substantiam omnium rerum, quot accipiebant esse principia materialia; et omnia alia dicebant esse accidentia horum, idest materialium principiorum, vel per modum passionis vel per modum habitus vel per modum dispositionis, vel cuiuslibet alterius quod reducatur ad genus accidentis.
          <td>Having supposed, therefore, that the forms of artificial things are accidents, and that matter is substance, Antiphon assumed the other proposition, namely, that just as the bed and statue are related to bronze and wood, so also each natural thing is related to some other thing which is its matter. Thus bronze and gold are related to water (because the matter of all liquifiable things seems to be water), and bone and wood are related to earth, and it is the same with all other natural things. Hence he concluded that the material things which subsist under natural forms are their nature and substance. And because of this some have said that earth is the nature and substance of all things, for example, the first theological poets; whereas the later philosophers chose fire or air or water, or some of these or all of them, as is clear from what was said above [I, L2 #13; L8 #54]. For they said that there are as many u stances of things as there are material principles. And they said that all other things are accidents of these material principles, either as passions, or as habits, or as dispositions, or as anything else which is reduced to the genus of accident.

Sed omnia alia dicebant fieri et corrumpi infinities: ut puta, si aqua sit principium materiale, dicebant aquam nunquam corrumpi, sed manere eam in omnibus sicut substantiam eorum; sed aes et aurum et alia huiusmodi dicebant corrumpi et generari infinities.
          <td>There is, however, another difference, for they also said that these principles differ as the permanent and the corruptible. Since they held that each of the aforementioned simple bodies is a material principle, they said it was permanent, for they did not say that they were changed into each other. But they said that all other things come to be and are corrupted infinitely. For example, if water is the material principle, they said that water is never corrupted, but remains water in all things as their substance.

          <td>Sicuti enim illud est ars, quod competit alicui inquantum est secundum artem et artificiosum; ita illud est natura, quod competit alicui inquantum est secundum naturam et naturale. Sed illud quod est in potentia tantum ad hoc quod sit artificiosum, non dicimus habere aliquid artis, quia nondum habet speciem lecti: ergo in rebus naturalibus id quod est potentia caro et os, non habet naturam carnis et ossis antequam accipiat formam, secundum quam sumitur ratio definitiva rei (per quam scilicet scimus quid est caro vel os); nec adhuc est natura in ipso antequam habeat formam. Ergo natura rerum naturalium habentium in se principium motus, alio modo etiam forma est: quae licet non separetur a materia secundum rem, tamen differt ab ea ratione. Sicut enim aes et infiguratum, quamvis sint unum subiecto, tamen ratione differunt, ita materia et forma.
          <td>Just as art belongs to a thing insofar as it is according to art and the artistic, so also nature belongs to a thing insofar as it is according to nature and the natural. But we do not say that that which is only in potency to that which is artistic has anything of art, because it does not yet have the species [e.g.] of a bed. Therefore in natural things that which is potentially flesh and bone does not have the nature of flesh and bone before it takes on the form in respect to which the definitive nature [ <i>ratio</i> ] of the thing is established (i.e. that through which we know what flesh and bone are). The nature is not yet in it before it has the form. Therefore the nature of natural things which have in themselves a principle of motion is in another way the form. And this form, although it is not separated from the matter in the thing, still differs from the matter by reason [ <i>ratio</i> ]. For as bronze and the shapeless, although one in subject, are different in reason [ <i>ratio</i> ], so also are matter and form.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">

          <td>But he denies this, saying that the composite of matter and form, such as a man, is not the nature itself, but is some thing from nature. For nature [ <i>natura</i> ] has the nature [ <i>ratio</i> ] of a principle, but the composite has the nature [ <i>ratio</i> ] of ‘being from a principle’.

          <td>153. From the foregoing argument he proceeds further to show that form is nature more than matter. For a thing is said to be greater insofar as it is in act rather than insofar as it is in potency. Whence form, according to which a thing is natural in act, is nature more than matter, according to which a thing is something natural in potency.

Sed forma rei naturalis redit per generationem, fit enim ex homine homo: ergo forma rei naturalis est natura.
          <td>154. He gives the second argument where he says, ‘Again man is...’ (193 b 8). He says that although a bed does not come to be from a bed, as Antiphon said, man does come to be from man. Whence what they say is true, namely, that the form of bed is not the nature, but the wood is. For if wood should germinate, a bed would not come to be, but wood. Therefore, as this form, which does not arise through germination, is not nature but art, so the form which arises from generation is nature. But the form of a natural thing does arise through generation, for man comes to be from man. Therefore the form of a natural thing is nature.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Tertiam rationem ponit ibi: amplius autem natura etc.: quae talis est. Natura potest significari ut generatio, puta si natura dicatur nativitas. Sic igitur natura dicta ut generatio, idest nativitas, est via in naturam. Haec enim est differentia inter actiones et passiones, quod actiones denominantur a principiis, passiones vero a terminis. Unumquodque enim denominatur ab actu, qui est principium actionis et terminus passionis. Non enim ita est in passionibus sicut in actionibus: medicatio enim non dicitur via in medicinam, sed in sanitatem; necesse est enim quod medicatio sit a medicina, non in medicinam. Sed natura dicta ut generatio, idest nativitas, non sic se habet ad naturam sicut medicatio ad medicinam: sed se habet ad naturam sicut ad terminum, cum sit passio. Id enim quod nascitur, a quodam in quoddam venit inquantum nascitur: unde id quod nascitur, denominatur ab eo in quod, non ab eo ex quo. Id autem in quod tendit nativitas, est forma: forma igitur est natura.
          <td>155. He gives his third argument where he says, ‘We also speak...’ (193 b 13). Nature can be signified as a generation, for instance, if we should call it birth. Thus nature in the sense of generation, i.e., birth, is the way to nature. For the difference between actions and passions is that actions are named from their principles while passions are named from their terminations. For each thing is named from act, which is the principle of action and the termination of passion. But naming is not the same in passions and actions. For medication is not called the way to medicine, but the way to health. It is necessary for medication to proceed from medicine, not to medicine. But nature in the sense of generation, i.e., birth, is not related to nature as medication is related to medicine. Rather it is related to nature as to a termination, since it is a passion. For that which is born, insofar as it is born, comes from something to something. Hence that which is born is named from that to which it proceeds, and not from that from which it proceeds. That, however, to which birth tends is form. Therefore form is nature.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit: sed forma et natura etc., ostendit quod natura quae est forma dupliciter dicitur, scilicet de forma incompleta et forma completa. Et hoc patet in generatione secundum quid, ut puta cum aliquid fit album: nam albedo est forma completa, et privatio albedinis est quodammodo species, inquantum coniungitur nigredini, quae est forma imperfecta. Sed utrum in generatione simplici, quae est substantiarum, sit aliquid quod sit privatio et contrarium simul, ita quod formae substantiales sint contrariae, vel non, considerandum est posterius in quinto huius, et in libro de generatione.
          <td>156. Next where he says, ‘Shape and nature...’ (193 b 19), he shows that the nature which is form is used in two ways, i.e., of the incomplete form and the complete form. This is clear in accidental generation, for example, when something becomes white. For whiteness is a complete form, and the privation of whiteness is in some way a species, insofar as it is joined to blackness, which is an imperfect form. But whether or not in simple generation, which is the generation of substances, there is something which is a privation and also a contrary, so that substantial forms are contraries, must be considered later in Book VI and in <i>De Generatione et Corruptione</i> I:3.

          <td>He gives the second reason where he says, ‘Further, is astronomy...’ (193 b 25). In connection with this reason he raises the question whether astronomy is altogether other than natural philosophy or a part of it. For it is clear that astronomy is a part of mathematics.

        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Quod autem astrologia sit pars physicae, probat dupliciter. Primo quidem per rationem talem. Ad quemcumque pertinet cognoscere substantias et naturas aliquarum rerum, ad eum etiam pertinet considerare accidentia illarum; sed ad naturalem pertinet considerare naturam et substantiam solis et lunae, cum sint quaedam corpora naturalia; ergo ad eum pertinet etiam considerare per se accidentia ipsorum.
          <td>That astronomy is a part of physics he proves in two ways. First by the following argument. To whomever it belongs to know the substances and natures of certain things, also belongs the consideration of their accidents. But it belongs to the natural philosopher to consider the nature and substance of the sun and the moon, since they are certain natural bodies. Therefore it belongs to the natural philosopher to consider their <i>per se</i> accidents.

Unde videtur quod astrologia sit pars physicae; et per consequens physica non totaliter differat a mathematica.
          <td>He proves this also from the custom of the philosophers. For natural philosophers are found to have treated the shape of the sun and of the moon and of the earth and of the whole world. And these are topics which claim the attention of the astronomers.

Because the mathematician does not consider lines, and points, and surfaces, and things of this sort, and their accidents, insofar as they are the boundaries of a natural body, he is said to abstract from sensible and natural matter. And the reason why he is able to abstract is this: according to the intellect these things are abstracted from motion.

Et hoc est unum intellectum esse abstractum ab alio. Manifestum est autem quod posteriora non sunt de intellectu priorum, sed e converso: unde priora possunt intelligi sine posterioribus, et non e converso. Sicut patet quod animal est prius homine, et homo est prius hoc homine (nam homo se habet ex additione ad animal, et hic homo ex additione ad hominem); et propter hoc homo non est de intellectu animalis, nec Socrates de intellectu hominis: unde animal potest intelligi absque homine, et homo absque Socrate et aliis individuis. Et hoc est abstrahere universale a particulari.
          <td>As evidence for this reason we must note that many things are joined in the thing, but the understanding of one of them is not derived from the understanding of another. Thus white and musical are joined in the same subject, nevertheless the understanding of one of these is not derived from an understanding of the other. And so one can be separately understood without the other. And this one is understood as abstracted from the other. It is clear, however, that the posterior is not derived from the understanding of the prior, but conversely. Hence the prior can be understood without the posterior, but not conversely. Thus it is clear that animal is prior to man, and man is prior to this man (for man is had by addition to animal, and this man by addition to man). And because of this our understanding of man is not derived from our understanding of animal, nor our understanding of Socrates from our understanding of man. Hence animal can be understood without man, and man without Socrates and other individuals. And this is to abstract the universal from the particular.

          <td>Similiter autem inter accidentia omnia quae adveniunt substantiae, primo advenit ei quantitas, et deinde qualitates sensibiles et actiones et passiones et motus consequentes sensibiles qualitates. Sic igitur quantitas non claudit in sui intellectu qualitates sensibiles vel passiones vel motus: claudit tamen in sui intellectu substantiam. Potest igitur intelligi quantitas sine materia subiecta motui et qualitatibus sensibilibus, non tamen absque substantia. Et ideo huiusmodi quantitates et quae eis accidunt, sunt secundum intellectum abstracta a motu et a materia sensibili, non autem a materia intelligibili, ut dicitur in VII Metaphys.
          <td>In like manner, among all the accidents which come to substance, quantity comes first, and then the sensible qualities, and actions and passions, and the motions consequent upon sensible qualities. Therefore quantity does not embrace in its intelligibility the sensible qualities or the passions or the motions. Yet it does include substance in its intelligibility. Therefore quantity can be understood without matter, which is subject to motion, and without sensible qualities, but not without substance. And thus quantities and those things which belong to them are understood as abstracted from motion and sensible matter, but not from intelligible matter, as is said in <i>Metaphysics</i>, VII:10.

          <td>Quia igitur sic sunt abstracta a motu secundum intellectum, quod non claudunt in suo intellectu materiam sensibilem subiectam motui; ideo mathematicus potest ea abstrahere a materia sensibili. Et nihil differt quantum ad veritatem considerationis, utrum sic vel sic considerentur. Quamvis enim non sint abstracta secundum esse, non tamen mathematici abstrahentes ea secundum intellectum, mentiuntur: quia non asserunt ea esse extra materiam sensibilem (hoc enim esset mendacium), sed considerant de eis absque consideratione materiae sensibilis, quod absque mendacio fieri potest: sicut aliquis potest considerare albedinem absque musica, et vere, licet conveniant in eodem subiecto: non tamen esset vera consideratio, si assereret album non esse musicum.
          <td>Since, therefore, the objects of mathematics are abstracted from motion according to the intellect, and since they do not include in their intelligibility sensible matter, which is a subject of motion, the mathematician can abstract them from sensible matter. And it makes no difference as far as the truth is concerned whether they are considered one way or the other. For although the objects of mathematics are not separated according to existence, the mathematicians, in abstracting them according to their understanding, do not lie, because they do not assert that these things exist apart from sensible matter (for this would be a lie). But they consider them without any consideration of sensible matter, which can be done without lying. Thus one can truly consider the white without the musical, even though they exist together in the same subject. But it would not be a true consideration if one were to assert that the white is not musical.

Unde posuit hominem esse separatum, et equum et lapidem et alia huiusmodi; quae quidem separata dicebat esse ideas: cum tamen naturalia sint minus abstracta quam mathematica.

          <td>Since Plato was puzzled as to how the intellect could truly separate those things which were not separated in their existence, he held that all things which are separated in the understanding are separated in the thing. Hence he not only held that mathematical entities are separated, because of the fact that the mathematician abstracts from sensible matter, but he even held that natural things themselves are separated, because of the fact that natural science is of universals and not of singulars. Hence he held that man is separated, and horse, and stone, and other such things. And he said these separated things are ideas, although natural things are less abstract than mathematical entities. For mathematical entities are altogether separated from sensible matter in the understanding, because sensible matter is not included in the understanding of the mathematicals, neither in the universal nor in the particular. But sensible matter is included in the understanding of natural things, whereas individual matter is not. For in the understanding of man flesh and bone is included, but not this flesh and this bone.

          <td>However, although sciences of this sort are intermediates between natural science and mathematics, they are here said by the Philosopher to be more natural than mathematical, because each thing is named and takes its species from its terminus.

            <td>Again, 'that for the sake of which', or the end, belongs to the same department of knowledge as the means. But the nature is the end or 'that for the sake of which'. For if a thing undergoes a continuous change and there is a stage which is last, this stage is the end or 'that for the sake of which'. (That is why the poet was carried away into making an absurd statement when he said 'he has the end for the sake of which he was born'. For not every stage that is last claims to be an end, but only that which is best.) For the arts make their material (some simply 'make' it, others make it serviceable), and we use everything as if it was there for our sake. (We also are in a sense an end. 'That for the sake of which' has two senses: the distinction is made in our work On Philosophy.) The arts, therefore, which govern the matter and have knowledge are two, namely the art which uses the product and the art which directs the production of it. That is why the using art also is in a sense directive; but it differs in that it knows the form, whereas the art which is directive as being concerned with production knows the matter. For the helmsman knows and prescribes what sort of form a helm should have, the other from what wood it should be made and by means of what operations. In the products of art, however, we make the material with a view to the function, whereas in the products of nature the matter is there all along.

            <td>How far then must the physicist know the form or essence? Up to a point, perhaps, as the doctor must know sinew or the smith bronze (i.e. until he understands the purpose of each): and the physicist is concerned only with things whose forms are separable indeed, but do not exist apart from matter. Man is begotten by man and by the sun as well. The mode of existence and essence of the separable it is the business of the primary type of philosophy to define.

Thus when we consider what the snub is, we consider not only its form, i.e., its curvature, but we also consider its matter, i.e., the nose.

          <td>The other way is as follows. The natural philosopher differs from the mathematician, as was said above [L3 #163], because the consideration of the natural philosopher is like the consideration of the snub, whereas that of the mathematician is like the consideration of the curved.

          <td>Concerning this, therefore, he makes two points. First he states what the ancients seem to have thought. He says that if one wishes to look at the sayings of the ancient natural philosophers, it seems that [for them] natural science is concerned only with matter.

        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Ars imitatur naturam; oportet igitur quod sic se habeat scientia naturalis circa naturalia, sicut se habet scientia artificialis circa artificialia. Sed eiusdem scientiae artificialis est cognoscere materiam et formam usque ad aliquem certum terminum; sicut medicus cognoscit sanitatem ut formam, et choleram et phlegma et huiusmodi sicut materiam in qua est sanitas, nam in contemperatione humorum sanitas consistit; et similiter aedificator considerat formam domus, et lateres et ligna, quae sunt materia domus; et ita est in omnibus aliis artibus. Ergo eiusdem scientiae naturalis est cognoscere tam materiam quam formam.
          <td>Art imitates nature. Therefore natural science must be related to natural things as the science of the artificial is related to artificial things. But it belongs to the same science of the artificial to know the matter and the form up to a certain point, as the doctor knows health as a form, and bile and phlegm and such things as the matter in which health is. For health consists in a harmony of humours. And in like manner the builder considers the form of the house and also the bricks and the wood which are the matter of the house. And so it is in all the other arts. Therefore it belongs to the same natural science to know both the matter and the form.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Eius autem quod ars imitatur naturam, ratio est, quia principium operationis artificialis cognitio est; omnis autem nostra cognitio est per sensus a rebus sensibilibus et naturalibus accepta: unde ad similitudinem rerum naturalium in artificialibus operamur. Ideo autem res naturales imitabiles sunt per artem, quia ab aliquo principio intellectivo tota natura ordinatur ad finem suum, ut sic opus naturae videatur esse opus intelligentiae, dum per determinata media ad certos fines procedit: quod etiam in operando ars imitatur.
          <td>171. The reason for saying that art imitates nature is as follows. Knowledge is the principle of operation in art. But an of our knowledge is through the senses and taken from sensible, natural things. Hence in artificial things we work to a likeness of natural things. And so imitable natural things are [i.e., are produced] through art, because all nature is ordered to its end by some intellective principle, so that the work of nature thus seems to be the work of intelligence as it proceeds to certain ends through determinate means. And this order is imitated by art in its operation.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secundam rationem ponit ibi: adhuc quod cuius causa et cetera.
          <td>172. He gives the second argument where he says, ‘Again “that for the sake of which”...’ (194 a 27).
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Eiusdem scientiae est considerare finem et ea quae sunt ad finem: et hoc ideo quia ratio eorum quae sunt ad finem, a fine sumitur. Sed natura quae est forma, est finis materiae; ergo eiusdem scientiae naturalis est considerare materiam et formam.
          <td>It belongs to the same science to consider the end and those things which are for the end. This is so because the reason [ <i>ratio</i> ] for those things which are for the end is taken from the end. But nature, which is form, is the end of matter. Therefore it belongs to the same natural science to consider matter and form.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Quod autem forma sit finis materiae, sic probat. Ad hoc quod aliquid sit finis alicuius motus continui, duo requiruntur: quorum unum est quod sit ultimum motus, et aliud est quod sit cuius causa fit. Aliquid enim potest esse ultimum, sed non est cuius causa fit; unde non habet rationem finis. Et quia de ratione finis est quod sit cuius causa fit, poeta hoc apposuit, quod derisorie se habet dicere finem cuius causa fit. Videtur enim esse nugatio, sicut si diceretur homo animal: quia animal est de ratione hominis, sicut et cuius causa fit de ratione finis. Vult enim poeta quod non omne ultimum sit finis, sed illud quod est ultimum et optimum, hoc est cuius causa fit.
          <td>173. That form is the end of matter he proves as follows. In order for something to be the end of a continuous motion two things are required. First it must be the final stage of the motion, and secondly it must be that for the sake of which the thing comes to be. For something can be last, but not be that for the sake of which something comes to be, and hence not have the nature [ <i>ratio</i> ] of an end. And because it is of the nature [ <i>ratio</i> ] of an end that it be that for the sake of which something comes to be, the poet maintained that it would be a jest to say that the end is that for the sake of which something comes to be. This seemed to him to be a trifle, for just as if we were to say ‘man animal’ because animal is in the nature [ <i>ratio</i> ] of man, so also, that for the sake of which something comes to be is in the nature [ <i>ratio</i> ] of end. For the poet wished to say that not every last thing is an end, but rather only that which is last and best. This is that for the sake of which something comes to be.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Et quidem quod forma sit ultimum generationis, hoc est per se manifestum. Sed quod sit cuius causa fit respectu materiae, manifestat per similitudinem in artibus.

          <td>And indeed that the form is last in generation is <i>per se</i> evident. But that it is that for the sake of which something comes to be with respect to matter is made clear by a simile taken from the arts. Certain arts make matter. And of these some make it simply, as the art of the moulder makes tiles which are the matter of a house, while others make it operative, i.e., they dispose matter pre-existing in nature for the reception of a form, as the art of the carpenter prepares wood for the form of a ship.

          <td>Item considerandum est quod nos utimur omnibus quae sunt secundum artem facta, sicut propter nos existentibus. Nos enim sumus quodammodo finis omnium artificialium.

          <td>It must further be noted that we use all things which are made by art as though they exist for us. For we are in a sense the end of all artificial things. And he says ‘in a sense’ because, as is said in first philosophy [ <i>Metaph</i>. XII:7], that for the sake of which something comes to be is used in two ways, i.e., ‘of which’ and ‘for which’. Thus the end of a house as ‘of which’ is the dweller, as ‘for which’ it is a dwelling.

Et haec est sicut architectonica respectu eius quae disponit materiam, sicut navifactiva respectu carpentariae, quae secat ligna: unde etiam oportet quod ipsa ars usualis sit quodammodo architectonica, idest principalis ars, respectu factivae.
          <td>From this, therefore, we can conclude that matter is ordered by two arts, that is, those that direct the arts which make matter, and those that pass judgment on the former. Thus there is one art which uses, and another art which is productive of the artifact, as it were, inducing the form. And this latter art is architectonic with reference to that which disposes matter. Thus the art of the ship builder is architectonic with respect to the art of the carpenter who cuts wood. Hence it is necessary that the art which uses be in a sense architectonic, i.e., the principal art, with respect to the productive art.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Quamvis igitur utraque sit architectonica, scilicet usualis et factiva, tamen differunt: quia usualis est architectonica inquantum est cognoscitiva et diiudicativa de forma; alia autem, quae est architectonica tanquam factiva formae, est cognoscitiva materiae, idest diiudicat de materia. Et hoc manifestat per exemplum. Usus enim navis pertinet ad gubernatorem; et sic gubernatoria est usualis; et sic est architectonica respectu navifactivae, et cognoscit et diiudicat de forma. Et hoc est quod dicit, quod gubernator cognoscit et instituit qualis debeat esse forma temonis. Alius autem, scilicet factor navis, cognoscit et diiudicat ex quibus et qualibus lignis debeat fieri navis.
          <td>Therefore, although each is architectonic, i.e., the art which uses and the productive art, they nevertheless differ. For the art which uses is architectonic insofar as it knows and passes judgment on the form, whereas the other, which is architectonic as productive of the form, knows the matter, i.e., passes judgment on the matter. He makes this clear by an example. The use of a ship pertains to the navigator, and thus the art of the navigator is an art which uses, and hence it is architectonic with respect to the art of the ship builder, and knows and passes judgment on the form. He says that the navigator knows and judges what the shape of the rudder should be. The other art, however, i.e., the art of the ship builder, knows and judges from what wood and from what kind of wood the ship should be made.

          <td>From this, then, we can conclude that matter is related to form as form is related to use. But use is that for the sake of which the artifact comes to be. Therefore, form also is that for the sake of which matter is in artificial things. And so as in those things which are according to art we make matter for the sake of the work of art, which is the artifact itself, likewise matter is in natural things from nature, and not made by us; nevertheless it has the same ordination to form, i.e., it is for the sake of form.

However it is not spoken of as if matter itself were in the genus of relation, but rather because a proper matter is determined for each form.

          <td>Concerning this he makes two points. First he raises the question, i.e., to what extent should natural science consider the form and quiddity of a thing. (For to consider the forms and quiddities of things absolutely seems to belong to first philosophy.)

Et similiter naturalis non considerat de forma inquantum est forma, sed inquantum est in materia. Et ideo sicut medicus in tantum considerat de nervo in quantum pertinet ad sanitatem, cuius causa considerat nervum; similiter naturalis in tantum considerat de forma in quantum habet esse in materia.
          <td>Secondly, he answers the question by saying that as the doctor considers nerves, and the smith considers bronze, up to a certain point, so also the natural philosopher considers forms. For the doctor does not consider nerve insofar as it is nerve, for this belongs to the natural philosopher. Rather he considers it as a subject of health. So also the smith does not consider bronze insofar as it is bronze, but insofar as it is the subject of a statue or something of the sort. So also the natural philosopher does not consider form insofar as it is form, but insofar as it is in matter. And thus, as the doctor considers nerve only insofar as it pertains to health, for the sake of which he considers nerve, so also the natural philosopher considers form only insofar as it has existence in matter.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Et ideo terminus considerationis scientiae naturalis est circa formas quae quidem sunt aliquo modo separatae, sed tamen esse habent in materia.

          <td>And so the last things considered by natural science are forms which are, indeed, in some way separated, but which have existence in matter. And rational souls are forms of this sort. For such souls are, indeed, separated insofar as the intellective power is not the act of a corporeal organ, as the power of seeing is the act of an eye. But they are in matter insofar as they give natural existence to such a body.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Et quod sint in materia, per hoc probat, quod forma cuiuslibet rei generatae ex materia est forma in materia: ad hoc enim terminatur generatio, ut forma sit in materia.

Unde usque ad animam rationalem se extendit consideratio naturalis, quae est de formis.
          <td>That such souls are in matter he proves as follows. The form of anything generated from matter is a form which is in matter. For the generation is-terminated when the form is in matter. But man is generated from matter and by man, as by a proper agent, and by the sun, as by a universal agent with respect to the generable. Whence it follows that the soul, which is the human form, is a form in matter. Hence the consideration of natural science about forms extends to the rational soul.

          <td>But how forms are totally separated from matter, and what they are, or even how this form, i.e., the rational soul, exists insofar as it is separable and capable of existence without a body, and what it is according to its separable essence, are questions which pertain to first philosophy.

Again (3) the primary source of the change or coming to rest; e.g. the man who gave advice is a cause, the father is cause of the child, and generally what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is changed. Again (4) in the sense of end or 'that for the sake of which' a thing is done, e.g. health is the cause of walking about. ('Why is he walking about?' we say. 'To be healthy', and, having said that, we think we have assigned the cause.) The same is true also of all the intermediate steps which are brought about through the action of something else as means towards the end, e.g. reduction of flesh, purging, drugs, or surgical instruments are means towards health. All these things are 'for the sake of' the end, though they differ from one another in that some are activities, others instruments.

These are causes of the statue qua statue, not in virtue of anything else that it may be—only not in the same way, the one being the material cause, the other the cause whence the motion comes. Some things cause each other reciprocally, e.g. hard work causes fitness and vice versa, but again not in the same way, but the one as end, the other as the origin of change. Further the same thing is the cause of contrary results. For that which by its presence brings about one result is sometimes blamed for bringing about the contrary by its absence.

But the seed and the doctor and the adviser, and generally the maker, are all sources whence the change or stationariness originates, while the others are causes in the sense of the end or the good of the rest; for 'that for the sake of which' means what is best and the end of the things that lead up to it. (Whether we say the 'good itself or the 'apparent good' makes no difference.) Such then is the number and nature of the kinds of cause.

Et ita ad hunc modum causae reducuntur omnes partes quae ponuntur in definitione: nam partes speciei ponuntur in definitione, non autem partes materiae, ut dicitur in VII Metaphys. Nec est hoc contra id quod supra dictum est, quod in definitione rerum naturalium ponitur materia: nam in definitione speciei non ponitur materia individualis, sed materia communis; sicut in definitione hominis ponuntur carnes et ossa, non autem hae carnes et haec ossa.
          <td>And as was said above that even the genera of matter are called causes, so also the genera of a species are called causes. And he gives as an example that harmony of music which is called the octave. The form of an octave is a proportion of the double, which is a relation of two to one. For musical harmonies are constituted by the application of numerical proportions to sounds as to matter. And since two or the double is the form of that harmony which is the octave, the genus of two, which is number, is also a cause. Thus just as we say that the form of the octave is that proportion of two to one which is the proportion of the double, so also we can say that the form of the octave is that proportion of two to one which is multiplicity. And so all of the parts which are placed in the definition are reduced to this mode of cause. For the parts of the species are placed in the definition, but not the parts of the matter, as is said in <i>Metaphysics</i>, VII:10. Nor is this contrary to what was said above [L3 #163] about matter being placed in the definitions of natural things. For individual matter is not placed in the definition of the species, but common matter is. Thus flesh and bones are placed in’ the definition of man, but not this flesh and these bones.

          <td>The nature of the species, therefore, which is constituted of form and common matter, is related as a formal cause to the individual which participates in such a nature, and to this extent it is said that the parts which are placed in the definition pertain to the formal cause.

          <td>180. Next he says that that from which there is a beginning of motion or rest is in some way called a cause. Thus one who gives advice is a cause, and the father is a cause of the son, and everything which brings about a change is a cause of that which is changed.

          <td>The advising cause, which operates in those things which act because of something proposed to them, is that which gives to the agent the form through which it acts. For the agent acts because of something proposed to him through his knowledge, which the advisor has given to him, just as in natural things the generator is said to move the heavy or the light insofar as he gives the form through which they are moved.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Quartum autem modum causae ponit, quod aliquid dicitur causa ut finis; et hoc est cuius causa aliquid fit, sicut sanitas dicitur ambulationis. Et hoc patet quia respondetur ad quaestionem factam propter quid: cum enim quaerimus propter quid ambulat? Dicimus ut sanetur; et hoc dicentes opinamur nos assignare causam. Ideo autem potius probat de fine quod sit causa quam de aliis, quia hoc minus videbatur propterea quia finis est ultimum in generatione.
          <td>181. Further, he posits a fourth mode of cause. A thing is called a cause as an end. This is that for the sake of which something comes to be, as health is said to be a cause of walking. And this is evident because it answers the proposed question ‘why’. For when we ask, ‘Why does he walk?’, we say, ‘That he may become healthy’; and we say this thinking that we assign a cause. And thus he gives more proof that the end is a cause than that the other things are causes, because the end is less evident, inasmuch as it is last in generation.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Et ulterius addit quod omnia quae sunt intermedia inter primum movens et ultimum finem, omnia sunt quodammodo fines: sicut medicus ad sanitatem inducendam extenuat corpus, et sic sanitas est finis maciei; maciem autem operatur per purgationem; purgationem autem per potionem; potionem autem praeparat per aliqua instrumenta. Unde omnia haec sunt quodammodo finis: nam macies est finis purgationis, et purgatio potionis, et potio organorum, et organa sunt fines in operatione vel inquisitione organorum.
          <td>And he adds further that all things which are intermediates between the first mover and the ultimate end are in some way ends. Thus the doctor reduces the body in order to produce health, and so health is the end of thinness. But thinness is produced by purgation~ and purgation is produced by a drug, and the drug is prepared by instruments. Hence all of these things are in some way ends, for the thinness is the end of the purging, the purging is the end of the drug, and the drug is the end of the instruments, and the instruments are the ends in the operation or in the seeking for the instruments.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Et sic patet quod ista intermedia differunt ad invicem, inquantum quaedam sunt organa et quaedam opera, operata scilicet per organa. Et hoc inducit ne aliquis credat quod solum id quod est ultimum sit causa sicut cuius gratia, propter hoc quod hoc nomen finis ultimum quoddam esse videtur. Est igitur omnis finis ultimum non simpliciter, sed respectu alicuius.
          <td>And thus it is clear that these intermediate things differ from each other insofar as some of them are instruments and some of them are operations performed by instruments. And he brings this out lest anyone think that only that which is last is a cause in the sense of ‘that for the sake of which’. For the name ‘end’ seems to refer to something which is last. Thus every end is last, not simply, but in respect to something.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Et ultimo concludit quod fere tot modis dicuntur causae. Et addit fere, propter causas quae sunt per accidens, sicut sunt casus et fortuna.

          <td>Deinde cum dicit: contingit autem multipliciter etc., manifestat tria consequentia ex iam dicta causarum diversitate.
          <td>182. Next where he says, ‘As the word has...’ (195 a 3), he makes clear three things which follow from what he has said about the different causes.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Quorum primum est quod cum causae dicantur multipliciter, contingit unius et eiusdem esse multas causas per se et non per accidens; sicut causa statuae est ars statuifica ut efficiens, et aes ut materia. Et inde est quod aliquando unius rei assignantur plures definitiones secundum diversas causas; sed perfecta definitio omnes causas complectitur.
          <td>The first point is that since there are many causes, then one and the same thing has many causes <i>per se</i>, and not <i>per accidens</i>. Thus the art of the sculptor is a cause of a statue as an efficient cause, and bronze is a cause as matter. And so it is that many definitions of one thing are sometimes given in accordance with the different causes. But the perfect definition embraces all of the causes.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secundum est quod quaedam sibi invicem sunt causae secundum diversam speciem causae; sicut laborare est causa efficiens bonae habitudinis, bona autem habitudo est causa finalis laboris. Nihil enim prohibet aliquid esse prius et posterius altero secundum diversas rationes: finis enim est prius secundum rationem, sed posterius in esse; agens autem e converso. Et similiter forma est prior quam materia secundum rationem complementi, materia autem est prius quam forma generatione et tempore in omni eo quod movetur de potentia in actum.
          <td>The second point is that some things are causes of each other in respect to different species of cause. Thus work is an efficient cause of a good habit, yet a good habit is a final cause of work. For nothing prevents a thing from being prior and posterior to another according to different aspects [ <i>ratio</i> ]. The end is prior according to reason [ <i>ratio</i> ], but posterior in existence; the converse is true of the agent. And in like manner, the form is prior to matter in respect to the nature [ <i>ratio</i> ] of being a complement, but the matter is prior to form in respect to generation and time in everything which is moved from potency to act.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Tertium est quod idem est causa contrariorum quandoque; sicut per suam praesentiam gubernator est causa salutis navis, per absentiam autem suam causa est submersionis eius.
          <td>The third point is that the same thing is, at times, the cause of contraries. Thus through his presence the navigator is the cause of the safety of the ship, through his absence, however, he is a cause of its sinking.

          <td>183. Next where he says, ‘All the causes...’(195 a 15), he reduces all the causes mentioned above to four species. He says that all the causes enumerated above are reduced to four modes, which are evident. For the elements, i.e., the letters, are causes of syllables, and in like manner earth is a cause of vases, and silver of a vial, and fire and such things, i.e., the simple bodies, are causes of bodies. And in the same way every part is a cause of the whole, and the propositions in a syllogism are a cause of the conclusion. And all of these things are understood as causes in the same way, namely, as that from which something comes to be is called a cause, for this is common to all the instances mentioned above.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Omnium autem nunc enumeratorum, quaedam se habent ut materia et quaedam ut forma, quae causat quidditatem rei: sicut omnes partes se habent ut materia, ut elementa syllabarum et quatuor elementa corporum mistorum; sed ea quae important totum vel compositionem vel quamcumque speciem, se habent in ratione formae; ut species referatur ad formas simplicium, totum autem et compositio ad formas compositorum.
          <td>However, of all the things just enumerated some are causes as matter, and some as form, which causes the quiddity of the thing. Thus all parts, such as the elements of syllables, and the four elements of mixed bodies, are causes as matter.

Thus species is referred to the forms of simple things, and the whole and composition are referred to the forms of composites.

          <td>184. But there seems to be two difficulties here.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Primo quidem de hoc quod dicit, quod partes sunt causae materiales totius, cum supra partes definitionis reduxerit ad causam formalem..
          <td>The first is the fact that he says that the parts are material causes of the whole, whereas above [#179] he reduced the parts of the definition to the formal cause.

          <td>Et potest dici quod supra locutus est de partibus speciei, quae cadunt in definitione totius: hic autem loquitur de partibus materiae, in quarum definitione cadit totum, sicut circulus cadit in definitione semicirculi
          <td>It can be said that he spoke above of the parts of the species which fall in the definition of the whole. But here he speaks of the parts of the matter in whose definition falls the whole. Thus circle falls in the definition of semicircle.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sed melius dicendum est quod licet partes speciei quae ponuntur in definitione, comparentur ad suppositum naturae per modum causae formalis, tamen ad ipsam naturam cuius sunt partes, comparantur ut materia: nam omnes partes comparantur ad totum ut imperfectum ad perfectum, quae quidem est comparatio materiae ad formam.
          <td>But it would be better to say that, although the parts of the species which are placed in the definition are related to the supposit of nature as a formal cause, they are, nevertheless, related to the very nature of which they are parts as matter. For all parts are related to the whole as the imperfect to the perfect, which is, indeed, the relation of matter to form.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Item potest esse dubium de hoc quod dicit, quod propositiones sunt materia conclusionis. Materia enim inest ei cuius est materia: unde supra notificans causam materialem, dixit quod est ex quo fit aliquid cum insit; propositiones autem sunt seorsum a conclusione.
          <td>Further a difficulty can be raised with reference to what he says about propositions being the matter of conclusions. For matter is in that of which it is the matter. Hence speaking of the material cause above [#178] he said that it is that from which something comes to be when it is in it. But propositions are apart from the conclusion.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sed dicendum quod ex terminis propositionum constituitur conclusio: unde secundum hoc propositiones dicuntur materia conclusionis, in quantum termini, qui sunt materia propositionum, sunt etiam materia conclusionis, licet non secundum quod stant sub ordine propositionum; sicut et farina dicitur materia panis, licet non secundum quod stat sub forma farinae. Ideo tamen potius dicuntur propositiones materia conclusionis quam e converso, quia termini qui coniunguntur in conclusione, separatim ponuntur in praemissis. Sic igitur habemus duos modos causae.
          <td>But it must be pointed out that the conclusion is formed from the terms of the propositions. Hence in view of this the propositions are said to be the matter of the conclusion insofar as the terms which are the matter of the propositions are also the matter of the conclusion, although they are not in the same order as they are in the propositions. In this same way flour is called the matter of bread, but not insofar as it stands under the form of flour. And so propositions are better called the matter of the conclusion than conversely. For the terms which are joined in the conclusion are posited separately in the premises. Thus we have two modes of cause.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Quaedam vero dicuntur esse causae secundum aliam rationem, quia scilicet sunt principium motus et quietis.

          <td>185. Some things are called causes for another reason, i.e., because they are a principle of motion and rest. And in this way the seed which is active in generation is called a cause.

For although propositions, insofar as their terms are concerned, are the matter of the conclusion, as was said above [#184], nevertheless insofar as their inferential power is concerned, they are reduced to this genus of cause. For the principle of the discourse of reason to its conclusion is from propositions.

          <td>186. Another meaning of cause is found in other causes, i.e., insofar as the end or the good has the nature [ <i>ratio</i> ] of a cause. And this species of cause is the most powerful of all the causes, for the final cause is the cause of the other causes. It is clear that the agent acts for the sake of the end. And likewise it was shown above [L4 #173] in regard to artificial things that the form is ordered to use as to an end, and matter is ordered to form as to an end. And to this extent the end is called the cause of causes.

          <td>Now since he has said that this species of cause has the nature of a good, while sometimes in those things which act by choice it happens that the end is evil, he forestalls this difficulty by saying that it makes no difference whether the final cause is a true or an apparent good.

          <td>Dicit ergo primo quod multi numero sunt modi causarum: sed si reducantur capitulatim, sive in quadam summa, ad aliqua communia, inveniuntur pauciores. Vel capitales accipiuntur secundum combinationem: manifestum est enim quod pauciores sunt combinationes modorum quam modi.
          <td>He says, therefore, first that the modes of causes are numerous, but if they are reduced to headings, either under some highest, or under some common aspect, they are found to be fewer. Or ‘headings’ may be taken as a combination, for it is obvious that combinations of the modes are fewer than the modes.

          <td>Prima ergo divisio vel combinatio modorum est, quod in eadem specie causae dicitur una causa prior altera, ut intelligamus causam priorem universaliorem: ut sanitatis causa est medicus ut causa propria et posterior, artifex autem ut communior et prior; et hoc in specie causae efficientis. Et simile est in specie causae formalis: nam causa formalis diapason propria et posterior est proportio dupla; causa autem prior et communior est proportio numeralis, quae dicitur multiplicitas. Et similiter ea quae continet unamquamque causam communitate sui ambitus, dicitur causa prior.
          <td>188. Therefore the first division or combination of modes is that in the same species of cause one cause is said to be prior to another, as when we understand that the more universal cause is prior. Thus the doctor is the proper and posterior cause of health, whereas the artisan is the more common and prior cause. This is in the species of efficient cause. And the same thing is true in the species of formal cause. For the proper and posterior formal cause of the octave is the proportion of the double, whereas the more common and prior is the numerical proportion which is called multiplicity. And in like manner a cause which contains any cause in the community of its extension is a prior cause.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Advertendum est autem quod causa universalis et propria, vel prior et posterior, potest accipi aut secundum communitatem praedicationis, secundum exempla hic posita de medico et artifice; vel secundum communitatem causalitatis, ut si dicamus solem esse causam universalem calefactionis, ignem vero causam propriam: et haec duo sibi invicem correspondent.
          <td>189. It must be noted, however, that the universal cause and the proper cause, and the prior cause and the posterior cause, can be taken either according to a commonness in predication, as in the example given about the doctor and the artisan, or according to a commonness in causality, as if we say the sun is a universal cause of heating, whereas fire is a proper cause. And these two divisions correspond to each other.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Manifestum est enim quod quaelibet virtus extenditur ad aliqua secundum quod communicant in una ratione obiecti; et quanto ad plura extenditur, tanto oportet illam rationem esse communiorem: et cum virtus proportionetur obiecto secundum eius rationem, sequitur quod causa superior agat secundum formam magis universalem et minus contractam. Et sic est considerare in ordine rerum: quia quanto aliqua sunt superiora in entibus, tanto habent formas minus contractas, et magis dominantes supra materiam, quae coarctat virtutem formae. Unde et id quod est prius in causando, invenitur esse prius quodammodo secundum rationem universalioris praedicationis; ut puta, si ignis est primum calefaciens, caelum non tantum est primum calefaciens, sed primum alterans.
          <td>For it is clear that any power extends to certain things insofar as they share in one nature [ <i>ratio</i> ], and the farther that that power extends, the more common that nature [ <i>ratio</i> ] must be. And since a power is proportioned to its object according to its nature [ <i>ratio</i> ], it follows that a higher cause acts according to a form which is more universal and less contracted. And this can be seen in the order of things. For to the extent that among beings some things are superior, to that extent they have forms which are less contracted and more dominant over matter, which contracts the power of form. And so that which is prior in causing is found to be prior in some way under the aspect [ <i>ratio</i> ] of a more universal predication. For example, if fire is the first in heating, then the heavens are not only the first in heating but also the first in producing alteration.

          <td>For besides <i>per se</i> causes there are <i>per accidens</i> causes and their genera. Thus Polycletus is. a <i>per accidens</i> cause of the statue, while the sculptor is a <i>per se</i> cause. For Polycletus is a cause of statue insofar as he happens to be a sculptor. And in like manner those things which contain Polycletus in their commonness, e.g., man and animal, are <i>per accidens</i> causes of statue.

          <td>Et iterum considerandum est quod in causis per accidens quaedam sunt propinquiores causis per se, et quaedam magis remotae. Nam causa per accidens dicitur omne illud quod coniungitur causae per se, quod non est de ratione eius; hoc autem contingit esse vel propinquius rationi causae, vel remotius ab ea; et secundum hoc causae per accidens erunt vel propinquiores vel remotiores: sicut, si statuam facienti accidat esse album et musicum, musicum propinquius est, quia est in eodem subiecto et secundum idem, scilicet secundum animam, in qua est musica et ars statuae factiva; album autem inest secundum corpus. Sed subiectum propinquius se habet adhuc quam alia accidentia, sicut Polycletus quam album vel musicum: non enim coniunguntur haec statuam facienti nisi propter subiectum.
          <td>Moreover it must be noted that among <i>per accidens</i> causes some are closer to the <i>per se</i> causes and some are more removed. For everything which is joined to the <i>per se</i> cause but is not of its nature [ <i>ratio</i> ] is called a <i>per accidens</i> cause. Now a thing can be closer to the nature [ <i>ratio</i> ] of the [ <i>per se</i> ] cause or more removed from it, and to this extent the <i>per accidens</i> causes are closer or more removed. Thus, if a sculptor happens to be white and musical, the musical is closer, because it is in the same subject in respect to the same thing, i.e., in respect to the soul in which are both [the art of the] musician and the art of statue making. But the subject itself is still more closely related than the other accidents. Thus Polycletus is closer than white or musical, for these latter are not joined to this sculptor except through the subject.

          <td>He says that besides the causes properly so called, i.e., the causes <i>per se</i> and the causes <i>per accidens</i>, some things are said to be causes in potency, as being able to operate, while other things are actually operating causes. Thus either the builder in habit or the builder in act can be called the cause of the building of a house.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Et sicut distinguuntur causae modis praedictis, similiter distinguuntur ea quorum sunt causae.

Et similiter si dicatur aliquid causa motiva huius aeris, vel aeris in universali, vel materiae.
          <td>192. And just as causes are distinguished according to the above mentioned modes, so also the things of which they are the causes are distinguished. For one thing is caused posteriorly and more properly, and another priorly and more commonly. Thus something might be called the cause of this statue, or of statue in general, or still more commonly it might be called the cause of an image. And likewise something might be called the moving cause of this bronze, or of bronze in the universal, or of matter.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Et ita etiam potest dici in effectibus per accidens, et quod aliquid sit communius, et aliquid minus commune.

          <td>So also, in <i>per accidens</i> effects, it can be said that one thing is more common and another less common. An effect is said to be <i>per accidens</i> when it is joined to a <i>per se</i> effect and is outside its nature [ <i>ratio</i> ]. Thus the <i>per se</i> effect of cooking is delectable food, but the <i>per accidens</i> effect is healthful food. However the converse is true of medicine.

These are the six modes: the singular and the genus, which above [#188] he called the prior and the posterior, the accident and the genus of the accident, the simple and the complex. And each of these is divided by potency and act; and so all the modes become twelve. He distinguishes all the modes by potency and act because what is in potency is not simply.

        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Primum est, quod inter causas in actu et causas in potentia est ista differentia, quod causae operantes in actu simul sunt et non sunt cum eis quorum causae sunt in actu; ita tamen quod accipiantur causae singulares, idest propriae; sicut hic medicans simul est et non est cum hoc qui fit sanus, et hic aedificans cum hoc quod aedificatur. Si vero non acciperentur causae propriae, licet acciperentur in actu, non esset verum quod dicitur. Non enim aedificans est et non est simul cum hoc quod aedificatur: potest enim esse quod est aedificans in actu, sed tamen hoc aedificium non aedificatur, sed aliud. Sed si accipiamus aedificantem hoc aedificium, et hoc aedificium secundum quod est in aedificari, necesse est quod posito uno ponatur et alterum, et remoto uno removeatur et alterum. Hoc autem non accidit semper in causis quae sunt in potentia: non enim simul corrumpitur domus et homo qui aedificavit ipsam.
          <td>The first point is that causes in act and causes in potency differ as follows. Causes operating in act exist and do not exist simultaneously with those things of which they are the causes in act. For example, if we take singular causes, i.e., proper causes, then this healer exists and does not exist simultaneously with him who becomes healed, and this builder exists simultaneously with that which is built. But this is not true if we take causes in act which are not proper causes. For it is not true that builder exists and does not exist simultaneously with that which is built. For it can happen that the builder is in act but this building is not being built, but some other. But if we take the one who is building this building, and if we take this building insofar as it is being built, then it is necessary that when one is posited, the other must be posited also, and when one is removed the other is removed. But this does not always happen in regard to causes which are in potency. For a home and the man who built it are not corrupted simultaneously.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Unde habetur quod sicut agentia inferiora, quae sunt causa rerum quantum ad suum fieri, oportet simul esse cum iis quae fiunt quandiu fiunt; ita agens divinum, quod est causa existendi in actu, simul est cum esse rei in actu. Unde subtracta divina actione a rebus, res in nihilum deciderent, sicut remota praesentia solis lumen in aere deficeret.
          <td>And thus it follows that just as inferior agents, which are causes of the coining to be of things, must exist simultaneously with the things which come to be as long as they are coming to be, so also the divine agent, which is the cause of existing in act, is simultaneous with the existence of the thing in act. Hence if the divine action were removed from things, things would fall into nothingness, just as when the presence of the sun is removed, light ceases to be in the air.

          <td>Secundum ponit ibi: oportet autem semper etc.; dicens quod in naturalibus oportet semper supremam causam uniuscuiusque requirere, sicut contingit in artificialibus. Ut si quaeramus quare homo aedificat, respondetur, quia est aedificator; et similiter si quaeramus quare est aedificator, respondetur, quia habet artem aedificativam: et hic statur, quia haec est prima causa in hoc ordine. Et ideo oportet in rebus naturalibus procedere usque ad causam supremam. Et hoc ideo est, quia effectus nescitur nisi sciatur causa; unde si alicuius effectus causa sit etiam alterius causae effectus, sciri non poterit nisi causa eius sciatur; et sic quousque perveniatur ad primam causam.
          <td>196. He sets forth the second point where he says, ‘In investigating the cause...’ (195 b 21). He says that it is necessary to seek in natural things the first cause of each thing, just as we do in artificial things. So if we should ask why it is that a man builds, we answer ‘because he is a builder’. Likewise, if we ask why he is a builder, we answer, ‘because he possesses the builder’s art’. And here the inquiry stops, because this is the first cause in this order. Hence in natural things we should proceed to the first cause. This is so because the effect is not known unless the cause is known. Hence if the cause of an effect is also the effect of some other cause, then it cannot be known unless its cause is known, and so on until we arrive at a first cause.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Tertium ponit ibi: amplius autem aliae et cetera. Et est, quod causis debent proportionaliter respondere effectus, ita quod generalibus causis generales effectus reddantur, et singularibus singulares; puta, si dicatur quod statuae causa est statuam faciens, et huius statuae hic statuam faciens. Et similiter causis in potentia respondent effectus in potentia, et causis in actu effectus in actu.
          <td>197. He sets forth the third point where he says, ‘Further generic effects...’ (195 b 25). Effects should correspond proportionally to causes so that general effects be referred to general causes and singular effects to singular causes. For example, if it is said that the cause of statue is sculptor, then the cause of this statue is this sculptor. In like manner effects in potency should correspond to causes in potency and effects in act to causes in act.

          <td>Quarum prima est, quia omnia ista quae dicuntur fieri a casu vel fortuna, inveniuntur habere aliquam causam determinatam, aliam a fortuna.

Et similiter est in omnibus aliis quae dicuntur esse a fortuna; quia habent aliquam aliam causam praeter fortunam. Et sic fortuna non videtur esse causa alicuius, et per consequens nec aliquid esse: quia non ponimus fortunam nisi inquantum aliqua ponimus esse a fortuna.
          <td>The first argument is that all of those things which are said to come to be by chance or fortune are found to have some determinate cause other than fortune. He gives an example of this sort of thing. If someone coming to the market place should find some man whom he wished to find, but who he did not previously believe would be found, we say that his finding of this man was due to fortune. But the cause of this finding is his will to buy, for the sake of which he went to the market where the man whom he sought was. And the same is true of all other things which are said to be by fortune, for they have some cause other than fortune. And so fortune does not seem to be a cause of anything, and consequently is nothing. For we do not posit fortune except insofar as we hold that some things exist by fortune.

Next where he says, ‘But there is a further circumstance...’ (196 a 11), he argues about this second proof, showing what he had assumed above, namely, that it is inconsistent that the ancient natural philosophers did not treat chance and fortune. He proves this with two arguments.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Quarum primam ponit dicens: et mirabile videtur, sicut et vere est, quod antiqui naturales de casu et fortuna non determinaverunt.

Nec excusantur propter rationem supra dictam destruentem fortunam et casum: quia licet homines non ignorarent quod contingit reducere unumquemque effectum in aliquam causam, sicut dixit praedicta opinio destruens fortunam et casum, nihilominus tamen posuerunt, non obstante hac ratione, quaedam fieri a fortuna et quaedam non. Unde ipsis philosophis naturalibus facienda erat mentio de fortuna et casu, saltem ut ostenderent falsum esse aliqua fieri a fortuna et casu; et ut assignarent rationem quare quaedam dicebantur esse a fortuna et quaedam non. Nec etiam possunt excusari per hoc quod casus et fortuna reducerentur in aliquam causarum ab eis positarum: non enim opinabantur quod fortuna sit aliquid eorum quae arbitrabantur esse causas, ut amicitiam aut litem aut aliquid huiusmodi.
          <td>His first argument is as follows. It seems remarkable, and indeed it is, that the ancient natural philosophers did not treat chance and fortune. For they assumed that they treated the causes of those things which come to be, yet there are many things which come to be by fortune and chance. Hence they should have treated fortune and chance. Nor are they to be excused by the argument given above [200] which denies fortune and chance. For although men know that every effect is reduced to some cause, as the above opinion which denies fortune and chance stated, nevertheless, regardless of this argument, these philosophers held that some things come to be by fortune, and other things do not. Hence these natural philosophers must make mention of fortune and chance at least in order to show that it is false that some things come to be by fortune and chance, and in order to point out the reason why some things are said to be by fortune and some not. Nor can they be excused by reason of the fact that chance and fortune would be reduced to one of the causes which they posited. For they did not think that fortune is one of the things which they thought to be causes, such as friendship or strife or some other such thing.

          <td>Secundam rationem ponit ibi: inconveniens igitur est et cetera.
          <td>202. He gives his second argument where he says, ‘This is strange...’ (196 a 19).
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Et dicit quod inconveniens est quod antiqui naturales reliquerunt tractare de fortuna, sive putaverunt fortunam esse sive non: quia si putaverunt fortunam esse, inconveniens fuit quod de ea non determinaverunt; si vero non putaverunt fortunam esse, inconveniens fuit quod ea aliquando usi sunt; sicut Empedocles, qui dixit quod aer non semper adunatur superius supra terram quasi hoc ei sit naturale, sed quia ita accidit a casu. Dicit enim quod quando mundus est factus, lite distinguente elementa, accidit quod aer se collegit in istum locum, et sicut tunc cucurrit, ita semper stante isto mundo cursum habebit: sed multoties in aliis mundis, quos ponebat infinities fieri et corrumpi, ut supra dictum est, aer aliter ordinatur inter partes universi. Et similiter dicebat quod plurimae partes animalium fiunt a fortuna; sicut quod in prima constitutione mundi fiebant capita sine cervice.
          <td>He says that whether they thought that fortune existed or not, it is inconsistent that the ancient natural philosophers neglected to treat fortune. For if they thought that there was fortune, it is inconsistent that they did not treat it; if, however, they thought that there was no fortune, it is inconsistent that they sometimes used it. For example, Empedocles said that air is not always united on high above the earth, as if this were natural to it, but rather this happens by chance. For he says that when the earth was made by strife distinguishing the elements, it happened that air gathered together in this place, and as it came together then, it will hold this course so long as the world remains. But in other worlds, which he held come to be and are corrupted to infinity, as was said above [I, L10 #76], air would be differently related in many ways to the parts of the universe. And likewise he said that the many parts of animals come to be by fortune, so that in the first production of the world, heads came to be without necks.

And they said that the revolution of the world, and the movement of the stars distinguishing and constituting the whole universe below according to this order, is by chance.

        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Quarum prima est quod admiratione dignum videtur quod animalia et plantae non fiunt a fortuna, sed ab intellectu vel natura, vel a quacumque alia causa determinata: quod ex hoc patet quod non ex quocumque semine aliquid generatur, sed ex determinato semine fit homo, et ex determinato semine oliva. Et cum ista inferiora non fiant a fortuna, dignum est admiratione quod caelum et ea quae sunt diviniora inter sensibilia manifesta nobis, scilicet partes mundi sempiternae, sint a casu, et non habeant aliquam causam determinatam, sicut animalia et plantae. Et si hoc verum est, dignum fuisset insistere, et assignare rationem quare sic esset: quod tamen antiqui praetermiserunt.
          <td>The first argument is that it would seem to be worthy of great wonder that animals and plants are not from fortune but from intellect or nature or some other determinate cause. For it is clear that a thing is not generated from any seed whatsoever, but man from a determinate seed, and the olive from a determinate seed. And since these inferior things do not come to be by fortune, it is worthy of wonder that the heavens and those things which are more divine among the sensible things obvious to us, e.g. the sempiternal parts of the world, are by chance, and should not have any determinate cause, as do animals and plants. And if this is true, it would have been worthwhile to insist and to give a reason why this is so. But the ancients failed to do this.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secundam rationem ponit, ibi: quomodo enim eo quod aliter etc., dicens: quomodo potest esse verum quod caelestia corpora sint a casu, et inferiora non: cum et aliter videatur esse inconveniens, ex hoc ipso quod illa nobiliora sunt; et adhuc etiam inconvenientius secundum ea quae videntur? Videmus enim quod in caelo nihil fit a casu; in his autem inferioribus, quae non dicuntur esse a casu, multa videntur contingere a fortuna. Rationabile autem esset e converso accidere secundum eorum positionem; ut scilicet in illis invenirentur aliqua fieri a casu vel a fortuna, quorum casus vel fortuna est causa; non autem in illis quorum non est causa.
          <td>205. He gives the second argument where he says, ‘For besides the other...’ (196 b 1). How can it be true that the celestial bodies are by chance, while inferior bodies are not? This seems to be inconsistent first from the fact that they are the nobler, and secondly it is even more inconsistent in the light of what is seen. For we see that in the heavens nothing comes to be by chance, whereas in inferior bodies, which are not said to be by chance, many things seem to happen by fortune. According to their position it would be more reasonable if the converse were true, so that in those things whose cause is chance or fortune, some things would be found to come to be by chance or by fortune, whereas in those things whose cause is not chance or fortune, these latter would not be found.

Unde magis debet dici fortuna causa inferior, quae de se non habet ordinem ad eventum fortuitum, quam causa superior, si qua sit ordinans.
          <td>But although this opinion has a radical truth, they did not use the name ‘fortune’ well. For that divine thing which orders cannot be called or named fortune, because to the extent that a thing participates in reason or order, it recedes from the nature [ <i>ratio</i> ] of fortune. Hence, the inferior cause, which of itself does not have an ordination to the fortuitous event, should much more be called fortune than the superior cause, if such a cause is the one which orders.

          <td>He omits an inquiry about this opinion, both because it exceeds the bounds of natural science, and because he shows below [L8 #214] that fortune is not a <i>per se</i> cause, but a <i>per accidens</i> cause. Hence how he evaluates these opinions will be made more clear in what follows. And so he concludes that for the clarification of these opinions, we must consider what fortune and chance are, and whether they are the same or different, and how they are reduced to the causes mentioned above.

(The distinction between the two must be made later—for the present it is sufficient if it is plain that both are in the sphere of things done for the sake of something.) Example: A man is engaged in collecting subscriptions for a feast. He would have gone to such and such a place for the purpose of getting the money, if he had known. He actually went there for another purpose and it was only incidentally that he got his money by going there; and this was not due to the fact that he went there as a rule or necessarily, nor is the end effected (getting the money) a cause present in himself—it belongs to the class of things that are intentional and the result of intelligent deliberation. It is when these conditions are satisfied that the man is said to have gone 'by chance'. If he had gone of deliberate purpose and for the sake of this—if he always or normally went there when he was collecting payments—he would not be said to have gone 'by chance'.

          <td>But certain other things occur in fewer instances, as when a man is born with six fingers or without eyes. And everyone says that things of this sort come to be by fortune. Hence, it is clear that fortune is something, since to be by fortune and to be in fewer instances are convertible. And he brings this up in opposition to the first opinion which denied fortune.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Videtur autem divisio philosophi esse insufficiens, quia etiam quaedam contingentia sunt ad utrumlibet. Avicenna ergo dixit quod in his quae sunt ad utrumlibet, contingit aliquid esse a fortuna, sicut ea quae sunt in minori parte. Nec obstat quod non dicitur esse a fortuna quod Socrates sedeat, cum hoc sit ad utrumlibet: quia licet hoc sit ad utrumlibet respectu potentiae motivae, non tamen est ad utrumlibet respectu potentiae appetitivae, quae determinate tendit in unum; praeter quam si aliquid accideret, diceretur esse fortuitum.
          <td>209. However, it seems that this division of the Philosopher is insufficient, for there are some happenings which are indeterminate. Therefore Avicenna said that in those things which are indeterminate a thing happens to be by fortune, as for example those things which are occasional. And it is no objection that it is not said that it is by fortune that Socrates sits, since this is indeterminate. For although this is indeterminate with respect to the moving potency, it is not indeterminate with respect to the appetitive potency which tends determinately to one thing. And if something should happen outside of this, it would be said to be fortuitous.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">

Unde ex eo quod est ad utrumlibet nihil sequitur, nisi per aliquid aliud quod determinat ad unum, vel sicut semper vel sicut frequenter. Et propter hoc in iis quae fiunt, praetermisit ea quae sunt ad utrumlibet.
          <td>Now just as the moving potency, which is indeterminate, does not move to act unless it is determined to one thing by the appetitive potency, so also nothing which is indeterminate moves to act unless it is determined to one thing by something. For that which is indeterminate is, as it were, being in potency. However, potency is not a principle of action, but only act is such. Hence from that which is indeterminate nothing follows unless it is determined to one thing by something, either always or frequently. And because of this, he omitted things which are indeterminate from his discussion of things which come to be.

For that is called necessary which has in its nature that which cannot not be, whereas the contingent, as happening frequently, has in its nature that which can not be.

          <td>212. He gives the third division where he says, ‘Again, some of the former...’ (196 b 18). He says that of the things which come to be for the sake of an end, some happen in accordance with will and others do not. Both of these are found among those things which come to be for the sake of something.

          <td>213. Now since those things which come to be either necessarily or frequently come to be from nature or from that which is proposed [by the intellect], it is clear that both in those things which always happen and in those things which happen frequently there are some things which come to be for an end. For both nature and that which is proposed [by the intellect] act for the sake of an end.

          <td>He says that when things of this sort (i.e., things which are from what is proposed [by the intellect] for the sake of something, and which are in few instances) come to be through a <i>per accidens</i> cause, we say that they are by fortune. For as certain aspects of beings are <i>per se</i> and others <i>per accidens</i>, the same is true of causes. Thus the <i>per se</i> cause of a house is the builder’s art, while the <i>per accidens</i> cause is the white or the musical.

        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Et hoc modo dicitur fortuna esse causa per accidens, ex eo quod effectui aliquid coniungitur per accidens; utpote si fossurae sepulcri adiungatur per accidens inventio thesauri. Sicut enim effectus per se causae naturalis est quod consequitur secundum exigentiam suae formae, ita effectus causae agentis a proposito est illud quod accidit ex intentione agentis: unde quidquid provenit in effectu praeter intentionem, est per accidens.
          <td>In this sense fortune is said to be a <i>per accidens</i> cause when something is accidentally, joined to the effect, for example, if the discovery of a treasure is accidentally joined to the digging of a grave. Thus the <i>per se</i> effect of a natural cause is what follows according to the exigencies of its form, so that the effect of the agent who acts through something proposed [by the intellect] is that which happens because of the intention of the agent. Hence whatever takes place in the effect outside this intention is <i>per accidens</i>.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Et hoc dico si id quod est praeter intentionem ut in paucioribus consequatur: quod enim vel semper vel ut frequenter coniungitur effectui, cadit sub eadem intentione. Stultum est enim dicere quod aliquis intendat aliquid, et non velit illud quod ut frequenter vel semper adiungitur.
          <td>And I say that this is true if what is outside the intention follows in few cases. For what is always or frequently joined to the effect falls under the intention itself. For it is stupid to say that someone intends something but does not will that which is always or frequently joined to it.

          <td>Moreover, he points out a difference between the <i>per se</i> cause the <i>per accidens</i> cause. The <i>per se</i> cause is limited and determinate, whereas the <i>per accidens</i> cause is unlimited and indeterminate, because an infinity of things can happen to be united.

          <td>Et dicit primo quod fortuna et casus, ut prius dictum est, sunt in iis quae fiunt propter aliquid. Differentia autem casus et fortunae posterius determinabitur.

Et sic patet quod fortuna est causa per accidens eorum quae sunt propter aliquid.
          <td>But now it should be clear that each of them is contained among those things which act for the sake of an end. Thus if one knows that he will receive money in the forum, and if he goes there to take it away, [this does not happen by fortune], but if he did not go there for this purpose, it is <i>per accidens</i> that his arrival should have this effect.

Sed si aliquis hoc proposito iret ut pecuniam reportaret, vel semper aut frequenter reportaret quando venit, non diceretur esse a fortuna: sicut si aliquis frequenter aut semper madefacit sibi pedes, quando vadit ad locum lutosum, et hoc licet non intendat, tamen hoc non dicitur esse a fortuna.
          <td>Moreover, fortune pertains to those things which come to be because of what is proposed [by the intellect]. For taking money away, which is said to be by fortune, is the end of some causes, but not in itself, as in those things which happen by nature. Rather it is the end of those things which come to be as proposed by the intellect. But if someone acting under such a proposal should go in order to take money away, or if he always or frequently takes money away when he comes, this would not be said to be by fortune, just as if anyone frequently or always soaks his feet when he goes to a muddy place, it would not be said that this is due to fortune, even though he did not intend it.

          <td>Et dicit manifestum esse ex praemissis quod fortuna est causa per accidens in his quae fiunt secundum propositum propter finem in minori parte.

          <td>He says that it is clear from the foregoing that fortune is a <i>per accidens</i> cause in those things which come to be in a few instances according to what is proposed for the sake of an end. And from this it is clear that fortune and intellect pertain to the same thing. For only those who have an intellect act by fortune, for there is no proposal or will without intellect. And although only those who have an intellect act by fortune, still the more something is subject to the intellect, the less is it subject to fortune.

But strictly it is not the cause—without qualification—of anything; for instance, a housebuilder is the cause of a house; incidentally, a fluteplayer may be so. And the causes of the man's coming and getting the money (when he did not come for the sake of that) are innumerable.

For all of those things which others say about fortune are in a certain respect true, because they have some meaning [ <i>ratio</i> ]. Since fortune is a <i>per accidens</i> cause, it follows that what is by fortune is something <i>per accidens</i>. But what is <i>per accidens</i> is not simply. Hence it follows that fortune is not the cause of anything simply.

Sed haec causa per accidens infinita est: quia infinitis aliis de causis potest homo ire ad locum illum; puta si vadat causa visitandi aliquem, vel causa persequendi hostem, vel causa fugiendi persequentem, vel causa videndi aliqua spectabilia.

But this <i>per accidens</i> cause is infinite, because it is possible for a man to go to that place because of an infinity of other reasons, e.g., if he came to visit someone, or to pursue an enemy, or to escape from a pursuer, or to see a show of some sort.

But fortune lies outside of both of these. And so since such causes, which occur in exceptional cases, are <i>per accidens</i> and infinite and without reason [ <i>ratio</i> ], it follows that causes by fortune are infinite and without reason [ <i>ratio</i> ].

          <td>The problem is whether everything which happens to be a <i>per accidens</i> cause ought to be called a cause of that which comes to be by fortune. Thus it is clear that the <i>per se</i> cause of health can be either nature or the art of the doctor. However, can all those things with which the coming to be of health happens to be connected, such as the wind, and the heat, and shaving of the head, be called causes <i>per accidens</i> ? The question, therefore, is whether each of these is a cause <i>per accidens</i>.

          <td>Sed quia supra diximus quod fortuna maxime dicitur causa per accidens ex parte effectus, prout scilicet aliquid dicitur esse causa eius quod accidit effectui; manifestum est quod causa fortuita aliquid operatur ad effectum fortuitum, licet non intendat illud, sed aliquid aliud effectui coniunctum. Et secundum hoc ventus aut aestus possunt dici causae fortuitae sanitatis, inquantum faciunt aliquam alterationem in corpore, ad quam sequitur sanitas: sed depilatio, aut aliquid aliud huiusmodi non facit manifeste aliquid ad sanitatem.
          <td>Now since we said above [L8 #214] that fortune is most properly called a <i>per accidens</i> cause on the part of the effect, since a thing is said to be a cause of that which happens to the effect, it is clear that a fortuitous cause produces something in the fortuitous effect although it does not intend that, but rather something else connected with the effect. According to this wind or heat can be called fortuitous causes of health insofar as they produce some change in the body, upon which change health follows. But removing the hair or some other such thing does not produce anything clearly related to health.

          <td>Et dicit quod eufortunium et infortunium dicitur, quando habet aliquod bonum vel malum cum magnitudine: nam eufortunium dicitur quando sequitur aliquod magnum bonum; infortunium autem quando sequitur aliquod magnum malum.

On the other hand, if one is close to a great evil and is freed from it, he is said to be fortunate. This is so because the intellect takes that which is only a little removed as if it were not removed at all, but already possessed.

          <td>224. Thirdly where he says, ‘Further, it is with reason...’ (197 a 30), he explains why good fortune is uncertain. He says that this is so because good fortune is a kind of fortune.

          <td>225. Finally where he says, ‘Both are then...’ (197 a 33), he concludes as a sort of résumé that each, i.e., chance and fortune, is a cause <i>per accidens</i>, and that each pertains to things which do not happen simply, i.e., neither always nor frequently, and that each pertains to things which come to be for the sake of something, as is clear from what was said above [L7 #198ff].

For instance, taking a walk is for the sake of evacuation of the bowels; if this does not follow after walking, we say that we have walked 'in vain' and that the walking was 'vain'. This implies that what is naturally the means to an end is 'in vain', when it does not effect the end towards which it was the natural means—for it would be absurd for a man to say that he had bathed in vain because the sun was not eclipsed, since the one was not done with a view to the other. Thus the spontaneous is even according to its derivation the case in which the thing itself happens in vain. The stone that struck the man did not fall for the purpose of striking him; therefore it fell spontaneously, because it might have fallen by the action of an agent and for the purpose of striking.

          <td>A sign of this is the fact that fortune seems to be the same as happiness, or very nearly so. Hence the happy are commonly called the fortunate. For according to those who think that happiness consists in external goods, happiness is the same as fortune; according to those, however, who say that external goods, in which fortune plays a great part, help as instruments in the attainment of happiness, good fortune is close to happiness because it helps one attain it.

Hence, since one has dominion over his actions insofar as he acts voluntarily, it follows that in those actions alone where one acts voluntarily should something happen by fortune, but not in others.

          <td>He says that since fortune is found only in those who act voluntarily, it follows that neither an inanimate thing, nor a child, nor a beast act by fortune, since they do not act voluntarily as having free choice (which is here called ‘that which is proposed’). Hence, neither good fortune nor misfortune can happen to them except metaphorically. Thus, someone said that the stones from which altars are built are fortunate because honour and reverence are shown them, but the stones next to the altar stones are walked upon. This is said because of a certain likeness to men among whom the honoured seemed to be fortunate, whereas those stones which are walked upon are called unfortunate.

          <td>But although it follows from the foregoing that such things do not act by fortune, there is nothing to prevent them from being acted upon by fortune.

When things which come to be simply for the sake of something do not come to be for the sake of that which happens, but for the sake of something extrinsic, then we say that these things come to be by chance. But we say that among the things which come to be by chance, only those things which happen in those who have free choice come to be by fortune.

Ac si hoc sit frustra vel vanum, quod aptum natum est fieri causa alicuius, cum non perficiat illud cuius causa natum est fieri.
          <td>A sign of this is the fact that the word ‘vain’ is used, which in the Greek is close to chance. For we use the term ‘vain’ when that which is for the sake of something does not come to be because of that something, i.e., when that for the sake of which something is done does not occur. Thus if one should walk in order to evacuate the bowels, and if this should not occur to the walker, then he is said to have walked in vain, and his walking would be vain. Thus that which is suitable for the coming to be of something is vain and frustrated when it does not accomplish that for whose coming to be it is suitable.

          <td>He explains why he says ‘that for whose coming to be it is suitable’. If someone were to say that he bathed in vain because the sun was not eclipsed while he bathed, he would speak ridiculously, because bathing oneself is not apt for producing an eclipse of the sun.

          <td>Hence chance, which in the Greek is called ‘automatum’, i.e., <i>per se</i> vain, occurs in those things which are for the sake of something. This is also true of that which is frustrated or vain. For the name <i>per se</i> vain signifies the very thing which is frustrated, just as <i>per se</i> man signifies man himself and <i>per se</i> good signifies good itself.

          <td>He gives an example of things which happen by chance. Thus fit is chance] when it is said that a stone, which strikes someone when falling, did not fall for the purpose of striking him. Therefore it fen because of that which is <i>per se</i> vain or <i>per se</i> frustrated, for the stone does not naturally fall for this purpose. However at times a stone does fall as thrown by someone for the purpose of hitting another.

          <td>However, although chance and the vain are alike insofar as each is among the things which are for the sake of something, nevertheless they also differ. For a thing is called vain because of the fact that that which was intended does not follow, whereas a thing is called chance because of the fact that something else which was not intended does follow.

          <td>Hence sometimes a thing is vain and chance at the same time, for example, when that which was intended does not occur but something else does occur.

          <td>He says that they differ most of all in the things which happen by nature, because chance has a place here but fortune does not. For when in the operations of nature something happens outside of nature, for example, when a six fingered person is born, we do not say that this happens by fortune, but rather because of that which is <i>per se</i> vain, i.e., by chance.

For chance and fortune are causes either of those things which proceed from nature or of those things which proceed from intelligence, as is clear from what has been said. Hence, since nature and intelligence are causes as things from which motion begins, so fortune and chance also are reduced to the same genus.

The mathematicals are of this sort, in which the ‘why’ is reduced to the definition of the straight or of the commensurate, or of some other thing which is demonstrated in mathematics. Since a right angle is defined as that angle which is formed by the falling of one line upon another which makes of both parts two equal angles, then if it should be asked why an angle is a right angle, the reply would be because it is formed by a line making two equal angles from each part.

And since everything which is in potency is reduced to act by that which is a being in act, it is necessary that there be two other causes, namely the matter and the agent which reduces the matter from potency to act. However, the action of the agent tends toward something determinate, and thus it proceeds from some determinate principle. For every agent does that which is suitable to it. But that toward which the action of the agent tends is called the final cause. Therefore, there must be four causes.

However in non-univocal agents the species [ <i>ratio</i> ] is different. For in these cases the things which come to be cannot reach the point where they follow upon the form of the generator according to the same kind [ <i>ratio</i> ] of species. Rather they participate in some likeness to it, insofar as they are able, as is clear in those things which are generated by the sun.

For it was said above [#242] that the form and the end coincide in the same thing.

Thus if something has gone before, whether it be the matter or the mover, then something necessarily follows.

However, a demonstration cannot be established when something follows in most instances. But then a demonstration should be founded upon that which is posterior in generation in order that something might follow of necessity from another, just as the conclusion follows from the propositions of a demonstration. Thus let us proceed in demonstration as follows: if this should come to be, then this and that are required, for example, if man should be generated, it is necessary that human seed be an agent in the generation.

For example, we might demonstrate that the front teeth are sharp because as such they are better for cutting food, and nature does what is better. Nature does not, however, do what is better simply, but what is better with reference to what belongs to each substance; otherwise nature would give a rational soul, which is better than an irrational soul, to each animal.

Similarly if a man's crop is spoiled on the threshing-floor, the rain did not fall for the sake of this—in order that the crop might be spoiled—but that result just followed. Why then should it not be the same with the parts in nature, e.g. that our teeth should come up of necessity—the front teeth sharp, fitted for tearing, the molars broad and useful for grinding down the food—since they did not arise for this end, but it was merely a coincident result; and so with all other parts in which we suppose that there is purpose? Wherever then all the parts came about just what they would have been if they had come be for an end, such things survived, being organized spontaneously in a fitting way; whereas those which grew otherwise perished and continue to perish, as Empedocles says his 'man-faced ox-progeny' did.

And if some of the ancient natural philosophers touched upon some cause other than the necessity of matter, they have no reason for taking any glory from the fact. For after such causes were posited by them, e.g., intellect which Anaxagoras posited, and friendship and strife which Empedocles posited, they did not use them except in certain general instances, such as in the constitution of the world.

          <td>252. Concerning the first point it must be noted that those who held that nature does not act for the sake of something tried to confirm their position by denying that in which nature is most clearly seen to act for the sake, of something. That which most strongly demonstrates that nature acts for the sake of something is the fact that in the operation of nature a thing is always found to come to be as good and as suitable as it can be. Thus, the foot is made in a certain way by nature so that it may be suitable for walking. Hence if it falls short of this natural disposition, it is not fit for this use. And the same is true of other instances.

Oportet enim, inferioribus partibus ex propinquitate solis calefactis, resolvi vapores ex aquis; quibus sursum ascendentibus propter calorem, cum pervenerint ad locum ubi deficit calor propter distantiam a loco ubi reverberantur radii solis, necesse est quod aqua vaporabiliter ascendens congeletur ibidem, et congelatione facta, vapores vertantur in aquam; et cum aqua fuerit generata, necesse est quod cadat deorsum propter gravitatem: et cum hoc fit, accidit ut frumentum augeatur. Non tamen propter hoc pluit ut augeatur; quia similiter in aliquo loco frumentum destruitur propter pluviam, ut cum est collectum in area. Non tamen propter hoc pluit, ut destruatur frumentum, sed hoc casu accidit, pluvia cadente;
          <td>And since they tried especially to oppose this point, Aristotle says that it can be objected that there is nothing to prevent nature from not acting for the sake of something nor from doing what is always better. For at times we find that from some operation of nature some utility results which nevertheless is not the end of that natural operation, but merely happens to occur. Thus, we might say that Jupiter rains, i.e., God or universal nature, but not for the purpose that grain should grow. Rather rain results from the necessity of matter. For it must be that in the lower regions, because of the closeness of the heat of the sun, vapours are drawn out from the water. Having been carried above because of the heat, when they arrive at the point where heat is lacking because of the distance from the place where the rays of the sun are reflected, it is necessary that the vaporized water which is going up freeze at that very point. When the freezing is completed, the vapours are changed into water. And when water has been generated, it must fall down because of its weight. And when this takes place, it happens that the grain grows. Now it does not rain so that grain might grow. For in the same way grain might be destroyed in some place because of rain, as when grain is gathered on a thrashing floor. Thus, rain does not fall in order to destroy grain, rather this happens by chance when rain falls.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>et eodem modo videtur casu accidere quod frumentum crescat per accidens, pluvia cadente.

Non tamen ita quod propter istas utilitates natura fecerit dentes tales vel tales: sed quia dentibus sic factis a natura propter necessitatem materiae sic decurrentis, accidit ut talem formam consequerentur, qua forma existente sequitur talis utilitas. Et similiter potest dici de omnibus aliis partibus, quae videntur habere aliquam determinatam formam propter aliquem finem.
          <td>Hence it seems that there is nothing to prevent this from being true also in regard to animals, which seem to be disposed for the sake of some end. For example, one might say that because of the necessity of matter some teeth, i.e., the front teeth, happen to be sharp and suitable for cutting food, and the molars happen to be broad and useful for grinding food. Nevertheless, nature did not make the teeth such and so for the sake of these utilities. Rather after teeth have been made by nature in such a way as they develop from the necessity of matter, it is accidental that they acquired such a form. And once this form exists, this utility follows. And the same thing can be said of all other parts which seem to have some determinate form for the sake of some end.

Quaecumque vero non habuerunt talem dispositionem sunt destructa, et quotidie destruuntur; sicut Empedocles dixit a principio fuisse quosdam generatos, qui ex una parte erant boves, et ex alia parte erant homines.
          <td>253. But one might say that such utilities follow always or in many cases, and what is always or in most cases suitable exists by nature. In order to forestall this objection they say that from the beginning of the formation of the world the four elements were joined in the constitution of natural things, and thus the many and varied dispositions of natural things were produced. And in all these things only that which happened to be suitable for some utility, as if it were made for that utility, was preserved. For such things had a disposition which made them suitable for being preserved, not because of some agent intending an end, but because of that which is <i>per se</i> vain, i.e., by chance. On the other hand, whatever did not have such a disposition was destroyed, and is destroyed daily. Thus Empedocles said that in the beginning things which were part ox and part man were generated.

If then, it is agreed that things are either the result of coincidence or for an end, and these cannot be the result of coincidence or spontaneity, it follows that they must be for an end; and that such things are all due to nature even the champions of the theory which is before us would agree.

          <td>255. Having stated the opinion and argument of those who say that nature does not act for an end, he here disproves this position.

Non enim dicimus quod a fortuna vel a casu fit, quod multoties pluat in hieme; sed diceremus esse a casu si forte multum plueret sub cane, id est in diebus canicularibus: et similiter non dicimus quod fit a casu quod cauma sit in diebus canicularibus; sed si hoc esset in hieme. Ex his duobus sic argumentatur.
          <td>256. Concerning the first point he sets forth five arguments. The first is as follows. Everything which happens naturally either happens in every instance or in most instances. But nothing which happens by fortune or by that which is <i>per se</i> vain, i.e., by chance, happens in every instance or in most instances. For we do not say that in the winter it rains frequently by fortune or by chance. But if it rains frequently during the dog days, we would say that this happens by chance. And in like manner, we do not say that it happens by chance that there is heat during the dog days, but only if this should happen during the winter.

          <td>From these two points he argues as follows. Everything which happens either happens by chance or for the sake of an end. Now those things which happen outside the intention of an end are said to happen by chance. But it is impossible for those things which happen in every instance or in most instances to happen by chance. Therefore, those things which happen in every instance or in most instances happen for the sake of an end.

          <td>257. He gives the second argument where he says, ‘Further, where a series...’(199 a 9). He says that there is an end for all things. That which is prior and all of its consequences are done for the sake of the end.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Hoc supposito sic argumentatur. Sicut aliquid agitur naturaliter, sic aptum natum est agi: hoc enim significat quod dico naturaliter, scilicet aptum natum. Et haec propositio convertitur, quia sicut aliquid aptum natum est agi, sic agitur: sed oportet apponere hanc conditionem, nisi aliquid impediat.
          <td>Having assumed this he argues as follows. As something is done naturally, so is it disposed to be done. For ‘so disposed’ [aptum natum] means ‘naturally’. And this proposition is convertible, because as something is disposed to be done, so it is done. However, it is necessary to add this condition: unless it is impeded.

Unde manifestum est quod natura agit propter finem.
          <td>Therefore, let us agree that there is no impediment. Hence as something is done naturally, so is it disposed to be done. But things which happen naturally are done so that they lead to an end. Therefore, they are disposed to be done in such a way that they are for the sake of an end. And thus nature seeks an end, i.e., nature has a natural disposition for an end. Hence, it is clear that nature acts for the sake of an end.

Thus if artificial things, e.g., houses, were made by nature, they would be made according to the order in which they now are made by art. Thus the foundation would be constructed first, and afterwards the walls would be erected, and finally the roof would be placed on top. For nature proceeds this way in the things which are rooted in the earth, i.e., in plants. Their roots, like a foundation, are fixed in the earth, the trunk, after the manner of a wall, is raised on high, and the branches are on top like a roof.

          <td>And in like manner if the things which are produced by nature were made by art, they would be made according to the way they are disposed to be produced by nature.

          <td>258. He gives the third argument where he says, ‘... and generally art...’ (199 a 16). He says that art makes certain things which nature cannot make’ such as a house and things of this sort. However, in regard to those things which happen to be produced by art and by nature, art imitates nature, as is clear in regard to health, as was said above [#257]. Hence, if things which are made according to art are for the sake of an end, it is clear that things which are made according to nature also are made for an end, since in each case the prior and the posterior are similarly related.

          <td>He says that it is most clear that nature acts for the sake of something when we consider animals which act neither through art, nor through inquiry, nor through deliberation.

          <td>He says that nature is used in two ways, i.e., for the matter and for the form. The form is the end of generation, as was said above [L11 #242].

            <td>But the person who asserts this entirely does away with 'nature' and what exists 'by nature'. For those things are natural which, by a continuous movement originated from an internal principle, arrive at some completion: the same completion is not reached from every principle; nor any chance completion, but always the tendency in each is towards the same end, if there is no impediment. The end and the means towards it may come about by chance. We say, for instance, that a stranger has come by chance, paid the ransom, and gone away, when he does so as if he had come for that purpose, though it was not for that that he came. This is incidental, for chance is an incidental cause, as I remarked before. But when an event takes place always or for the most part, it is not incidental or by chance.

If the ship-building art were in the wood, it would produce the same results by nature. If, therefore, purpose is present in art, it is present also in nature. The best illustration is a doctor doctoring himself: nature is like that. It is plain then that nature is a cause, a cause that operates for a purpose.

          <td>262. The first thing by which some seem to be moved to deny that nature acts for an end is the following. Sometimes we see things happen otherwise [than is customary], as happens in the case of monsters which are the errors of nature. Whence Empedocles held that at the beginning of the constitution of things certain things were produced which did not have this form and this order which is now commonly found in nature.

          <td>Ad hoc ergo excludendum inducit quatuor rationes.
          <td>263. He brings forth four arguments to overcome this difficulty.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Circa quarum primam ostendit quod licet ars agat propter aliquid, tamen in iis quae fiunt secundum artem, contingit fieri peccatum; quia aliquando grammaticus non recte scribit, et medicus quandoque potat aliquem medicinali potione non recte.
          <td>First he shows that although art acts for the sake of something, still in things which are made by art error occurs. For sometimes the grammarian does not write correctly, and the doctor prescribes a drink as a medicinal potion incorrectly.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Unde manifestum est quod contingit peccatum esse etiam in iis quae sunt secundum naturam, quamvis natura propter aliquid operetur. In arte autem, eorum quae propter aliquid fiunt, quaedam fiunt secundum artem, et recte fiunt; quaedam autem sunt, in quibus artifex fallitur, non secundum artem agens: et in his contingit peccatum, arte propter aliquid agente. Si enim ars non ageret ad determinatum finem, qualitercumque ars operaretur, non esset peccatum; quia operatio artis aequaliter se haberet ad omnia. Hoc ipsum igitur quod in arte contingit esse peccatum, est signum quod ars propter aliquid operetur. Ita etiam contingit in naturalibus rebus; in quibus monstra sunt quasi peccata naturae propter aliquid agentis, inquantum deficit recta operatio naturae. Et hoc ipsum quod in naturalibus contingit esse peccatum, est signum quod natura propter aliquid agat.
          <td>Hence it is clear that error occurs also in things which are by nature, even though nature acts for the sake of something. Of the things which are made by art for the sake of something, some are made according to art and are made correctly. There are other things, however, in which the artisan fails, not acting according to his art, and in these cases error occurs, even though the art is acting for the sake of something. For if art does not act for a determinate end, then there would be no error no matter how the art was performed. For the operation of the art would be equally related to all things. The very fact, then, that there happens to be error in art is a sign that art acts for the sake of something. The same thing also happens in natural things in which monsters are, as it were, the errors of nature acting for the sake of something insofar as the correct operation of nature is deficient. And this very fact that error occurs in natural things is a sign that nature acts for the sake of some thing.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Unde in substantiis quas in principio mundi Empedocles dixit esse constitutas bovigenas, idest ex media parte boves et ex media homines, si non poterant pervenire ad aliquem finem et terminum naturae, ut scilicet conservarentur in esse; non hoc fuit quia natura non hoc intendat, sed quia haec non possibilia salvari, generata sunt non secundum naturam, sed corrupto aliquo naturali principio; sicut nunc etiam accidit aliquos monstruosos partus generari propter corruptionem seminis.
          <td>The same thing is true of those substances which Empedocles said were produced at the beginning of the world, such as the ‘ox-progeny’, i.e., half ox and half man. For if such things were not able to arrive at some end and final state of nature so that they would be preserved in existence, this was not because nature did not intend this [a final state], but because they were not capable of being preserved. For they were not generated according to nature, but by the corruption of some natural principle, as it now also happens that some monstrous offspring are generated because of the corruption of seed.

          <td>Ubicumque sunt determinata principia et determinatus ordo procedendi, ibi oportet esse determinatum finem propter quem alia fiant: sed in generatione animalium est determinatus ordo procedendi; quia oportet primum fieri semen, et non statim a principio est animal; et ipsum semen non statim est induratum, sed a principio est molle, et quodam ordine ad perfectionem tendit: ergo in generatione animalium est determinatus finis. Non ergo propter hoc accidunt monstra et peccata in animalibus, quia natura non agit propter aliquid.
          <td>Wherever there are determinate principles and a determinate order of proceeding, there must be a determinate end for the sake of which other things come to be. But in the generation of animals there is a determinate order of proceeding. For it is necessary that seed come to be first, and there is no animal which exists immediately from the beginning. And the seed itself is not immediately hardened, but in the beginning it is soft and tends toward perfection in a certain order. Therefore, there is a determinate end in the generation of animals. Therefore, monsters and errors do not occur in animals because nature does not act for the sake of something.

          <td>Tertiam rationem ponit ibi: amplius et in plantis inest etc.; quae talis est.

        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Licet natura in plantis agat propter aliquid sicut in animalibus, tamen minus est dearticulatum, idest distinctum, in plantis; vel minus ex operationibus eorum colligi potest.

Dicere enim quod fiant, videtur inconveniens: sed tamen oportet ita esse, si in animalibus contingit hac de causa, quia natura non agit propter aliquid. Non ergo ista de causa in animalibus contingit quia natura propter aliquid non agit.
          <td>If, therefore, monsters and errors occur in animals because nature does not act for the sake of something, this should be even more true of plants. As the ‘man headed ox-progeny’ occurs in animals, does there also occur in plants an ‘olive-headed vine progeny’, i.e., half olive and half vine? It seems absurd to say that these things occur. Nevertheless this must be so if in regard to animals it is true that nature does not act for the sake of something. Therefore, in regard to animals it is not true that nature does not act for the sake of something.

          <td>Sed ipse contrarium ostendit dicens, quod ille qui sic dicit, naturam scilicet non agere propter aliquid, destruit naturam et ea quae sunt secundum naturam. Haec enim dicuntur esse secundum naturam, quaecumque ab aliquo principio intrinseco moventur continue, quousque perveniant ad aliquem finem; non in quodcumque contingens, neque a quocumque principio in quemcumque finem, sed a determinato principio in determinatum finem: semper enim ab eodem principio proceditur in eundem finem, nisi aliquid impediat. Contingit autem id cuius causa fit aliquid, aliquando fieri a fortuna, quando non propter hoc agitur: sicut si aliquis extraneus veniat, et recedat balneatus, dicimus hoc esse a fortuna, eo quod ita fecit, se balneando, ac si propter hoc venisset, cum tamen propter hoc non venerit; unde secundum accidens est ipsum balneari (fortuna enim est de numero causarum secundum accidens, ut prius dictum est). Sed si semper aut frequenter ei venienti hoc accidat, non dicitur esse a fortuna. In rebus autem naturalibus, non per accidens sed semper sic est, nisi aliquid impediat: unde manifestum est quod determinatus finis, qui sequitur in natura, non sequitur a casu, sed ex intentione naturae. Ex quo patet quod contra rationem naturae est, dicere quod natura non agat propter aliquid.
          <td>But Aristotle shows the contrary. He says that one who speaks in this manner, i.e., one who says that nature does not act for the sake of something, destroys nature and the things which are according to nature. For those things are said to be according to nature which are moved continuously by some intrinsic principle until they arrive at some end—not to some contingent end, and not from any principle to any end, but from a determinate principle to a determinate end. For progress is always made from the same principle to the same end, unless something impedes it. However, that for the sake of which something is done sometimes happens to occur by fortune, when [that which is done] is not done for the sake of this. For example, if some stranger should come and leave after he has bathed, we say this was by fortune. For he did not bathe himself as if he had come for this purpose, since he did not come for this. Hence his bathing is accidental (for fortune is a <i>per accidens</i> cause, as was said above; L8 #214). But if this should happen always or in most instances to him who comes, it would not be said to be by fortune. But in natural things events occur not <i>per accidens</i> but always, unless something should impede. Hence, it is clear that the determinate end which follows in nature does not follow by chance, but from the intention of nature. And from this it is clear that it is contrary to the meaning [ <i>ratio</i> ] of nature to say that nature does not act for the sake of something.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit: inconveniens autem est etc., excludit tertium ex quo aliquis opinari potest quod natura non agat propter aliquid. Videbatur enim quibusdam quod natura non agat propter aliquid, quia non deliberat.
          <td>268. Next where he says, ‘It is absurd...’(199 b 26), he destroys the third point by which some hold the opinion that nature does not act for the sake of something. For it seems to some that nature does not act for the sake of something because nature does not deliberate.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sed philosophus dicit quod inconveniens est hoc opinari: quia manifestum est quod ars agit propter aliquid; et tamen manifestum est quod ars non deliberat. Nec artifex deliberat inquantum habet artem, sed inquantum deficit a certitudine artis: unde artes certissimae non deliberant, sicut scriptor non deliberat quomodo debeat formare litteras. Et illi etiam artifices qui deliberant, postquam invenerunt certum principium artis, in exequendo non deliberant: unde citharaedus, si in tangendo quamlibet chordam deliberaret, imperitissimus videretur. Ex quo patet quod non deliberare contingit alicui agenti, non quia non agit propter finem, sed quia habet determinata media per quae agit. Unde et natura, quia habet determinata media per quae agit, propter hoc non deliberat. In nullo enim alio natura ab arte videtur differre, nisi quia natura est principium intrinsecum, et ars est principium extrinsecum. Si enim ars factiva navis esset intrinseca ligno, facta fuisset navis a natura, sicut modo fit ab arte. Et hoc maxime manifestum est in arte quae est in eo quod movetur, licet per accidens, sicut de medico qui medicatur se ipsum: huic arti enim maxime assimilatur natura.
          <td>But the Philosopher says that it is absurd to hold this opinion. For it is obvious, that art acts for the sake of something, yet it is also obvious that art does not deliberate. Nor does the artisan deliberate insofar as he has the art, but insofar as he falls short of the certitude of the art. Hence the most certain arts do not deliberate, as the writer does not deliberate how he should form letters. Moreover, those artisans who do deliberate, after they have discovered the certain principles of the art, do not deliberate in the execution. Thus one who plays the harp would seem most inexperienced if he should deliberate in playing any chord. And from this it is clear that an agent does not deliberate, not because he does not act for an end, but because he has the determinate means by which he acts. Hence since nature has the determinate means by which it acts, it does, not deliberate. For nature seems to differ from art only because nature is an intrinsic principle and art is an extrinsic principle. For if the art of ship building were intrinsic to wood, a ship would have been made by nature in the same way as it is made by art. And this is most obvious in the art which is in that which is moved, although <i>per accidens</i>, such as in the doctor who cures himself. For nature is very similar to this art.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Unde patet quod natura nihil est aliud quam ratio cuiusdam artis, scilicet divinae, indita rebus, qua ipsae res moventur ad finem determinatum: sicut si artifex factor navis posset lignis tribuere, quod ex se ipsis moverentur ad navis formam inducendam.
          <td>Hence, it is clear that nature is nothing but a certain kind of art, i.e., the divine art, impressed upon things, by which these things are moved to a determinate end. It is as if the shipbuilder were able to give to timbers that by which they would move themselves to take the form of a ship.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Ultimo autem epilogando dicit, manifestum esse quod natura sit causa, et quod agat propter aliquid.
          <td>Finally, he concludes by saying that it is clear that nature is a cause and that it acts for the sake of some thing.

            <td>Whereas, though the wall does not come to be without these, it is not due to these, except as its material cause: it comes to be for the sake of sheltering and guarding certain things. Similarly in all other things which involve production for an end; the product cannot come to be without things which have a necessary nature, but it is not due to these (except as its material); it comes to be for an end. For instance, why is a saw such as it is? To effect so-and-so and for the sake of so-and-so. This end, however, cannot be realized unless the saw is made of iron. It is, therefore, necessary for it to be of iron, it we are to have a saw and perform the operation of sawing. What is necessary then, is necessary on a hypothesis; it is not a result necessarily determined by antecedents. Necessity is in the matter, while 'that for the sake of which' is in the definition.

            <td>Necessity in mathematics is in a way similar to necessity in things which come to be through the operation of nature. Since a straight line is what it is, it is necessary that the angles of a triangle should equal two right angles. But not conversely; though if the angles are not equal to two right angles, then the straight line is not what it is either. But in things which come to be for an end, the reverse is true. If the end is to exist or does exist, that also which precedes it will exist or does exist; otherwise just as there, if the conclusion is not true, the premiss will not be true, so here the end or 'that for the sake of which' will not exist. For this too is itself a starting-point, but of the reasoning, not of the action; while in mathematics the starting-point is the starting-point of the reasoning only, as there is no action. If then there is to be a house, such-and-such things must be made or be there already or exist, or generally the matter relative to the end, bricks and stones if it is a house. But the end is not due to these except as the matter, nor will it come to exist because of them. Yet if they do not exist at all, neither will the house, or the saw—the former in the absence of stones, the latter in the absence of iron—just as in the other case the premisses will not be true, if the angles of the triangle are not equal to two right angles.

            <td>and the end is 'that for the sake of which', and the beginning starts from the definition or essence; as in artificial products, since a house is of such-and-such a kind, certain things must necessarily come to be or be there already, or since health is this, these things must necessarily come to be or be there already. Similarly if man is this, then these; if these, then those. Perhaps the necessary is present also in the definition. For if one defines the operation of sawing as being a certain kind of dividing, then this cannot come about unless the saw has teeth of a certain kind; and these cannot be unless it is of iron. For in the definition too there are some parts that are, as it were, its matter.

But the timbers which are the lightest are placed at the highest point, i.e., at the roof. Thus they thought that the dispositions of natural things have come to be such as they are from the necessity of matter.

For a saw has a certain disposition or form. And for this reason it must have such a matter. And it has a certain disposition or form because of some end. However, this end, which is cutting, could not be achieved unless the saw were of iron. Therefore, it is necessary that a saw be iron, if there must be a saw and if it must be for this end, which is its operation.

This is so because the end also is a principle, not indeed of action, but of reasoning. For from the end we begin to reason about those things which are the means to the end. In demonstrative sciences, however, a principle of action is not considered, but only a principle of reasoning, because there are no actions in demonstrative sciences, but only reasonings. Hence in things which are done for the sake of an end, the end properly holds the place which the premise holds in demonstrative sciences. Hence, there is a similarity on both sides, even though they seem to be related conversely because of the fact that the end is last in action, which does not pertain to demonstration.

Thus, tiles and stones must exist first if a house is to come to be. This does not mean that the end is for the sake of the matter, but rather that the end will not be if the matter does not exist. Thus, there will be no house if there are no stones, and there will be no saw if there were no iron. For just as in demonstrative sciences the premises are not true if the conclusion, which is similar to things which are for an end, is not true, so also is the beginning related to the end, as was said.

          <td>This also is clear in artificial things. For as the demonstrator in demonstrating takes the definition as a principle, so also does the builder in building, and the physician in curing. Thus, because the definition of a house is such, this [what is in the definition] must come to be and exist in order that a house might come to be, and because this is the definition of health, this must come to be in order for someone to be cured.

The third is a combination of these two, for example, thunder is a continuous sound in the clouds caused by the extinguishing of fire in a cloud. This definition embraces within itself the whole demonstration without the order of demonstration.

For if one wishes to define the operation of a saw (which is a division of a certain sort which will not occur unless the saw has teeth, and these teeth are not suitable for cutting unless they are of iron), it’ will be necessary to place iron in the definition of saw. For nothing prevents us from placing certain parts of matter in the definition, not individual parts, such as this flesh and these bones, but common parts, such as flesh and bones. And this is necessary in the definition of all natural things [cf. L5 #179].
