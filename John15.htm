              1 "I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser. 2 Every

              branch that does bear fruit he prunes, that it may bear more
              fruit. 3 You are already made clean by the word which I have
              spoken to you. 4 Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot
              bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can
              you, unless you abide in me. 5 I am the vine, you are the
              branches. He who abides in me, and I in him, he it is that bears
              much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing. 6 If a man does
              not abide in me, he is cast forth as a branch and withers; and the
              branches are [and he is] gathered, thrown into the fire and
              burned. 7 If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask
              whatever you will, and it shall be done for you. 8 By this my

            about two things: one was near, in the present, and this was his

            1979 He himself is the vine. So he says, making a comparison,
            <b>I am the vine</b>; for just like a vine, although it seems to be
            of small account, nevertheless surpasses all trees in the sweetness
            of its fruit, so Christ, although he seemed to be despised by the
            world because he was poor, and seemed of small account and was
            publicly disgraced, nevertheless produced the sweetest fruit: "His
            fruit was sweet to my taste" (Song 2:3). And so Christ is a vine
            producing a wine which interiorly intoxicates us: a wine of sorrow
            for sin: "You have given us to drink the wine of sorrow" [Ps 60:3];
            and a wine which strengthens us, that is, which restores us: "My
            blood is drink indeed" (6:55). In the same way he compared himself,
            above, to wheat, for his flesh is truly food.

            1980 This vine is true. Sometimes what is true is distinguished from
            its likeness, as a man is distinguished from his picture. And
            sometimes what is true is distinguished from what is deformed or
            spoiled, as true wine is distinguished from vinegar, which is
            spoiled wine. When Christ says here,
            <b>I am the true vine,</b> he is using true in the second sense to
            distinguish himself from the deformed or spoiled vine, which is the
            Jewish people. We read about them: "How then have you turned
            degenerate and become a wild vine" (Jer 2:21). This was because this
            vine brought forth wild grapes instead of grapes: "When I looked for
            it to yield grapes, why did it yield wild grapes?" (Is 5:4).

            1981 There are two natures in Christ, the divine and the human.
            Because of his human nature he is like us and is less than the
            Father. Because of his divine nature he is like God and above us.
            Thus he is the true vine insofar as he is the head of the Church,
            the man Christ Jesus. He implies this when he mentions the
            vinedresser, who is the Father. He says,
            <b>and my Father is the vinedresser.</b>
            If Christ is the vine because of his divine nature, the Father would
            also be the vine like the Son. But because Christ is the vine by
            reason of his human nature, the Father is related to him as
            vinedresser to vine. Indeed, even Christ himself, as God, is a
            vinedresser.

            1982 [The vinedresser cultivates the vine.] Now to cultivate
            something is to devote one's interest to it. And we can cultivate
            something in two ways: either to make what is cultivated better, as
            we cultivate a field or something of that sort, or to make ourselves
            better by the cultivating, and in this way we cultivate wisdom. God
            cultivates us to make us better by his work, since he roots out the
            evil seeds in our hearts. As Augustine says, he opens our hearts
            with the plow of his words, plants the seeds of the commandments,
            and harvests the fruit of devotion.

            And so the Father is the vinedresser of this vine for the good of
            others. For he plants: "I planted you a choice vine, wholly of pure
            seed" (Jer 2:21), and makes its grow: I planted, Apollos can make
            one grow from within and produce fruit, no matter how much others
            cooperate on the exterior. And God guards and preserves, for we read
            that he built a watchtower in the vineyard, and put a hedge around

            1983 The vinedresser is concerned about two things: the vine and its

            "The vine brought forth branches" [Ez 17:6]. He mentions two things

            bad branches; his interest in the good branches.

            1984 The vinedresser's interest in the bad branches is to cut them
            off the vine. Thus he says,
            <b>every branch</b>, that is, every believer,
            <b>of mine that bears no fruit,</b>
            that is, bears no fruit on the vine, which is me, without whom
            nothing can bear fruit,
            <b>he takes away</b>
            from the vine. It is clear from this that not only are some cut off
            from Christ for doing evil, but also because they neglect to do
            good: "We entreat you not to accept the grace of God in vain" (2 Cor
            6:1). Thus the Apostle said about himself: "By the grace of God I am
            what I am, and his grace toward me was not in vain" (1 Cor 15:10).
            We read in Matthew (25:28) that the money was taken away from the
            servant who did not bear fruit with it, but hid it instead; and our
            Lord ordered the unfruitful fig tree to be cut down (Lk 13:7).

            minoratur, et magis inefficax fit ad bene operandum. Et inde est
            quod Deus, ut bene fructificet, frequenter praescindit huiusmodi
            impedimenta et purgat, immittens tribulationes et tentationes,
            quibus fortior fiat ad operandum. Et ideo dicit <i>purgabit eum</i>,
            etiamsi purus existat: quia nullus est adeo purus in hac vita ut non
            sit magis magisque purgandus; I Io. I, 8:

            1985 His interest in the good branches is to help them so they can
            bear more fruit. So he says,
            <b
              >and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes, that it may bear
              more fruit.</b
            >
            Considering the literal sense, we see that a natural vine with
            branches that have many shoots bears less fruit, because the sap is
            spread out through all the shoots. Thus the vinedresser prunes away
            the extra shoots so that the vine can bear more fruit. It is the
            same with us. For if we are well‑disposed and united to God, yet
            scatter our love over many things, our virtue becomes weak and we
            become less able to do good. This is why God, in order that we may
            bear fruit, will frequently remove such obstacles and prune us by
            sending troubles and temptations, which make us stronger.
            Accordingly, he says, he
            <b>prunes</b>, even though one may be clean, for in this life no one
            is so clean that he does not need to be cleansed more and more: "If
            we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in
            us" (1 Jn 1:8). And he does this so
            <b>that it may bear more fruit,</b>
            that is, grow in virtue, so that the more pruned or cleansed the
            more fruitful one is: "Let the just still be justified, and the holy
            still be sanctified" [Rev 22:11]; "The Gospel is bearing fruit and
            growing" (Col 1:6); "They go from strength to strength" (Ps 84:7).

            to the vine: the union of the branches to the vine, and the pruning

            Tertio mundat sermo Dei a peccatis, invocatus in Baptismo. Nam
            homines in Baptismo purgantur, quia in aqua verbum mundat; quia, ut

            The word of Christ, in the first place, cleanses us from error by
            teaching us: "He must hold firm to the sure word as taught, so that
            he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine" (Tit 1:9).
            This is because there is no falsity in the words of God: "All my
            words are right" [Prv 8:8]. He says,
            <b>you are already made clean</b>
            from the errors of the Jews. Secondly, the word of Christ cleanses
            our hearts from earthly affections by inflaming them toward heavenly
            things. For the word of God by its power moves our hearts, weighed
            down by earthly things, and sets them on fire: "Is not my word
            fire?" (Jer 23:29). Thirdly when God is invoked in baptism, his word
            cleanses us from sin. For we are cleansed in baptism because the
            word cleanses with the water. As Augustine says: "Take away the word
            and what is the water but only water? The word accompanies the
            element and a sacrament is formed."
            <a href="John15.htm#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" id="_ftnref3">[3]</a>
            Thus it is the word which makes the water touch the body and wash
            the heart. The word, I say, not because it is spoken, but because it
            is believed. For this word of faith is so strong in the Church that
            it even cleanses infants, although they themselves cannot believe,
            when it is proclaimed from the faith of those who believe, offer,
            bless and touch the infants, "baptizing them in the name of the
            Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit" (Mt 28:19). Fourthly,
            the word of Christ cleanses by the power of faith: God "cleansed
            their hearts by faith" (Acts 15:9).

            1990 He does two things about the first: first, he presents an
            illustration; and secondly shows that it is apt. As to the first he
            says, I say that you should abide in me so that you can bear fruit,
            because just
            <b>as the branch</b>
            literally, a material branch,
            <b>cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine,</b>

            bear fruit
            <b>unless you abide in me.</b>
            Thus, being united to Christ is the reason why someone bears fruit.
            And so of those who are not united to Christ we read: "What return
            [fruit] did you get from the things of which you are now ashamed?"
            (Rom 6:21); "The company of the godless is barren" (Job 15:34).

            be filled with the fruit of your works" [Ps 104:13]. They also
            produce a fourth fruit, but in eternal life: "He gathers fruit for
            eternal life" (4:36). Eternal life is the last and perfect fruit of
            our labors: "The fruit of good works is glorious" [Wis 3:15].

            Look at what our Lord says here! He says that without him we cannot
            do anything great, nor anything small, indeed, we cannot do anything
            at all. This is not surprising because neither does God do anything
            without him: "Without him was not anything made that was made"
            (1:3). For our works are either from the power of nature or from
            divine grace. If they are from the power of nature, then, since
            every action of nature is from the Word of God, no nature can act to
            do anything without him. If our works are from the power of grace,
            then, since he is the author of grace ‑ "grace and truth came
            through Jesus Christ" (1:17) ‑ it is obvious that no meritorious
            work can be done without him: "Not that we are capable of thinking
            anything of ourselves as originating from ourselves; our capability
            is from God" [2 Cor 3:5]. Therefore, if we cannot even think without
            it coming from God, much less can we do anything else.

            1994 Here he mentions the second reason for remaining united to
            Christ, which is the threat of punishment, for unless we abide in
            him, we will not escape punishment. He mentions five things which
            describe this punishment. Some of these belong to the punishment of
            loss, that is to say, the exclusion from glory; so he says,
            <b>he is cast forth.</b>
            Sometimes on a natural vine we see a branch which remains by some
            sort of an external connection without sharing any of the sap. In
            this way also some remain connected to Christ only by faith, yet
            they do not share the sap of the vine because they do not have
            charity. Thus, such persons will be cast out, that is, separated
            from fellowship with the good.

            Look, it is given to the fire for fuel" [Ez 15:2]. If the wood of
            the vine does not remain united to it, it is more worthless than
            other woods; but if it abides on the vine it is more beautiful than
            the others. Thus Augustine says: "A branch is fit for two things:
            either the vine or the fire. If it is not on the vine, it will be in
            the fire."

            his wisdom are in us: "You do not have his word abiding in you"

            ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with sighs too deep
            for words" (Rom 8:26). For this reason Christ taught us to pray with

            believed and meditated upon, teach us to ask for the things
            necessary for our salvation; and these words of God when loved and
            accomplished help us to merit it. So he adds,
            <b>ask</b>, with sound judgment and perseverance,
            <b>whatever you will, and it shall be done for you:</b>

            your Father who is in heaven" (Mt 5:16); and by teaching well, which
            also glorifies God: "Glorify the Lord by teaching" [Is 24:15];
            "Every one who calls upon my name I have created him for my praise
            and glory" (Is 43:7). And so the apostles are the soil which bears
            much fruit because they have become the disciples of Christ by
            abiding in him and by the fire of their charity.

            For these are the signs of a disciple of Christ: first that one
            abides in him, is united to him: "If you continue in my word, you
            are truly my disciples" (8:31). And by doing this they become fit
            for bearing the fruit of teaching. The second sign is charity: "By
            this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you have love
            for one another" (13:35). And because of this they are able to bear
            the fruit of good works, because nothing has any value without
            charity: "If I have prophetic powers, and understand all
            mysteries... but have not love, I am nothing" (1 Cor 13:2).

            1997 Above, our Lord urged his disciples to remain united with him;
            here he shows what this involves. He makes three points: first, to
            abide in him is to abide in his love; secondly, to abide in his love
            is to keep his commandments (v 10); thirdly, that his commandment is
            to love (v 12). He does two things about the first: first, he
            recalls the benefit granted to the disciples; secondly, he urges
            them to persevere, <b>abide in my love</b> (v 9).

            1998 He says that the fact that we abide in Christ is due to his
            grace; and this grace is the effect of his love: "I have loved you
            with an everlasting love" (Jer 31:3). It is clear from this that all
            our good works are ours due to the benefit of divine love. For they
            would not be ours unless faith acted through love, and we would not
            love unless we were first loved. And so he reminds them of this

            1999 The word "as" sometimes indicates an equality of nature, and at
            other times a similarity in acting. The Arians, who erred about this
            passage, wanted the "as" to indicate an equality, and because of
            this they concluded that the Son was inferior to the Father. But
            this is false. We must say, then, according to Augustine, that the
            word "as" indicates a likeness in grace and love; for the love with
            which the Son loves his disciples is a certain likeness of that love
            with which the Father loves the Son.

            But the Son did not love the disciples in either of these ways. For
            he did not love them to the point of their being gods by nature, nor
            to the point that they would be united to God so as to form one
            person with him. But he did love them up to a similar point: he
            loved them to the extent that they would be gods by their
            participation in grace ‑ "I say, 'You are gods'" (Ps 82:6); "He has
            granted to us precious and very great promises, that through these
            you may become partakers of the divine nature" (2 Pet 1:4) ‑ and he
            loved them to the extent that they would be united to God in
            affection: "He who is united to the Lord becomes one spirit with
            him" (1 Cor 6:17); "For those whom he foreknew he also predestined
            to be conformed to the image of his Son" (Rom 8:29). Thus the Father
            communicated to the Son a greater good, with respect to each nature
            of the Son, than the Son did to his disciples; yet there is a
            similarity, as was said.

            For just as the love which the Father has for him is the model or
            standard of Christ's love for us, so Christ wants his obedience to
            be the model of our obedience. By saying this Christ shows that he
            abided in the Father's love because in all things he kept the
            Father's commandments. For he submitted to death: "He humbled
            himself and became obedient unto death, even death on a cross" (Phil
            2:8); and refrained from all sin: "He committed no sin; no guile was
            found on his lips" (1 Pet 2:22). These things are to be understood
            of Christ in his human nature: "He has not left me alone, for I
            always do what is pleasing to him" (8:29). And so he says,
            <b>I abide in his love,</b>
            because there is nothing in me, as a human being, opposed to his
            love.

            2004 Now so they do not think he is urging them to keep his
            commandments for his own benefit and not for their benefit, he says,
            <b>These things I have spoken to you,</b>
            that you keep my commandments, for your own good, so
            <b>that my joy may be in you.</b>
            Now love is the cause of joy, for everyone takes joy in what he
            loves. But God loves himself and creatures, especially rational
            creatures, to whom he grants an infinite good. So Christ rejoices in
            two things from all eternity: first, in his own good and that of the
            Father: "I was delighted every day, playing before him" [Prv 8:30];
            secondly, he delights in the good of the rational creature:
            "delighting in the sons of men" (Prv 8:31), that is, in the fact
            that I am shared in by the children of men. He rejoices in these
            things from eternity: "As the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so
            shall your God rejoice over you" (Is 62:5).

            <b>And that your joy</b>, which I take in my own humanity,
            <b>may be full</b>. The goods in which we rejoice are either
            imperfect or imperfectly possessed; and so in this life our joy
            cannot be full. But it will be full when perfect goods are perfectly
            possessed: "Enter into the joy of your master" (Mt 25:21).

            Ad quod, secundum Gregorium, dicendum est, quod caritas est radix et
            finis omnium virtutum. Radix quidem, quia ex caritate confirmata in
            corde hominis movetur homo ad implenda omnia alia praecepta; Rom.
            XIII, v. 8:
            <i>qui diligit proximum, legem implevit</i>. Ergo omnia praecepta
            quasi ad hoc ordinantur ut homo benefaciat proximo, et non molestet
            eum; quod quidem potissime ex caritate fit. Finis autem est, quia
            omnia praecepta ad ipsam ordinantur, et in sola caritate solidantur;
            I Tim. I, 5: <i>finis praecepti est caritas</i>. Dicit ergo
            <i>hoc est praeceptum meum, ut diligatis invicem</i>, quasi
            scilicet, a caritate omnia procedunt sicut a principio, et in
            caritate omnia ordinantur sicut in finem. Nam, sicut dicit
            Gregorius,
            <i
              >ut multi arboris rami ex una radice prodeunt, sic multae virtutes
              ex una radice generantur: nec habet aliquid viriditatis ramus boni
              operis, si non manet in radice caritatis</i
            >.
          </td>
          <td>
            The answer, according to Gregory, is that charity is the root and
            end of all the virtues.
            <a href="John15.htm#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" id="_ftnref11">[11]</a>
            It is the root, because it is from charity, firmly rooted in the
            human heart, that we are led to accomplish all the other
            commandments: "He who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law" (Rom
            13:8). Therefore, all the commandments are, in a way, directed to
            this: that we do good to our neighbor, and not harm him; and this is
            done best through charity. Charity is the end because all the
            commandments are directed to it and by it alone are given strength:
            "The aim of our charge is love" (1 Tim 1:5). So he says,
            <b>This is my commandment, that you love one another,</b>
            since everything comes from charity as its source, and all things
            are directed to charity as their end. As Gregory puts it: just as
            many branches of a tree spring from one root, so the many virtues
            are produced from one root; and the branch of a good work has no
            life if it is not united to the root of charity.

            2007 Since we read in Matthew (22:40) that the law and the prophets
            depend not only on love for God, but also on love for neighbor, why
            does Christ mention here only love for neighbor? The answer is that
            one is included in the other: for a person who loves God must love
            his neighbor and things which belong to God; and the person who
            loves his neighbor for the sake of God must love God. Now although
            the objects of these acts are different, yet the outcomes are the
            same. There are two reasons why he mentions love of neighbor rather
            than the love of God. By doing this he wants to teach and lead them
            to help their neighbor, and to help them to become strong enough to
            endure sufferings from those who will persecute them. To do both of
            these, charity for our neighbor is necessary.

            2008 Here he shows by an example how we should love our neighbor,
            which is, as Christ loved us. Now Christ loved us in the correct
            order and efficaciously. His love was orderly because he loved
            nothing in us but God and in relation to God: "I am the mother of
            beautiful love" (Si 24:18), and efficacious because he loved us so
            much that he delivered himself for us: "Christ loved us and gave
            himself up for us, a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God" (Eph
            5:2). So we should love our neighbor, in a holy way, for his good,
            and efficaciously, by showing our love by our actions: "Let us not
            love in word or speech but in deed and in truth" (1 Jn 3:18).

            We should answer that Christ did not lay down his life for his
            enemies so that they would remain his enemies, but to make them his
            friends. Or, one could say, that he lay down his life for his
            friends, not in the sense that they were friends who loved him, but
            rather were those whom he loved. It is clear that the sign of the
            greatest love is to lay down one's life for one's friends. This is
            so because there are four lovable things to be put in order: God,
            our soul, our neighbor, and our body. We should love God more than
            ourselves and our neighbor, so that for the sake of God we ought to
            give ourselves, body and soul, and our neighbor. We should lay down
            our body, but not give it, for the sake of our soul. For our
            neighbor, we should expose our body and our physical life for his
            salvation. Consequently, since our physical life is the best thing
            we have after our soul, it is the greatest thing to expose it for
            the sake of our neighbor, and a sign of greater love: "In this the
            love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only Son
            into the world, so that we might live through him" (1 Jn 4:9).

            The statement, <b>you are my friends</b> can be understood in two
            ways, based on the two ways someone is called a friend. A person is
            called a friend either because he loves or because he is loved. And
            what follows, <b>if you do what I command you</b> is true for both
            meanings of friend. Those who love God keep his commandments, and
            because a friend is, as Gregory says, in a way the guardian of the
            other's soul, it is appropriate that one who guards or keeps the
            will of God in his commandments is called the friend of God.

            Again, those whom God loves keep his commandments, because by
            conferring his grace on them he helps them to keep them: for by
            loving us, God makes us love him: "I love those who love me" (Prv
            8:17). It is not they who first loved God, but God makes them lovers
            by loving them.

            Respondeo. Dicendum, secundum Augustinum, quod servitus proprie ex
            timore creatur. Est autem duplex timor: scilicet servilis, quem
            expellit caritas, I Io. IV, 18:
            <i>timor non est in caritate</i>; alius est timor filialis, qui ex
            caritate generatur, quia timet perdere quis quod amat; et hic est
            timor bonus et castus, de quo dicitur in Ps. XVIII, v. 10:
            <i>timor domini sanctus permanet in saeculum saeculi</i>. Et
            secundum hoc sunt duae servitutes. Una quae procedit ex timore
            filiali; et secundum hanc servi sunt iusti omnes, et filii Dei, ut
            obiiciebatur. Alia servitus, est quae procedit ex timore poenae, et
            contrariatur dilectioni; et de hac dicit
            <i>iam non dicam vos servos</i>.

            [I answer. According to Augustine, servitude is, properly speaking,
            created by fear. But there are two kinds of fear: sevile, which
            charity casts out - 1 John 4:18
            <i>There is no fear in charity</i>. The other is filial fear, which
            is generated by charity, since one fears to lose whe he loves. And
            that is the good and chaste fear mentioned in Ps 19:10
            <i>The ear of the Lord is holy, it lasts forever</i>. So there are
            two kinds of servitud: one which proceeds from filial fear, and with
            this, all the just are servants and sons of God, as was objected.
            The other servitude, which comes from fear of punishement is
            contrary to love, and that is what he is talking about when he says
            <i>I no longer call you slaves/servants</i>.]

            causa sui operatur, et quantum ad causam finalem operis, et quantum

            quod aliquis servus operatur causa alterius, sicut causa finali;
            operatur tamen a se, inquantum se movet ad opus: et haec est bona
            servitus, quia ex caritate movetur ad bona opera facienda; sed non
            operatur propter se: quia caritas non quaerit quae sua sunt, sed
            quae sunt Iesu Christi et salutis proximorum. Qui autem omnino causa
            alterius operantur, sunt mali servi. Patet ergo quod discipuli servi

            [Note also that a slave, properly speaking, is someone who is not
            his own mover; a freeman is his own mover. So there is a difference
            between the acts of a slave and a freeman, because a slave act when
            another moves him, but a freeman acts on his own, both with regard
            to the purpose of his action and the moving power. For a freeman
            acts for his own sake, and by himself, because he is moved to action
            by his own will, since he is moved by charity to do good works.]
            This verse shows the servant does not act for the sake of himself,
            because charity does not seek its own, but the interests of Jesus
            and the salvation of one's neighbor. Those who act entirely by
            reason of another are bad servants. Thus it is clear that the
            disciples were servants, but it was a good servitude springing from
            love.

            Ad secundam quaestionem dicendum, quod ille servus qui movetur solum

            artificem. Instrumentum autem communicat cum artifice in opere, sed
            non in operis ratione. Sic ergo tales servi participant solum in
            opere; sed quando servus operatur ex propria voluntate, necesse est
            quod rationem operis sciat, et quod revelentur ei occulta, per quae
            ea scire possit quae agit, Eccli. XXXIII, 31:
            <i>servus si est tibi fidelis, sit tibi quasi anima tua</i>.
            Apostoli autem, ut dictum est, a se movebantur ad bona opera
            facienda, scilicet ex propria voluntate per amorem inclinata; et
            ideo dominus secreta sua revelat eis. Sed de malis servis verum est
            quod nesciunt quid faciat dominus eorum. Sed quae sunt illa quae
            nesciunt? Illa proprie quae in nobis Deus facit. Omnia enim bona
            quae facimus, Deus in nobis operatur Is. XXVI, 12 et Phil. II, 13:
            <i>operatur in nobis et velle et perficere</i>. Servus ergo malus ex
            superbia cordis sui obtenebratus, dum quod facit, sibi attribuit,
            <i>nescit quid faciat dominus eius</i>. Hic ponit verum signum

            As for the second difficulty, we should say that the servant who is
            moved only by another and not by himself, is related to the one who
            moves him as a tool to the worker. Now a tool shares with the worker
            in the work, but not in the reason for the work. So such servants
            share only in the work. But when a servant acts by his own will, it
            is necessary for him to know the reason for the work and have
            secrets revealed to him so he can know what he is doing. "If you
            have a servant, regard him as your own soul" [Sir 33:31]. Now the
            apostles, as was said, were moved by themselves to accomplish good
            works, that is, they were moved by their own will, inclined by love.
            And so our Lord revealed his secrets to them. But bad servants do
            not know what their master is doing. What things don't they know?
            Strictly speaking, they do not know what God does in us. For God
            acts in us in all the good we do: "O Lord... you have wrought for us
            all our works (Is 26:12). So the bad servant, darkened by the pride
            in his own heart,
            <b>does not know what his master is doing</b>
            when this servant attributes to himself what he does.

            2018 Another question concerns the statement,
            <b
              >all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you.</b
            >
            If he did make all things known to them it would follow that the
            disciples knew as much as the Son. The answer, according to
            Chrysostom, is that
            <b>all that I have heard</b>
            means all that I have heard which you ought to hear, but not
            absolutely all things,
            <b>I have made known to you:</b>
            "I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now"
            (16:12).

            Vel dicendum, secundum Augustinum, quod dominus propter certitudinem
            dicendorum utitur praeterito pro futuro; ut sit sensus
            <i>omnia quaecumque audivi a patre meo, nota feci vobis</i>, idest,
            faciam in plenitudine, de qua dicit apostolus I Cor. XIII, v. 12:
            <i>tunc cognoscam sicut et cognitus sum</i>; infra XVI, 25:
            <i>in illo die palam de patre meo annuntiabo vobis</i>, quando
            scilicet introducet nos ad visionem patris. Omnia enim quae scit
            filius, scit pater. Quando ergo revelabit nobis patrem, revelabit
            omnia quae scit, et id quod scimus.

          <td>
            Or, one could say, according to Augustine, that what he would say to
            them was so certain that he used the past tense instead of the
            future.
            <a href="John15.htm#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" id="_ftnref16">[16]</a>
            So the meaning becomes,
            <b
              >all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you,</b
            >
            that is, I will make known with that fullness of which the Apostle
            says: "Then I shall understand fully, even as I have been fully
            understood" (1 Cor 13:12). And below we read, "The hour is coming
            when I shall tell you plainly of the Father" (16:25), that is, when
            I lead you to the vision of the Father. For all things the Son knows
            the Father knows. So when he revels the Father to us, the Son will
            reveal all that the Son himself knows and which we know.

            Vel dicendum, secundum Gregorium, et melius. Eiusdem rei potest
            haberi cognitio perfecta et imperfecta: sicut in scientiis apparet
            quod qui scit principia omnia unius scientiae dicitur scire
            scientiam illam, sed imperfecte eam scit. Unde qui docet aliqua
            principia alicuius scientiae, potest dicere se docuisse scientiam
            illam, quia omnia quae sunt scientiae illius, sunt in principiis
            eius virtute; sed illam eamdem scientiam perfectius scit quando
            conclusiones singulas, quae virtute erant in principiis, novit. Sic
            ergo et de divinis potest haberi duplex cognitio. Una imperfecta: et
            haec habetur per fidem, quae est praelibatio illius futurae
            beatitudinis et cognitionis quam habebimus in patria; Hebr. c. XI,
            1:
            <i
              >est autem fides sperandarum substantia rerum, argumentum non
              apparentium</i

            scilicet in fide, secundum quamdam praelibationem, sicut
            conclusiones virtute sunt in principiis. Unde dicit Gregorius:
            <i
              >omnia quae nota facit servis suis, sunt gaudia internae caritatis
              et festa supernae patriae, quae quotidie mentibus per aspirationem
              sui amoris imprimit, dum enim audita superna caelestia amamus,
              amata iam novimus: quia ipse amor notitia est</i
            >.

          <td>
            Again, one could say with Gregory, and this is better, that the same
            thing can be known perfectly or imperfectly. For example, in the
            sciences it is obvious that a person who knows all the principles of
            a science is said to know that science, although imperfectly. And so
            a person who teaches some principles of a science can say that he
            teaches that science, because everything that belongs to that
            science is virtually contained in its principles. But one will know
            that same science more perfectly when he knows the individual
            conclusions which are virtually in the principles. In the same way
            we can have a twofold knowledge of divine matters. One is imperfect,
            and is gained by faith, which is a foretaste of that future
            happiness and knowledge which we will have in heaven: "Faith is the
            substance of things to be hoped for" [Heb 11:2]. He says of this
            knowledge,
            <b>all... I have made known to you,</b>
            that is, in faith, by a kind of foretaste, like conclusions are
            virtually contained in their principles. So Gregory says: "All the
            things he has made known to his servants are the joys of interior
            love and the feasts of our heavenly fatherland, which he excites in
            our minds every day by the breath of his love. For as long as we
            love the sublime heavenly things we have heard, we already know what
            we love, because the love itself is knowledge."

            2021 Some say that God's temporal choice is caused by the merits of
            those who are chosen. This conflicts with what it says here. For if
            God chose you because you were good, you were still not able to be
            good unless you chose the good, and this good is especially God.
            Therefore, it was you who first chose the good which is God, before
            you were chosen. But our Lord says the contrary:
            <b>you did not choose me, but I chose you.</b>
            Thus we should not say that our own goodness entirely precedes God's
            choice. I say "entirely" because we might have some particular good
            which could be the cause of another good being given to us; and this
            good could be the cause of being given still another good, since
            there is a certain order in God's gifts. But in general, nothing can
            be the cause of and precede the divine choice, because all our goods
            are from God.

            <i>quomodo potuissent illa esse, nisi tu voluisses?</i>
            Et sic bonum derivatur ad res creatas ex voluntate Dei. Unde Deus
            aliquem alteri praeeligit, inquantum plus ei de bono influit quam
            alteri. Voluntas autem hominis movetur ad aliquid ex bono
            praeexistente apprehenso: et ideo oportet in electione nostra unum

            2024 Perhaps someone might say: What choice could there be since we
            were nothing and there was no rank among us? But one who says this
            is mislead by thinking that the divine choice is like human choice.
            They are not the same. Our choice is caused by some already existing
            good; while God's choice is the cause of an influx of good, greater
            in one than in another. Since choice is an act of the will, then
            according as the will of God and the human will are differently
            related to the good, so the character of their choice will be
            different. Now God's will is related to a created good as its cause:
            "How would anything have endured if thou hadst not willed it?" (Wis
            11:25). And so goodness is dispensed to created things from the will
            of God. Accordingly, God prefers one person to another insofar as he
            confers more good on that one than on another. But the human will is
            moved to something by a preexisting good which has become known.
            Therefore, in our choices it is necessary that one good exist before
            another. The reason why God confers more good on one than on another
            is so that there might be a splendor of order in things. This is
            clear in material things where prime matter of itself is uniformly
            disposed to all forms. Also, before things themselves exist, they
            are not disposed to this or that existence; rather, they receive
            different forms and existences from God so that an order can be
            established among them. It is like this among rational creatures,
            where some are chosen for glory and some are rejected for
            punishment: "The Lord knows who are his... In a great house there
            are not only vessels of gold and silver but also of wood and
            earthenware, and some for noble use, some for ignoble" (2 Tim 2:19).
            And so we see a diversified order: the mercy of God shines forth in
            those whom, without any previous merits, he prepares for grace; in

            love your neighbor: "The aim of our charge is love" (1 Tim 1:5). One
            could also say, with Chrysostom, that the apostles could have said:
            Lord, why are you reminding us so much about your love? Are you
            reprimanding us? But our Lord says: Not at all. I am doing this to

            2033 Now he mentions a second point for their consolation, and this
            is based on the reason for their being hated. When a person endures
            another's hatred because of his own sins, there is reason for regret
            and sorrow; but when he is hated because of his virtue he should
            rejoice. First, our Lord gives the reason why some are loved by the
            world; secondly, why the apostles are hated by the world (v 19).

            I reply that it is possible to find something purely good, but not
            something purely evil, since the subject of evil is something good.
            Consequently, the evil of guilt is located in some good of nature.
            Therefore, no person can be a sinner and evil without having some
            good. So it is because of the evil of these authorities, the evil of
            their unbelief, that they belong to the world and hate the apostles
            and those who are not of the world. But because of the good they
            possess they are not of the world and hate those who are of the
            world, as thieves and robbers, and such. Still, there were some who
            were living well in the world yet loved the apostles and approved of
            their actions.

            each other, for, example, the proud: "Among the proud there is
            always strife" [Prv 13:10]. And one greedy person hates another who

            Responsio. Dicendum, quod duplex est amor: amicitiae scilicet et
            concupiscentiae, sed differunt: quia in amore concupiscentiae, quae
            sunt nobis extrinseca, ad nos ipsos trahimus, cum ipso amore
            diligamus alia, inquantum sunt nobis utilia vel delectabilia; sed in
            amore amicitiae est e converso, quia nosmetipsos trahimus ad ea quae
            sunt extra nos; quia ad eos quos isto amore diligimus, habemus nos
            sicut ad nosmetipsos, communicantes eis quodammodo nosmetipsos. Unde

            I reply that there are two kinds of love: the love of friendship and
            the love of concupiscence. These are quite different. With the love
            of concupiscence we draw external things or persons to ourselves,
            and we love these others insofar as they are useful to us or give us
            pleasure. But in the love of friendship we have the opposite, for we
            draw ourselves to what is external to us, because those we love in
            this way we treat the same as ourselves, sharing ourselves with them
            in some way. Thus, likeness is a cause of love, when we are speaking
            of the love of friendship, for we do not love a person in this way
            unless we are one with that person: and likeness is a certain way of
            being one. But with the love of concupiscence, whether it is for
            what is useful or gives pleasure, likeness is a cause of division
            and hated. For since with this love I love some person or thing
            insofar as it is useful to me or gives me pleasure, I hate as
            opposed to me whatever hinders this usefulness or pleasure. So it is
            that the proud feud among themselves, for one takes for himself the
            glory that another loves and in which he takes pleasure. As for the
            potters, they quarrel because one takes for himself some profit
            which another wants for himself.

            Sed sciendum, quod amor concupiscentiae non est rei concupitae, sed
            concupiscentis: propter hoc enim quis hoc amore aliquem diligit,
            inquantum est sibi utilis, ut dictum est. Et ideo magis diligit in
            hoc se quam illum: sicut qui diligit vinum quia est sibi
            delectabile, se potius quam vinum diligit. Sed amor amicitiae est
            potius rei amatae quam amantis, quia diligit aliquem propter ipsum
            dilectum, non propter ipsum diligentem. Sic ergo, quia in amore
            amicitiae similitudo causa est amoris, dissimilitudo causa odii,
            inde est quod mundus odio habet quod suum non est et sibi dissimile,
            et diligit, idest dilectione amicitiae, quod suum est. Sed de
            dilectione concupiscentiae est e converso. Et ideo dicit

          <td>
            Notice that the love of concupiscence is not a love for the thing
            desired but a love for the person desiring: for in this kind of
            love, one loves another because the other is useful, as was said.
            Therefore, in this kind of love, one is rather loving himself than
            the other. For example, a person who loves wine because it gives him
            pleasure loves himself rather than the wine. But the love of
            friendship is concerned rather with the thing loved than with the
            one loving, because here one loves another for the sake of the one
            loved, and not for the sake of the one loving. And so because in the
            love of friendship likeness is a cause of love, and unlikeness a
            cause of hatred, the world hates what is not its own and is unlike
            it; but it loves, with the love of friendship, what is its own. It
            is the reverse with the love of concupiscence. Thus he says,
            <b>If you were of the world, the world would love its own,</b>
            with the love of friendship.

            <b>the world hates you,</b>
            that is, those who love the world and who are unlike you, hate you:
            "An unjust man is an abomination to the righteous, but he whose way
            is straight is an abomination to the wicked" (Prv 29:27); and in the

              >nolite mirari, fratres, si odit vos mundus. Nos scimus quoniam
              translati sumus de morte ad vitam, quoniam diligimus fratres</i
            >. Et ideo dicit Sap. II, 15:
            <i>gravis est nobis etiam ad videndum</i>. Secunda ratio est
            displicentia correctionis. Nam sancti viri et verbis et factis mundi
            facta reprehendunt; et ideo mundus odit eos; Amos V, v. 10:

            <i>quia testimonium perhibeo de illo, quod opera eius mala sunt</i>.

            dicitur, quod videntes fratres Ioseph quod a cunctis plus amaretur,

            2038 Three reasons can be given why the world hates those who are
            holy. First, there is a difference of condition: the world is in a
            state of death, but those who are holy are in a state of life: "Do
            not wonder, brethren, that the world hates you. We know that we have
            passed out of death into life, because we love the brethren" (1 Jn
            3:13). And so we read: "The very sight of him is a burden to us"
            (Wis 2:15). The second reason is that the world does not like to be
            corrected: for those who are holy are, by their words and actions, a
            rebuke to the conduct of the world. Consequently the world hates
            them: "They hate him who reproves in the gate" (Amos 5:10); "But
            it," the world, "hates me because I testify of it that its works are
            evil" (7:7). The third reason is because of evil envy, for those who
            are evil envy the good when they see them grow and increase in
            goodness and holiness, just like the Egyptians hated and persecuted
            the children of Israel when they saw them increasing (Ex 1:9). And
            we also see that Joseph's brothers hated him when they saw that he
            was loved more than they (Gen 37:4).

            2040 Their different conditions were that Christ was the Lord and
            the apostles were servants: "A servant is not greater than his
            master" (13:16). He reminds them of this difference when he says,
            <b

            sufferings as your Lord; rather, you should regard this as a great
            glory. Thus Christ said to the disciples who were asking to sit on
            his right and left, "Are you able to drink the cup that I am to
            drink?" (Mt 20:22). "It is a great honor to follow God" (Sir 23:28);

            2041 On the contrary. He said above, "No longer do I call you
            servants" (15:15), while he says here,
            <b>A servant is not greater than his master.</b>
            I answer that there are two kinds of servitude. One comes from a
            slave‑like fear, that is, from a fear of punishment; and the
            Apostles were not servants in this way. The other comes from a
            "chaste fear," [the respect of a spouse], and such servitude was in
            the apostles: "Blessed are those servants whom the master finds
            awake when he comes" (Lk 12:37).

            And so because their reason for acting is the same in the two cases,
            the consequence follows:
            <b>If they persecuted me, they will persecute you:</b>
            "If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much
            more will they malign those of his household" (Mt 10:25). Matthew
            (23:34) says of this persecution: "Therefore I send you prophets and
            wise men and scribes, some of whom you will kill and crucify, and
            some you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from to town
            to town." Similarly, they will be honored for the same reason that
            Christ was: if they kept my word, they will keep yours also, because
            your words are my words: "You desire proof that Christ is speaking
            in me" (2 Cor 13:3); "For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of
            your Father speaking through you" (Mt 10:20). And so Christ says,
            "He who hears you hears me" (Lk 10:16). The apostles were in truth
            accepted and honored by some of the people, as is clear from "When
            you received the word of God which you heard from us, you accepted
            it not as the word of men but as what it really is, the word of God"
            (1 Thess 2: 13).

            2043 Now he amplifies on the second consideration that would console
            them, which is based on the reason for their being hated. The
            apostles were chosen and raised above the world insofar as they had
            been made sharers of divinity and joined to God. This is why the
            world hated them. From this it follows that the world rather hated
            God in them than hated them. The reason for this hatred was that the
            world lacked the true knowledge of God which comes from the true
            faith and devoted love. If they did have this knowledge and
            recognized that the apostles were friends of God, they would not
            have persecuted them. Thus he says,
            <b>all this they will do to you,</b>
            that is, hate and persecute you,
            <b>on my account</b>. And so this should be your glory: "Let none of
            you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or a wrongdoer, or a
            mischief‑maker; yet if one suffers as a Christian, let him not be
            ashamed, but under that name let him glorify God" (1 Pet 4:14). On
            my account, not because they love me, but because they hate me; just
            as, on the contrary, you will suffer on my account because you love
            me.

            2046 How does this reconcile with Romans (3:23) which states that
            "All have sinned"? We should say that our Lord is not speaking here
            of just any sin, but of the sin of disbelief, that is, they do not
            believe in Christ. This is called here simply "sin" because it is a
            prime example of sin, because as long as this sin lasts, no other
            sin can be remitted; for no sin is remitted except by faith in Jesus
            Christ through whom we are justified, as we read in Romans (5:1).
            Consequently,
            <b>they would not have sin</b> means that they would not be charged
            with not believing in him. This is primarily because "faith comes
            from what is heard" (Rom 10:17). So, if Christ had not come and had
            not spoken to them, they could not have believed. And no one is
            charged with a sin for not doing what he can't do at all.

            privati beneficio Dei propter alia eorum peccata actualia et
            originalia, damnabuntur.

            2047 Yet some could say that they were bound to believe and could
            have believed even if Christ had not come, since he had been
            foretold to them by the prophets: "which he promised beforehand
            through his prophets in the holy scriptures, the gospel concerning
            his Son" (Rom 1:2). I answer that of themselves the Jews could not
            believe and understand the words of the prophets unless they were
            shown by divine help: "The words are shut up and sealed until the
            appointed time" [Dan 12:9]. Thus the eunuch said: "How can I
            understand, unless some one guides me?" (Acts 8:31).
            <p>
              Therefore, if Christ had not come, they would not have this sin,
              the sin of disbelief, although they would have had other actual
              sins for which they would have been punished. And a similar
              reasoning holds for all those whom the preaching of God's word
              could not reach. For this reason they cannot be charged with the
              sin of disbelief for their condemnation; but they will be
              condemned, because deprived of God's favors because of their other
              actual sins and original sin.

            2049 He has just stated what could have excused them from unbelief.
            But they don't have this excuse because Christ showed himself to
            them in person and taught them. Thus he says,
            <b>but now,</b> since I have come and spoken to them,
            <b>they have no excuse</b>, that of ignorance,
            <b>for their sin.</b> "So they are without excuse; for although they
            knew God they did not honor him as God" (Rom 1:20). But they did
            know Christ, as is clear from Matthew (21:38): "This is the heir;
            come, let us kill him." However, they knew that he was the Christ
            promised in the law, but they did not know that he was God, because
            "If they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory" (1
            Cor 2:8). And so their ignorance is no excuse, because they did not
            do this from ignorance but from another root, that is, from hatred
            and a certain malice.

            2051 Two problems arise here. First, whether anyone can hate God? We
            should say that no one can hate God as God. Since God is the pure
            essence of goodness, and since this is lovable in itself, it is
            impossible that God be hated in himself. This is the reason why it
            is impossible for an evil person to see God. For it is impossible
            for God to be seen without being loved; and one who loves God is
            good. So these two things are incompatible, namely, to see God and
            be evil.

            Yet one can hate God from a particular point of view. For example,

            enjoyment of lust, and one who wants to be free from all punishment
            hates the justice of God when it punishes.

            Secunda quaestio est quia nullus potest habere odio quod ignorat:
            Iudaei autem ignorabant patrem, supra eodem:
            <i>nesciunt eum qui me misit</i>: non ergo verum videtur quod dicit
            <i>et patrem meum odit</i>. Sed dicendum, secundum Augustinum, quod
            aliquis potest aliquid diligere vel odire quod numquam vidit, neque
            secundum veritatem cognoscit, sed fama de eo bene seu male
            sermocinante. Sed hoc potest contingere dupliciter. Uno modo quod
            habeatur odio seu diligatur secundum ipsam eius personam, vel
            secundum id quod de eo narratur; sicut si audiam aliquem esse furem,
            odio eum, non quia ipsam eius personam cognoscam vel odiam, sed quia
            communiter odio omnem furem: unde si esset fur, et ego eum furem
            esse nescirem, haberem eum odio, nec tamen scirem me eum odire.
            Iudaei autem habebant odio Christum, et veritatem quam praedicabat.
            Unde cum ipsa veritas, quam Christus praedicabat, esset in voluntate
            Dei patris, et opera quae Christus faciebat; similiter sicut
            Christum, odio habebant patrem, licet ipsi nescirent illa esse in
            voluntate patris.

            2052 The second problem arises because no once can hate what he does
            not know. But the Jews did not know the Father: "They do not know
            him who sent me" (15:21). Therefore, what he says here does not seem
            to be true, that they
            <b>hate my Father also.</b>
            We can say, according to Augustine, that a person can love or hate
            something that was never seen nor truly known.
            <a href="John15.htm#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" id="_ftnref24">[24]</a>
            This can happen in two ways. In one way, I can hate or love a person
            according as I know him; or, according to what I am told about him.
            For example, if I hear that someone is a thief I hate him, not
            because I know or hate this very person, but because in general I
            hate all thieves. So, if he were a thief and I did not know it, I
            would hate him without knowing that I hated him. Now the Jews hated
            Christ and the truth that he preached. Since the very truth that
            Christ preached and the works he performed were in the will of God
            the Father, then just as they hated Christ, so also they hated the
            Father, even though they did not know that these things were in the
            will of the Father.

            Did Christ perform certain good works among them that no one else
            had done? It seems not. If we say that Christ raised the dead,
            Elijah and Elisha also did this. If Christ walked on the water,
            Moses parted the waters. Again, Joshua did something greater [than
            Christ] for he made the sun stand still. So it seems that Christ
            should not use this as an argument, and thus the conclusion is not
            true.

            I answer that we can say, according to Augustine, that our Lord is
            not speaking of the miracles he worked among them, that is, merely
            in their sight, but of those he worked "among" them, that is, on
            their very persons.

            In curing the sick, although others did it, no one did it so much as
            Christ, because no other was made God and no one was born of a
            virgin but Christ. So in healing the sick he performed among them
            works which no one else performed; and this in three ways. First,
            because his works were so great: for he raised a person who had been
            dead for four days; he gave sight to a man who was born blind, which
            had never been heard of before, as we read above (9:32). Secondly,
            because of the great number of his works, for he healed all who were
            sick (Mt 14:35), and no one else did this. Thirdly, because of the
            way he did these works: others did these things by praying for help,
            which showed that they were not doing this by their own power; but
            Christ did it by command, for he did it by his own power: "What is
            this? A new teaching! With authority he commands even the unclean
            spirits, and they obey him" (Mk 1:27).

            2055 The second question is about the truth of the conditional
            statement, that if Christ had not done among them works which no one
            else did, the Jews would not have the sin of disbelief. My reply is
            that if we speak of any of the miracles indiscriminately, the Jews
            would have been excusable if they had not been done among them by
            Christ. For no one can come to Christ by faith unless he is drawn:
            "No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him"
            (6:44). So the spouse says in the Song (1:4): "Draw me after you."
            Therefore, if there were no one who had drawn them to the faith,
            they would have an excuse for their disbelief. Note that Christ drew
            by words and by signs, both visible and invisible, that is, by
            inciting and stirring hearts from within: "The king's heart is a
            stream of water in the hand of the Lord" (Prv 21:1). And so an inner
            impulse to act well is the work of God, and those who resist it sin.
            If not, Stephen would have no reason to say: "You always resist the
            Holy Spirit" (Acts 7:51). And Isaiah (50:5) says: "The Lord has
            opened my ear," that is, the ear of my heart, "and I was not
            rebellious." When our Lord said,
            <b>If I had not done among them the works which no one else did,</b>
            we have to understand this as referring not only to visible works
            but also to the interior impulses and attractions to his teaching.
            If these had not been done among them, they would not have sin. It
            is now clear how they could have been excused, that is, if he had
            not accomplished miraculous works among them.

            2056 Now he shows the root of their sin of disbelief, namely, their
            hatred, because of which they did not believe the works they saw. He
            says,
            <b>but now they have seen,</b>
            the works he did among them,
            <b>and hated both me and my Father:</b>
            "Because they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the
            Lord" (Prv 1:29). As Gregory says, there are some in the Church who
            not only do not do good works, but they even persecute those who do,
            so that what they fail to do they detest in others.

            2057 Yet some could say: If it is true that the Jews hated you and
            your Father, why did you perform miracles among them? He answers and
            says
            <b>It is to fulfill the word that is written in their law.</b>
            Here we could ask why he says that this was written in their law
            when it was written in the Psalms? We can say to this that the "law"
            is understood in three ways in scripture. Sometimes it is taken for
            the entire Old Testament; and this is the way it is understood here,
            because the entire teaching of the Old Testament is directed to the
            observance of the law: "Jesus, remember me when you come in your
            kingdom" (Lk 23:42). Sometimes it is taken as distinguished from the
            histories and the prophets: "that everything written about me in the
            law of Moses and the prophets and the psalms" (in which the
            histories are sometimes included) "must be fulfilled" (Lk 24:44).
            And sometimes the law is taken as distinct only from the prophets,
            and then the histories are included in the prophets. He says,
            <b>It is to fulfill what is written in their law,</b>
            that is, in the Psalms (35:19)
            <b>'They hated me without a cause,'</b>
            and not to gain some benefit or avoid some trouble (for this is why
            people hate). Indeed, Christ gave them opportunities to love him
            when he healed and taught them: "He went about doing good" (Acts
            10:38); "Is evil a recompense for good? They have dug a pit for my
            life" (Jer 18:20); "What wrong did your fathers find in me that they
            went far from me" (Jer 2:5).

            Strictly speaking that person is said to come who comes willingly
            and on his own authority; and this is true of the Holy Spirit,

            et cetera. Ubi sciendum est, quod spiritus sanctus mitti dicitur,

            quos templum Dei facit; I Cor. III, 15:
            <i>templum Dei estis, et spiritus Dei habitabit in vobis</i>. Nec
            est contrarium quod spiritus sanctus dicitur mitti et venire: nam in
            hoc quod venire dicitur, manifeste apparet maiestas divinitatis
            ipsius, <i>qui operatur prout vult</i>, I Cor. XII, 6. Dicitur autem
            mitti ut ostendatur processio ipsius ab alio: quod enim creaturam
            rationalem inhabitando sanctificet, ab alio habet, a quo habet ut
            sit, sicut filius ab alio habet quidquid operatur.

          <td>
            2061 Thirdly, he touches on the twofold procession of the Holy
            Spirit. First, he mentions the temporal procession when he says,
            <b>whom I shall send to you from the Father.</b>
            Note that the Holy Spirit is said to be sent not because the Spirit
            is changing place, since the Spirit fills the entire universe, as we
            read in Wisdom (1:7), but because, by grace, the Holy Spirit begins
            to dwell in a new way in those he makes a temple of God: "Do you not
            know that you are God's temple and that God's Spirit dwells in you?"
            (1 Cor 3:16). There is no disagreement in saying that the Holy
            Spirit is sent and that he comes. In saying that the Spirit comes,
            the grandeur of his divinity is indicated: the "Spirit, who
            apportions to each one individually as he wills" (1 Cor 12:11). And
            he is said to be sent to indicate his procession from another, for
            the fact that he sanctifies the rational creature by indwelling he
            has from that other, from whom he has it that he is, just as it is
            from another that the Son has whatever he does.

            The Holy Spirit is sent by the Father and the Son together; and this

            is, the Holy Spirit, "flowing from the throne of God and of the
            Lamb," that is, of Christ (Rev 22:1). Therefore, when speaking of
            the sending of the Holy Spirit he mentions the Father and the Son,
            who send the Spirit by the same and equal power. Thus sometimes he
            mentions the Father as sending the Spirit, but not without the Son,
            as above (14:26): "The Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my
            name"; at other times he says that he himself sends the Holy Spirit,
            but not without the Father: as here,
            <b>whom I shall send to you from the Father,</b>
            because whatever the Son does he has from the Father: "The Son
            cannot do anything of himself" [5:19].

            2062 He mentions the eternal procession of the Holy Spirit when he
            shows in a similar way that the Spirit is related both to the Father
            and the Son. He shows the Spirit as related to the Son when he says,
            <b>the Spirit of truth,</b>
            for the Son is the Truth: "I am the way, and the truth, and the
            life" (14:6). He shows the Spirit as related to the Father when he
            says,
            <b>who proceeds from the Father.</b>
            So to say that the Holy Spirit is
            <b>the Spirit of truth,</b>
            is the same as saying the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of the Son: "God
            has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts" (Gal 4:6). And
            because the word "spirit" (<i>spiritus</i>) suggests a kind of
            impulse and every motion produces an effect in harmony with its
            source (as heating makes something hot), it follows that the Holy
            Spirit makes those to whom he is sent like the one whose Spirit he
            is. And since he is the Spirit of Truth "He will teach you all
            truth" [16:13]; "The inspiration of the Almighty gives
            understanding" [Job 32:8]. In the same way, because he is the Spirit
            of the Son, he produces sons: "You have received the spirit of
            sonship" (Rom 8:15). He says the
            <b>Spirit of truth</b>

            2063 Because he says
            <b>who proceeds from the Father</b>
            and does not add "and from the Son," the Greeks say that the Holy
            Spirit does not proceed from the Son but only from the Father. But
            this absolutely cannot be. For the Holy Spirit could not be
            distinguished from the Son unless he either proceeds from the Son,
            or on the other hand, the Son proceeds from him (and no one claims
            this). For one cannot say that among the divine persons, who are
            entirely immaterial and simple, there is a material distinction
            based on a division of quantity, which matter underlies. Thus it is
            necessary that the distinction of the divine persons be by way of a
            formal distinction, which has to involve some kind of opposition.
            For if forms are not opposed they are compatible with one another in
            the same subject and do not diversify a supposit; for example, to be
            white and large. So among the divine persons, since "not subject to
            birth" and "fatherhood" are not opposed, they belong to one person.
            If, then, the Son and the Holy Spirit are distinct persons
            proceeding from the Father, they have to be distinguished by some
            properties that are opposed. These properties cannot be opposed like
            affirmation and negation or privation and possessing are opposed,
            because then the Son and the Holy Spirit would be related to one
            another like being and non‑being and as the complete to the
            deprived, and this is repugnant to their equality. Nor can these
            properties be opposed like contraries are opposed, one of which is
            more perfect than the other. What remains is that the Holy Spirit is
            distinguished from the Son only by a relative opposition.

            Haec autem oppositio non potest nisi ex hoc esse quod unus eorum

            This kind of opposition rests solely on the fact that one of them is
            referred to the other. For the different relations of two things to
            some third thing are not directly opposed except accidentally, that
            is by some incidental consequence. So in order for the Holy Spirit
            to be distinguished from the Son, they must have relations that are
            opposed, by which they will be opposed to each other. No such
            relations can be found except relations of origin, insofar as one
            person is from the other. Thus it is impossible, granting the
            Trinity of persons, that the Holy Spirit not be from the Son.

            2064 Some say that the Holy Spirit and the Son are distinguished by
            the different ways they proceed, insofar as the Son is from the
            Father by being born and the Holy Spirit by proceeding. But the same
            problem still returns which arose from the previous opinion, as to
            how these two processions differ. One cannot say that they are
            distinguished because of the diverse things received by their
            respective generations, like the generation of a human being and a
            horse differ because of the diverse natures that are communicated.
            For the very same nature is received by the Son by being born from
            the Father and by the Holy Spirit by proceeding. So we are left with
            the conclusion that they are distinguished only by the order of
            origin, that is to say, insofar as the birth of the Son is a
            principle of the procession of the Holy Spirit. And so, if the Holy
            Spirit were not from the Son, the Spirit would not be distinguished
            from the Son and procession would not be distinguished from birth.

            Thus even the Greeks admit some order between the Son and the Holy
            Spirit. For they say that the Holy Spirit is of the Son, and that
            the Son acts through the Holy Spirit, but not conversely. And some
            even admit that the Holy Spirit is from the Son, but they will not
            concede that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son. Yet in this they
            are obviously imprudent. For we use the word "procession" in all
            cases in which one thing is from another in any way. And so this
            word, because it is so general, has been adapted to indicate the
            existence of the Holy Spirit as from the Son. We don't have any
            examples of this in creatures which would lead us to give it a
            specific name; while we do have examples which give us the special
            term of "generation" which is applied to the Son. The reason for
            this is that in creatures we do not find a person proceeding from
            will, as love, while we do find a person proceeding from nature, as
            son. Thus, however the Holy Spirit is ordered to the Son, it can be
            concluded that the Spirit proceeds from the Son.

            2065 Nevertheless some of the Greeks assert that one should not say
            that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son because for them the
            preposition "from" indicates a principle which is not from a
            principle, and this is so only of the Father. This is not compelling
            because the Son with the Father is one principle of the Holy Spirit,
            as also of creatures. And although the Son has it from the Father
            that the Son is a principle of creatures, still creatures are said
            to be from the Son; and for the same reason it can be said that the
            Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son.

            gifts of the Holy Spirit" (Heb 2:4). Thirdly, the Spirit will soften
