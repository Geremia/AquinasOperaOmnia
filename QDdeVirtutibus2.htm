            Whether Charity Is Something Created in the Soul, or Is it the Holy Spirit Itself?</b></a>
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et videtur quod caritas non sit aliquid creatum in anima.
          <td>It seems that charity is not something created in the soul.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sicut enim dicit Augustinus, sicut anima est vita corporis, ita Deus est vita animae. Sed anima est vita corporis sine medio. Ergo et Deus est vita animae sine medio. Cum igitur vita animae sit ex hoc quod est in caritate: quia qui non diligit, manet in morte, ut dicitur I Ioan. III, 14, homo non est in caritate per aliquid quod sit medium inter Deum et hominem, sed per ipsum Deum. Caritas ergo non est aliquid creatum in anima, sed ipse Deus.
          <td>1. For, as Augustine says, just as the soul is the life of the body, so God is the life of the soul. But the soul is immediately the life of the body. Therefore God is immediately the life of the soul. Therefore, since a soul is said to be alive from the fact that it has charity, as is said (1 John iii. 14), He that loveth not, abideth in death, man is not in charity through something which is a medium between God and man, but through God Himself. Charity, therefore, is not something created in the soul, but is God Himself.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed dicebatur, quod similitudo illa attenditur quantum ad hoc quod anima est vita corporis hominis ut motor, non quantum ad hoc quod est vita corporis ut forma. —Sed contra, quanto aliquod agens est virtuosius, tanto minorem dispositionem requirit in patiente: ignis enim magnus sufficiens est etiam ligna minus desiccata comburere. Sed Deus est agens infinitae virtutis. Ergo si est vita animae, sicut movens ipsam ad diligendum; videtur quod non requiratur aliqua dispositio creata ex parte ipsius animae.
          <td>2. But it was objected that the comparison is applied only in this respect, that the soul is the life of the body as a mover, and not insofar as it is the life of the body as a form. But on the contrary, in proportion as any agent is more powerful, to that extent it requires less of a disposition in the patient; e.g., the less dry the wood is, the greater must be the fire sufficient to burn it. But God is an agent of infinite power. Therefore, if He is the life of the soul, as moving it to love, it seems that no created disposition on the part of this soul is required.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, inter ea quae sunt idem, non cadit medium. Sed anima diligens Deum est idem cum Deo: quia, ut dicitur I ad Corinth. cap. VI, 17, qui adhaeret Deo, unus spiritus est. Ergo non cadit aliqua caritas creata media inter animam diligentem et Deum dilectum.
          <td>3. Moreover, there is no medium among those things which are the same. But the soul loving God is the same as God, as is said (1 Cor. vi. 17), He who is joined to the Lord, is one in spirit. Therefore no created charity comes as a medium between the soul loving and God being loved.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, dilectio qua diligimus proximum caritas est. Sed dilectio qua diligimus proximum, ipse Deus est; dicit enim Augustinus in VIII de Trinit.: qui proximum diligit, consequens est ut ipsam dilectionem diligat. Deus autem dilectio est. Consequens ergo est ut praecipue Deum diligat. Ergo caritas non est aliquid creatum, sed ipse Deus.
          <td>4. Moreover, the love by which we love our neighbor is charity. But the love by which we love our neighbor is God Himself, for Augustine says in Book VIII of the <i>De Trinitate</i> , He who loves his neighbor loves the same love. But God is love. It follows, therefore, that he especially loves God. Therefore charity is not something created, but is God Himself.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed dicebatur, quod Deus est dilectio qua diligimus proximum causaliter. —Sed contra, Augustinus in eodem dicit, quod cum testimonio verborum Ioannis aperte declarat, ipsam supernam dilectionem, qua nos diligimus invicem, non solum ex Deo esse, sed etiam Deum esse. Non solum ergo causaliter, sed essentialiter dilectio Deus est.
          <td>5. But it was said that God, as a cause, is the love by which we love our neighbor. On the contrary, Augustine says in the same place, and he clearly proved it with the testimony of the words of St. John, that that very celestial love by which we love each other is not only from God but also is God. Therefore God is love not only causally, but essentially.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, Augustinus dicit in V de Trinitate: non dicturi sumus caritatem non propterea esse dictam Deum, quod ipsa caritas sit ipsa substantia quae Dei digna sit nomine; sed quod donum sit Dei, sicut dictum est de eo: tu es patientia mea; quia ab ipso nobis est. Non autem sic dictum est: domine, tu caritas mea; sed ita dictum est: Deus caritas est; sicut dictum est: Deus spiritus est. Videtur ergo quod Deus dicatur caritas non solum causaliter, sed essentialiter.
          <td>6. Moreover, Augustine says in Book V of the <i>De Trinitate</i> , For we are not going to say that God is called Love because love itself is a substance worthy of the name of God, but because it is a gift of God, as it is said of God, "Thou art my patience," in that He Himself gives it to us. For it is not said, 0 Lord You are my love; but it is said thus, "God is love," as it is said, "God is a Spirit." Therefore it is that God is called charity not only causally, but also essentially.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, cognito effectu Dei, non propter hoc ipse Deus cognoscitur. Sed per cognitionem dilectionis supernae ipse Deus cognoscitur. Dicit enim Augustinus, VIII de Trinit.: magis quis novit dilectionem qua diligit, quam fratrem quem diligit. Ecce iam potest notiorem Deum habere quam fratrem. Amplectere dilectionem, et dilectione amplectere Deum. Non igitur Deus dicitur dilectio fraterna solum per causam.
          <td>7. Moreover, when the effect of God is known, He Himself is not known because of this, but He is known through the knowledge of the highest love. For Augustine says in Book VIII of the Dc Trinitate, For he knows the love with which he loves, more than the brother whom he loves. So now he can know God more than he knows his brother. Embrace the love of God, and by love embrace God. Therefore God is called fraternal love not solely as a cause.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed dicebatur, quod fraterna dilectione cognita, cognoscitur Deus sicut in sua similitudine. Sed contra, homo secundum ipsam substantiam animae factus est ad imaginem et similitudinem Dei. Sed similitudo ista obscuratur per peccatum. Ad hoc igitur quod Deus possit in anima sicut in sua similitudine cognosci, requiritur solum quod peccatum tollatur; et non quod aliquid creatum animae superaddatur.
          <td>8. But it was objected that when fraternal love is recognized, God is recognized as in His own likeness. On the contrary, man is made in the image and likeness of God according to the very substance of his soul. But this likeness is obscured through sin. Therefore, in order that God be able to be recognized in the soul as in His own image, it is only necessary that sin be taken away, and not that some created thing be superadded to the soul.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, omne quod est in anima, vel est potentia, vel passio, vel habitus, ut dicitur in III Ethic. Sed caritas non est potentia animae, quia esset naturalis; nec est passio, quia non est in potentia sensitiva, in qua sunt omnes passiones; nec est habitus, quia habitus est difficile mobilis; caritas autem de facili amittitur, quia per unum actum peccati mortalis. Ergo caritas non est aliquid creatum in anima.
          <td>9. Moreover, everything that is in the soul is either a potency, or a passion, or a habit, as is said in Book III of the Ethic. But charity is not a potency of the soul, because if it were it would be natural. Nor is it a passion, because it is not in a sensitive potency in which are all passions. Nor is it a habit, because a habit is removed with difficulty; charity, however, is easily lost through one act of mortal sin. Therefore charity is not something created in the soul.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, nullum creatum habet virtutem infinitam. Sed caritas habet virtutem infinitam, quia coniungit infinite distantia, scilicet animam Deo, et meretur bonum infinitum. Ergo caritas non est aliquid creatum in anima.
          <td>10. Moreover, no created thing has infinite power. But charity has infinite power because it joins what is infinitely far apart, viz., the soul to God, and it merits an infinite good. Therefore charity is not something created in the soul.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, omnis creatura vanitas est, ut patet Eccle. I. Vanitas autem non coniungit veritati. Cum ergo caritas coniungat nos primae veritati, videtur quod caritas non sit creatura.
          <td>11. Moreover, every creature is vanity, as is shown (Eccle. i. 2). Vanity, however, does not unite with truth. Therefore, since charity unites us to the First Truth, charity is not something created.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, omne creatum est natura quaedam, cum sit in aliquo decem generum. Si igitur caritas est aliquid creatum in anima, videtur quod sit natura quaedam. Cum igitur caritate mereamur: si caritas est aliquid creatum, sequetur quod natura sit principium merendi; quod est erroneum secundum sententiam Pelagii.
          <td>12. Moreover, every created thing is a certain nature since it falls within one of the ten genera. Therefore, if charity is something created in the soul, it is a certain nature. Therefore, since we merit by charity, and if charity is a created thing, it follows that nature is the principle of meriting. This is the erroneous opinion of Pelagius.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, homo secundum esse gratiae est propinquior Deo quam secundum esse naturae. Sed Deus creavit hominem secundum esse naturae sine medio. Ergo nec in esse gratiae utitur medio, scilicet caritate creata.
          <td>13. Moreover, man is closer to God according to his existence in grace than he is according to his existence in nature. But God created man without a medium according to his existence in nature. So, neither in man's existence in grace does God use a medium, viz., a created charity.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, agens quod agit sine medio, est perfectius quam agens quod agit cum medio. Sed Deus est perfectissimum agens. Ergo agit sine medio: non ergo iustificat animam mediante aliquo creato.
          <td>14. Moreover, an agent which acts without a medium is more perfect than an agent which acts through a medium. But God is the most perfect agent. Therefore He acts without a medium. He does not, therefore justify the soul through the medium of any created thing.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, creatura rationalis est nobilior aliis creaturis. Sed aliae creaturae consequuntur suum finem absque aliquo alio superaddito. Multo magis igitur creatura rationalis movetur a Deo ad suum finem absque aliquo creato ei superaddito.
          <td>15. Moreover, a rational creature is more excellent than other creatures But other creatures attain their own end without anything superadded Therefore even more is a rational creature moved by God to its end with out some created thing superadded to it.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed dicebatur, quod creatura rationalis non est proportionata ad suum finem per sua naturalia; et ideo indiget aliquo superaddito. Sed contra, finis hominis est bonum infinitum. Sed nullum creatum est proportionatum bono infinito. Ergo id per quod homo ordinatur in suum finem, non est bonum creatum in anima.
          <td>16. But it was objected that a rational creature is not, through its own nature, proportionate to its end, and therefore it needs something super added. On the contrary, the end of man is the infinite good. But no created thing is proportionate to an infinite good. Therefore that by which man is ordered to his end is not a good created in the soul.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, sicut Deus est lumen primum, ita est et bonum summum. Sed lumen quod Deus est, praesens est animae; quia de eo dicitur, Psal. XXXV, 10: in lumine tuo videbimus lumen. Ergo et summum bonum, quod Deus est, praesens est animae. Sed bonum est quo aliquid diligimus. Ergo id quo diligimus, est Deus.
          <td>17. Moreover, as God is the first light, He is also the highest good. But the light which is God is present to the soul, because of which it is said ( Ps. xxxv. 10), In thy light we shall see light. Therefore the highest good, which is God, is also present to the soul. But the good is that by which we love something. Therefore that by which we love is God.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed dicebatur, quod bonum quod Deus est, est praesens animae non formaliter, sed effective.- Sed contra, Deus est pura forma. Ergo formaliter adest his quibus adest.
          <td>18. But it was objected that the good which is God is present to the soul not formally but efficiently. On the contrary, God is pure form. Therefore He is present formally in those things in which He is present.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, nihil diligitur nisi cognitum, ut dicit Augustinus, X de Trinitate. Ergo secundum hoc aliquid est diligibile secundum quod est cognoscibile. Sed Deus est per seipsum cognoscibilis, sicut primum principium cognoscendi. Ergo est per seipsum diligibilis: non ergo per aliquam caritatem creatam.
          <td>19. Moreover, nothing is loved unless it is known, as Augustine say in Book X of the <i>De Trinitate</i> . Therefore according to this, a thing is lovable according as it is knowable. But God is, through Himself, knowable as the first principle of knowledge. Therefore He is lovable throngh Himself and not through any created charity.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea unumquodque, secundum hoc est diligibile, secundum quod est bonum. Sed Deus est infinitum bonum. Ergo est in infinitum diligibilis. Sed nullus amor creatus est infinitus. Ergo cum aliqui qui sunt in caritate, diligant eum secundum quod diligibilis est; videtur quod dilectio qua diligimus Deum, non sit aliquid creatum.
          <td>20. Moreover, a thing is lovable according as it is good. But God is infinite good. Therefore He is infinitely lovable. But no created love is infinite. Therefore, since some who have charity love God because He is lovable, the love by which we love God is not something created.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, Deus diligit omnia quae sunt, ut dicitur Sapient. XI, 25. Sed non diligit creaturas irrationales per aliquid eis superadditum. Ergo nec creaturas rationales. Et ita videtur quod caritas et gratia propter quas homines diliguntur a Deo, non sint aliquid creatum superadditum animae nostrae.
          <td>21. Moreover, God loves all things which exist, as is said (Wis. xi. 25). But He does not love irrational creatures through something superadded to them; therefore neither does He love rational creatures in this way. Thus the charity and grace according to which man is loved by God is not something created and superadded to the soul.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, si caritas sit aliquid creatum, oportet quod sit accidens. Sed caritas non est accidens: quia nullum accidens est dignius suo subiecto; caritas autem est dignior quam natura. Ergo caritas non est aliquid creatum in anima.
          <td>22. Moreover, if charity is something created, it must be an accident. But charity is not an accident because no accident is more worthy than its subject. Charity, however, is more worthy than nature. Therefore charity is not something created in the soul.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, sicut Bernardus dicit, eadem lege diligimus Deum et proximum qua pater et filius se diligunt. Sed pater et filius se diligunt dilectione increata. Ergo nos diligimus Deum dilectione increata.
          <td>23. Moreover, as Bernard says, we love God and our neighbor by the same law by which the Father and the Son love Themselves. But the Father and the Son love Themselves with an uncreated love. Therefore we love God with an uncreated love.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, illud quod suscitat a morte, est infinitae virtutis. Sed caritas suscitat a morte; dicitur enim I Ioan. III, 14: nos scimus quoniam translati sumus de morte ad vitam, quoniam diligimus fratres. Ergo caritas est virtutis infinitae; ergo non est aliquid creatum.
          <td>24. Moreover, that which can raise from death is of infinite power. But charity raises from death, for it is said (1 John iii. 14), We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren. Therefore charity is of infinite power and is not something created.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed contra, omne quod recipitur in aliquo, recipitur in eo per modum recipientis. Si ergo caritas recipitur in nobis a Deo, oportet quod recipiatur a nobis finite secundum modum nostrum. Omne autem finitum est creatum. Ergo caritas est aliquid creatum in nobis.
          <td>On the contrary, everything which is received in a thing is received in it according to the mode of the receiver. If, therefore, charity is received in us from God, it must be received finitely by us, according to our proper mode. However, every finite thing is created. Therefore charity is something created in us.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Respondeo. Dicendum, quod quidam posuerunt, quod caritas in nobis, qua diligimus Deum et proximum, non sit aliud quam spiritus sanctus, ut patet per Magistrum in 17 dist. I Sent. Et ut huius opinionis intellectus plenius habeatur, sciendum est, quod actum dilectionis quo Deum et proximum diligimus, Magister posuit quoddam creatum in nobis, sicut et actus ceterarum virtutum; sed ponebat differentiam inter actus caritatis et actus aliarum virtutum: quod spiritus sanctus ad actus aliarum virtutum movet animam mediantibus quibusdam habitibus, qui virtutes dicuntur; sed ad actum dilectionis movet voluntatem immediate per seipsum absque aliquo habitu, ut patet in 17 dist. I Lib. Et ad hoc ponendum movet ipsum excellentia caritatis, et verba Augustini in obiiciendo inducta, et quaedam similia. Ridiculum autem fuisset dicere, quod ipse actus dilectionis, quem experimur dum diligimus Deum et proximum, sit ipse spiritus sanctus.
          <td><b>I answer.</b> It must be said that there are some who have maintained that the charity in us by which we love God and our neighbor is nothing more than the Holy Spirit, as is clear from the Master in the First Book of the <i>Sentences</i> , dist. 17. In order that this opinion might be more clearly understood, it should be known that the Master placed this act of love by which we love God and our neighbor as a created thing in us, like the acts of the other virtues. But he set a difference between the act of charity and the acts of the other virtues. For, the Holy Spirit moves the soul to the acts of the other virtues by means of certain habitual means which are called virtues, but He moves the will immediately to the act of love through Himself without any habit, as is clear in Book I, dist. 17. It was the excellence of charity which moved him to posit this theory, and the words of Augustine and others were used in objections. However, it was ridiculous to say that the very act of love which we express when we love God and our neighbor is the Holy Spirit Itself.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed haec opinio omnino stare non potest. Sicut enim naturales actiones et motus a quodam principio intrinseco procedunt, quod est natura; ita et actiones voluntariae oportet quod a principio intrinseco procedant. Nam sicut inclinatio naturalis in rebus naturalibus appetitus naturalis nominatur, ita in rationalibus inclinatio apprehensionem intellectus sequens, actus voluntatis est.
          <td>This opinion clearly cannot stand. For, just as natural actions and movements proceed from a certain intrinsic principle which is nature, so also it is necessary that actions of the will proceed from an intrinsic principle. And, just as the natural inclination in natural things is called the natural appetite, so also in rational beings, the inclination which follows the apprehension of the intellect is the act of the will.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Possibile autem est quod res naturalis ab aliquo exteriori agente ad aliquid moveatur non a principio intrinseco, puta cum lapis proiicitur sursum. Sed quod talis motus vel actio non a principio intrinseco procedens, naturalis sit, hoc omnino est impossibile, quia in se contradictionem implicat. Unde, cum contradictoria esse simul non subsit divinae potentiae; nec hoc a Deo fieri potest, ut motus lapidis sursum, qui non est a principio intrinseco, sit ei naturalis. Potest quidem lapidi dare virtutem, ex qua sicut ex principio extrinseco sursum naturaliter moveatur; non autem ut motus iste sit ei naturalis, nisi ei alia natura detur. Et similiter non potest hoc divinitus fieri ut aliquis motus hominis vel interior vel exterior qui sit a principio extrinseco, sit voluntarius; unde omnes actus voluntatis reducuntur, sicut in primam radicem, in id quod homo naturaliter vult, quod est ultimus finis. Quae enim sunt ad finem, propter finem volumus.
          <td>It is, however, possible that a natural thing be moved not by an intrinsic principle but by some extrinsic agent, as for instance when a stone thrown into the air. But it is certainly impossible that such a movement or action which does not proceed from an intrinsic principle be called natural, for this would imply a contradiction in itself. Whence, since for contradictories to exist at the same time does not lie within the divine power, it cannot even be effected by God that the upward motion of a stone, which does not proceed from an intrinsic principle, be natural to it. Now it is possible to give a stone that power by which it would naturally move upward as from an intrinsic principle, but that motion would not be natural to the stone unless another nature be given to it. And likewise, it cannot be effected by God that any movement of man, either interior or exterior, which proceeds from an extrinsic principle is voluntary. Whence, all the acts of the will are reduced, as to a pristine root, to that which man naturally wishes, which is the last end; and he wishes the means for the sake of the end.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Actus igitur qui excedit totam facultatem naturae humanae, non potest esse homini voluntarius, nisi superaddatur naturae humanae aliquid intrinsecum voluntatem perficiens, ut talis actus a principio intrinseco proveniat. Si igitur actus caritatis in homine non ex aliquo habitu interiori procedat naturali potentiae superaddito, sed ex motione spiritus sancti, sequetur alterum duorum: vel quod actus caritatis non sit voluntarius; quod est impossibile, quia hoc ipsum diligere est quoddam velle; aut quod non excedat facultatem naturae, et hoc est haereticum.
          <td>Therefore an act which exceeds the entire capabilities of human nature cannot be voluntary to man unless there be added to human nature something intrinsic, perfecting the will, so that such an action would proceed from an intrinsic principle. If, therefore, the act of charity in man does not proceed from an interior habit superadded to a natural potency, but proceeds from the movement of the Holy Spirit, then one of these two alternatives follow: either an act of charity is not voluntary, which is impossible because to love something is to will it; or it does not exceed the capability of nature, and this view is heretical.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Hoc igitur remoto, sequetur primo quidem, quod actus caritatis sit actus voluntatis; secundo, dato quod actus voluntatis possit esse totaliter ab extrinseco, sicut actus manus vel pedis, sequetur etiam, si actus caritatis est solum a principio exteriori movente, quod non sit meritorius. Omne enim agens quod non agit secundum formam propriam, sed solum secundum quod est motum ab altero, est agens instrumentaliter tantum; sicut securis agit prout est mota ab artifice.
          <td>This difficulty being removed, it will follow, first, that the act of charity is an act of the will. Secondly, if it is granted that the act of the will can be entirely from an extrinsic principle, as acts of the hands or feet, it will also follow that if the act of charity is only from the movement of extrinsic principle, it cannot be meritorious. For, every agent which does not act according to its proper form but only because it is moved by a another, is an agent only instrumentally, as an axe is an agent only inasmuch as it is moved by a woodsman.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sic igitur si anima non agit actum caritatis per aliquam formam propriam, sed solum secundum quod est mota ab exteriori agente, scilicet spiritu sancto; sequetur quod ad hunc actum se habeat sicut instrumentum tantum. Non ergo in homine est hunc actum agere vel non agere; et ita non poterit esse meritorius. Haec enim solum meritoria sunt quae in nobis aliquo modo sunt; et sic totaliter tollitur meritum humanum, cum dilectio sit radix merendi.
          <td>Therefore if the soul does not effect an act of charity through some proper form, but only because it is moved by an extrinsic agent, i.e., by the Holy Spirit, then it will follow that it is considered only as an instrument for this act. There would not be, then, in man the power to act or not to act, and he would not be able to gain merit. For, only those things are meritorious which are in us according to a certain manner. Thus human merit is entirely taken away, since love is the basis of meriting.

          <td>Tertium inconveniens est, quia sequeretur quod homo qui est in caritate, ad actum caritatis non sit promptus, neque ipsum delectabiliter agat. Ex hoc enim actus virtutum sunt nobis delectabiles, quod secundum habitus conformamur ad illos, et inclinamur in illos per modum inclinationis naturalis. Et tamen actus caritatis est maxime delectabilis et maxime promptus existenti in caritate; et per eumdem omnia quae agimus vel patimur, delectabilia redduntur.
          <td>Thirdly it cannot hold, because it would follow that a man who is in charity would not be inclined to an act of charity, nor would he perform it with any pleasure. For, the acts of virtue are enjoyable to us because we are conformed to them according to a habit, and we are inclined toward them through the manner of a natural inclination. However, the act of charity is especially enjoyable and especially inclines one to remain in charity, and through it everything we do or suffer is rendered pleasing.

Et inde est quod omnia disponit suaviter, quia omnibus dat formas et virtutes inclinantes in id ad quod ipse movet, ut in illud tendant non coacte, sed quasi sponte.
          <td>The conclusion, therefore, is that there must be a certain habit of charity created in us, which is the formal principle of the act of love. By this opinion it is not denied that the Holy Spirit, Who is Uncreated Charity, exists in man who has created charity, or that He moves man's soul to the act of love, as God moves all things to their own actions to which they are inclined by their own proper forms. And thus it is that He disposes all things sweetly, because to all things He gives forms and powers inclining them to that which He Himself moves them; so that they tend toward it not by force, but as if it were by their own free accord.

          <td>Ad secundum dicendum, quod licet ad efficaciam moventis pertineat ut dispositionem non praeexigat in subiecto; tamen efficaciam eius demonstrat, si dispositionem fortem imprimat in passo vel moto. Fortis enim ignis non solum formam substantialem, sed et fortem dispositionem inducit. Unde fortius est agens quod sic ad agendum movet, quod etiam formam imprimit per quam agat, quam id movens quod sic movet ad agendum, ut tamen nullam imprimat formam. Unde cum spiritus sanctus sit virtuosissimum movens; sic movet ad diligendum, quod etiam habitum caritatis inducit.
          <td>To the second, it must be said that although it pertains to the effectiveness of a mover that it does not require any disposition in the subject, however, that mover displays its effectiveness if it impresses a strong disposition in that which receives or is moved. For, a great fire causes not only substantial form to appear, but also a strong disposition. That agent which moves to action, and which also impresses a form through that which it moves, is stronger than that mover which so moves to action that it impresses no form. Therefore, because the Holy Spirit is the most powerful mover, He so moves to love that He also causes a habit of charity.

          <td>To the third, it must be said that when it is written (1 Cor. vi. 17), He who is foined to the Lord, is one in spirit, this is not meant a unity of substance, but a unity of affection between the lover and the loved. By this union the habit of charity is regarded more as a principle of love than as a medium between the lover and the loved, for the act of love pass immediately to God as to the loved, but not immediately into the habit of charity.

          <td>To the fifth, it must be said that God is said to be love or charity only causally, as He is said to be hope or patience only causally, but also essentially. This, however, does not deny that besides that love which God is essentially, there is also in us a created love.

          <td>Ad septimum dicendum, quod auctoritas illa eamdem difficultatem habet, sive ponatur creatus habitus caritatis in nobis, sive non. Cum enim dicit Augustinus, quod qui diligit proximum, magis cognoscit dilectionem qua diligit, quam proximum quem diligit, intelligere videtur de ipso actu dilectionis. Quem quidem actum nullus ponit esse aliquid increatum; unde ex hoc concludi non potest quod ipsa dilectio sic nota, sit Deus; sed quod in hoc quod percipimus actum dilectionis in nobis, sentimus in nobis ipsis quamdam Dei participationem, quia ipse Deus dilectio est; non quod sit ipse actus dilectionis quem percipimus.
          <td>To the seventh, it must be said that this text has the same difficulty whether a created habit of charity is posited in us or not. For, when Augustine said that he who loves his neighbor knows the love by which he loves more than he knows the neighbor whom he loves, he seems to understand the very act of love. Now no one holds that this act is something uncreated; therefore it cannot be concluded that the love thus known is God. Therefore when we perceive in ourselves an act of love, we feel a certain participation of God because God Himself is love, not because He is that very act of love which we perceive.

          <td>To the eighth, it must be said that a creature, insofar as it is more perfect, approaches more to a likeness to God. Whence, although any creature has a certain likeness to God in this, that it exists and is good, however a rational creature has, in addition, a further cause for similitude in this, that it is intellectual, and another in what it has been made. Thus in the act of charity God is more expressly perceived as in a closer likeness.

However, infinite power would strive after charity if man were infinitely ordered to the infinite good through charity, which is clearly false. For, the manner follows the form of the thing.

It is not, however, heretical that we merit by something which exists as a certain nature in some category. For it is clear that we merit by our acts, and our acts, as created things, exist in some genus and are of a certain nature.

In iustificatione ergo requiritur aliqua operatio iustificantis; et ideo requiritur quod sit ibi principium activum formale: quod non habet locum in creatione.
          <td>To the thirteenth, it must be said that God created natural being without an efficient medium, but not without a formal medium. For, to each thing He gave the form through which it exists. And likewise He gives existence in grace through some superadded form. But existence in nature and existence in grace are not entirely similar for, as St. Augustine says in <i>Super Joan.</i> , He who created thee without thee will not justify thee without thee. Therefore in justification, some operation of justifying is needed and thus it is necessary that there be present an active formal principle which is not present in creation.

Sed si loquamur de medio formali, manifestum est quod quanto agens est perfectius, tanto magis formam inducit. Nam agens imperfectum non inducit formam, sed dispositionem tantum; et tanto debiliorem quanto est debilius.
          <td>To the fourteenth it must be said that an agent acting mediately is less effective if he uses that medium because of its necessity. But God does not use a medium because He is in need of the help of any creature; He acts mediately in order that He might preserve order in things. But if we speak of a formal medium, it is clearthat as the agent is more perfect, so much more will he induce a form. For an imperfect agent does not induce a form but only a disposition to the form, and the less perfect the agent is, the less is his power to induce that disposition.

When I say through Himself, this is understood on the part of the one loved, not of the one loving. For, God is loved by the soul not because of some other thing, but only because of Himself; and still the soul needs some formal principle in order to love God perfectly.

But when the accident is an act and the form of the substance, there is nothing to prevent the accident from being more worthy than the substance.

On the contrary, hope, because it does not join, always concerns that which is not joined. Hope is not necessary for those who are united to God through the enjoyment of beatitude. If charity unites, by the same reasoning it does not belong to those who are not yet united, i.e., to those living in this life. But virtue perfects us in this life, for it is a disposition of that which is perfect to that which is best. Therefore charity is not a virtue.

Nam proprium bonum hominis in quantum homo, est bonum rationis, eo quod homini esse est rationale esse.

Cum ergo virtus operetur ad bonum; ad virtutem cuiuslibet requiritur quod sic se habeat quod ad bonum bene operetur, id est voluntarie et prompte et delectabiliter, et etiam firmiter: hae enim sunt conditiones operationis virtuosae, quae non possunt convenire alicui operationi, nisi operans amet bonum propter quod operatur, eo quod amor est principium omnium voluntariarum affectionum. Quod enim amatur, desideratur dum non habetur, et delectationem infert quando habetur et tristitiam ingerunt ea quae ad habendo amatum impediunt.

          <td><b>I answer.</b> It must be said that charity is, without a doubt, a virtue. Now since a virtue is that which makes its possessor good and renders his works good, it is clear that man is ordered to his proper good according to the proper virtue. But the proper good of man must be considerd in various ways, according as man is understood under various aspects. The proper good of man as man is the good of reason, in that to be a man is to be rational. But the good of man considered as an artist is the good of art; so also considered in his political character, his good is the common good of the state. Since virtue operates for good, it is necessary for virtue of any kind that it operate well for the good, i.e., voluntarily, readily, with delight and firmly. These are the conditions of virtuous operation which are not found in any operation unless the agent love the good for which he is working, because love is the principle of all the voluntary affective powers. For, that which is loved is desired when it is not possessed; there is pleasure when it is possessed; and those things which prevent one from having what has been loved cause sadness. Also, those things which are done out of love are done steadily, rapidly and with delight. Therefore love of the good, for which virtue operates, is necessary for virtue.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Bonum autem ad quod operatur virtus quae est hominis in quantum homo, est homini connaturale; unde voluntati eius naturaliter inest huius boni amor, quod est bonum rationis. Sed si accipiamus virtutem hominis secundum aliquam aliam considerationem non naturalem homini, oportebit ad huiusmodi virtutem amorem illius boni, ad quod talis virtus ordinatur, esse aliquid superadditum circa naturalem voluntatem. Non enim artifex bene operatur nisi superveniat ei amor boni quod per operationem artis intenditur; unde philosophus dicit in VIII Polit., quod ad hoc quod aliquis sit bonus politicus, requiritur quod amet bonum civitatis. Si autem homo, in quantum admittitur ad participandum bonum alicuius civitatis, et efficitur civis illius civitatis; competunt ei virtutes quaedam ad operandum ea quae sunt civium, et ad amandum bonum civitatis; ita cum homo per divinam gratiam admittatur in participationem caelestis beatitudinis, quae in visione et fruitione Dei consistit, fit quasi civis et socius illius beatae societatis, quae vocatur caelestis Ierusalem secundum illud, Ephes. II, 19: estis cives sanctorum et domestici Dei. Unde homini sic ad caelestia adscripto competunt quaedam virtutes gratuitae, quae sunt virtutes infusae; ad quarum debitam operationem praeexigitur amor boni communis toti societati, quod est bonum divinum, prout est beatitudinis obiectum.
          <td>But that virtue which belongs to man as man operates for a good that is connatural to man. Therefore the love of this good, which is the good of reason, is by nature in his will. But if we accept the virtue of man according to some other consideration that is not natural to man, it will be necessary for virtue of this kind that love of that good to which such a virtue is ordered be something superadded to the nature of the will. For the artist does not operate well unless the love of the good which is intended through the operation of his art be added to him. Whence the Philosopher says in Book VIII of the <i>Politics</i> , for one to be considered politically good, he must love the good of the state. But when man becomes a citizen of a state and is admitted to participating in the good of some state, certain virtues are suitable, necessary even, for doing those things which are a citizen's duty and for loving the good of the state. Therefore man, through grace, becomes as it were a citizen and a sharer in this blessed society which is called the heavenly Jerusalem (Ephes. ii. 19), You are fellow-citizens with the saints, and the domestics of God. And in this way, man is admitted to participating in celestial beatitude which consists in the vision and enjoyment of God. Therefore certain gratuitous virtues, which are infused, are necessary for man when he is enrolled in the heavenly state; for the proper operation of these virtues there is required the love of the common good for the whole society, which is the divine good considered as the object of beatitude.

          <td>Amare autem bonum alicuius civitatis contingit dupliciter: uno modo ut habeatur; alio modo ut conservetur. Amare autem bonum alicuius civitatis ut habeatur et possideatur, non facit bonum politicum; quia sic etiam aliquis tyrannus amat bonum alicuius civitatis ut ei dominetur: quod est amare seipsum magis quam civitatem; sibi enim ipsi hoc bonum concupiscit, non civitati. Sed amare bonum civitatis ut conservetur et defendatur, hoc est vere amare civitatem; quod bonum politicum facit: in tantum quod aliqui propter bonum civitatis conservandum vel ampliandum, se periculis mortis exponant et negligant privatum bonum. Sic igitur amare bonum quod a beatis participatur ut habeatur vel possideatur, non facit hominem bene se habentem ad beatitudinem, quia etiam mali illud bonum concupiscunt; sed amare illud bonum secundum se, ut permaneat et diffundatur, et ut nihil contra illud bonum agatur, hoc facit hominem bene se habentem ad illam societatem beatorum. Et haec est caritas, quae Deum per se diligit, et proximos qui sunt capaces beatitudinis, sicut seipsos; et quae repugnat omnibus impedimentis et in se et in aliis; unde nunquam potest esse cum peccato mortali, quod est beatitudinis impedimentum. Sic igitur patet quod caritas non solum est virtus, sed potissima virtutum.
          <td>But to love the good of any society involves a twofold consideration: first, the manner in which it is obtained; secondly, the manner in which it is preserved. But to love the good of any society so that it might be had or possessed, does not constitute the political good. Thus does a tyrant love the good of the state in order to dominate it, which is to love himself more than the state; for he desires this good for himself, not for the state. But to love the good of the state so that it might be preserved and defended, this is indeed to love the state, and this constitutes the political good. So much is this so, that men would expose themselves to dangers of death or neglect their own private good, in order to preserve or increase the good of the state. Therefore, to love the good in which the blessed participate so that it might be had or possessed does not make man well-disposed toward beatitude, because the wicked also desire this good. But to love that good for its own sake in order that it might remain and be made wide-spread, and that nothing might act against that good, this does dispose man well toward that society of the blessed. This is charity, which loves God for His own sake, and loves fellow-men who are capable of attaining beatitude as it loves itself; charity resists every hindrance both in itself and in others; charity can never exist with mortal sin, that obstacle to beatitude. Therefore it is clear that charity is not only a virtue, but even the most powerful of the virtues.

          <td>To the fourth, it must be answered that the tendency which is present to us from nature is imperfect and weak as regards its freely obtaining things spiritual and gratuitous.

          <td>To the sixth, it must be said that, concerning the nature of charity or love, it is that which unites in affection. For example, this union is considered in this respect: that a man consider his friend as another self, and wishes good for him as he does for himself. But to unite in reality, this is not the nature of charity. Therefore there can be a love both of what is possessed and what is not possessed.

For one who has virtue and loves the good of reason, it follows from the inclination of virtue that he loves what is like himself, i.e., virtuous men in whom the good of reason is strong. But the friendship which is for God, Who is blessed and the author of beatitude, ought to be included among the virtues which order men to beatitude.

Whence, however the human will tries to love God, it is unable to reach Him so that it might love Him as much as He ought to be loved.

But this can happen with the moral virtues which are means between extremes. The measure of charity is this, that it has no such measure.

In omnibus autem actibus voluntariis id quod est ex parte finis, est formale: quod ideo est, quia unusquisque actus formam et speciem recipit secundum formam agentis, ut calefactio secundum calorem. Forma autem voluntatis est obiectum ipsius, quod est bonum et finis, sicut intelligibile est forma intellectus; unde oportet quod id quod est ex parte finis, sit formale in actu voluntatis. Unde idem specie actus, secundum quod ordinatur ad unum finem, cadit sub forma virtutis; et secundum quod ordinatur ad alium finem, cadit sub forma vitii; ut patet de eo qui dat eleemosynam vel propter Deum, vel propter inanem gloriam. Actus enim unius vitii, secundum quod ordinatur ad finem alterius vitii, recipit formam eius; utpote qui furatur ut fornicetur, materialiter quidem fur est, formaliter vero intemperatus. Manifestum est autem quod actus omnium aliarum virtutum ordinatur ad finem proprium caritatis, quod est eius obiectum, scilicet summum bonum. Et de virtutibus quidem moralibus manifestum est: nam huiusmodi virtutes sunt circa quaedam bona creata quae ordinantur ad bonum increatum sicut ad ultimum finem. Sed de virtutibus aliis theologicis idem manifestum est: nam ens increatum est quidem obiectum fidei, ut verum; et in quantum est appetibile, habet rationem boni. Et sic tendit fides in ipsum, in quantum est appetibile, cum nullus credat nisi volens. Spei autem obiectum licet sit ens increatum, in quantum est bonum, tamen dependet ab obiecto caritatis: est enim bonum, obiectum spei, in quantum est desiderabile et consequibile: nullus enim desiderat consequi aliquod bonum nisi per hoc quod amat ipsum.
          <td><b>I answer.</b> Charity is the form, moving power and root of the virtues. This can be shown by the fact that we must judge habits by their acts. So when what belongs to one habit is formal in the act of another habit, that habit must be related to the other as its form. But in all voluntary acts the end is what gives the form. That is because every act takes its form and species according to the form of the agents, such as heating from heat. But the form of thewill is its object, which is the good and the end, just as the intelligible is the form of the intellect. So that which has relation to the end must be formally in the act of the will. Thus in species, the same act is considered under the form of a virtue if it is ordered to one end, or under the form of a vice if it is ordered to another end. This is clear from the example of one who gives alms either for the sake of God or for the sake of vainglory. For, the act of one vice, according as it is ordered to the end of another vice, receives the form of the second vice; e.g., he who would steal in order to commit adultery is a thief materially, but formally he is considered intemperate. It is clear that the act of all the other virtues is ordered to the proper end of charity, which is its object, viz., the highest good. This is certainly clear regarding the moral virtues, for virtues of this kind are concerned with certain created goods which are ordered to the uncreated good as to their final end. And the same is clearly evident regarding the theological virtues; for uncreated being as true is indeed the object of faith; and insofar as it is desirable, it has the aspect of the good. Thus faith is directed toward that good insofar as it is desirable, since no one believes unless he wishes to believe. Even though the object of this species (i.e., the theological virtues) is uncreated being considered as good, nevertheless the object is still derived from the object of charity; for, the good is the object of hope insofar as it can be desired and obtained, since no one desires to obtain some good unless he loves it.

          <td>Unde manifestum est quod in actibus omnium virtutum est formale id quod est ex parte caritatis; et pro tanto dicitur forma omnium virtutum, in quantum scilicet omnes actus omnium virtutum ordinantur in summum bonum amatum, ut ostensum est. Et quia praecepta legis sunt de actibus virtutum; inde est quod apostolus dicit, I Timoth. cap. I, 5, quod finis praecepti est caritas. Et hinc etiam apparet, quomodo caritas sit motor omnium virtutum; in quantum scilicet importat actus omnium aliarum virtutum. Omnis enim virtus vel potentia superior dicitur movere per imperium inferiorem, ex eo quod actus inferioris ordinatur ad finem superioris; sicut aedificativa imperat caementariae, eo quod actus caementariae artis ordinatur ad formam domus, quae est finis aedificativae. Unde cum omnes aliae virtutes ordinentur ad finem caritatis, ipsa imperat actus omnium virtutum, et ex hoc dicitur motor earum.

          <td>Therefore it is evident that in the acts of all the virtues there is the formal element which comes from charity; and it is called the form of all the virtues in that every act of all the virtues is ordered to the highest good that is loved, as has just been shown. And because the precepts of the law are concerned with the acts of the virtues, so it is that the Apostle writes (1 Tim. i. 5), The end of the commandment is charity. Thus it is apparent how charity can be the mover of all the virtues; it is the mover because it influences the acts of all the other virtues. For, every higher act or power is said to move a lower act or power, so that the act of the lower is ordered to the end of the higher. For example, a house-builder commands a stone-mason so that the act of the stone-mason is ordered to the form of the house, which is the end of the builder. Since all the other virtues are ordered to the end of charity, charity commands the acts of all the virtues; and for this reason it is called their mover. And because the word "mother" signifies someone who receives and conceives within herself, charity is called the mother of the virtues. For this same reason, charity is called the root of the virtues.

But when the things are above the one who understands, then the will rises higher than the intellect is able to attain. Thus it is that in moral matters, which concern things below man, the cognitive virtue informs the appetitive virtues, just as prudence informs the other moral virtues.

          <td>Ad decimumseptimum dicendum, quod ipsa visio, in quantum est finis ut bonum quoddam, est obiectum caritatis.
          <td>To the seventeenth, it must be said that the vision of God, inasmuch as it is the end considered as a certain good, is the object of charity.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad decimumoctavum dicendum, quod forma intrinseca non potest esse finis rei, licet sit finis generationis rei. Caritas autem non est forma intrinseca, ut dictum est, sed ex hoc ipso quod trahit alias virtutes ad suum finem, format virtutes, ut ex dictis patet.
          <td>To the eighteenth, it must be said that the intrinsic form cannot be the end of a thing, although it is the end of the generation of a thing. But charity is not the intrinsic form, as has been said; but from the fact that it brings the other virtues to their end, it forms the virtues, as is clear from what has been said.

        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et videtur quod non.
          <td>It seems that charity is not one virtue.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Habitus enim distinguuntur per actus, et actus per obiecta. Sed caritas habet duo obiecta: Deum et proximum. Ergo non est una virtus, sed duae.
          <td>1. Habits are distinguished by their acts; acts by their objects. But charity has two objects; God and neighbor. Therefore charity is not one virtue but two.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed dicebatur, quod unum illorum obiectorum est principalius, scilicet Deus; non enim diligit caritas proximum nisi propter Deum.- Sed contra, philosophus dicit in IX Ethicor., quod amicabilia quae sunt ad alterum, venerunt ex amicabilibus quae sunt ad seipsum. Sed id quod est principium et causa, est potissimum in unoquoque genere. Ergo homo ex caritate diligit seipsum tamquam principale obiectum, et non Deum.
          <td>2. It has been objected that one of these objects is more primary, viz., God, for charity loves fellow-man only on account of God. On the contrary, the Philosopher says in Book IX of the <i>Ethics</i> , that friendly relations with another come from a man's relations to himself. But that which is a principle and cause is the most powerful in any genus. Therefore through charity man loves himself principally and God secondarily.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, I Ioan., IV, 20, dicitur: qui fratrem suum, quem videt, non diligit; Deum, quem non videt, quomodo potest diligere? Magis ergo videtur quod debeat diligere proximum quam Deum. Proximus ergo est magis diligibilis quam Deus; et ita videtur esse principalius obiectum caritatis.
          <td>3. Moreover, it is written (1 John iv. 20 ), He that loveth not his brother, whom he seeth, how can he love 'God, whom he seeth not? Therefore we ought to love our neighbor more than God. Since our neighbor is to be loved more than God, he is the more primary object of charity.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, nihil amatur nisi cognitum, ut Augustinus dicit in Lib. de Trin. Sed proximus magis cognoscitur quam Deus. Ergo etiam magis diligitur; et sic videtur quod caritas non sit una virtus.
          <td>4. Moreover, nothing is loved unless it is known, as Augustine says in the <i>De Trinitate</i> . But our neighbor is better known than God; therefore he is also loved more than God. Thus it seems that charity is not one virtue.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, omnis virtus habet proprium modum quem in suis actibus ponit: iustus enim est qui non solum iusta, sed iuste operatur. Sed caritas ponit duos modos in suis actibus; nam caritate diligit Deum aliquis ex toto corde, proximum autem sicut seipsum. Ergo caritas non est una virtus.
          <td>5. Moreover, every virtue has its own proper mode which it employs in regard to its acts; for a just man not only does just deeds, but also acts justly. Charity uses two modes in its acts; for in charity one loves God with his whole heart, and he loves his neighbor as himself. Therefore charity is not one virtue.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, praecepta legis ordinantur ad virtutes, quia intentio legislatoris est facere homines virtuosos, ut dicitur in II Ethicor. Sed de caritate dantur duo praecepta, scilicet: diliges dominum Deum tuum, et diliges proximum tuum. Ergo caritas non est una virtus.
          <td>6. Moreover, precepts of the law are ordered to the virtues, for the intention of the law-giver is to make men virtuous, as is seen in Book II of the <i>Ethics</i> . But two precepts are given for charity: Love the Lord thy God, and love your neighbor. Therefore charity is not one virtue.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, sicut diligimus Deum et proximum, ita et honorare debemus. Sed alio honore honoramus Deum et proximum nam Deum honoramus latria, proximum dulia sola. Ergo alia est caritas qua diligimus Deum, et alia qua diligimus proximum.
          <td>7. Moreover, as we love God and our neighbor, so ought we to honor them. But we honor God and neighbor with different forms of honor; we honor God with adoration ( <i>latria</i> ), and our neighbor only with veneration ( <i>dulia</i> ). Therefore there is one kind of charity by which we love God and another by which we love our fellow-men.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, virtus est qua recte vivitur. Sed ad aliam vitam pertinet diligere Deum, et ad aliam diligere proximum; nam diligere Deum videtur ad contemplativam vitam pertinere, diligere proximum ad activam. Ergo caritas Dei et proximi non est una virtus.
          <td>8. Moreover, virtue is that by which we love rightly. But to love God pertains to one life, to love neighbor pertains to another life; for to love God seems to belong to the contemplative life, while loving one's neighbor belongs to the active life. Therefore love of God and of our neighbor is not a single virtue.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, secundum philosophum in I Physic., unum dicitur tripliciter: continuitate, indivisibilitate et ratione. Sed caritas non est una continuitate, quia neque est corpus, neque forma corporis; neque est una indivisibilitate quia sic neque finita neque infinita esset; nec ratione, quia sic synonyma sunt unum, ut vestis et indumentum. Ergo caritas non est una.
          <td>9. Moreover, according to the Philosopher in Book I of the <i>Physics</i> , one is considered in three ways: as the continuous, as the indivisible, and as having the same essence. But charity does not have the unity of continuity because it is neither a body nor the form of a body. Nor has it the unity of indivisibility because then it would be neither finite nor infinite. Nor is it one in definition because synonymous things are one in this way, as raiment and dress. Therefore charity is not one.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, minime habent de ratione unius quae sunt unum proportione tantum: unde quae non sunt proportione unum, neque sunt unum specie neque genere neque numero, ut dicitur in V Metaph. Sed caritas est circa aeternum, scilicet Deum et proximum; quae sunt improportionalia. Ergo caritas nullo modo est una virtus.
          <td>10. Moreover, what is one by analogy is neither one in species nor in genus nor in number, as is said in Book V of the <i>Metaphysics</i> ; even less are those things which are one only by analogy considered in the definition of the one. But charity is directed toward the eternal, viz., God and neighbor, who are not in the same relationship. Therefore in no way is charity considered one virtue.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, secundum philosophum in VIII Ethic., amicitia perfecta non habetur ad multos. Sed caritas qua diligitur Deus et proximus, est perfectissima amicitia. Ergo non habetur ad multos; et ita non eadem caritate diligitur Deus et proximus.
          <td>11. Moreover, according to the Philosopher in Book VIII of the <i>Ethics</i> , perfect friendship cannot be had for many. But charity, by which God and neighbor are loved, is the most perfect friendship. Therefore it is not directed to many. Thus God and neighbor are not loved with the same charity.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, virtus in cuius actu sufficit non tristari, est alia a virtute quae delectabiliter operatur, sicut fortitudo a iustitia. Sed in actu caritatis quantum ad aliqua obiecta sufficit non tristari, sicut cum diligimus inimicos: in aliquibus etiam oportet delectari, sicut cum diligimus Deum et amicos. Ergo caritas non est una virtus, sed alia et alia.
          <td>12. Moreover, a virtue, by the performance of which it is sufficient that we be not saddened, is different from a vitrue which is performed with pleasure; as fortitude is different from justice. But in the act of charity, it is sufficient that we act without sadness in regard to some objects, as when we love our enemies; but it is necessary that we act with enjoyment in regard to others, as when we love God and our friends. Therefore charity is not one virtue, but different for each object.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed contra.
          <td><b>On the contrary,</b>
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quaecumque ita se habent quod unum intelligitur in alio, illa sunt unum. Sed in dilectione proximi intelligitur dilectio Dei, et e converso, ut dicit Augustinus, VII de Trinit. Ergo est eadem caritas qua diligimus Deum et proximum.
          <td>(1) those things are one when they are so regarded that one thing is understood in another. But in loving our neighbor is understood the love of God, and vice versa, as Augusti ne says in Book VII of the <i>De Trinitate</i> . Therefore it is the same charity by which we love God and our neighbor.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, in quolibet genere est unum primum movens. Sed caritas est motor omnium virtutum. Ergo est una.
          <td>(2) Moreover, in any genus, there is one first mover. But charity is the mover of all the virtues. Therefore it is one.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Respondeo. Dicendum, quod caritas est una virtus. Ad cuius evidentiam sciendum est, quod unitas cuiuslibet potentiae vel habitus ex obiecto consideranda est; et hoc ideo, quia potentia hoc ipsum quod est, dicitur in ordine ad possibile, quod est obiectum. Et sic ratio et species potentiae ex obiecto accipitur; et similiter est de habitu, qui nihil est aliud quam dispositio potentiae perfectae ad suum obiectum. Sed in obiecto consideratur aliquid ut formale et aliquid ut materiale.
          <td>I answer. It must be said that charity is one virtue. To understand this, it must be said that any unity of power or of habit should be considered from the object, and this is because the potency is that which is said to have an order to the possible, which is the object. And thus the formal notion and the species of potency is taken from the object. It is the same for a habit, which is nothing more than a disposition of a perfected potency toward its object.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Formale autem in obiecto est id secundum quod obiectum refertur ad potentiam vel habitum; materiale autem id in quo hoc fundatur: ut si loquamur de obiecto potentiae visivae, obiectum eius formale est color, vel aliquid huiusmodi, in quantum enim aliquid coloratum est, in tantum visibile est; sed materiale in obiecto est corpus cui accidit color.
          <td>In the object, however, something is considered as form, and something else as matter. The form in an object is that according to which the object is related to a potency or to a habit; but the matter is that in which the formal notion has its foundation. Thus, if we speak of the object of the power of sight, its formal object is color, or something of this kind, for according as a thing is colored, thus is it visible. Materially, however, it is the body in which the color exists.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ex quo patet quod potentia vel habitus refertur ad formalem rationem obiecti per se; ad id autem quod est materiale in obiecto, per accidens. Et ea quae sunt per accidens non variant rem, sed solum ea quae sunt per se: ideo materialis diversitas obiecti non diversificat potentiam vel habitum, sed solum formalis. Una est enim potentia visiva, qua videmus et lapides et homines et caelum, quia ista diversitas obiectorum est materialis, et non secundum formalem rationem visibilis. Sed gustus differt ab olfactu secundum differentiam saporis et odoris, quae sunt per se sensibilia.
          <td>From this it is clear that a power or habit is related essentially to the formal notion of the object and only accidentally to the matter of the object. Whatever is accidental does not cause a change in the thing, but only that which is essential; therefore a material diversity in the object does not cause a diversity of power or habit because only a formal diversity causes this. There is one power of sight by which we see stones and men and the sky, because this diversity of objects is material and does not come from the formal notion of the visible. The sense of taste, however, differs from the sense of smell insofar as there is a difference between flavor and odor, which are sensibles in themselves.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et hoc etiam oportet in caritate considerare. Manifestum est enim quod aliquem possumus diligere dupliciter: uno modo ratione sui ipsius, alio modo ratione alterius. Ratione autem sui ipsius aliquem diligimus, quando cum ratione boni proprii diligimus, utpote quia est in se honestus, vel nobis delectabilis, aut utilis. Ratione autem alterius diligimus aliquem quando diligimus ipsum quia attinet alii quem diligimus. Ex hoc enim ipso quod diligimus aliquem secundum se, diligimus omnes et familiares et consanguineos et amicos ipsius, in quantum ei attinent; sed tamen in omnibus illis est una ratio formalis dilectionis, scilicet bonum illius, quem ratione sui diligimus, et ipsum quodammodo in omnibus aliis diligimus.
          <td>Now this consideration is necessary in regard to charity. It is evident that we can love something in a twofold way; in the first, by reason of its very self, and in the second by reason of another. We love someone for himself when we love him because of his proper good, viz., because he is essentially noble or because he is pleasing or useful to us. But we love someone for the sake of another when we love him because he is related to someone else whom we love. If we love someone on his own account, we love his entire family, his relatives, his friends, inasmuch as they are related to him; but in all of these, there is only one formal notion of love, viz., the good of the one whom we love for his own sake. And, in a certain way, we love him in all these others.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sic igitur dicendum, quod caritas diligit Deum ratione sui ipsius; et ratione eius diligit omnes alios in quantum ordinantur ad Deum: unde quodammodo Deum diligit in omnibus proximis; sic enim proximus caritate diligitur, quia in eo est Deus, vel ut in eo sit Deus. Unde manifestum est quod est idem habitus caritatis quo Deum et proximum diligimus.
          <td>Therefore it must be said that charity loves God for His own sake; and because of Him, it loves all others according as they are ordered to God. Thus, in a way, charity loves God in all fellow-men, for our neighbor is loved by charity because God is in him or God might be in him. It is evident that it is the same habit of charity by which we love God and our neighbor.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed si diligeremus proximum ratione sui ipsius, et non ratione Dei, hoc ad aliam dilectionem pertineret: puta ad dilectionem naturalem, vel politicam, vel ad aliquam aliarum quas philosophus tangit in VIII Ethic.
          <td>But if we love our neighbor for his own sake and not for the sake of God, this pertains to some other love, e.g., to a natural love, or a political love, or some other kind which the Philosopher discusses in Book VIII of the <i>Ethics</i> .
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad primum ergo dicendum, quod proximus non diligitur nisi ratione Dei; unde ambo sunt unum obiectum dilectionis, formaliter loquendo, licet materialiter sint duo.
          <td>To the first, it must be said that our neighbor is not loved except for the sake of God; whence formally considered, both are one object of love, although materially they are two.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad secundum dicendum, quod cum amor respiciat bonum, secundum diversitatem boni est diversitas amoris. Est autem quoddam bonum proprium alicuius hominis in quantum est singularis persona; et quantum ad dilectionem respicientem hoc bonum, unusquisque est sibi principale obiectum dilectionis. Est autem quoddam bonum commune quod pertinet ad hunc vel ad illum in quantum est pars alicuius totius, sicut ad militem, in quantum est pars exercitus, et ad civem, in quantum est civitatis; et quantum ad dilectionem respicientem hoc bonum, principale obiectum dilectionis est illud in quo principaliter illum bonum consistit, sicut bonum exercitus in duce, et bonum civitatis in rege; unde ad officium boni militis pertinet ut etiam salutem suam negligat ad conservandum bonum ducis; sicut etiam homo naturaliter ad conservandum caput, brachium exponit. Et hoc modo caritas respicit sicut principale obiectum, bonum divinum, quod pertinet ad unumquemque, secundum quod esse potest particeps beatitudinis; unde ea sola ex caritate diligimus quae nobiscum beatitudinem participare possunt, ut Augustinus dicit in Lib. de doctrina Christiana.
          <td>To the second, it must be said that since love looks to the good, there is a diversity of love according as there is a diversity of the good. There is, however, a certain good proper to each man considered as one person, and as far as loving this good is concerned, each one is the principal object of his own love. But there is a certain common good which pertains to this man or that man insofar as he is considered as part of a whole; thus there is a certain common good pertaining to a soldier considered as part of the army, or to a citizen as part of the state. As far as loving this common good is concerned, the principal object of love is that in which the good primarily exists; just as the good of the army is in the general, or the good of the state is in the king. Whence, it is the duty of a good soldier that he neglect even his own safety in order to save the good of his general. Thus also does a man naturally endanger his arm in order to save his head. And in this way charity regards the divine good as its principal object, which pertains to every one according as he is able to be a sharer in beatitude; thus we love out of charity only those objects which are able to participate in eternal happiness with us, as Augustine says in the <i>De Doctrina Christiana</i> .
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad tertium dicendum, quod Ioannes argumentatur a maiori, negando, non quod proximus magis debeat diligi; sed quia magis est in promptu ut diligatur, quia homines proniores sunt ad diligendum visibilia quam invisibilia.
          <td>To the third, it must be said that St. John, denying the major premise, argues not that one's fellow-men ought to be loved more, but that they are more accessible to one's love, because men are more inclined to love what can be seen rather than the unseen.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad quartum dicendum, quod licet cognitum diligatur, tamen non sequitur quod magis cognitum magis diligatur. Non enim ea ratione aliquid diligitur quia cognoscitur, sed quia est bonum; unde quod est magis bonum, magis est diligibile, licet non sit magis cognitum; sicut homo minus diligit aliquem servum, vel etiam equum, quem in continuo usu habet, quam aliquem bonum hominem quem tantum fama cognoscit.
          <td>To the fourth, it must be said that although what is known is loved, it does not follow that what is more known is also more loved. For, a thing is not loved because it is known, but because it is good; thus that which is better is more lovable, even though it is not better known. For example, a man loves his servant or even his horse which he has had in constant use less than he loves some good man whom he knows only by reputation.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad quintum dicendum, quod caritas respicit ut formale obiectum, bonum divinum, sicut dictum est, art. praec. et in corp. huius art., quod quidem bonum diversimode se habet ad ipsum Deum et ad proximum, et ideo oportet quod habeat diversum modum circa principale obiectum et secundarium; unde circa principale obiectum habet unum modum tantum.
          <td>To the fifth, it must be said that charity regards the divine good as its formal object, as has been said in the previous Article and in the body of this Article. This good is related differently to God and to one's neighbor, therefore it is necessary that charity have a different mode as regards its primary and secondary objects. However, it has only one mode of operation in relation to its primary object.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad sextum dicendum, quod praecepta legis sunt de actibus virtutum, et non de habitibus; unde ex diversitate praeceptorum non potest concludi diversitas habituum, sed diversitas actuum; qui tamen pertinent ad unum habitum, propter rationem formalem.
          <td>To the sixth, it must be said that the precepts of the law concern the acts of the virtues and not the habits. Therefore, from a diversity of precepts it does not follow that there is a diversity of habits, but only a diversity of acts. These acts pertain to one habit because of the formal notion.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad septimum dicendum, quod in proximo honoratur etiam bonum proprium ipsius; et ideo alius honor debetur proximo, et alius Deo.
          <td>To the seventh, it must be said that in honoring our neighbor we also honor his proper good; and thus one kind of honor is due to him, another kind to God.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad octavum dicendum, quod tam dilectio proximi quam dilectio Dei continetur sub contemplativa vita, ut Gregorius dicit super Ezechiel. Nam oratio, quae maxime ad contemplativam vitam pertinere videtur, ad Deum pro proximis fit. Sed tamen principium vitae activae praecipue est amor Dei in seipso. Nec tamen sequitur, si caritas est principium diversorum, quod caritas non sit una.
          <td>To the eighth, it must be said that the love of neighbor as well as the love of God is included within the contemplative life, as Gregory writes in <i>Super Ezechiel</i> . For prayer to God, which seems especially to pertain to the contemplative life, becomes prayer for fellow-man. So, too, the principle of the active life is, in a special way, the love of God in Himself. It does not follow, then, that if charity is the principle of different actions, it is not one.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad nonum dicendum, quod caritas non est una continuitate; sed potest dici una indivisibilitate, in quantum est una forma simplex. Non enim dicitur finita vel infinita secundum quantitatem dimensivam, sed secundum quantitatem virtutis. Sed sic non agimus hic de virtute caritatis, sed secundum quod est una ratione: non quidem una numero, ut tunica et vestis; sed ratione speciei, sicut Socrates et Plato sunt unum in ratione hominis.
          <td>To the ninth, it must be said that charity is not one by the unity of continuity, but it can be considered one by the unity of indivisibility inasmuch as it is one simple form. It is not called finite or infinite considered as a quantity with dimensions, but considered as the quantity of virtue. Here we are not treating of charity in this manner, but only insofar as it is considered one in essence; not indeed a numerical unity as is tunic and dress, but a unity of species, as Socrates and Plato are one in their human nature.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad decimum dicendum, quod ratio illa procederet, si temporale ratione sui esset obiectum caritatis, et non ratione aeterni, ut dictum est.
          <td>To the tenth, it must be answered that this argument would hold if the object of charity be considered in its temporal aspect, not in its eternal aspect, as has been said.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad undecimum dicendum, quod amicitia perfecta non habetur ad multos, ita quod ad unumquemque sit ratione sui ipsius; sed quanto amicitia est perfectior ad unum ratione eius, tanto ad plures se posset extendere ratione ipsius. Et sic caritas, quia perfectissima amicitia est, ad Deum se extendit, et ad omnes qui possunt percipere Deum; et non solum ad notos, sed etiam ad inimicos.
          <td>To the eleventh, it must be said that perfect friendship is not directed towards many, so that to each one it would be something proper to himself. But inasmuch as friendship towards one becomes more perfect as regards that one, the more perfect the love we have toward one, the better able are we to love others. Thus charity, because it is the most perfect friendship, extends itself to God and to all who are able to know God; it includes not only those whom we know, but also our enemies.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad duodecimum dicendum, quod virtus quae delectabiliter operatur circa principale obiectum, potest eadem circa aliquod accessorium non delectabiliter, sed sine tristitia, operari; et hoc modo caritas delectabiliter operatur in principali obiecto, licet difficultatem patiatur in aliquo secundario obiecto, ita ut sufficiat sine tristitia operari.
          <td>To the twelfth, it must be said that virtue, which acts for its principal object with enjoyment, is able in the same way to act for some secondary object; not with pleasure, but without sadness. And in this way charity acts with pleasure towards its principal object, although with regard to a secondary object it endures difficulty in such a way that it is able to act without sadness.

            Whether Charity Is a Special Virtue Distinct From the Other Virtues?</b></a>

          <td>Et videtur quod non.
          <td>It seems that charity is not a special virtue.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Illud enim quod ponitur in definitione cuiuslibet virtutis, non est virtus specialis: quia virtus generalis ponitur in definitione cuiuslibet specialis virtutis. Sed caritas ponitur in definitione cuiuslibet virtutis: dicit enim Hieronymus: ut breviter communem definitionem virtutis complectar; virtus est caritas, qua diligimus Deum et proximum. Ergo caritas non est virtus specialis, ab aliis distincta.
          <td>1. That which is put in the definition of any virtue is not a special virtue, because a general virtue is included in the definition of each special virtue. But charity is included in the definition of each virtue, for Jerome says, Let me briefly define all virtue as the charity by which we love God and our neighbor. Therefore charity is not a special virtue distinct from the others.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, caritas qua diligimus proximum, non est virtus distincta a caritate qua diligimus Deum, quia caritas diligit proximum propter Deum. Sed omnis virtus diligit proximum propter Deum. Ergo nulla virtus distinguitur a caritate.
          <td>2. Moreover, charity by which we love our neighbor is not a virtue distinct from charity by which we love God; because charity loves fellow-man because of God. But every virtue loves fellow-man because of God. Therefore no virtue is distinguished from charity.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, distinctiones habituum attenduntur secundum actus virtutum. Sed caritas operatur actus omnium aliarum virtutum: caritas est patiens, est benigna, ut dicitur I ad Corinth., XIII, 4. Ergo caritas non est virtus ab aliis distincta.
          <td>3. Moreover, the distinctions of habits are marked by the acts of the virtues. But charity carries into effect the acts of all the other virtues, as is said (1 Cor. xiii. 4), Charity is patient, is kind. Therefore charity is not a virtue distinct from the others.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, bonum est obiectum generale omnium virtutum: nam virtus est quae bonum facit habentem, et opus eius bonum reddit. Sed bonum est obiectum caritatis. Ergo caritas habet obiectum generale; et ita est generalis virtus.
          <td>4. Moreover, the good is the general object of all the virtues, for virtue is that which makes its possessor good and renders his works good. But the good is the object of charity. Therefore charity has a general object, and thus it is a general virtue.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, una perfectio est unius perfectibilis. Sed caritas est perfectio multorum perfectibilium, id est omnium virtutum. Ergo non est una.
          <td>5. Moreover, a single perfection is of one perfectible. But charity is the perfection of many perfectibles, i.e., of all the virtues. Therefore charity is not one.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, idem habitus non potest esse in diversis subiectis. Sed caritas est in diversis subiectis: iubemur enim Deum diligere ex tota mente, ex tota anima, ex toto corde, ex tota fortitudine. Ergo caritas non est virtus una.
          <td>6. Moreover, the same habit cannot be in diverse subjects. But charity is in diverse subjects, for we are commanded to love God with our whole mind, with our whole soul, with our whole heart, and with our whole strength. Therefore charity is not one virtue.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, virtus ad tollenda peccata ordinatur. Sed caritas sufficit ad tollenda omnia peccata; quia minima caritas resistere potest cuilibet tentationi. Ergo caritas facit id quod est omnium virtutum; et ita non videtur esse virtus specialis.
          <td>7. Moreover, charity is directed toward the removing of sins. But charity is sufficient to take away all sins, because the least bit of charity can resist any temptation. Therefore charity does that which belongs to all the virtues, and so does not seem to be a special virtue.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, unicuique virtuti speciali opponitur aliquod peccatum speciale. Sed caritati contrariantur omnia peccata: quia per quodlibet peccatum mortale perditur caritas. Ergo caritas non est virtus specialis.
          <td>8. Moreover, some special sin is opposed to each special virtue. But all sins are contrary to charity, because charity is lost through each mortal sin. Therefore charity is not a special virtue.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, nulla virtus est necessaria nisi ad recte operandum. Sed sola caritas sufficienter nos dirigit ad recte operandum; dicit enim Augustinus: habe caritatem, et fac quidquid vis. Ergo praeter caritatem non est aliqua alia virtus; et ita non est virtus specialis distincta ab aliis.
          <td>9. Moreover, no virtue is necessary except in acting uprightly. But charity alone sufficiently directs us in right acting, for Augustine says, Have charity and do what you wirh. Therefore there is no other virtue outside of charity; and charity is not a special virtue distinct from the others.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, habitus virtutum necessarii sunt ad hoc quod homo prompte et delectabiliter operetur: nullus enim est iustus qui non gaudet iusta operatione, ut dicitur in I Ethic. Sed ad omnia prompte et delectabiliter operanda sufficit caritas: quia dicit Augustinus in Lib. de verbis domini: omnia gravia et immania, facilia et prope nulla facit amor. Ergo praeter caritatem non est necessaria aliqua alia virtus.
          <td>10. Moreover, the habits of the virtues are necessary in order that a man might act promptly and with enjoyment, for no one is just who does not rejoice in just works, as is said in Book I of the <i>Ethics</i> . But charity is sufficient for the prompt and enjoyable operation of all works, for Augustine writes in the <i>De Verbis Domini</i> , Love makes all hard and repulsive tasks easy and next to nothing. Therefore there is no need for any virtue outside of charity.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, ea quae sunt distincta ad invicem, habent distinctam generationem et corruptionem. Sed caritas et aliae virtutes non habent distinctam generationem et corruptionem; quia simul cum caritate et infunduntur et perduntur aliae virtutes. Ergo caritas non est specialis virtus.
          <td>11. Moreover, those things which are distinct from each other have a distinct generation and a distinct corruption. But charity and the other virtues do not have distinct generations and corruptions because all the other virtues are communicated along with charity and they are lost when charity is lost. Therefore charity is not a special virtue.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed contra, est quod apostolus, I ad Cor., cap. XIII, 13, condividit eam aliis virtutibus, dicens: nunc autem manent fides, spes, caritas, tria haec.
          <td>On the contrary, opposed to this is the fact that the Apostle (1 Cor. xiii. 13) divides charity from the other virtues saying, Now there remain faith, hope and charity, these three.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Respondeo. Dicendum, quod caritas est quaedam virtus specialis, distincta ab aliis virtutibus. Ad cuius evidentiam considerandum est, quod quandocumque aliquis actus dependet a pluribus principiis, secundum ordinem se habentibus, ad perfectionem illius actus requiritur quod quodlibet illorum principiorum sit perfectum. Si enim sit imperfectio in primo, sive in medio, vel in ultimo, sequitur actus imperfectus; sicut, si desit peritia artis artifici, sive recta dispositio in instrumento, opus sequitur imperfectum. Et hoc etiam in ipsis potentiis animae considerari potest. Si enim sit recta ratio, quae est motiva inferiorum potentiarum, et concupiscibilis sit indisposita, operabitur quidem aliquis secundum rationem, sed operatio erit imperfecta, quia habebit impedimentum ex concupiscibili indisposita ad contrarium trahente; sicut circa continentem apparet: et ideo praeter prudentiam, quae perficit rationem, necesse est, ad hoc quod homo recte se habeat circa concupiscibilia, quod habeat temperantiam, ad hoc quod prompte operetur et sine impedimento.
          <td><b>I answer.</b> It must be said that charity is a special virtue, distinct from the other virtues. To understand this, it must be considered that whenever any act depends upon several principles that are constituted according to a certain order, it is necessary for the perfection of this act that each of the principles be perfect. For, if there be an imperfection in the beginning, or in the middle, or in the end, an imperfect act follows; just as if knowledge of art is lacking in the artist, Or a right disposition be lacking in the instrument, an imperfect work will follow. And this can also be considered in the very powers of the soul. For, if right reason, which is the mover of the inferior powers, be correct, and the concupiscible attitude is disordered, one will indeed act according to reason, but the operation will be imperfect, for he will have hindrance from the ill-disposed concupiscence tending toward its contrary. This is clear in the example of the continent man. Therefore in addition to prudence, which perfects reason, it is necessary in order that man be rightly constituted with regard to the objects of the concupiscible appetite, that he possess temperance in order that he might act readily and without hindmance.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et sicut est in diversis potentiis, quarum una movet aliam; idem est etiam considerare secundum diversa obiecta quorum unum ordinatur ad alterum sicut ad finem: una enim et eadem potentia, secundum quod est finis, non solum aliam potentiam, sed etiam seipsam, movet in ea quae sunt ad finem. Et ideo ad rectam operationem, aliquem non solum oportet bene dispositum esse ad finem, sed etiam bene dispositum ad ea quae sunt ad finem: alias sequitur operatio impedita; ut patet in eo qui bene est dispositus ad bene appetendam sanitatem, sed male est dispositus ad sumendum ea quae sunt sanativa. Et sic manifestum est quod, cum per caritatem homo disponatur ut bene se habeat ad ultimum finem, necesse est ut habeat alias virtutes, quibus bene disponatur ad ea quae sunt ad finem.
          <td>Just as among diverse powers, one of which moves the other, so one may consider diverse objects, one of which is ordered to the other as to an end. For, one and the same power, insofar as it is an end, not only moves another power, but even moves itself regarding the means to the end. Therefore, for right operation it is necessary that something not only be well-disposed toward the end, but also that it be well-disposed toward the means to the end. Otherwise, an impeded operation follows, as is clear in the case of one who is well-disposed toward attaining good health, but is ill-disposed toward undertaking the means which bring about health. Thus it is clear that, since man is disposed through charity to be well-ordered toward his final end, it is necessary to have other virtues by which he will be well-disposed toward the means which pertain to the end.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Est ergo caritas alia ab his quae ordinantur ad ea quae sunt ad finem, licet illa quae ordinatur ad finem, sit principalior, et architectonica, respectu earum quae ordinantur in ea quae sunt ad finem; sicut medicinalis respectu pigmentariae, et militaris respectu equestris.
          <td>Charity, therefore, is different from the virtues which are ordered to the means to the end; even though that virtue which is ordered to the end is more primary and architectonic with respect to the other virtues, which are ordered to the means to the end. In this way, medical knowledge is related to the art of applying unguents, or the military art is related to horsemanship.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Unde manifestum fit quod necesse est caritatem esse quamdam virtutem specialem distinctam ab aliis virtutibus, sed principalem et motivam respectu earum.
          <td>It becomes clear, therefore, that it is necessary for charity to be a special virtue, distinct from the other virtues, but yet the most important virtue and the mover of the other virtues.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad primum ergo dicendum, quod illa definitio datur per causam, in quantum caritas est causa omnium aliarum virtutum.
          <td>To the first, it must be said that this is a causal definition inasmuch as charity is the cause of the other virtues.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad secundum dicendum est, quod caritas in diligendo proximum habet Deum ut rationem formalem obiecti, et non solum ut finem ultimum, ut ex supradictis, art. praec., patet: sed aliae virtutes habent Deum non ut rationem formalem obiecti, sed ut ultimum finem.
          <td>To the second, it must be answered that charity in loving fellow-man has God as the formal notion of the object, and not only as the final end, as it clear from the preceding Article. The other virtues have God, not as the formal notion of the object, but as their final end.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et ideo, cum dicitur quod caritas diligit proximum propter Deum, illud propter denotat non solum causam materialem, sed quodammodo formalem. Cum autem dicitur de aliis virtutibus quod operantur propter Deum, illud propter denotat causam finalem tantum.
          <td>Thus, when it is said that charity loves neighbor on account of God, the on account of denotes not only the material cause, but in a way the formal cause. But when it is said of the other virtues that they operate on account of God, the on account of denotes only the final cause.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad tertium dicendum, quod caritas non producit actus aliarum virtutum elicitive, sed imperative tantum. Elicit enim virtus illos actus tantum qui sunt secundum rationem propriae formae, sicut iustitia recte facere, et temperantia temperanter; sed imperare dicitur omnes actus quos ad finem suum advocat.
          <td>To the third, it must be said that charity does not produce the acts of the other virtues by eliciting them, but only by commanding them. For, the virtue draws out only those acts which are according to the notion of proper form, as justice acts rightly or temperance acts temperately. But virtue is said to command all the acts which it summons up to its end.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad quartum dicendum, quod bonum commune non est obiectum caritatis, sed summum bonum; et ideo non sequitur quod caritas sit generalis virtus sed quod sit summa virtutum.
          <td>To the fourth, it must be said that the good in general is not the object of charity, but the highest good. Therefore it does not follow that charity is a general virtue, but that it is the highest virtue.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad quintum dicendum, quod caritas non est perfectio intrinseca aliarum virtutum, sed extrinseca, ut supra, art. 3 huius quaest., dictum est; unde ratio non sequitur.
          <td>To the fifth, it must be said that charity is not the intrinsic perfection of the other virtues, but the extrinsic perfection, as was said in Article III of this Question. Therefore the objection does not follow.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad sextum dicendum, quod caritas est, sicut in subiecto, in una tantum potentia, scilicet in voluntate, quae per imperium movet alias potentias; et secundum hoc Deum iubemur ex tota mente et anima diligere, ut omnes vires animae nostrae advocentur in obsequium divini amoris.
          <td>To the sixth, it must be said that charity exists as in a subject in only one power, viz., the will which, through its command, moves the other powers. According to this, we are commanded to love God with our whole mind and our whole soul in order that all the powers of our soul might be summoned in submission to divine love.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad septimum dicendum, quod sicut caritas imperat aliarum virtutum actus, ita per modum imperii excludit peccata eis contraria; et secundum hunc modum caritas resistit tentationibus; sed tamen necesse est esse alias virtutes, quae directe et elicitive peccata excludant.
          <td>To the seventh, it must be said that, just as charity commands the acts of the other virtues, so through this manner of commanding does it exclude the sins which are contrary to these virtues; and in this way charity resists temptations. However, it is necessary that there be other virtues which directly and in an elicited way drive out sins.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad octavum dicendum est, quod sicut actus aliarum virtutum ordinantur ad finem quod est obiectum caritatis; ita et peccata quae sunt contra alias virtutes, habent oppositionem ad finem, qui est obiectum caritatis: et ex hoc contingit quod contraria aliarum virtutum, scilicet peccata, caritatem expellant.
          <td>To the eighth, it must be said that, just as the acts of the other virtues are ordered to the end which is the object of charity, so also do sins, which are contrary to those virtues, oppose the end which is the object of charity. From this it happens that the contraries of the other virtues, viz., sins, drive out charity.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad nonum dicendum, quod licet caritas sufficienter per modum imperii in omnibus nos dirigat quae ad rectam vitam pertinent; tamen requiruntur aliae virtutes quae eliciendo actus exequantur imperium caritatis, ad hoc quod homo prompte et sine impedimento operetur.
          <td>To the ninth, it must be said that, although charity adequately directs us through its manner of commanding in all things which pertain to a righteous life, nevertheless other virtues are required which, by eliciting their acts, carry out the command of charity so that man will act readily and without impediment.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad decimum dicendum, quod contingit aliquid esse propter finem quod tamen secundum se est difficile et triste; sicut cum aliquis accipit medicinam amaram libenter propter sanitatem, licet in ipsa sumptione multum affligatur. Caritas igitur facit omnia esse delectabilia ex fine; sed requiruntur aliae virtutes, quae faciant ea quae sunt virtuosa secundum se delectabilia, ad hoc quod facilius operemur.
          <td>To the tenth, it must be said that it sometimes happens that a thing which in itself is difficult and causes sadness may exist for the sake of an end; as one freely takes a bitter medicine for the sake of health, although he is much afflicted by its consumption. Charity, therefore, makes all things pleasing in respect to the end, but the other virtues are needed which make those things which are good in themselves more enjoyable, in order that we may more easily do them.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad undecimum dicendum, quod caritas simul habet generationem cum aliis virtutibus, non quia sit indistincta ab aliis, sed quia Dei perfecta sunt opera; unde infundens caritatem simul infundit omnia illa quae sunt necessaria ad salutem. Corrumpitur autem simul cum omnibus virtutibus: quia quaecumque contrariantur aliis virtutibus, contrariantur caritati, ut dictum est.
          <td>To the eleventh, it must be said that charity is generated at the same time as the other virtues, not because it is not distinct from the others, but because the works of God are perfect. Whence, when charity is communicated, all the virtues which are necessary for salvation are communicated at the same time. However, charity is corrupted at the same time as the virtues because whatever is opposed to the other virtues is opposed to charity, as has been said.

          <td>It seems that charity can exist with mortal sin.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicit enim Origenes in I periarchon: non arbitror quod aliquis ex his qui in summo perfectoque perstiterunt gradu, ad subitum evacuetur ac decidat; sed per partes et paulatim eum diffluere necesse est. Subito autem aliquis committit peccatum mortale per solum consensum. Ergo qui est in perfecto statu per caritatem, non decidit a caritate per unum actum peccati mortalis; et sic caritas potest esse cum peccato mortali.
          <td>1. Origen says in <b>1 Periarchon</b> , 2: I do not think that anyone who has continually stayed in the highest and perfect state would suddenly fall from that height, but he must needs fall away little by little. But one commits mortal sin suddenly, through his consent alone. Therefore he who is in a perfect state through charity cannot fall away from charity through one act of mortal sin. Thus charity can exist along with mortal sin.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, Bernardus dicit, quod caritas in Petro, quando Christum negavit, non fuit extincta, sed sopita. Sed Petrus negando Christum peccavit mortaliter. Ergo caritas potest remanere cum peccato mortali.
          <td>2. Moreover, Bernard says that the charity in Peter when he denied Christ was not wiped out, but only rendered inactive. But Peter, by denying Christ, sinned mortally. Therefore charity can remain with mortal sin.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, caritas est fortior quam habitus virtutis moralis. Sed habitus virtutis non tollitur per unum actum vitiosum, cum non per unum actum generetur: ex eisdem enim contrario modo factis generatur virtus et corrumpitur, ut dicitur in II Ethic. Ergo multo minus habitus caritatis tollitur per unum peccatum mortale.
          <td>3. Moreover, charity is stronger than the habit of a moral virtue. But the habit of virtue is not taken away through one act of vice, since it is not generated through one act; for virtue is generated and corrupted by doing the same things in a contrary manner, as is said in Book II of the <i>Ethics</i> . Therefore much less is the habit of charity taken away through a single mortal sin.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, unum uni opponitur. Sed caritas est una virtus specialis, ut ostensum est. Ergo sibi opponitur unum vitium speciale. Non ergo per alia peccata mortalia tollitur; et sic videtur quod possit peccatum mortale simul esse cum caritate.
          <td>4. Moreover, to each thing there is one thing in opposition. But charity is a special virtue, as has been shown. Therefore there is opposed to it one special vice. Thus charity is not taken away by other mortal sins, and so it seems that it is possible for mortal sin to exist along with charity.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, opposita non se expellunt nisi circa idem subiectum. Sed quaedam peccata non sunt in eodem subiecto cum caritate: nam caritas est in superiori parte rationis, quae convertitur ad Deum; potest autem peccatum mortale esse etiam in inferiori parte rationis, ut dicit Augustinus in Lib. de Trinit. Ergo non omne peccatum mortale excludit caritatem.
          <td>5. Moreover, things in opposition cannot be in the same subject, for one drives out the other. But some sins are not in the same subject with charity, for charity is in the higher reason which is turned to God; but mortal sin can exist in the lower reason, as Augustine says in the <i>De Trinitate</i> 7 Therefore not every mortal sin drives out charity.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, illud quod est fortissimum, non potest expelli a debilissimo. Sed caritas est fortissima: fortis enim est ut mors dilectio, ut dicitur Cantic., VII, 6: peccatum autem est debilissimum, quia malum est infirmum et impotens, ut Dionysius dicit. Ergo peccatum mortale non expellit caritatem; et sic potest esse simul cum ea.
          <td>6. Moreover, that which is the strongest is not able to be driven out by what is the weakest. But charity is the strongest, for it is said (Cantic. viii. 6), Love is strong as death. But sin is the weakest because evil is infirm and powerless, as Dionysius says. Therefore mortal sin does not drive out charity, and so it can exist along with it.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, habitus secundum actus cognoscuntur. Sed actus caritatis potest esse cum peccato mortali: homo enim peccans diligit Deum et proximum. Ergo caritas potest esse cum peccato mortali.
          <td>7. Moreover, habits are known through their acts. But the act of charity is able to exist with mortal sin, for a man sinning loves God and his neighbor. Therefore charity can exist with mortal sin.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, caritas praecipue facit delectari in contemplatione Dei. Sed delectationi quae est in considerando, nihil est contrarium, ut dicit philosophus in I Topic. Ergo caritati nihil est contrarium: et ita non potest expelli per peccatum mortale.
          <td>8. Moreover, charity especially causes one to take delight in the contemplation of God. But there is no contrary to that delight which comes from speculative knowledge, as the Philosopher says in Book I of the <i>Topics</i> . Therefore there is no contrary to charity, and so it is not able to be driven out by mortal sin.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, universale movens potest impediri in uno mobili, et non impediri in alio. Sed caritas est universalis motor omnium virtutum, ut supra, art. 3, dictum est. Ergo non oportet quod sic impediatur in una virtute in quantum alias movet: potest igitur cum peccato opposito temperantiae caritas remanere, prout est motiva aliarum virtutum.
          <td>9. Moreover, a universal mover can be hindered in regard to one object that is potentially movable, and not in regard to another. But charity is the universal mover of all the virtues, as was said above in Article III. Therefore it is not necessary that its operation towards one virtue be hindered insofar as it moves the others. Thus charity is able to exist with the sin which is opposed to temperance, according as it is the mover of the other virtues.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">

          <td>11. Moreover, everything which does not have the perfection it was meant to have by nature is without form. But charity does not have here in this life the perfection that it is destined to have in heaven. Therefore it is without form, and thus it seems that it can exist with mortal sin.

          <td>12. Moreover, habits are known through acts. But some acts of those who have charity can be imperfect; for oftentimes those who have charity are moved by another movement to impatience, or to vainglory. Therefore it may happen that the habit of charity is imperfect and without form, and thus it seems that mortal sin can exist with charity.

          <td>13. Moreover, just as sin is opposed to virtue, so is ignorance opposed to science. But not every ignorance takes away complete science. Therefore not every mortal sin takes away all virtue. Whence, since charity is the root of the virtues, it does not seem that every mortal sin takes away charity.

Ergo aliquis potest peccando contra Deum agere, manente caritate.
          <td>14. Moreover, charity is the love of God. But a person who keeps his love towards a thing can act against it through incontinence; just as one loving himself acts against his good through incontinence; and another loving his community acts against it through incontinence, as the Philosopher says in Book V of the <i>Politics</i> . Therefore one can act against God by sinning and still remain in charity.

Sed caritas facit hominem bene se habere circa universalem finem. Ergo manente caritate, potest aliquis peccare circa aliquod particulare; et sic caritas potest esse cum peccato mortali.
          <td>15. Moreover, one can be well-disposed toward the universal, and yet fail in the particular. For example, the incontinent man has right reason toward the universal, viz., that it is wrong to commit fornication; but yet in regard to the particular, he chooses here and now to commit fornication as a good, as is explained by the Philosopher in Book VI of the <i>Ethics</i> . But charity causes man to keep himself well-disposed toward the universal end. Therefore, remaining in charity, one can sin in regard to some particular act, and thus charity can exist with mortal sin.

          <td>16. Moreover, contraries are in the same genus. But sin is in the genus of act because sin is something said, done, or desired contrary to the law of God.

However, whoever sins mortally is worthy of eternal punishment, according to what is written (Rom. vi. 23) , The wages of sin is death. But no one can at the same time be worthy of eternal life and of eternal punishment. Therefore charity cannot be retained with mortal sin.

          <td>Respondeo. Dicendum, quod caritas nullo modo potest simul esse cum peccato mortali. Ad cuius evidentiam primo considerandum est, quod omne peccatum mortale directe opponitur caritati. Quicumque enim praeeligit aliquid alteri, illud quod praeeligit, magis amat; unde quia homo magis amat propriam vitam et sui consistentiam quam voluptatem, quantumcumque sit magna voluptas, homo retraheretur ab ea, si eam existimaret esse suae vitae infallibiliter peremptivam; propter quod dicit Augustinus in Lib. LXXXIII quaestionum, quod nemo est qui non magis dolorem metuat quam appetat voluptatem; quandoquidem videmus etiam immanissimas bestias a maximis voluptatibus abstinere dolorum metu. Ex hoc autem aliquis mortaliter peccat quod aliquid magis eligit quam vivere secundum Deum, et ei inhaerere. Unde manifestum est quod quicumque mortaliter peccat, ex hoc ipso magis amat aliud bonum quam Deum. Si enim amaret magis Deum, praeeligeret vivere secundum Deum quam quocumque temporali bono potiri. Hoc autem est de ratione caritatis quod Deus super omnia diligatur, ut ex superioribus patet; unde omne peccatum mortale caritati contrariatur.
          <td>I answer. It must be said that charity can, in no way, exist along with mortal sin. To prove this, it must be considered, first, that every mortal sin is directly opposed to charity. Whoever chooses something in preference to something else, loves better that which he first chooses. Whence, because man loves his own life itnd his own continuance more than pleasure, however great that pleasure may be, he is drawn away from pleasure if he thinks that it is infallibly destructive of his own life. This is explained by Augustine when he writes in the <i>LXXXIII Quaestionum</i> , that there is no one who fears pain more than he who seeks pleasure. Sometimes we even see that the most savage of beasts will avoid the greatest pleasures because of the fear of pain. However, one sins mortally in this, that he prefers something other than to live according to God and to cling to God. Thus it is clear that whoever sins mortally, by this fact he loves some other good more than he loves God; for if he would love God, he would choose to live according to God more than to obtain some temporal good. However, it is of the very essence of charity that God be loved above all things, as is clear from what is said above. Therefore every mortal sin is contrary to charity.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Caritas enim hominibus a Deo infunditur. Quae autem ex infusione divina causantur, non solum indigent actione divina in sui principio, ut esse incipiant, sed in tota sui duratione, ut conserventur in esse; sicut illuminatio aeris indiget praesentia solis, non solum cum primo aer illuminatur, sed quamdiu illuminatus manet: et propter hoc, si aliquod obstaculum interponatur intercipiens directum aspectum ad solem, desinit esse lumen in aere; et similiter quando peccatum mortale advenit, quod impedit directum aspectum animae ad Deum, per hoc quod aliquid aliud praefert Deo, intercipitur influxus caritatis, et desinit esse caritas in homine, secundum illud Is., LIX, 2: peccata nostra diviserunt inter nos et Deum nostrum.
          <td>Charity is founded in man by God. But those things which are caused by divine infusion are in need of divine action not only in the beginning so that they might begin to exist, but also in their entire duration so that they might be preserved in existence. For example, the illumination of the air needs the presence of the sun not only when the air is first lighted, but as long as it remains lighted. And for this reason, if any intervening obstacle prevents the direct rays of the sun, the light in the air fails. Likewise, when mortal sin enters, which obstructs the soul's direct sight of God—and through this something else is preferred to God—the flow of charity is stopped, and charity is then lacking in man, as is said (Isaiah. lix. 2), Your iniquities have divided between you and your God.

          <td>To the first, it must be said that the words of Origen should not be understood to mean that a man sinning mortally, howsoever perfect he was, does not suddenly lose charity. The words are to be interpreted to mean that it does not easily happen that a perfect man would suddenly commit a mortal sin at once, but through negligence; and many venial sins would be disposed finally to fall into mortal sin.

          <td>To the third, it must be said that a moral virtue which is acquired by acts consists in an inclination of power to act; and that inclination is not entirely taken away by one act. But by one act, the influence that God exerts in the operation of charity is taken away; therefore one act of sin takes away charity.

          <td>To the fifth, it must be said that the higher reason, in which charity exists, moves the lower reason. Therefore sin, inasmuch as it is opposed to the movement of charity in the lower part of the soul, drives out charity.

Sed quia actus voluntatis consistit in motu animae ad rem, sicut res in seipsis sunt contrariae, ita motus voluntatis in contraria sunt contrarii: desiderium enim dulcis contrariatur desiderio amari. Et secundum hoc amor Dei contrariatur amori peccati, quod excludit a Deo. Consideratio autem in qua non est contrarietas, non est proprius actus caritatis, qui ab ipsa elicitur, sed solum ab ipsa imperatur quasi eius effectus.
          <td>To the eighth, it must be said that delight, which comes from speculative knowledge, does not have a contrary in the same genus so that the consideration of some other thing would be contrary to it. This is because the species of contraries are not contrary in the understanding; whence, the delight which comes from a consideration of white is not contrary to the delight which comes from a consideration of black. Since the act of the will consists in the movement of the soul toward the thing willed, and just as things in themselves are contraries, so the movements of the will towards these contraries are contraries. For, the desire of sweetness is contrary to the desire of the bitter. According to this, the love of God is contrary to the love of sin which excludes one from God. However, speculative knowledge, insofar as there is no contrary, is not a proper act of charity which is elicited by it, but charity is only commanded by it as its effect.

Non est autem sic cum universale mobile sic impeditur in particulari effectu, quod non impeditur in his quae pertinent ad universalem virtutem.
          <td>To the ninth, it must be said that charity which is the universal mover of the virtues, when it is impeded through mortal sin in regard to those things which pertain to one virtue, is impeded in regard to its own universal object; and because of this it is universally impeded in regard to all. However, this is not true when the object that is potentially movable is so hindered in regard to its particular effect, so that it is not hindered in regard to those things which pertain to universal virtue.

          <td>To the tenth, it must be said that although hope and faith have God as their object, they are not the form of the other virtues; as is true of charity and as was proved above in Article III. Therefore, although charity is not without form, hope and faith can exist without form.

          <td>To the eleventh, it must be said that a defect of any perfection doesnot render virtue without form, but only that defect which removes the order to the final end. Indeed, there is an order in the charity of this life, although the charity of this life does not have the perfection of the charity of heaven which is in accord with its proper and perfect enjoyment of God.

          <td>To the twelfth, it must be said that imperfect acts can be performed by one possessing charity, but they do not follow from charity. For, not every act of the agent is the act of each form in the agent, and this is especially true in a rational nature which possesses freedom to exercise those habits in it.

          <td>To the thirteenth, it must be said that although not every ignorance of proper principles excludes science, however the ignorance of common principles does take away science, and when these principles are unknown, it follows that there is an ignorance of art, as is said in Book I of the <i>Elench</i> . However, the final end is regarded as the most common principle to all. Therefore, a de-ordination from the final end through mortal sin completely removes charity. But every de-ordination of particular principles does not remove charity, as is clear with venial sins.

Si enim aliquis amans civitatem aliquam, vel proprii corporis salutem, existimaret se alterum horum perdere per hoc quod agit: vel totaliter abstineret, vel illud quod ageret, plus diligeret quam propriam salutem vel civitatis. Unde cum aliquis sciens se amittere Deum per peccatum mortale (quod est scire se peccare mortaliter), nihilominus hoc incontinenter agit: convincitur plus amare quod agit quam Deum.
          <td>To the fourteenth, it must be said that whoever acts incontinently against a good which he loves, thinks that the good is not completely lost through that incontinent act which he is doing. For, if anyone who loves a certain state, or the health of his own body, would think that he would lose either of these through what he is doing, he would either abstain totally from those acts, or he would love that which he did more than his health or the good of the state. Whence, although one knows that he loses God through mortal sin—which is to know that he has sinned mortally—and nevertheless is doing that incontinent act, he clearly loves what he is doing more than he loves God.

          <td>To the fifteenth, it must be said that charity requires not only that there be a disposition to the universal, that God be loved above all things, but also that the act of choice and of the will be so disposed toward any particular that is chosen.

          <td>To the sixteenth, it must be answered that although acts are directly contrary to acts, and habits to habits, acts are also indirectly contrary to habits according as they conform to contrary habits.

          <td>1. That because of which a thing is so is itself more so. But man is loved in charity because of his virtue and blessedness.

But there does not seem to be any sharing of life between the angels and us, because we do not share with the angels in the life of nature, for they are more excellent in nature than man. Nor, again, do we share with them in the life of glory, for the gifts of grace and of glory are given by God according to the active capacity of the one receiving, as is said (Matt. xxv. 15), To every one He gave according to his proper ability.

Likewise, neither does it indicate the relation of an efficient cause, because it is the Holy Spirit Who moves us to love, as is said (Rom. v. 5), The charity of God is poured forth in our hearts, by the Holy Ghost, who is given to us. And again, it does not indicate the relation of a formal cause, because charity is not an intrinsic form since it does not come from the essence of a thing; nor is it the extrinsic exemplary form, for then all things which are loved out of charity would be located in the species of charity, just as imitations are located in the species of the exemplar.

Secundum igitur quod aliqua se habent ad hoc bonum, sic se habent ad hoc quod sint diligibilia ex caritate.

For example, the proper object of natural friendship, which is friendship toward blood-relatives, is a natural good considered as something produced from parents; in a political friendship, however; the object is the good of the state. Charity, therefore, has a certain special good as its proper object, viz., the good of divine beatitude, as was said above in Article IV of this Question. Thus, according as things are related to this good, so also are they lovable out of charity. But it should be considered that, since to love is to wish the good of someone, that which is said to be loved has a twofold consideration: it is considered either as one for whom we wish the good; or as the good which we wish for someone.

However, there is something else to which it pertains to have an eternal beatitude, but only through a certain return, viz., our body which is glorified through a redundance of glory from the soul to itself. Therefore God ought to be loved out of charity as the root of beatitude; however each man ought to love himself in charity in order that he may share in beatitude.

Accordingly, since all human goods are ordered to eternal beatitude as the ultimate end, the love of charity includes within itself all human loves, with the exception of those which are based on sin, which cannot be ordered to beatitude. Whence, that some who are relatives, or fellow-citizens, or fellow pilgrims, or any such, should love (diligant) one another, can be meritorious and out of charity; but that some be bound together (ament se invicem) for the sake of sharing in robbery or adultery, this cannot be meritorious nor out of charity.

          <td>To the fifteenth, it must be said that charity does not flee the body but the corruption of the body, inasmuch as it is said (Wis. ix. 15), For the corruptible body is a load upon the soul. Because of this the Apostle clearly has said the body of this death (Rom. vii. 24).

Unde a nobis requiri potest quod ex caritate diligamus, non autem quod iudicemus nos ex caritate diligere. Unde apostolus dicit, I ad Cor. cap. IV, 3: neque meipsum iudico; sed qui iudicat me, dominus est.
          <td>To the sixteenth, it must be said that it does not follow from the fact that man does not know for certain whether he has chariy that he is not able to love out of charity, but it does follow that he is not able to judge whether he loves out of charity. Thus, it can be required of us that we love out of charity, but not that we judge that we are loving out of charity. Whence the Apostle says (1 Cor. iv. 3), Neither do I judge my own self... but he that judgeth me, is the Lord.

Finalis quidem, in quantum dilectio proximi ordinatur ad dilectionem Dei sicut ad finem; unde dicitur I ad Timoth. I, 5: finis praecepti est caritas, quia scilicet dilectio Dei est finis observationis praeceptorum. In habitudine autem causae efficientis, in quantum caritas est habitus inclinans ad diligendum, sic se habens ad actum dilectionis, sicut calor ad calefactionem. In habitudine autem causae formalis, in quantum actus recipit speciem ab habitu, sicut et calefactio a calore.
          <td>To the seventeenth, it must be said that when one is said to love his neighbor out of charity, this preposition out of can designate a relation of final, efficient and formal causes; the final cause inasmuch as the love of neighbor is ordered to the love of God as to an end, whence it is written (1 Tim. i. 5), The end of the commandment is charity, because the love of God is the goal in observing the precepts. In the relationship of efficient cause, however, inasmuch as charity is a habit tending toward loving, being related to the act of loving as heat is to heating. In the reationship of formal cause, however, inasmuch as the act receives its species from the habit, as heating does from heat.

          <td>To the eighteenth, it must be said that the notion of being a neighbor is preserved both in him who gives favors and in him who receives, but not that whoever gives favors is a neighbor since it is required among neighbors that there be a sharing in some order. Therefore God, although He gives favors, cannot be said to be our neighbor; but Christ, inasmuch as He is man, is called our neighbor according as He gives favors to us.

          <td>Et videtur quod non.
          <td>It seems that loving one's enemies is not from the perfection of a counsel.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quod enim cadit sub praecepto, non est de perfectione consilii. Sed diligere inimicum cadit sub praecepto illo, videlicet: diliges proximum tuum sicut teipsum: nam nomine proximi intelligitur omnis homo, ut Augustinus dicit in Lib. de doctrina Christiana. Ergo diligere inimicum non est de perfectione consilii.
          <td>1. That which comes under a precept is not from the perfection of a counsel. But to love one's enemies comes under this precept, viz., Love your neighbor as yourself, for by the word neighbor is understood all men, as Augustine says in the <i>De Doctrina Christiana</i> . Therefore to love one's enemies is not from the perfection of a counsel.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed dicendum, quod est de perfectione consilii dilectio inimicorum quantum ad exhibitionem familiaritatis, et aliorum effectuum caritatis.- Sed contra, omnem proximum tenemur ex caritate diligere. Sed dilectio caritatis non est tantum in corde, sed etiam in opere: dicitur enim I Ioan. III, 18: non diligamus verbo, neque lingua, sed opere et veritate. Ergo etiam quantum ad effectus caritatis dilectio inimicorum cadit sub praecepto.
          <td>2. But it should be objected that the love of enemies is from the perfection of a counsel, at least to the extent of displaying acquaintance and the other effects of charity. On the contrary, we are bound to love all men in charity. But the love of charity is not only in the heart but also in works, for it is said (1 John iii. 18), Let us not love in word, nor in tongue, but in deed, and in truth. Therefore, considered as the effect of charity, love of enemy comes under a precept.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, Matth. V, 44, similiter dicitur: diligite inimicos vestros, et benefacite his qui oderunt vos. Si igitur diligere inimicos cadit sub praecepto, et benefacere eis cadit sub praecepto; quod pertinet ad effectus caritatis.
          <td>3. Moreover, it is also written (Matt. v. 44), Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you. If, therefore, to love your enemy is from a precept, then to do good to him, which pertains to the effect of charity, is also from a precept.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, ea quae pertinent ad perfectionem consiliorum, non fuerunt in veteri lege tradita: quia, ut dicitur Hebr. VII, 19, nihil perfectum adduxit lex. Sed in veteri lege fuit traditum quod ad inimicos non solum affectus dilectionis haberetur, sed etiam effectus dilectionis eis impenderetur; dicitur enim Exod. XXIII, 4: si occurreris bovi inimici tui aut asino erranti, reduc ad eum;- Levit. XIX, 17: ne oderis fratrem tuum in corde tuo; sed publice argue eum, ne habeas super illo peccatum;- et Iob XXXI, vv. 29-30: si gavisus sum ad ruinam eius qui me oderat, et exultavi, quod invenisset eum malum: non enim dedi ad peccandum guttur meum;- et Prov. XXV, 21: si esurierit inimicus tuus, ciba illum; si sitiverit, da ei aquam bibere. Ergo diligere inimicum etiam quantum ad exibitionem effectuum caritatis, non est de perfectione consilii.
          <td>4. Moreover, those things which pertain to the perfection of the counsels were not written in the Old Law, as is said (Hebr. vii. 19), The law brought nothing to perfection. But in the Old Law, it was taught that not only the affection of love be had for enemies, but also that the effect of love be imparted to them. For, it is written (Exod., xxiii. 4), If thou meet thy enemy's ox or ass going astray, bring it back to him; (Levit. xix. 17), Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart, but reprove him openly, lest thou incur sin through him; (Job xxxi. 29, 30), If I have been glad at the downfall of him that hated me, and have re/oiced that evil had found him. For I have not given my mouth to sin; (Prov. xxv. 21), If thy enemy be hungry, give him to eat; if he thirst give him water to drink. Therefore the love of enemies, insofar as it shows the effects of charity, is not from the perfection of a counsel.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, consilium non contrariatur legis praecepto; unde dominus, perfectionem novae legis traditurus, praemisit Matth. V, v. 17: non veni solvere legem, sed adimplere. Diligere autem inimicos videtur contrariari praecepto legis: quia dicitur Matth. cap. V, 43: diliges amicum tuum, et odio habebis inimicum tuum. Ergo dilectio inimicorum non cadit sub perfectione consilii.
          <td>5. Moreover, a counsel is not contrary to a precept of the law. For the Lord, when He was about to teach the perfection of the New Law, first said (Malt. v. 17), I am not come to destroy the law but to fulfill it. But to love enemies seems to be contrary to the precept of the law, for it is said (Matt. v. 43), Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thy enemy. Therefore the love of enemies does not come under the perfection of a counsel.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, dilectio habet proprium obiectum in quod inclinat, quia, sicut dicit Augustinus, pondus meum est amor meus. Sed proprium obiectum dilectionis non videtur esse inimicus, sed magis dilectioni repugnans. Ergo non est de perfectione caritatis quod aliquis diligat inimicum.
          <td>6. Moreover, love has its proper object toward which it inclines, as Augustine says, My weight is my love. An enemy does not seem to be the proper object of love, but rather he seems to be one resisting love. Therefore it is not of the perfection of charity that an enemy should be loved.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, perfectio virtutis non contrariatur inclinationi naturae; sed magis per virtutem inclinatio naturae perficitur. Natura autem movet ad hoc quod inimicus odio habeatur: quaelibet enim res naturalis repudiat suum contrarium. Ergo non est de perfectione caritatis quod inimicus diligatur.
          <td>7. Moreover, the perfection of a virtue is not contrary to the inclination of nature; rather, through virtue the inclination of nature is perfected. But it is nature that moves us to hate our enemies, for every natural being rejects its own contrary. Therefore it is not of the perfection of charity that an enemy should be loved.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, perfectio caritatis et cuiuslibet virtutis consistit in assimilatione ad Deum. Sed Deus amicos diligit, et inimicos odit, secundum illud Malach. I, 2: Iacob dilexi, Esau odio habui. Ergo non est de perfectione caritatis quod aliquis diligat inimicos, sed magis quod eos odio habeat.
          <td>8. Moreover, the perfection of charity, and of any virtue, consists in our becoming like to God. But God loves His friends and hates His enemies, according to the text (Malac. i. 2), I have loved Jacob, but have hated Esau. Therefore it is not of the perfection of charity that someone should love his enemies, but rather he should hate them.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, dilectio caritatis directe respicit bonum vitae aeternae. Sed aliquibus inimicis nostris non debemus velle bonum vitae aeternae; quia vel sunt damnati in Inferno, vel adhuc viventes sunt reprobati a Deo. Ergo diligere inimicos non pertinet ad perfectionem caritatis.
          <td>9. Moreover, the love of charity looks directly to the good of eternal life. But we ought not to wish the good of eternal life for some of our enemies; for, either they have been condemned to hell, or if they are still living, they have been rejected by God. Therefore to love enemies does not pertain to the perfection of charity.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, eum quem tenemur ex caritate diligere, non possumus licite occidere, nec velle eius mortem, aut quodcumque malum: quia de ratione amicitiae est quod amicos velimus esse et vivere. Sed nos licite possumus aliquos occidere; quia, secundum apostolum, Rom. XIII, 4: potestas saecularis Dei minister est, vindex in iram ei qui male agit. Non ergo tenemur inimicos diligere.
          <td>10. Moreover, we cannot lawfully kill one whom we are bound to love in charity, nor can we wish his death or any other evil for him, because the meaning of friendship is that we wish to be friends and to live. But it is lawful for us to kill some, for, according to the Apostle (Rom. xiii. 4), For he is God's minister: an avenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil. Therefore we are not bound to love our enemies.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, philosophus in Lib. topicorum docet sic argumentari in contrariis. Si diligere amicos est bonum et eis benefacere; diligere inimicos et eis benefacere malum est. Sed nullum malum perfectionem habet caritatis, nec cadit sub consilio. Ergo diligere inimicum non pertinet ad perfectionem consilii.
          <td>11. Moreover, the Philosopher in the <i>Topics</i> , teaches that in the case of contraries the argument runs as follows. If to love your friends and to do good for them is a good thing, then to love your enemies and to do good for them is an evil thing. But no evil attains to the perfection of charity, nor is it included under a counsel. Therefore to love your enemies does not pertain to the perfection of a counsel.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, amicus et inimicus sunt contraria. Ergo et diligere amicum et diligere inimicum sunt contraria. Contraria autem non possunt esse simul. Cum igitur teneamur ex caritate diligere amicos, non potest cadere sub consilio quod inimicos diligamus.
          <td>12. Moreover, friend and enemy are contraries. Therefore both to love a friend and to hate an enemy are contraries. But contraries cannot exist together. Therefore, since we are bound to love our friends in charity, it cannot be a counsel that we love our enemies.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, consilium non potest esse sub impossibili. Sed diligere inimicum videtur impossibile, cum sit contra inclinationem naturae. Ergo diligere inimicum non cadit sub consilio.
          <td>13. Moreover, a counsel cannot be concerned with the impossible. But to love an enemy seems to be impossible, since it is contrary to the inclination of nature. Therefore to love our enemies is not a counsel.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, implere consilia perfectorum est. Perfecti autem maxime fuerunt apostoli, qui tamen non dilexerunt inimicos quantum ad affectum et effectum: legitur enim de beato Thoma apostolo, quod imprecatus fuit illi qui manu alapam ei dederat, ut manus eius in convivio a canibus deportaretur. Ergo diligere inimicos quantum ad affectum et effectum non cadit sub perfectione consilii.
          <td>14. Moreover, to obey the counsels is for the perfect. The Apostles were perfect to a high degree, but they did not love their enemies both with regard to affection and deed. For it was written of St. Thomas the Apostle that he called down upon the one who struck him with an open hand, a curse such that his hand was snatched off by hungry dogs. Therefore to love enemies both as regards affection and deed does not come under the perfection of a counsel.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, imprecari mala, praecipue damnationis aeternae opponitur dilectioni et quantum ad affectum, et quantum ad effectum. Sed prophetae imprecati sunt mala suis adversariis: dicitur enim in Psalm. LXVIII, 29: deleantur de libro vitae, cum iustis non scribantur; et iterum Psalm. LIV, 16: veniat mors super illos, et descendant in Infernum viventes. Ergo diligere inimicos non est de perfectione caritatis.
          <td>15. Moreover, to call down evils on anyone, especially the evil of eternal damnation, is opposed to love both as regards affection and deed. But the Prophets called down evils for their adversaries, for it is said (Psalms lxviii. 29), Let them be blotted out of the book of the living; and with the just let them not be written. And again, (Psalms liv. 16), Let death come upon them, and let them go down alive into hell. Therefore to love enemies does not come under the perfection of charity.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, de ratione amicitiae verae est ut aliquis propter seipsum diligatur: caritas autem includit amicitiam sicut perfectum minus perfectum. Diligere autem inimicum propter seipsum, contrariatur caritati; quia solus Deus propter seipsum diligitur. Non ergo cadit sub consilii perfectione ut inimicus diligatur.
          <td>16. Moreover, it is of the very nature of true friendship that someone be loved for his own sake; but charity includes friendship, as the perfect includes the less perfect. But to love one's enemy for his own sake is contrary to charity, for only God is loved for His own sake. Therefore it is not from the perfection of a counsel that our enemy is loved.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, id quod cadit sub perfectione consilii, melius est et magis meritorium quam id quod sub necessitate praecepti. Sed diligere inimicum non est melius neque melioris meriti quam diligere amicum, quod manifeste cadit sub necessitate praecepti: quia si bonum est diligere aliquod bonum, melius est et magis meritorium diligere quod melius est. Melior autem est amicus inimico. Non ergo diligere inimicum est de perfectione consilii.
          <td>17. Moreover, that which is from the perfection of a counsel is better and more meritorious than that which is from the necessity of a precept. But to love an enemy is neither better nor more meritorious than to love a friend, which clearly is from the necessity of a precept; for, if it is good to love something good, it is better and more meritorious to love what is better. But a friend is better than an enemy. Therefore to love an enemy is not from the perfection of a counsel.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed dicebatur, quod diligere inimicum maioris meriti est, quia est difficilius.- Sed contra, diligere inimicum est difficilius quam diligere Deum. Ergo eadem ratione, maioris meriti esset diligere inimicum quam Deum.
          <td>18. But it was stated that to love an enemy is more meritorious because it is more difficult. On the contrary, to love an enemy is more difficult than to love God. Therefore, by the same reasoning, it should be more meritorious to love an enemy than to love God.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">

          <td>19. Moreover, a sign that a habit has been formed is pleasure in the work, as the Philosopher writes in Book II of the Ethic." But to love a friend is more pleasing than to love an enemy. Therefore it is also more virtuous, and consequently more meritorious. Thus to love an enemy does not come from the perfection of a counsel.

          <td>Ad cuius evidentiam sciendum est, quod sicut supra, art. 4 huius quaest., dictum est, proprium et per se obiectum caritatis est Deus; et quidquid ex caritate diligitur, ea ratione diligitur qua ad Deum pertinet, sicut si diligimus aliquem hominem, diligimus per consequens omnes ei attinentes, etiam si sint nobis inimici. Constat autem quod omnes homines ad Deum pertinent, in quantum sunt ab ipso creati, et capaces beatitudinis, quae in fruitione ipsius consistit. Manifestum est ergo, quod ista ratio dilectionis quam respicit caritas, in omnibus hominibus invenitur.
          <td>To prove this, it must be known that, as has been said above in Article IV of this Question, the proper and essential object of charity is God; and whatever is loved in charity is loved in terms of that very relationship by which it is related to God. For example, just as if we love some man, we consequently love everything with whom he is concerned, even if they are our own enemies. But it is agreed that all men are related to God as created by Him and as capable of a happiness which consists in the enjoyment of Him. It is clear, therefore, that this meaningful basis of the love that charity involves is found in all men.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sic ergo, in eo qui contra nos inimicitiam exercet, est duo invenire: unum quod est ratio dilectionis, scilicet quod ad Deum pertinet; et aliud quod est ratio odii, scilicet quod nobis adversatur. In quocumque autem invenitur ratio dilectionis et ratio odii si praetermissa dilectione in odium convertamur, manifestum est quod id quod est ratio odii praeponderat in corde nostro ei quod est ratio dilectionis. Sic ergo, si aliquis inimicum suum odio habeat, inimicitia illius praeponderat in corde suo amori divino. Magis ergo odit amicitiam illius quam diligat Deum. Tantum autem odimus aliquid, quantum diligimus bonum quod nobis per inimicum subtrahitur. Relinquitur ergo quod quicumque inimicum odit, aliquod bonum creatum diligit plus quam Deum; quod est contra praeceptum caritatis. Habere igitur odio inimicum est contrarium caritati; unde necesse est quod si ex praecepto caritatis tenemur quod dilectio Dei praeponderet in nobis dilectioni cuiuslibet alterius rei, et per consequens odio contrarii. Sequitur ergo quod ex necessitate praecepti teneamur diligere inimicos.
          <td>Therefore, in one who acts unfriendly toward us, two things are to be considered: one which is the basis of love, viz., in that he is related to God; and another which is the basis of hate, viz., in that he is our adversary. However, if in anyone is tound both the basis of love and of hate, and if love is neglected and we turn in the direction of hate, it is clear that the basis of hate predominates in our heart over the basis of love. Thus, therefore, if one regards his enemy with hatred, his enmity toward him predominates in his heart over divine love. Therefore he hates the friendship with such a one more than he loves God. But we hate something to the degree that we love the good of which we are deprived by the enemy. Therefore it remains that whoever hates his enemy loves some created good more than he loves God; and this is against the precept of charity. But to regard your enemy with hatred is against charity, for it is necessary, if we are bound by the precept of charity, that the love of God predominate in us over the love of any other thing and, as a consequence, also over the hatred of the contrary of that thing. Therefore it follows that we are bound to love our enemies out of the necessity of a precept.

          <td>At this point, however, although we are bound by the precept of charity to love our neighbor, the precept does not extend to this that we should actually love each and every neighbor in particular or do well by each one in a particular way, because no man is capable of having all men in mind in such a way that he would actually love each one in a particular way, nor is there any one capable of doing good or helping each and every one in a particular way.

You must take the matter as decided for you by a sort of lot, according as each man happens for the time being to be more closely connected with you.

We are bound, however, by the affection and the carrying out of the works of charity, by which we love all our neighbors and pray for them, not to exclude even those who are not joined to us by any special bond, as for instance those who live in India or Ethiopia.

Ex perfectione enim caritatis procedit quod sola caritas sic moveat ad inimicum, sicut ad amicum movet et caritas et specialis dilectio. Manifestum est autem quod ex perfectione activae virtutis procedit quod actio agentis ad remota procedat. Perfectior enim est ignis virtus per quam non solum propinqua sed remota calefiunt. Ita et perfectior est caritas, per quam non solum ad propinquos, sed etiam ad extraneos, et ulterius ad inimicos, non solum generaliter, sed etiam specialiter, et diligendo et benefaciendo movetur.
          <td>When no other bond remains to join us to our enemies except the bond of charity, we are bound by the obligation of precept to love them in common, both with affection and deed, and individually when the moment of need threatens. But when man for the sake of God shows toward his enemies that special affection and deeds of love which he devotes to those who are joined to him, this is perfect charity and follows from a counsel. For, it arises from the perfection of charity that charity alone should so move one toward an enemy in the manner that both charity and particular iove move one toward a friend. It is evident, however, that the fact that the action of an agent attains to that which is distant is due to the perfection of its active power. For the power of fire is more perfect when not only things nearby but also those distant are heated. So also that charity is more perfect through which one is moved, both in loving and in doing good, toward not only neighbors but also foreigners, and beyond this even to enemies, not only in general but in particular.

Possumus enim illis quod ex caritate diligimus, velle aut inferre aliquod malum temporale, propter tria. Primo quidem, propter eorum correctionem. Secundo, in quantum aliquorum temporalis prosperitas est in detrimentum alicuius multitudinis, vel etiam totius Ecclesiae; unde dicit Gregorius, XXII Moral.: evenire plerumque solet, ut, non amissa caritate, inimici nos ruina laetificet; et rursus eius gloria, sine invidiae culpa, contristet; dum, corruente eo, quosdam bene erigi credimus; et, proficiente illo, plerosque iniuste opprimi formidamus.- Tertio, ad servandum ordinem divinae iustitiae, secundum illud Ps.

          <td>To the tenth, it must be said that he whose office prescribes it, may lawfully punish evil-doers or even kill them while loving them out of charity. For, Gregory says in one of his Homilies that the just, while still loving, may cause a persecution; for if outwardly they create unrest by disciplining, inwardly, however, they may preserve their serenity by charity. Now we can desire or cause some temporal evil for those whom we love in charity for three reasons: first, we can do it in order to correct them; secondly, it may be because the temporal prosperity of some is detrimental to the good of some multitude or even the whole Church, whence Gregory writes in XXII <i>Moral.</i> It often happens that the ruin of our enemy can make us happy without our losing charity, and again, his glory can sadden us without incurring the fault of envy. This happens when, by his downfall, we believe that some are profited more, or when, by his advantage, we fear that many will be unjustly oppressed. Thirdly, our motive may be in order to preserve the order of divine justice, according as it is written (Psalms lvii. 11), The just shall rejoice when he shall see the revenge.

Secondly, that we love him for whom we wish some good, as is proper to a friendship for a noble person; but not as the good which we wish for ourselves, as is proper to a friendship for a pleasant or useful person, in which we love a friend as our own good. For, it is not that we seek pleasure or utility for a friend, but that we seek pleasure or utility for ourselves from a friend; just as we also love things pleasing and useful for ourselves, such as food or clothing. But when we love one out of virtue, we wish good for him, and we do not wish him for ourselves; this is especially proper to the friendship of charity.

But if we consider these two absolutely, it is better to love a friend than an enemy; it is also better to love God than a friend. For, the difficulty which is found in loving an enemy does not constitute the reason for meriting, except insofar as perfect charity is demonstrated by it, which overcomes the difficulty. Thus, if there would be such a perfect charity as to take away all difficulty, to this extent it would be more meritorious. But we speak of one who loves a friend with such perfect charity that it even extends to the love of enemies; but this love operates with more ardor toward the friend, unless by chance it is considered accidentally insofar as it operates against something repugnant with a greater effort. For example, in natural things, water that is warm is with greater effort brought to the freezing point.

          <td><b>I answer.</b> It must be said that, according to every opinion or authority on Scripture, such order must, without doubt, be designated to charity so that God is loved above all things, both in regard to affection and to the effect of love.

          <td>However, concerning the love for fellow-men, it was the opinion of some that the order of charity had to do with the effects of love, and not with the loving itself; and they were influenced by the words of Augustine, who writes that all men ought to be loved equally, but since you cannot do good to all, you are to pay special regard to those who, by the accidents of time, or place, or circumstance, are brought into closer connection with you.

          <td>Sed ista positio irrationabilis videtur. Sic enim Deus providet unicuique secundum quod conditio eius requirit; unde tendentibus in finem naturae imprimitur a Deo amor et appetitus finis, secundum quod exigit sua conditio ut tendat in finem; unde quorum est vehementior motus secundum naturam in aliquem finem, eorum etiam est maior inclinatio in illum, quae est appetitus naturalis, ut patet in gravibus et levibus. Sicut autem appetitus vel amor naturalis est inclinatio quaedam, indita rebus naturalibus ad fines connaturales, ita dilectio caritatis est inclinatio quaedam infusa rationali naturae ad tendendum in Deum. Secundum igitur quod necesse est alicui tendere in Deum, secundum hoc ex caritate inclinatur.
          <td>But this seems to be an unreasonable position, for God so provides for each man according as his state in life requires. Thus love and a desire for the end are implanted by God in those things which tend toward the end of their nature, according as each one's individual state demands that it tend toward its end. Therefore in these things there is a stronger movement according to nature toward a certain end, and there is also in them a greater inclination, which is the natural appetite; as can be seen in heavy and light objects. But, just as the appetite or natural love is a certain inclination implanted in natural things to ends which are connatural to them, so the love of charity is a certain. inclination infused in rational nature for the purpose of tending toward God. Therefore, according as it is necessary for one to tend toward God, thus is he inclined out of charity.

Coadiuvat nos etiam, instrumentaliter tantum, corpus nostrum, et etiam quae corpori necessaria sunt.
          <td>However, for those who will tend toward God as to an end, what is especially needed is that there be divine help; secondly, that there be some self-help; and thirdly, that there be cooperation with fellow-men. And in this we see a gradation, for some cooperate only in a general way, while others who are more closely united cooperate in a special way. Not all are able to cooperate in a special way. Our body and those things which are necessary for the body also help us tend toward God, but only instrumentally.

          <td>But whoever there is that is a hindrance to this love, should be hated, for the Lord said (Luke xiv. 26), If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother,... he cannot be my disciple. Finally, we ought to love our body. Thus, regarding the act which charity evokes, an order ought to be established according to the affection in the love of fellow-men.

Manifestum est autem quod secundum dilectionem naturalem propinqui plus diliguntur etiam secundum affectum, et secundum dilectionem socialem plus coniuncti, et sic de aliis dilectionibus. Unde manifestum fit, quod etiam secundum affectum unus proximorum magis est diligendus quam alius, et ex caritate imperante actus aliarum amicitiarum licitarum.
          <td>However, it should also be considered that, as we said above in Article VII and VIII, other lawful and noble loves which arise from other causes are also able to be ordered to charity. Thus, the charity of these loves can command an act; and therefore that which is loved more according to some of these loves is loved more out of that charity which commands the act. It is also clear that, according to natural love, our relatives are more loved in affection; according to a social love, those who are closely united to us are loved more; and so for all the other kinds of love. Therefore it is also evident that in affection, one neighbor ought to be loved more than another; and he is loved out of a charity which commands the act of the other lawful friendships.

Et sic etiam contingit in his quae sunt fidei. Unde apostolus, I ad Corinth., XV, probat resurrectionem mortuorum futuram per resurrectionem Christi.
          <td>To the first, it must be said that the object of faith is the true, whence according as something happens to be more true, so is it more believed. But since truth consists in the conformity of intellect and thing, and if truth is considered according to the characteristic of equality which does not allow a greater or less degree, it does not then happen that a thing is more or less true. But if the being itself of the thing is considered, which is the basis of truth, as is said in II <i>Metaphys.</i> , then the disposition of things in being and in truth is the same. Thus, those things which are more in being are more true, and because of this, principles in scientific demonstrations are believed more than conclusions. And thus it happens also in regard to those things which concern faith. In this way the Apostle (1 Cor. xv) proves the future resurrection of the dead through the resurrection of Christ.

But in this life, it is necessary for us to tend toward our end; and therefore the order of love is also established according to the measure of help in tending to that end which is obtained from others. And thus it is not always those who live better lives that are loved more, but there also arises a factor of propinquity, so that the reason for greater love is found jointly in each of these factors.

Therefore, in the collection for ecclesiastical benefices he ought not to regard any closeness to himself but rather the closeness to God and the usefulness to the Church; just as the overseer of any household in attending to the affairs of his master ought to consider the service as being rendered to his master and not to himself. But in one's own private affairs, such as the goods of patrimony, or those things which are acquired by one's own personal effort as an individual, in these goods one ought to observe an order of closeness in doing good.

But considering those things which pertain to some other thing by reason of a certain bond, such as the fact that one is a citizen or a soldier, he ought to obey the ruler of the state or his general more than his parents.

Sed hoc non est diligere filium ratione eius, sed ratione sui ipsius. Sed secundum modum dilectionis qua diligimus aliquem ratione eius, plus diligendus est pater quam filius, in quantum ex patre maius beneficium suscepimus, et in quantum honor filii magis dependet ex honore patris quam e converso; et ideo in exhibitione reverentiae, et in obediendo, et in satisfaciendo voluntati eius, et in similibus, tenetur homo magis patri quam filio; sed in subventione necessariorum plus tenetur homo filio quam parenti, quia parentes debent thesaurizare filiis, et non e converso, ut dicitur I Corinth., IV.
          <td>To the eighteenth, it must be said that according to that love by which one loves himself, he loves his wife and children more than his parents because a wife is some part of the husband, and the son of the father. Therefore the love which one has for his wife and son is more included in the love by which a person loves himself than is the love which he has for his parents. But this is not to love the son for the son's sake, but rather for one's own sake. But according to the mode of love by which we love another for the other's sake, a father ought to be loved more than a son insofar as we receive greater benefit from the father, and also insofar as the honor of the son depends more on the honor of the father than vice versa. Therefore in a display of reverence, in obedience, in doing the will of another, and in other similar things, man is bound more to his father than to his son. But in providing the necessities, he is bound more to the child than to the parent, because parents ought to lay away treasures for their children and not vice versa, as is said in 1 Corinth., iv.

          <td>Respondeo. Dicendum, quod perfectum tripliciter dicitur. Uno modo perfectum simpliciter: alio modo perfectum secundum naturam; tertio modo secundum tempus. Perfectum quidem dicitur simpliciter quod omnibus modis perfectum est, et cui nulla perfectio deest. Perfectum autem secundum naturam dicitur, cui non deest aliquid eorum quae nata sunt haberi a natura illa: sicut intellectum hominis dicimus perfectum, non quod nihil ei intelligibilium desit, sed quia nihil ei deest eorum per quae homo natus est intelligere. Perfectum secundum tempus dicimus quando nihil deest alicui eorum quae natum est habere secundum tempus illud: sicut dicimus puerum perfectum, quia habet ea quae requiruntur ad hominem secundum aetatem illam. Sic igitur dicendum, quod caritas perfecta simpliciter a solo Deo habetur. Caritas autem perfecta secundum naturam haberi quidem potest ab homine, sed non in hac vita. Caritas autem perfecta secundum tempus, etiam in hac vita haberi potest. Ad cuius evidentiam sciendum est, quod cum actus et habitus speciem habeant ex obiecto, oportet quod ex eodem ratio perfectionis ipsius sumatur. Obiectum autem caritatis est summum bonum. Caritas ergo est perfecta simpliciter quae in summum bonum fertur in tantum quantum diligibile est. Summum autem bonum diligibile est in infinitum, cum sit bonum infinitum. Unde nulla caritas creaturae, cum sit finita, potest esse simpliciter perfecta, sed sic perfecta dici potest sola caritas Dei, qua diligit seipsum.
          <td><b>I answer.</b> It must be said that the perfect is spoken of in three ways: first, the perfect in itself; secondly, the perfect according to nature; and thirdly, the perfect according to time. A thing is called perfect in itself when it is perfect in every respect and when no perfection is lacking. Something is called perfect according to nature when it lacks none of the things which it should possess by its very nature. For example, we say that the intellect of man is perfect, not because it lacks none of the intelligibles, but rather because it lacks none of those things through which man naturally knows. We say a thing is perfect according to time when nothing is lacking to it of those things which it is born to have according to a particular time, as we call a boy perfect because he possesses everything that is required for a human being of that age. So it must be said that charity which is perfect without any qualification is possessed by God alone. But charity which is perfect according to nature can be had by man, but not in this life. Charity which is perfect according to time can be had even in this life. To understand this clearly, it should be known that since act and habit are specified by their object, it is necessary that any reason of their perfection arise from this same object. But the object of charity is the highest good. Therefore charity is perfect without qualffication not only when it is directed to the highest good, but in the same degree as that good is good. Therefore since the highest good is infinite, it is to be loved infinitely. Whence no created charity, since it is finite, can be perfect without qualification, but only the love of God by which He loves Himself can be called perfect in this way.

          <td>Sed tunc secundum naturam rationalis creaturae, caritas dicitur esse perfecta, quando rationalis creatura secundum suum posse ad Deum diligendum convertitur. Impeditur autem homo in hac vita, ne totaliter mens eius in Deum feratur, ex tribus. Primo quidem ex contraria inclinatione mentis; quando scilicet mens per peccatum conversa ad commutabile bonum sicut ad finem, avertitur ab incommutabili bono. Secundo per occupationem saecularium rerum; quia, ut dicit apostolus, I ad Cor., VII, 33: qui cum uxore est, sollicitus est quae sunt mundi quomodo placeat uxori, et divisus est; id est, cor eius non movetur tantum in Deum. Tertio vero ex infirmitate praesentis vitae, cuius necessitatibus oportet aliquatenus hominem occupari, et retrahi, ne actualiter mens feratur in Deum; dormiendo, comedendo, et alia huiusmodi faciendo, sine quibus praesens vita duci non potest: et ulterius ex ipsa corporis gravitate anima deprimitur, ne divinam lucem in sui essentia videre possit, ut ex tali visione caritas perficiatur; secundum illud apostoli, II ad Cor., V, 6: quamdiu sumus in corpore, peregrinamur a domino; per fidem enim ambulamus, et non per speciem.
          <td>However, according to the nature of a rational creature, charity is said to be perfect when the rational creature is turned to loving God as much as he is able to love Him. But man is impeded in this life, so that his mind is not directed completely to God, for three reasons. The first reason is the contrary inclination of the soul, for when the soul is turned by sin toward a changeable good as toward an end, it is directed away from the immutable good. Secondly, man does not completely love God because of his occupation with the affairs of the world; for, as the Apostle says (1 Cor. vii. 33), He that is with a wife, is solicitous for the things of the world, how he may please his wife; and he is divided; i.e., his heart is not directed only to God. The third reason is from the infirmity of this present life, with the necessities with which man must be occupied to a certain extent, and his soul must be diverted from being directed to God perfectly, e.g., sleeping, eating, and doing other things of this kind without which the present life could not be lived. Further, the soul is weighted down by the burden of the body so that it cannot see the divine light in its essence.14 By such a vision, charity would be per fected, according as the Apostle says (1I Cor. v. 6-7), While we are in the body, we are absent from the Lord. (For we walk by faith, and not by sight.)
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Homo autem in hac vita potest esse sine peccato mortali avertente ipsum a Deo; et iterum potest esse sine occupatione temporalium rerum, sicut apostolus dicit, I ad Cor., c. VII, 33: qui sine uxore est, sollicitus est de his quae sunt domini, quomodo placeat Deo. Sed ab onere corruptibilis carnis in hac vita liber esse non potest. Unde quantum ad remotionem primorum duorum impedimentorum, caritas potest esse perfecta in hac vita; non autem quantum ad remotionem tertii impedimenti; et ideo illam perfectionem caritatis quae erit post hanc vitam, nullus in hac vita habere potest, nisi sit viator et comprehensor simul; quod est proprium Christi.
          <td>However, man can live in this life without turning himself away from God by mortal sin. Again, he is able to live without the occupation of temporal affairs, as is said (1 Cor. vii. 32), He that is without a wife, is solicitous for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please God. However, man cannot be free from the burden of his corruptible body in this life. Thus, according as the first two impediments are removed, charity can be perfect in this life; but not as regards the third. Therefore no one can possess in this life the perfect charity he will have in the next life, unless he be at one and the same time a traveler here below and a beholder of God, and this is proper only to Christ.

          <td>To the first, it must be said that when it is written, Love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart, this is understood to be a precept according to which the totality excludes everything that prevents a perfect adherence to God; and this is not a precept but the end of a precept.

Unde perfectio caritatis quae est secundum quodcumque tempus, est perfectio quae competit caritati secundum eius speciem. Est autem de ratione caritatis ut Deus super omnia diligatur, et ut nullum creatum ei praeferatur in amore. Unde, cum omnis tentatio ex amore alicuius boni creati proveniat, vel ex timore mali contrarii, quod etiam ex amore derivatur; ex sua specie hoc habet caritas in quolibet statu, quod cuilibet tentationi resistere possit, ita etiam, scilicet, quod in peccatum mortale per eam homo non inducatur, non autem quod nullo modo tentatione afficiatur: hoc enim pertinet ad perfectionem patriae.
          <td>To the fourth, it must be answered that the perfection which is found in a thing according to its species is found in it always; just as man, because of his rational soul, is perfect at any time or at any age. Whence, the perfection of charity which is according to all time is the perfection which is found in charity according to its species. But it is of the very essence of charity that God be loved above all things and that no creature be preferred to Him in love. Whence, since every temptation occurs from the love of some created good, or from the fear of a contrary evil which is derived from love, charity, in whatever degree, has from its species that it is able to resist any temptation in such way that man is not led into mortal sin through it, not however that man is affected in no way by temptation; for this pertains to the perfection of heaven.

Similiter etiam potest intelligi, quod Deus totaliter videbitur et diligetur, quia non est aliqua pars eius quae non videatur et diligatur, cum ipse non sit compositus, sed simplex. Sed tamen secundum alium intellectum non totaliter diligetur, nec totaliter videbitur; quia, scilicet, non tantum videbitur, nec tantum ab aliqua creatura diligetur, sicut visibilis est et diligibilis. Sed in vita ista nec etiam secundum primum aut secundum modum Deus totaliter videri aut diligi potest: quia nec ipse per essentiam suam videtur, nec est possibile homini, in hac vita viventi, ut absque intermissione eius affectus actualiter feratur in Deum. Sed tamen quodammodo totaliter diligitur Deus ab homine in hac vita, in quantum nihil est in affectu eius contrarium dilectioni divinae.
          <td>To the fifth, it must be said that in heaven God will be both wholly seen and wholly loved in the same way, viz., insofar as wholly is regarded on the part of the one who loves and the one who sees, for the entire power of the creature will be applied to seeing and loving God. Likewise, it can also be understood that God will be wholly seen and loved because there is no part of Him which is not seen and loved, since He is not composite but simple. But according to another way of understanding this, He is not wholly loved or seen, because He will not be seen or loved by any creature to the degree that He can be seen or is lovable. In this life, however, God cannot even be wholly seen or loved according to the first or second way, for He is not seen through His essence, nor is it possible for man living in this life that his affective power be perfectly directed toward God without any interruption. Nevertheless, God is wholly loved in some way by man in this life according as there is nothing in his affective power contrary to the divine love.

          <td>To the sixth, it must be said that the will is the mistress of its own act in regard to that which it does, but not in regard to the fact that it perseveres continually in one act, since a condition of this life requires that acts and the will be directed toward many things. Or, it can be said that the will is the mistress of its acts in those things which are connatural to man, but the perfection of charity which will be greatest in heaven is above man, especially if man is considered according to his state in the present life.

          <td>Ad septimum dicendum, quod aliqua actio desinit esse delectabilis non solum ex parte obiecti, sed etiam ex parte agentis quod deficit in virtute agendi. Sic igitur dicendum est, quod actualiter semper ferri in Deum, delectabile est ex parte obiecti; sed ex parte in hac vita constituti non potest esse talis delectatio continua, quia contemplatio mentis humanae non est sine actione virtutis imaginativae, et aliarum virium corporalium, quas necesse est laxari diuturnitate actionis, propter corporis infirmitatem, unde impeditur delectatio; et propter hoc dicitur Eccle., XII, 12: frequentis meditatio, carnis est afflictio.
          <td>To the seventh, it must be said that an action can cease to be lovable not only on the part of the object, but also on the part of the agent because he is deficient in the power of acting. Thus it must be said that what is always actually directed toward God is lovable on the part of the object. However, such a love, on the part of one living in this life, cannot be continual, because the contemplation of the human mind is not without the action of the imaginative power and of the other corporeal powers, which must be released from continuous action because of the weakness of the body; and for this reason delight is impeded.

          <td>To the ninth, it must be said that the objects of the other moral virtues are human goods which do not exceed the powers of man. Therefore man can arrive at the complete perfection of these in this life. But the object of charity is the uncreated good which does exceed the powers of man. Therefore the argument does not apply.

However, we can know what He is not, as Augustine says, and in this consists the perfection of the knowledge of this life. Likewise, we are not able to love God perfectly in this life so that we are always actually directed toward Him, but the mind is never directed to what is contrary to God.

          <td>To the third, it must be said that in this life charity is neither perfect without qualffication nor according to human nature, but only according to time. But those things which are perfect in this way possess that by which they grow, as is clear in the example given of boys. Therefore charity in this life always has that by which it increases itself.

          <td>2. Moreover, it seems to be from the perfection of charity that man orders all of his acts to God. But all men are bound to do this, for it is written (1 Cor. x. 31), Whether you eat or drink, or whatsoever else you do, do all to the glory of God. Therefore all are bound to the perfection of charity.

          <td>3. But it must be objected that this precept of the Apostle means that everything should be ordered to God in habit, but not in act. On the contrary, the precepts of the law concern the acts of the virtues; but a habit does not come under a precept. Thus, this precept of the Apostle does not concern the habitual, but the actual resolution of our acts to God.

V 20: nisi abundaverit iustitia vestra plusquam Scribarum et Pharisaeorum, non intrabitis in regnum caelorum. Ad ea autem quae sunt de necessitate salutis, omnes tenentur. Ergo et ad praedictam adimpletionem servandam. Sed praedicta adimpletio ad perfectionem pertinet; unde dominus in fine concludit Matth., V, 48: estote perfecti, sicut pater vester caelestis perfectus est. Ergo ad perfectionem caritatis omnes tenentur.
          <td>4. Moreover, the Lord fulfilled the precepts of the Old Law (Matt. v. 17), I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill. But this fulfillment is from the necessity of salvation, as is clear from what follows in this text (Matt. v. 20), Unless your justice abound more than that of the Scribes and Pharisees, you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. But everyone is bound to do those things which concern the necessity of salvation, and they are therefore bound to accomplish this fulfillment. But this aforesaid fulfillment pertains to perfection, for the Lord concluded (Matt. v. 48), Be you therefore perfect, as also your heavenly Father is perfect. Therefore all are bound to the perfection of charity.

Nullus ergo excusatur a perfectione caritatis.
          <td>5. Moreover, it is only the counsels that not all are bound to obey. But the perfection of eternal life or of charity is not referred to the counsels. For, a counsel of poverty is given, and it does not therefore follow that he who is poorer is more perfect; so, too, a counsel of virginity is given, and yet many virgins are less perfect in charity than others. Thus it seems that the perfection of charity is not referred to the counsels. Therefore no one is excused from the perfection of charity.

Nec tamen episcopi tenentur ad observandum huiusmodi consilium paupertatis, et alia huiusmodi. Ergo in his non consistit perfectio caritatis.
          <td>6. Moreover, the status of bishops is more perfect than the status of religious. Otherwise, one would not be able lawfully to transfer from the state of a religious to that of a prelate. Thus, Dionysius says in the <i>Eccles. Hierarchia</i> , that bishops are more perfect, but monks are more perfectly resigned in their virtues; and they ought to elevate themselves to that perfection which they observe in bishops. However, bishops are not bound to observe the counsel of poverty or other counsels of this kind. Therefore the perfection of charity does not consist in these.

          <td>Respondeo. Dicendum, quod huius quaestionis solutio ex praemissis accipi potest. Ostensum est enim supra, quod aliqua perfectio est quae ipsam speciem caritatis consequitur, utpote quae consistit in remotione cuiuslibet inclinationis in contrarium caritatis. Quaedam autem perfectio est, sine qua caritas esse potest, quae pertinet ad bene esse caritatis; quae scilicet consistit in remotione occupationum saecularium, quibus affectus humanus retardatur ne libere progrediatur in Deum. Est autem et quaedam alia perfectio caritatis, quae non est possibilis homini in hac vita, et quaedam ad quam nulla natura creata pertingere potest; ut ex supradictis apparet.
          <td><b>I answer.</b> It must be said that the answer to this problem can be seen from what has already been written. For, it was shown above, that a certain kind of perfection is that which follows from the very species of charity, viz., that which consists in removing any inclination toward the contrary of charity. But another perfection, without which charity can exist, is that which pertains to the well-being of charity, viz., that which consists in the taking away of the occupations of the world by which human affection is hindered from freely advancing to God. But there is another kind of perfection of charity which is not possible for man in this life; and another which no created nature can attain. This is clear from what is written above.

          <td>Manifestum est autem, quod ad illud omnes teneri dicuntur, sine quo salutem consequi non possunt. Sine caritate autem nullus potest salutem aeternam consequi, et ea habita ad salutem aeternam pervenitur. Unde ad primam perfectionem caritatis omnes tenentur sicut ad ipsam caritatem.
          <td>It is evident that all are said to be bound to that without which they cannot attain salvation. But without charity no one can attain eternal salvation, and when charity is possessed, eternal salvation is attained. Thus all are bound to the first perfection of charity as to charity itself.

          <td>Ad secundam vero perfectionem, sine qua caritas esse potest, homines non tenentur, cum quaelibet caritas sufficiat ad salutem. Multo etiam minus tenentur ad tertiam vel quartam perfectionem, cum nullus ad impossibile teneatur.
          <td>To the second kind of perfection, without which charity can exist, men are not bound, since any sort of charity is sufficient for salvation. And even less are they bound to the third or fourth perfections, since no one is bound to the impossible.

        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad secundum dicendum, quod omnia actu referre in Deum, non est possibile in hac vita, sicut non est possibile quod semper de Deo cogitetur; hoc enim pertinet ad perfectionem patriae. Sed quod omnia virtute referantur in Deum, hoc pertinet ad perfectionem caritatis ad quam omnes tenentur. Ad cuius evidentiam considerandum est, quod, sicut in causis efficientibus virtus primae causae manet in omnibus causis sequentibus, ita etiam intentio principalis finis virtute manet in omnibus finibus secundariis; unde quicumque actu intendit aliquem finem secundarium, virtute intendit finem principalem; sicut medicus, dum colligit herbas actu, intendit conficere potionem, nihil fortassis de sanitate cogitans, virtualiter tamen intendit sanitatem, propter quam potionem dat. Sic igitur, aliquis seipsum ordinat in Deum, sicut in finem, in omnibus quae propter seipsum facit manet virtute intentio ultimi finis, qui Deus est: unde in omnibus mereri potest, si caritatem habeat. Hoc igitur modo apostolus praecipit quod omnia in Dei gloriam referantur.
          <td>To the second, it must be said that to order all things actually to God is not possible in this life; just as it is not possible to be always thinking of God, for this pertains to the perfection of heaven. But that all things be ordered to God by virtue does pertain to the perfection of charity, to which all are bound. To prove this, it must be understood that just as in efficient causes the power of the primary cause remains in all the subsequent causes, so also does the intention of the principal end virtually remain in all the secondary ends. Thus, whoever actually intends some secondary end, virtually intends the primary end. For example, a physician, while actually gathering herbs, intends the end of preparing a prescription, while perhaps not thinking about health; yirtually, however, he intends health as the end for which he administers the prescription. In the same way, he who orders himself to God as to an end, in all things which he does for his own sake, the intention of the final end which is God remains virtually. Thus he is able to gain merit in all things if he has charity. It is in this manner, therefore, that the Apostle wrote that everything should be ordered to the glory of God.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad tertium dicendum, quod aliud est habitualiter referre in Deum, et aliud virtualiter. Habitualiter enim refert in Deum et qui nihil agit, nec aliquid actualiter intendit, ut dormiens; sed virtualiter aliquid referre in Deum, est agentis propter finem ordinantis in Deum. Unde habitualiter referre in Deum, non cadit sub praecepto; sed virtualiter referre omnia in Deum, cadit sub praecepto caritatis: cum hoc nihil aliud sit quam habere Deum ultimum finem.
          <td>To the third, it must be said that it is one thing to order things to God habitually and another thing to do so virtually. For, habitually one orders to God who does nothing, nor does he actually intend anything, as sleeping. But to order something to God virtually is the act of an agent ordering to God because of the end. Therefore to order to God habitually does not come under a precept, but to do so virtually does come from a precept since this is nothing other than to have God as the ultimate end.

          <td>To the fourth, it must be said that the saying, Be ye perfect, etc., seems to have reference to the love of enemies which in one way is from the perfection of a counsel; in another way from the necessity of a precept, as has been shown above.

          <td>Ad quintum dicendum, quod perfectio vitae aeternae in quibusdam quidem consistit principaliter et per se; in quibusdam autem secundario, et quasi per accidens. Principaliter quidem et per se consistit perfectio in his quae pertinent ad interiorem mentis dispositionem, et praecipue in actu caritatis, quae est radix omnium virtutum; secundario vero et per accidens consistit etiam in quibusdam exterioribus, ut puta in virginitate, paupertate, et huiusmodi. Haec enim ad perfectionem pertinere dicuntur tripliciter. Primo quidem, in quantum per ea subtrahuntur homini impedimenta occupationum, quibus remotis mens liberius fertur in Deum; unde et dominus cum dixisset, Matth. XIX, 21: si vis perfectus esse, vade, et vende omnia quae habes, et da pauperibus, consequenter adiecit: et veni, et sequere me; ut ostenderet, quod paupertas ad perfectionem non pertineret, nisi in quantum disponit ad sequendum Christum. Quem quidem sequimur non passibus corporis, sed affectibus mentis. Similiter apostolus, I ad Cor., VII, 34, consilium dat de non nubendo; quia quae virgo est, cogitat quae Dei sunt, quomodo placeat Deo; et eadem ratio est de aliis similibus.
          <td>To the fifth, it must be said that the perfection of eternal life consists principally and essentially in certain things, but secondarily and accidentally it consists in others. Principally and essentially, this perfection consists in those things which pertain to an interior disposition of the mind, and especially in the act of charity which is the root of all the virtues. But secondarily and accidentally, this perfection also consists in certain external things, such as virginity, poverty, and other such things. These things are said to pertain to perfection in a threefold manner. They pertain to perfection, first, insofar as through them the hindrances of the manifold activities of ordinary life are taken away from man, and when they are removed, the mind is more freely directed to God. Thus the Lord, when He said (Matt. xix. 21), If thou wilt be perfect, go sell what thou hast, and give it to the poor, He then added, and come follow me. He did this to show that poverty does not pertain to perfection unless it dispose one to follow Christ. For, we follow Him not with the movements of our body, but with the affections of the soul. In this way, the Apostle gave counsel about not marrying (1 Cor. vii. 34), for she who is a virgin thinkest on the things of the Lord, how to please Him. And this same reasoning concerns similar cases.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundo pertinent ad perfectionem, in quantum sunt quidam perfectae caritatis effectus qui enim perfecte diligit Deum, ab his se retrahit quae eum retrahere possunt ne Deo vacet.
          <td>Secondly, they pertain to perfection insofar as they are the effects of perfect charity; for he who loves God perfectly removes himself from those things which can prevent him from devoting himself to God.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Tertio pertinent ad perfectionem poenitentiae; quia nulla satisfactio pro peccatis adaequari potest votis religionis, quibus homo se Deo consecrat, et animam per votum obedientiae, et corpus per votum continentiae, et res omnes per votum paupertatis. Sic igitur in his quae principaliter et per se ad perfectionem pertinent, sequitur quod sit maior perfectio ubi haec inveniuntur magis, sicut quod perfectior est qui maioris est caritatis. In his autem quae ex consequenti et quasi per accidens, ad perfectionem pertinent, non sequitur magis simpliciter ubi magis inveniuntur. Unde non sequitur quod magis pauper sit magis perfectus; sed mensuranda est in talibus perfectio per comparationem ad illa in quibus consistit perfectio simpliciter; ut scilicet ille dicatur perfectior, cuius paupertas magis sequestrat hominem a terrenis occupationibus, et facit liberius Deo vacare.
          <td>Thirdly, they pertain to the perfection of penance, for no satisfaction for sin can be equal to religious vows by which man consecrates himself to God; his soul through the vow of obedience, his body through the vow of chastity, and all other things through the vow of poverty. Therefore, in regard to those things which primarily and essentially pertain to perfection, it follows that there will be a greater perfection where those things are found in more abundance; just as he who has more charity is more perfect. But with regard to those things which pertain to perfection as a consequent or accidentally, it does not follow that perfection in itself is greater where they are found in greater abundance. Therefore it does not follow that he who is poorer is more perfect. However, perfection in such matters ought to be measured by a comparison to those things in which perfection essentially consists. For example, he is said to be more perfect whose poverty separates him the more from earthly occupations and makes him freer in devoting himself to God.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad sextum dicendum, quod haec est differentia inter amicitiam honesti et delectabilis: quia in amicitia delectabilis, amicus diligitur propter delectationem; in amicitia autem honesti amicus diligitur propter seipsum, sed delectatio provenit ex consequenti. Ad perfectionem igitur amicitiae honesti pertinet ut aliquis propter amicum interdum abstineat etiam a delectatione quam in eius praesentia habet, in eius servitiis occupatus. Secundum igitur hanc amicitiam plus amat aliquem qui ab eo se absentat propter amicum, quam qui a praesentia amici discedere non vult etiam propter amicum. Sed si quis libenter vel faciliter a praesentia amici divellitur et in aliis magis delectatur, vel nihil vel parum comprobatur amicum diligere. Hos igitur tres gradus considerare possumus in caritate. Deus autem maxime propter seipsum est diligendus. Sunt enim quidam qui libenter, vel sine magna molestia, separantur a vacatione divinae contemplationis, ut terrenis negotiis implicentur, et in his vel nihil vel modicum caritatis apparet. Quidam verum in tantum delectantur in vacatione divinae contemplationis, quod eam deserere nolunt, etiam ut divinis obsequiis mancipentur ad salutem proximorum. Quidam vero ad tantum culmen caritatis ascendunt, quod etiam divinam contemplationem, licet in ea maxime delectentur, praetermittunt, ut Deo serviant in salutem proximorum; et haec perfectio in Paulo apparet, qui dicebat Rom., IX, 3: optabam ego ipse anathema, id est separatus, esse a Christo pro fratribus meis;- et ad Philipp., I, 23-24: desiderium habens dissolvi, et esse cum Christo; permanere autem in carne necessarium propter vos. Et haec perfectio est proprie praelatorum, et praedicatorum, et quorumcumque aliorum, qui procurandae saluti aliorum insistunt; unde significantur per Angelos in scala Iacob ascendentes quidem per contemplationem, descendentes vero per sollicitudinem quam de salute proximorum gerunt. Nec derogare potest perfectioni status praelatorum, quod aliqui statu praelatorum abutuntur quaerentes praelationem propter temporalia bona, quasi dulcedine contemplationis non allecti; sicut nec incredulitas multorum, fidem Dei evacuat, ut dicitur Rom., III.
          <td>To the sixth, it must be said that there is a difference between a friendship for a noble person and a friendship for a pleasant person, because in a friendship for a pleasant person, the friend is loved for the sake of pleasure; but in a friendship for a noble person, the friend is loved for his own sake, although pleasure is a result of this. Therefore it is proper to the perfection of a friendship for a noble person that one who is occupied in serving a friend should sometimes even abstain from a pleasure which he experiences in the friend's presence for the sake of that friend. So, according to this friendship, he who would absent himself from a friend for the friend's sake would love him more than he who would not wish to depart from the presence of that friend even for that friend's sake. But if anyone be willingly and easily deprived of the friend's presence and be more pleased with other things, this proves that he loves the friend either not at all, or only a little. We can, therefore, consider these three grades in charity, but God ought to be most especially loved for His own sake. For, there are some who freely, or without great vexation, are separated from the leisure of divine contemplation so that they are concerned with earthly affairs, and in these there is apparent either no charity, or very little. Some, however, so delight in the leisure of divine contemplation that they do not want to turn away from it even to apply their service to God to the salvation of their fellowmen. The highest degree, the third, are those who rise to the heights of charity so that even as they advance in divine contemplation, although they are very much delighted in it, serve God in order to save their fellowmen. This is the perfection meant by St. Paul (Rom. ix. 3), For I wished myself to be an anathema from Christ, i.e., separated from Him, for my brethren; and (Philip. i. 23-24), I desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ,... But to abide still in the flesh, is needful for you. This is the perfection proper to prelates, preachers, and all the other religious whose life is dedicated to looking after the salvation of others. This is what is meant by the angels on the ladder, in Jacob's dream, ascending through contemplation, but descending through the responsibility which they bear over the salvation of their neighbor (Gen. xxviii. 11-12). The status of church dignitaries, however, cannot become less perfect because of some who misuse this state and seek that position for the sake of temporal goods, as if not attracted to the delightfulness of contemplation; just as the disbelief of many does not destroy faith in God, as is said (Rom. iii. 27).

          <td>Ad septimum dicendum, quod in doctrina evangelica quaedam dicta sunt apostolis in persona omnium fidelium, ea scilicet quae pertinent ad necessitatem salutis; unde et Marc., XIII, 37, dicit: quod vobis dico, omnibus dico: vigilate; nam in vigilantia ibi intelligitur sollicitudo quam homo debet habere, ne imparatus inveniatur a Christo. Quaedam vero dicuntur apostolis quae pertinent ad perfectionem vitae, et ad praelati officium; et ad hoc extendi non potest, quod vobis dico, omnibus dico. Sciendum tamen, quod illa quae dixit dominus discipulis Luc., IX, 3: nihil in via tuleritis etc., secundum quod Augustinus exponit in Lib. de Consen. Evangelist., non pertinent ad perfectionem vitae, sed ad potestatem dignitatis apostolicae, per quam poterant, nihil secum ferentes, vivere de his quae ministrabantur ab his quibus Evangelium praedicabant: unde ibidem dicitur, quod dignus est operarius mercede sua, vel cibo suo, unde nec praeceptum fuit, nec consilium, sed concessio. Et propter hoc Paulus, qui secum necessaria deferebat, non utens hac concessione, supererogabat, quasi propriis stipendiis militans, ut patet I ad Cor., IX 7.
          <td>To the seventh, it must be said that in the teaching of the Gospels, certain things are said to the Apostles in the person of all the faithful, viz., those things which pertain to the necessity of salvation. Thus, it is written (Mark xiii. 37), What I say to you, I say to all: watch. By watch is meant that solicitude which man ought to have so that he will not be found unprepared by Christ. But other things are said to the Apostles which concern the perfection of this life and the duties of prelates, and these cannot be included in, What I say to you, I say to all. However, it should be understood that what the Lord said to His disciples (Luke ix. 3), Take nothing for your journey, etc., as Augustine has explained in the <i>De Consen. Evangelist.</i> , does not pertain to the perfection of life but to the power of apostolic dignity, through which the Apostles, while carrying nothing with them, were able to live on that which was provided for them by those to whom they preached the Gospel. Thus it was written in the same place (Luke x. 7), The labourer is worthy of his hire, i.e., of his food; but this was neither a precept nor a counsel, but a concession. Because of this, St. Paul who carried his necessities about with him, not using this concession, paid over and above, as if striving against his own wages. This is clear from 1 Cor. ix. 7.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad octavum dicendum, quod in homine sunt duo affectus; unus caritatis, quo anima desiderat esse cum Christo; alius autem naturalis, quo anima refugit separationem a corpore, qui adeo est homini naturalis, quod nec etiam Petro senectus abstulit, ut Augustinus dicit super Ioan. Ex coniunctione ergo horum duorum affectuum vellet anima sic coniungi Deo, quod non separaretur a corpore; secundum illud apostoli, II ad Corinth., V, 4: nolumus expoliari, sed supervestiri; ut absorbeatur quod mortale est a vita. Sed quia hoc est impossibile (quamdiu enim sumus in corpore, peregrinamur a domino); insurgit quaedam contrarietas inter praedictos affectus, et quanto caritas est perfectior, tanto sensibilius affectus caritatis vincit affectum naturae; et hoc ad perfectionem caritatis pertinet. Unde et apostolus ibidem subdit: audemus autem, et bonam voluntatem habemus, magis peregrinari a corpore; et praesentes esse ad dominum. Sed in his in quibus est caritas imperfecta, si tantum affectus caritatis vincat, ex repugnantia tamen naturalis affectus redditur insensibilis victoria caritatis. Quod ergo aperte et indubitanter, sive audacter, apostolus dicit: cupio dissolvi, et esse cum Christo, hoc perfectae caritatis est; sed quod qualitercumque, licet insensibiliter, praeferat anima fruitionem Dei unioni corporis, est de necessitate caritatis.
          <td>To the eighth, it must be said that there are two affections in man; the one of charity by which the soul desires to be with Christ; the other, however, a natural affection by which the soul resists the separation from the body—which is natural to man; for not even was the old man taken away from Peter, as Augustine says in <i>Super Joan. 2</i> . Thus, by uniting these two affections, the soul wishes to be united in such a way to God so that it would not be separated from the body. For this reason, the Apostle wrote (1I Cor. v. 4), We would not be unclothed, but clothed upon, that that which is mortal may be swallowed up by life. But since this is impossible, While we are in the body, we are absent from the Lord (2 Cor. v. 6), opposition arises among these mentioned affections, and the more perfect charity is, the more does the affection of charity sensibly overcome the affection of nature. This pertains to the perfection of charity. Whence the Apostle adds (1I Cor. v. 8), But we are confident, and have a good will to be absent rather from the body, and to be present with the Lord. But in those in whom charity is imperfect, if only the affection of charity conquers, then from the repugnance of the natural affection, the victory of charity is rendered imperceptible. Therefore the Apostle clearly, unhesitatingly, and even boldly said, I desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ (Philip. i. 23) ; this is perfect charity. It is from the necessity of charity that the soul prefers in any way, even imperceptibly, the enjoyment of God to the union with the body.

          <td>Ad nonum dicendum, quod ponere animam, id est, vitam praesentem, pro fratribus quodammodo est de necessitate caritatis, et quodammodo est de perfectione ipsius.

Sed hoc perfectae caritatis est ut etiam pro his in quibus proximo non tenetur, pro eo corporalem suam vitam periculis quis exponat.
          <td>To the ninth, it must be said that to give up your life, i.e., this present life for your brother is, in one way, from the necessity of charity, and in another way from the perfection of it. For, man ought to love his neighbor more than his own body. Therefore, in the case where one is bound to look after the salvation of his neighbor, he is also bound to expose his bodily life to dangers for the sake of that salvation. But this is perfect charity, that he also expose his bodily life to dangers for those to whom he is not bound as to a neighbor.

Unde perfectio caritatis non cadit eis sub voto, sed est eis ut finis, ad quem pervenire conantur per ea quae vovent.
          <td>To the twelfth, it must be said that no one promises perfect charity, but some promise a state of perfection which consists in those things which are ordered as means to the perfection of charity, such as poverty or fastings. They are not bound to all things of this kind, but only to those which they promise. Thus, the perfection of charity does not accrue to them by their vows, but it is as an end to which they attempt to arrive by means of what they vow.

But charity does not allow this, as Dionysius says, Divine love causes rapture, not allowing men to be' lovers of self. Likewise, the desire of money is the root of all evils, as St. Paul says (1 Tim. vi. 10). But neither does charity allow this, as Augustine says in the <i>LXXXIII Quaestionum</i> .

But charity is not deficient in this way because the human soul, which is its subject, is incorruptible. An accident fails in the second way through a defect of cause, as light fails in the air through an absence of the sun. But charity cannot fail in this way because its cause, which is God, is unfailing. An accident fails in a third way by a deficiency of its object, as paternity ceases through the death of a child. But neither is charity deficient in this way, because its object is the eternal good, which is God. In the fourth way, an accident fails through the action of its contrary agent, as the cold quality of water fails through the action of heat. But charity does not fail in this way because it is stronger than sin which is the agent acting against it, according to this (Cantic. viii. 6), Love is strong as death; and (Cant. viii. 7), Many waters cannot quench charity. Therefore charity can in no way fail in one who possesses it.

          <td><b>I answer.</b> It must be said that the Master wrote in Book I, dist. 17,24 that the charity in us is the Holy Spirit. But his intention was not to say that the very act of our love is the Holy Spirit, but rather that the Holy Spirit moves our soul to love God and neighbor; just as He moves our soul to the acts of the other virtues. But to the act of the other virtues, He moves the soul through certain habits of infused virtues, whereas to the act of love for God and neighbor He moves the soul without any habitual medium. Therefore, Peter's opinion was indeed true insofar as he maintained that the soul is moved by the Holy Spirit to love God and neighbor. However, it was imperfect in this respect that he did not posit in us a certain created habit by which the human will is perfected to the act of this kind of love. For, it is necessary that a habit of this kind be found in the soul, as was said above in Article I of this Question.

Prima quidem ex parte spiritus sancti moventis animam ad dilectionem Dei et proximi; et quantum ad hoc, necesse est dicere, quod motio spiritus sancti semper est efficax secundum suam intentionem. Operatur enim in anima spiritus sanctus dividens singulis prout vult, ut dicitur I Cor., XII; et ideo quibus spiritus sanctus pro suo arbitrio vult dare perseverantem divinae dilectionis motum, in his peccatum caritatem excludens esse non potest. Dico non posse ex parte virtutis motivae, quamvis possit ex parte vertibilitatis liberi arbitrii. Ista enim sunt beneficia Dei, quibus certissime liberantur, quicumque liberantur, ut Augustinus dicit in Lib. de Praedest. Sanctor. Quibusdam autem spiritus sanctus, pro suo arbitrio, dat quidem ut ad tempus moveantur motu dilectionis in Deum, non autem dat eis ut in hoc perseverent usque in finem, ut patet per Augustinum in Lib. de Corrept. et gratia.
          <td>There is, therefore, a four-fold consideration of charity that can be made. First, charity is considered on the part of the Holy Spirit moving the soul to the love of God and neighbor. In this regard, it is necessary to say that the movement of the Holy Spirit is always efficacious according to its own intention. For, the Holy Spirit operates in the soul, dividing to everyone according as he will, as is written (1 Cor. xii. 11). Therefore those to whom the Holy Spirit freely wishes to give a persevering movement of divine love, in them sin cannot drive out charity. This cannot be, I say, on the part of the moving power, although it is possible on the part of the indetermination of free choice. For, these are the gifts of God by which those who are liberated are most certainly liberated, as Augustine says in <i>De Praedestinatione Sanctorum</i> . For though the Holy Spirit freely gives to some that at times they might be moved to love God, He does not give in such manner that they might persevere to the end in that love, as is clear from St. Augustine in <i>De Correctione et Gratia</i> .
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secunda consideratio est de caritate secundum potestatem ipsius caritatis; et quantum ad hoc, nullus habens caritatem potest peccare, quantum est ex vi ipsius caritatis, sicut neque aliquis habens aliquam formam, ex vi illius formae potest operari contra formam illam; sicut calidum ex vi calidi non potest infrigidare, vel frigidum esse; potest tamen amittere calorem et infrigidari. Et secundum hoc loquitur Augustinus in Lib. de sermone domini in monte, exponens illud quod habetur Matth., VII, 18: non potest arbor bona fructus malos facere. Dicit enim, quod sicut potest fieri ut quod fuit nix, non sit, non autem ut nix sit calida; sic potest fieri ut qui malus fuit non sit malus, non tamen fieri potest ut malus bene faciat: et eadem ratio est de bono secundum quamcumque virtutem, quia nulla virtute aliquis male utitur.
          <td>Secondly, charity is considered according to the power of that charity. In this respect, no one who possesses charity can sin, in the sense of committing a sin by virtue of that charity; just as no one possessing any form can act contrary to that form by virtue of the form. For example, that which is warm, although it can lose heat and become cold, cannot become cold or be cold by virtue of its warmth. It was in this way that Augustine spoke in <i>De Sermone Domini in Monte</i> , explaining this text (Matt. vii. 18), A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit. For, he said that it can happen that what was snow is not now snow, but it does not happen that snow is warm. Thus, he who was evil is not now evil, but it cannot be that an evil man acts rightly. And concerning the good, this same reasoning applies to all the virtues, for no one uses virtue for evil.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Tertia consideratio est de caritate ex parte voluntatis, in quantum ei subiicitur ut materia formae. Ubi attendendum est, quod quando forma implet totam potentialitatem materiae, non potest remanere in materia potentia ad aliam formam; unde illam formam inamissibiliter habet, sicut patet de materia caelesti. Quaedam vero forma est quae non replet totam potentialitatem materiae, sed remanet potentia ad aliam formam; et tunc illa forma amissibiliter habetur ex parte materiae vel subiecti, sicut patet in formis elementarium corporum. Caritas autem implet potentialitatem sui subiecti, secundum quod suum subiectum reducit in actum dilectionis: et ideo in patria, ubi actu creatura rationalis diligit Deum ex toto corde suo, et nihil aliud diligit nisi actualiter referendo in Deum, caritas inamissibiliter habetur; in statu autem viae caritas non implet totam potentialitatem animae, quae non semper actualiter movetur in Deum, omnia in ipsum actuali intentione referens; et ideo caritas viae amissibiliter habetur, quantum est ex parte subiecti.
          <td>Thirdly, there is a consideration of charity from the side of the will insofar as the will is subjected to charity, as matter is to form. It must be noted that when form completes the entire potentiality of matter, the potency cannot remain in matter as potency to another form. Whence, it possesses that form in a manner such that it cannot be lost, as is evident with celestial matter. But there is a certain form which does not complete the entire potentiality of matter, but it remains in potency to another form. Then that form is possessed in such a manner that it can be lost on the part of matter, Le., on the subject; as is evident with the forms of the bodily elements. But charity completes the potentiality of its subject according as it reduces its subject to the act of love. Therefore in heaven, where the rational creature loves God in act with his whole heart, and loves nothing else except by referring it perfectly to God, charity is possessed in such a way that it is not lost. But in this present state of life, charity does not perfect all of the potentialities of the soul, and is not always perfectly directed to God because it must refer everything to Him by an actual intention. Therefore the charity of this life can be lost, considered on the part of the subject.

          <td>Quarta consideratio est de caritate ex parte subiecti, prout comparatur specialiter ad ipsam caritatem sicut potentia ad habitum. Ubi considerandum est, quod habitus virtutis inclinat hominem ad recte agendum, secundum quod per ipsam homo habet rectam aestimationem de fine; quia, ut dicitur in III Ethic., qualis unusquisque est, talis et finis videtur ei. Sicut enim gustus iudicat de sapore, secundum quod est affectus aliqua bona vel mala dispositione, ita id quod est conveniens homini secundum habitualem dispositionem sibi inhaerentem, bonam vel malam, aestimatur ab eo ut bonum; quod autem ab hoc discordat, aestimatur ut malum et repugnans; unde et apostolus dicit, I ad Cor., cap. II, 14, quod animalis homo non percipit ea quae sunt spiritus Dei. Contingit tamen quandoque, quod id quod videtur alicui secundum inclinationem habitus, non videatur ei secundum aliquid aliud; sicut luxurioso secundum inclinationem proprii habitus videtur bonum delectatio carnis, sed secundum rationis deliberationem, vel auctoritatem Scripturae, videtur ei contrarium; et ideo habens habitum luxuriae, ex hac aestimatione contra habitum quandoque agit, et similiter habens habitum virtutis quandoque agit contra inclinationem proprii habitus; quia aliquid ei aliter videtur secundum aliquem alium modum, puta per passionem, vel aliquam seductionem. Tunc ergo contra habitum caritatis nullus agere poterit, quia nullus potest habere aliam aestimationem de fine et obiecto caritatis quam secundum inclinationem caritatis; hoc autem erit in patria, ubi ipsa Dei essentia videbitur, quae est ipsa essentia bonitatis. Unde sicut nunc nullus potest aliquid velle nisi sub communi ratione boni, nec bonum sub ratione boni potest non amari, ita et tunc hoc bonum, quod est Deus, nullus poterit non amare. Et propter hoc, nullus videns Deum per essentiam, potest contra caritatem agere. Et inde est quod caritas patriae est inamissibilis.
          <td>The fourth consideration of charity is on the part of the subject according as it is compared in a special way to charity itself, as potency is compared to habit. It must be considered that the habit of virtue indines man to act rightly according as through it man has the right estimation of the end. For, as is said in Book III of the <i>Ethics</i> , according as a man is, such does the end seem to him. For example, just as taste judges flavor insofar as it is the affection for some good or bad disposition, so also that which is suitable to man according to a habitual disposition, inhering in him either as good or evil, is judged by him as a good; and what is not in accord with this is considered as evil and repugnant. Whence the Apostle says (1 Cor. ii. 14), The sensual man perceiveth not these things that are of the spirit of God. But it sometimes happens that that which seems to one to be according to the inclination of habit does not seem to him to be according to something else. For example, to one who has carnal delight, the delight of the flesh seems to be a good according to the inclination of his proper habit; but it seems to be contrary to the good according to the deliberation of reason or the text of Scripture. And because of this estimation, one who has the habit of carnal delight sometimes acts contrary to that habit. Likewise, one who has the habit of virtue sometimes acts contrary to the inclination of his proper habit; for a thing seems to him to be otherwise, according to some other mode, such as through passion or anything that entices him from the correct estimation. Therefore, no one will be able to act contrary to the habit of charity, because no one is able to have any judgment about the end and the object of charity other than that which he has according to the inclination of charity. This, however, will be in heaven where the very essence of God, which is the essence of goodness, will be seen. Thus, just as now no one can wish anything unless it be under the aspect of good, nor is any one able not to love the good as good; so also in the next life, no one will be able not to love this good, which is God. Because of this, no one who sees God in His essence can act against charity; and that is why the charity of heaven cannot be lost.

Ideo caritas viae potest amitti per peccatum mortale.
          <td>However, now our mind does not see that essence of divine goodness; it sees some of its effects which can seem either good or not-good, according to different considerations. For, the spiritual good appears as not-good to some insofar as it is contrary to their carnal delight, which concupiscence desires. Therefore the charity of this life can be lost through mortal sin.

Sed quandoque illud propositum mutatur, et sic dilectio quae vera fuit, amittitur. Si autem hoc aliquis habuisset in proposito, ut a diligendo quandoque desisteret, vera dilectio non fuisset. Unde patet, quod caritas inamissibilis est secundum potestatem propriam; amitti tamen potest secundum potestatem subiecti vertibilis.
          <td>To the third, it must be said that true love has an essential note that is never lost; for he who truly loves man has foremost in his soul that he will never diminish that love. But when this commitment in the soul is changed, that which was true love is lost. Further, if anyone would have this commitment that he would sometimes cease loving, his love would not be true. Whence it is clear that charity, considered according to its own power cannot be lost; but it can be lost because of the indeterminate power of the subject.

X, 5: qui diligit iniquitatem, odit animam suam; et hoc etiam philosophus dicit in IX Ethic. Et secundum hoc amor verus sui ipsius amittitur per peccatum contrarium, sicut et amor Dei.
          <td>To the sixth, it must be said that since there is in man a twofold nature, viz., the intellectual which is primary, and the sensitive which is lesser; he truly loves himself who loves himself for the good of reason. But when a man loves himself and wants sensual goods for himself which are contrary to the good of reason, he hates himself more than he loves himself, because it is written (Psalms x. 6), He that loveth iniquity hateth his own soul. And this the Philosopher also said in Book IX of the <i>Ethics</i> . According to this, true love of self is lost through the contrary sin; just as the love of God is also lost.

          <td>To the seventh, it must be said that charity excludes every movement of sin according to its own determination. For, it pertains to the essence of charity that it wishes not to desire concupiscibly, nor to love self inordinately. But sometimes the contrary happens because of the indetermination of free choice and the corruption of nature; thus the Apostle said (Rom. vii. 19), For the good which I will, I do not; but the evil which I will not, that I do.

          <td>Ad decimum dicendum, quod amissio ita se habet ad rem habitam sicut corruptio ad rem existentem. Unde sicut corruptio incipit a re existente, et terminatur in eius non esse, quia eius mutatio est de esse in non esse; ita etiam amissio, cum sit etiam mutatio de habere in non habere, incipit in habere, et terminatur in non habere, et ideo principium amissionis caritatis est quando caritas habetur; finis autem quando non habetur.
          <td>To the tenth, it must be said that a loss is related to the thing had, as corruption is related to the thing existing. Therefore, as corruption begins in an existing thing and terminates in its non-being ( <i>non-esse</i> ), because the change is from being ( <i>esse</i> ) to non-being ( <i>non-esse</i> ); so does a loss, since it is a change from having to non-having, begin in having and terminate in non-having. Therefore the beginning of the loss of charity is when charity is had; its end, however, is when charity is not had.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad undecimum dicendum, quod caritas aliquo modo desinit esse in anima secundum illa quatuor. Subiectum enim caritatis quamvis sit incorruptibile secundum substantiam, fit tamen indispositum ad hanc formam per contrariam dispositionem peccati. Similiter, quamvis causa caritatis sit incorruptibilis, tamen influxio huiusmodi causae impeditur per peccatum, quod dividit inter nos et Deum. Et ex hac etiam ratione ex parte obiecti deficit caritas, in quantum voluntas se avertit a bono incommutabili. Desinit etiam per contrarium motivum ad peccandum: quod licet, simpliciter loquendo, sit debilius quam caritas, tamen in casu potest esse fortius; quando scilicet caritas in actu non operatur, et motivum peccati movet in aliquo particulari opere, sicut etiam philosophus ostendit in VII Ethic., quod a passione potest vinci scientia, quamvis sit fortissima; in quantum non est in actu agens, sed in habitu ligato per passionem: et sicut scientia est fortissima in universali, passio autem in particulari operabili, ita caritas est fortissima circa finem ultimum; et motivum peccati habet fortitudinem in aliquo particulari opere.
          <td>To the eleventh, it must be said that charity ceases to exist in the soul in some way according to these four modes. For, the subject of charity, although it is incorruptible according to its substance, becomes indisposed to this form through the contrary disposition of sin. Likewise, although the cause of charity is incorruptible, the influence of this cause is impeded by sin which separates us from God. Also, charity fails on the part of its object insofar as the will diverts itself from the unchangeable good. Charity even fails through the contrary movement to sinning; for, essentially speaking, although sin is weaker than charity, in some instances sin can be stronger, viz., when charity is not operating in act and the movement of sin directs toward some other particular operation. The Philosopher also showed in Book VII of the <i>Ethics</i> , that science, although it is stronger, can be overcome by passion; this is considered insofar as the agent is not in act but is bound up in habit because of passion. For, just as science is strongest in the universal, passion however operates in the particular; so also charity is strongest when acting toward the final end, but it allows the movement of sin which has strength in some particular act.

          <td>Ad duodecimum dicendum, quod philosophus dicit, quod bonum unius virtutis non contrariatur bono alterius virtutis; et hoc intendit philosophus dicere in praedicamentis, et in II Ethic. Sed in naturis bonum contrariatur bono; utrumque enim contrariorum est quoddam bonum naturae. Bonum ergo quod movet appetitum ad peccandum, contrariatur bono divino quod est obiectum caritatis, in quantum in eo constituitur finis. Sic enim non est possibile esse nisi unum finem ultimum: sicut et in regno, in quo non potest esse nisi unus rex, contrariatur regi qui se regem facit secundum illud Ioan., XIX, 12: omnis qui se regem facit, contradicit Caesari.
          <td>To the twelfth, it must be said that the Philosopher did write that the good of one virtue is not contrary to the good of another, and this is what he intended to say in the <i>Praedicamentis</i> and in Book II of the <i>Ethics</i> . But in nature, one good is contrary to another, for each of the contraries is a certain good of nature. Therefore, the good which moves the appetite to sin is contrary to the divine good which is the object of charity, insofar as the end is found in the divine good. For there can be only one final end; just as in a kingdom, where there can be only one king, he who makes himself to be a king is contrary to the actual king, according to what is written (John xix. 12), Whosoever maketh himself a king, speaketh against Caesar.

          <td>Ad decimumtertium dicendum, quod caritas non expellitur a peccato sicut ab agente, sed sicut a contrario; unde ipsa superventio peccati est expulsio caritatis, sicut adventio lucis expulsio est tenebrarum: lux enim expellit tenebras in ipso suo fieri; sed motivum ad peccatum expellit secundum quod praeexistit in apprehensione animae.
          <td>To the thirteenth, it must be said that charity is not driven out by sin as by an agent, but as by its contrary. Thus, that intervening of sin is the expulsion of charity; just as the coming of light is the expulsion of darkness. For, the light drives out darkness by its own becoming; but a movement to sin drives out charity according as it pre-exists in the understanding of the soul.

          <td>Ad decimumquartum dicendum, quod quando homo in peccato mortali consistit, hoc quadam deliberatione rationis agitur, quia sine deliberato consensu non est peccatum mortale. Deliberatio autem quidam motus est tempore mensuratus, in cuius temporis ultimo instanti inest peccatum animae; sed ante illud ultimum instans, non est dare proximum in quo caritas insit; quia instantia non se habent consequenter, sed tempus est continuum; et ideo in toto tempore praecedenti quod terminatur ad ultimum instans, caritas inest animae, in cuius ultimo instanti post inest peccatum. Non ergo est dare ultimum instans in quo caritas insit, sed ultimum temporis, ut per philosophum patet in VIII Physic.
          <td>To the fourteenth, it must be said that when man stands in mortal sin, this is done by a certain deliberation of reason; for without a deliberating consent, there can be no mortal sin. But this deliberation is a measured movement of time in the last moment of which sin exists in the soul. But before that final instant, the nearest instant in which charity exists cannot be designated; because these moments are not regarded as moments following one another, for time is a continuum. Therefore in the entire time which precedes the moment that terminates in the final instant, charity exists in the soul; after the last instant of this time, sin exists. Thus it is not possible to designate the final instant in which charity exists, but the final time, as is shown by the Philosopher in Book VIII of the <i>Physics</i> .

          <td>To the fifteenth, it must be said that if the Master understood of charity that it is the charity of heaven, it is true that it is not lost, according to the proofs given above. But if he meant the charity of this life insofar as it is perfect, it is not true that it cannot be lost because of the mode of inhering in its subject, but only by virtue of the movement of the Holy Spirit; and thus it is said that those who were strengthened, were strengthened in this life.

Et per hunc modum intelligit, quod qui non permanet in sermone Christi, non est vere discipulus, quia perseverare ab eo efficaciter non didicit; potest tamen esse discipulus ad tempus quantum ad temporalem dilectionem Dei et proximi.
          <td>To the eighteenth, it must be said that, as Augustine says explaining this text (John x. 27), My sheep hear my voice and do not hear the voice of others, there is a certain voice of Christ which no one hears unless he be His sheep through a predetermination. This voice says, He who perseveres to the end will be saved. And in this way he understands that he who does not remain faithful to the words of Christ is not a true disciple, because he has not learned from Him to persevere effectively. However, he can be a temporary disciple when he loves God for a time and his neighbor.

Sed quando actu homo secundum caritatem non movetur, ingeritur quandoque motus contrarius peccati.
          <td>To the nineteenth, it must be said that as long as charity is actually dominant in man, man is not moved by a contrary motion, but he follows the movement of charity. Therefore the greatest remedy against sin is for man to return into his heart, converting it to the love of God. But when man is not moved in act according to charity, he is under pressure from the contrary movement of sin.

Accidentia autem et formae non subsistentes, non dicuntur entia quia ipsae habeant esse, sed quia eis aliquid est. Et ideo fieri et corrumpi non proprie est accidentium et formarum, sed subiectorum; puta, cum corpus aliquod fit album hoc est albedinem fieri, sicut aliquod corpus esse album, hoc est albedinem esse. Et eadem ratio est de corruptione; et ideo corruptibile et incorruptibile non attribuuntur per se accidenti, sed substantiae. Unde nihil prohibet caritatem viae et patriae esse eamdem numero, quamvis caritas viae sit amissibilis, caritas autem patriae sit inamissibilis.
          <td>To the twentieth, it must be said that to be corrupted and to be generated or to become, is proper to that which has being (esse); i.e., only a thing subsisting in its being ( <i>esse</i> ). But accidents and forms that are not subsisting are not called being because they have existence, but rather because by them something exists. Therefore, to become and to be corrupted are not proper to accidents and to forms, but to subjects. For example, when any thing becomes white, this is whiteness in becoming; just as for any thing to be white, is this existing whiteness. And the same reasoning holds for corruption. Therefore corruptible and incorruptible are not attributed directly to accidents, but only to substance. Whence, there is nothing that prevents the charity of this life and of heaven from being the same in number; although the charity here can be lost while the charity of heaven cannot be lost.

Sed ille qui caritatem amittit, penitus ruit, secundum illud apostoli, I Cor., XIII, 2: si caritatem non habeam, nihil sum. Ergo caritas non amittitur per unum peccatum mortale, quod quandoque subito fit.
          <td>1. For, Origen writes in I Periarch.,2 If a disgust for spiritual things ever takes one who has continually stayed in the highesrt and perfect state, I do not think that he is taken away or falls away suddenly; but he must fall away little by little and gradually. Thus, as it can sometimes happen, if one undergoes a slight fall and quickly recovers, it does not seem that he rushes to his complete downfall. But he who hast lost charity falls completely, according to this (1 Cor. xiii. 2), If I have not charity, I am nothing. Therefore charity is not lost through one mortal sin which sometimes happens suddenly.

          <td>Praeterea, Leo Papa dicit in sermone IX de passione, alloquens Petrum: vidit in te dominus non fidem victam, non dilectionem aversam, sed constantiam fuisse turbatam: abundavit fletus, ubi non defecit affectus, et fons caritatis lavit verba formidinis. Ergo dilectio caritatis non desiit in Petro propter actum peccati mortalis.
          <td>3. Moreover, Pope Leo the Great says in <i>Sermon IX De Passione</i> , when speaking of Peter, Our Lord saw in you not a conquered faith, not a reverted love, but a constancy shaken. Tears flowed in abundance where affection never failed, and the fount of charity washed away the words of dread. Therefore the love of charity was not lacking in Peter on account of that act of mortal sin.

          <td>Praeterea, caritas est fortior quam virtus acquisita. Sed virtus acquisita, non corrumpitur per unum actum peccati, sicut nec generatur; dicit enim philosophus, II Ethic., quod ex eisdem generatur virtus et corrumpitur. Ergo multo minus caritas amittitur per actum unius peccati mortalis.
          <td>4. Moreover, charity is stronger than acquired virtue. But acquired virtue is not corrupted by one act of sin; just as it is not generated by one act, for the Philosopher says in Book II of the <i>Ethics</i> , virtue is generated and corrupted from the same thing. Therefore much less is charity lost through the act of one mortal sin.

          <td>Praeterea, contrarium non expellitur nisi per suum contrarium. Habitus autem caritatis non opponitur actui peccati. Sed habitus non generatur per unum actum. Ergo caritas non amittitur per unum actum peccati.
          <td>5. Moreover, a thing is not driven out except by its contrary. But the habit of charity is not opposed to the act of sin. Now habit is not generated by one act. Therefore charity is not lost by one act of sin.

          <td>6. Moreover, just as faith is concerned with believing many things, so is charity concerned with loving many things out of charity. But he who does not believe in one article of faith does not on that account lose faith in the other articles.~ Therefore he who sins against one object that should be loved out of charity does not on this account lose charity toward the other objects of love. Thus charity is not lost by one mortal sin.

III, v. 17: qui habuerit substantiam huius mundi, et viderit fratrem suum necessitatem habentem, et clauserit viscera sua ab eo: quomodo caritas Dei manet in eo? Et sic videtur quod per peccatum omissionis aliquis caritatem amittat. Sed peccatum transgressionis non est minus quam peccatum omissionis. Ergo per quodcumque peccatum caritas tollitur.
          <td>On the contrary, it is written (1 John iii. 17), He that hath the substance of this world, and shall see his brother in need, and shall shut up his bowels from him: how doth the charity of God abide in him? Thus it seems that through a sin of omission one can lose charity. But a sin of transgression is no less than a sin of omission. Therefore charity is taken away by any sin.

          <td>Respondeo. Dicendum, quod absque omni dubio per quemlibet actum peccati mortalis habitus caritatis subtrahitur; non enim dicitur peccatum mortale, nisi quia per ipsum homo spiritualiter moritur, quod esse non potest praesente caritate, quae est animae vita. Similiter etiam per peccatum mortale fit homo dignus morte aeterna, secundum illud Rom. cap. VI, 23: stipendia peccati mors. Quicumque autem habet caritatem, habet meritum vitae aeternae: dominus enim dilectori suo promittit manifestationem sui ipsius, in quo vita aeterna consistit. Unde necesse est dicere, quod per quemlibet actum peccati mortalis homo caritatem amittit. Manifestum est enim quod in quolibet actu peccati mortalis fit aversio ab incommutabili bono, cui caritas unit; cui actus peccati mortalis opponitur.
          <td><b>I answer.</b> It must be said that, without doubt, the habit of charity is taken away by one act of mortal sin, for a sin is not called mortal unless men die spiritually by it; which cannot happen with charity which is the life of the soul. Likewise, man also becomes worthy of eternal death through mortal sin, according to this (Rom. vi. 23), The wages of sin is death. But whoever has charity is worthy of eternal life, for the Lord promised to those who love Him a manifestation of His own self in which vision eternal life consists. Whence it must be said that man loses charity through any act of mortal sin. For, it is clear that in each act of mortal sin there is a turning away from the immutable good to which charity unites us. The act of mortal sin is opposed to this charity.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed quia actus non directe contrariatur habitui, sed actui, posset alicui videri quod per actum peccati mortalis impediretur quidam oppositus caritatis actus, ita tamen quod non tolleretur habitus, sicut contingit in habitibus acquisitis; non enim aliquis amittit habitum virtutis gratuitae, si contra virtutem gratuitam agat.
          <td>Now, because act is not directly contrary to habit but to act, one could see that through the act of mortal sin the opposite act of charity would be hindered; however, not so that the habit would be taken away, as it happens in acquired habits. For, no one loses the virtue of generosity if he acts contrary to that virtue.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed de habitibus caritatis est aliter. Habitus enim caritatis non habet causam in subiecto, sed totaliter dependet a causa extrinseca: caritas enim infunditur in cordibus nostris per spiritum sanctum, qui datus est nobis, ut dicitur ad Rom. V, 5. Non autem sic Deus causat caritatem in anima, ut sit causa eius solum quantum ad fieri, et non quantum ad conservationem ipsius, sicut aedificator est causa domus solum quantum ad fieri, unde eo subtracto adhuc remanet domus; sed Deus est causa caritatis et gratiae in anima, et quantum ad fieri, et quantum ad conservationem, sicut sol est causa luminis in aere. Et ideo, sicut statim cessaret lumen in aere, si interponeretur aliquod obstaculum; ita statim cessat habitus caritatis in anima, quando anima se avertit a Deo per peccatum. Et hoc est quod Augustinus dicit, VIII super Gen. ad litteram: non ita Deus operatur hominem iustum, id est iustificando eum, ut si abscesserit, maneat in absente quod fecit; sed potius, sicut aer praesente lumine non factus est lucidus, sed fit; sic homo Deo sibi praesente illuminatur, absente autem continuo obtenebratur.
          <td>This is not the case concerning the habit of charity. For, the habit of charity does not have a cause in the subject, but entirely depends on an extrinsic cause; for the charity of God is poured forth in our hearts, by the Holy Spirit, Who is given to us, as is written (Rom. v. 5). However, God does not cause charity in our soul so that He is the cause only of its becoming and not of its preservation; as the builder is the cause of a house only in its becoming, and when he is taken away, the house still remains. God, however, is the cause of charity and of grace in the soul both as regards their becoming and their preservation; just as the sun is the cause of light in the air. Therefore, just as light in the air immediately ceases if some obstacle is placed in the way, so does the habit of charity immediately cease in the soul when the soul turns itself away from God through sin. This is what Augustine says in Book VIII of <b>Super Gen. ad Litteram</b> , God does not operate in a lust man thus (that is, by justifying him), so that if He would depart, that which He effected would remain in His absence. Rather, lust as the air has not made itself lucid but becomes so in the presence of light, so man is illuminated when God is present to him; but he continues in darkness when God is absent.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad primum ergo dicendum, quod verbum illud Origenis sic posset intelligi, quod homo qui est in statu perfecto, non subito procedit in actum peccati mortalis, sed per aliquam negligentiam praecedentem. Sed quia ipse subdit: si aliquis brevis lapsus acciderit etc., videtur melius dicendum, quod ipse intelligit, eum penitus evacuare et decidere, qui sic decidit, ut ex malitia peccet, quod non statim a principio contingit; quia etiam, ut philosophus dicit in I Ethic., non est facile iusto ut opus iniustum operetur statim, sicut iniustus facit, scilicet ex electione. Amittit ergo caritatem per unum actum peccati mortalis, sed adhuc aliquae reliquiae de praecedenti perfectione remanent, dum non habet ex malitia quod caritatem amittat.
          <td>To the first, it must be said that this saying of Origen can be understood in this way, that a man who is in a perfect state does not suddenly fall into the act of mortal sin, but does so through some previous negligence. But because he adds, If one undergoes a slight fall, etc., it seems better to say that he understood one who completely falls away falls so that he sins by malice, which fall does not come about suddenly. For, as the Philosopher says in Book I of the <i>Ethics</i> , it is not easy for a just man to perform unjust works suddenly as an unjust man does them, viz., by choice. Therefore one loses charity through one act of mortal sin, but some of the previous perfection remains if he has not lost charity out of malice.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad secundum dicendum, quod caritas amittitur dupliciter; uno modo directe, alio modo indirecte. Directe quidem per actualem Dei contemptum, sicut accidit in illis qui dicunt Deo, Iob XXI, 14: recede a nobis; scientiam viarum tuarum nolumus sicut dicitur Iob XII, 14. Alio modo indirecte; sicut non cogitans de Deo, propter aliquam passionem timoris vel concupiscentiae consentit in aliquid quod est contra Dei praeceptum, et sic per consequens caritatem amittit. Intendit ergo Bernardus dicere, quod caritas non fuit extincta in Petro per modum primum, sed amisit eam per modum secundum, et hoc nominat soporem. Et similiter sunt intelligenda verba Leonis Papae: quod patet ex hoc quod subiungit: non tardatum est remedium ablutionis, ubi non fuit iudicium voluntatis; magis enim negatio Petri fuit extorta ex terrore, quam ipse negaverit ex iudicio deliberatae voluntatis.
          <td>To the second, it must be said that charity is lost in two ways; directly and indirectly. It is lost directly through an actual contempt for God, as happens with those who say to God (Job xxi. 14), Depart from us, we desire not the knowledge of thy ways. In another way, it is lost indirectly; just as one who is not thinking of God, consents to something that is against the law of God on account of some passion of fear or of concupiscence, and as a consequence loses charity. Therefore Bernard intended to say that charity was not extinct in Peter according to the first manner; but Peter lost it according to the second manner, and therefore Bernard calls it inactive. In the same way, the words of Leo should be understood, and this is clear from what he further adds, The cleansing remedy will not be far away where there was no judgment of the will; for the denial of Peter was driven by fear more than by a deliberate judgment of the will.

          <td>Ad quartum dicendum, quod virtus acquisita habet causam in subiecto, et non totaliter ab extrinseco, sicut caritas; et ideo non est similis ratio.
          <td>To the fourth, it must be said that an acquired virtue has its cause in the subject and is not entirely extrinsic, as is true of charity. Therefore the comparison between acquired virtue and charity cannot be made.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad quintum dicendum, quod in contrariis potest expelli unum contrarium, sine hoc quod alterum adveniat. Habitus autem virtutis et vitii sunt contraria mediata; unde philosophus dicit in praedicamentis, quod inter bonum et malum est medium; unde non oportet quod solum tunc amittat homo habitum unius virtutis, quando generatur in eo habitus contrarii vitii.
          <td>To the fifth, it must be said that in contraries, one contrary can be driven out without the other contrary coming in. But the habits of virtue and vice are mediated contraries; whence the Philosopher says in the <i>Praedicamentis</i> , there is a medium between good and evil. Whence it is not necessary to say that a man loses the habit of one virtue only when the habit of the contrary vice is generated in him.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad sextum dicendum, quod habitus respicit, per se, formalem rationem obiecti magis quam ipsum obiectum materialiter; et ideo, si formalis ratio obiecti tollatur, species habitus non manet. Formalis autem ratio obiecti in fide est veritas prima, per doctrinam Ecclesiae manifestata, sicut formalis ratio scientiae est medium demonstrationis: et ideo, sicut aliquis memorialiter tenens conclusiones geometricas, non habet geometriae scientiam, si non propter media geometriae eis assentiatur, sed habebit conclusiones illas tamquam opinatas: ita, qui tenet ea quae sunt fidei, et non assentit eis propter auctoritatem Catholicae doctrinae, non habet habitum fidei. Qui autem propter doctrinam Catholicam alicui assentit, omnibus assentit quae doctrina Catholica habet: alioquin magis credit sibi quam Ecclesiae doctrinae. Ex quo patet, quod qui deficit in uno articulo pertinaciter, non habet fidem de aliis articulis: illam dico fidem quae est habitus infusus; sed oportet quod teneat ea quae sunt fidei, quasi opinata.
          <td>To the sixth, it must be said that a habit, of itself, regards the formal notion of its object more than the material notion of the object; therefore if the formal notion (ratio) of the object is taken away, the species of habit does not remain. However, the formal notion in the object of faith is the first truth manifested through the teaching of the Church; just as the formal notion of science is the medium of demonstration. Therefore, just as one who remembers the conclusions of geometry does not have the science of geometry if he does not assent to these conclusions because of the reasons of geometry, but he holds these conclusions only as opinion; so also one who holds those things which are of faith but does not assent to them because of the authority of Catholic teaching, does not have the habit of faith. For, he who asserts to anything because of Catholic teaching assents to all those things which that teaching contains. Otherwise, he would believe himself more than the teaching of the Church. From this it is clear that he who obstinately denies one article of faith does not have faith in the other articles—that faith, I say, which is an infused habit, for he holds the conclusions of faith as opinion.
