                        Everything that is in motion must be moved by something.
                        For if it has not the source of its motion in itself it
                        is evident that it is moved by something other than
                        itself, for there must be something else that moves it.
                        If on the other hand it has the source of its motion in
                        itself, let AB be taken to represent that which is in
                        motion essentially of itself and not in virtue of the
                        fact that something belonging to it is in motion. Now in
                        the first place to assume that Ab, because it is in
                        motion as a whole and is not moved by anything external
                        to itself, is therefore moved by itself—this is just as
                        if, supposing that KL is moving LM and is also itself in
                        motion, we were to deny that KM is moved by anything on
                        the ground that it is not evident which is the part that
                        is moving it and which the part that is moved.

                            In the second place that which is in motion without
                            being moved by anything does not necessarily cease
                            from its motion because something else is at rest,
                            but a thing must be moved by something if the fact
                            of something else having ceased from its motion
                            causes it to be at rest. Thus, if this is accepted,
                            everything that is in motion must be moved by
                            something. For AB, which has been taken to represent
                            that which is in motion, must be divisible since
                            everything that is in motion is divisible. Let it be
                            divided, then, at G. Now if GB is not in motion,
                            then AB will not be in motion: for if it is, it is
                            clear that AG would be in motion while BG is at
                            rest, and thus AB cannot be in motion essentially
                            and primarily. But ex hypothesi AB is in motion
                            essentially and primarily. Therefore if GB is not in
                            motion AB will be at rest. But we have agreed that
                            that which is at rest if something else is not in
                            motion must be moved by something. Consequently,
                            everything that is in motion must be moved by
                            something: for that which is in motion will always
                            be divisible, and if a part of it is not in motion
                            the whole must be at rest.

              884. After discussing motion in itself, and the concomitants of
              motion, and the division of motion into parts, in the preceding
              books, the Philosopher now begins to treat of motion in its
              relationship to movers and things moved, i.e., the mobiles. The
              treatment falls into two parts; In the first he shows that there
              is a first motion and a first mover; In the second he investigates
              the properties of the first motion and of the first mover, in Book
              VIII.

                  The first part is divided into two sections: In the first he
                  shows that there is a first motion and a first mover. And
                  because things that belong to one order are mutually related,
                  therefore in the second part he compares the various types of
                  motion (L-7).

                      Secondly, he proves the proposition (L. 2). Thirdly, he
                      proves something he took for granted (L. 3)

                          Proponit ergo primo quod necesse est omne quod
                          movetur, ab aliquo alio moveri. Quod quidem in
                          aliquibus est manifestum. Sunt enim quaedam quae non
                          habent in seipsis principium sui motus, sed principium
                          motus ipsorum est ab extrinseco, sicut in his quae per
                          violentiam moventur. Si ergo aliquid sit quod non
                          habeat in seipso principium sui motus, sed principium
                          sui motus est ab extrinseco, manifestum est quod ab
                          alio movetur. Si vero sit aliquod mobile quod habeat
                          in seipso principium sui motus, circa hoc potest esse
                          dubium an ab alio moveatur. Et ideo circa hoc instat,

                          oportet autem, si aliquid movet seipsum non motum ab
                          altero, quod sit primo et per se motum; sicut si
                          aliquid est calidum non ab alio, oportet quod sit
                          primo et per se calidum.

                          885. He proposes therefore first (676) that everything
                          that is being moved is necessarily being moved by some
                          other. In some cases this is indeed evident, for there
                          are some things which do not possess in themselves the
                          principle of their motion; rather the principle of
                          their motion is from without, as in things which are
                          being moved by compulsion. Therefore, if there is
                          anything that does not have in itself the principle of
                          its own motion but its principle of motion is from
                          without, it is clear that it is being moved by some
                          other. However, if there is a mobile which does have
                          in itself the principle of its own motion, there could
                          be doubt whether it too is being moved by some other.
                          Accordingly, he devotes himself to showing that this
                          type of mobile is being moved by some other.
                          Therefore, if it is supposed that such a mobile is not
                          being moved by some other, let AB be a mobile capable
                          of being moved primarily and according to itself and
                          not in the sense that some part of it is being moved;
                          for then it would not be being moved according to
                          itself, but according to a part. Now it is necessary
                          that if something moves itself without having been
                          moved by some other, that it be moved primarily and
                          <i>per se</i>; for example, if something is hot not
                          from some other source, it must be primarily and
                          <i>per se</i> hot.

                              Hoc ergo dato, procedit ad propositum ostendendum
                              dupliciter: primo quidem excludendo illud, unde
                              maxime videri posset quod aliquid non ab alio
                              moveatur; secundo directe ostendendo quod nihil
                              potest a seipso moveri, ibi: amplius quod a seipso
                              movetur et cetera.

                              With this in mind, he proceeds to prove his
                              proposition in two ways: First by excluding the
                              most evident case in which it would appear that
                              something is not being moved by some other;
                              Secondly, by proving directly that nothing can be
                              moved by itself, at 886.

                                  The most evident reason why it seems that
                                  something is not being moved by some other is
                                  that it is not being moved by something
                                  outside itself but by an intrinsic principle.

                                      He says therefore first (676 bis) that to
                                      believe that AB is being moved by itself
                                      because the whole is being moved, and this
                                      without being moved by anything outside of
                                      it, is like saying that, when one part of
                                      a whole is being moved and another part
                                      causes it to be moved, it is moving
                                      itself, because it is not evident which
                                      part is the mover and which is being
                                      moved. Such would be the case if a mobile
                                      DEZ is such that one part DE moves the
                                      part EZ and it is not seen which part
                                      moves the other, and which is being moved.

                                          When he speaks of the first mobile AB
                                          as being moved as a whole by an
                                          intrinsic principle of motion, he
                                          means a living body which is, as a
                                          whole, being moved by the soul; but
                                          when he speaks of the mobile DEZ he
                                          means some body that is not being
                                          moved as a whole but one bodily part
                                          of it is the mover and another the
                                          moved. In this latter case, it is
                                          evident that what is being moved is
                                          being moved by some other. From this
                                          latter case he wants to prove of a
                                          living body that seems to move itself
                                          that it too is being moved by some
                                          other. For it seems to move itself
                                          inasmuch as one part moves another,
                                          i.e., as the soul moves the body, as
                                          will be more fully explained in Book
                                          VIII.

                                              886. Then at (677) he proves
                                              directly that whatever is being
                                              moved is being moved by some
                                              other. This is his argument:
                                              Nothing that is being moved by
                                              itself rests from its motion on
                                              account of some other mobile’s
                                              resting. (He takes this as
                                              <i>per se</i> evident). From this
                                              he further concludes that if a
                                              mobile rests on account of the
                                              rest of another, then the mobile
                                              is moved by another. On this
                                              ground he concludes that.
                                              necessarily whatever is being
                                              moved is being moved by some
                                              other. And that this follows from
                                              the premises, he now proves.

                                                  That mobile which we have
                                                  supposed as being moved by
                                                  itself, i.e., ABI must be
                                                  divisible, for whatever is
                                                  being moved is divisible, as
                                                  was proved above. Hence,
                                                  because it is divisible,
                                                  nothing prevents it from being
                                                  divided. Therefore, let it be
                                                  divided at the point C so that
                                                  one part of it is PC and the
                                                  other part AC. Now, if PC is
                                                  part, of AB, then when the
                                                  part BC rests, the entire AB
                                                  must rest. But if upon the
                                                  part resting, the whole does
                                                  not rest, let us grant that
                                                  the whole is being moved and
                                                  one part is at rest. But
                                                  because we have assumed that
                                                  one part is resting, the whole
                                                  could not be granted as being
                                                  moved except by reason of the
                                                  other part. Therefore, when BC
                                                  (which is one part) is at
                                                  rest, the other part AC is
                                                  being moved. But no whole of
                                                  which one part only is being
                                                  moved is being moved primarily
                                                  and se. Therefore AB is not
                                                  being moved primarily and
                                                  <i>per se</i>, as we
                                                  originally assumed. Therefore
                                                  while BC is at rest, the
                                                  entire AB must be at rest.
                                                  Thus, what is being moved
                                                  ceases to be moved upon the
                                                  occasion of something else
                                                  resting. But above we held
                                                  that if something rests and
                                                  ceases to be moved on the
                                                  occasion of another’s resting,
                                                  it is being moved by that
                                                  other. Therefore, AB is being
                                                  moved by some other.

                        Since everything that is in motion must be moved by
                        something, let us take the case in which a thing is in
                        locomotion and is moved by something that is itself in
                        motion, and that again is moved by something else that
                        is in motion, and that by something else, and so on
                        continually: then the series cannot go on to infinity,
                        but there must be some first movent. For let us suppose
                        that this is not so and take the series to be infinite.
                        Let A then be moved by B, B by G, G by D, and so on,
                        each member of the series being moved by that which
                        comes next to it. Then since ex hypothesi the movent
                        while causing motion is also itself in motion, and the
                        motion of the moved and the motion of the movent must
                        proceed simultaneously (for the movent is causing motion
                        and the moved is being moved simultaneously) it is
                        evident that the respective motions of A, B, G, and each
                        of the other moved movents are simultaneous. Let us take
                        the motion of each separately and let E be the motion of
                        A, Z of B, and H and O respectively the motions of G and
                        D: for though they are all moved severally one by
                        another, yet we may still take the motion of each as
                        numerically one, since every motion is from something to
                        something and is not infinite in respect of its extreme
                        points. By a motion that is numerically one I mean a
                        motion that proceeds from something numerically one and
                        the same to something numerically one and the same in a
                        period of time numerically one and the same: for a
                        motion may be the same generically, specifically, or
                        numerically: it is generically the same if it belongs to
                        the same category, e.g. substance or quality: it is
                        specifically the same if it proceeds from something
                        specifically the same to something specifically the
                        same, e.g. from white to black or from good to bad,
                        which is not of a kind specifically distinct: it is
                        numerically the same if it proceeds from something
                        numerically one to something numerically one in the same
                        period of time, e.g. from a particular white to a
                        particular black, or from a particular place to a
                        particular place, in a particular period of time: for if
                        the period of time were not one and the same, the motion
                        would no longer be numerically one though it would still
                        be specifically one. We have dealt with this question
                        above. Now let us further take the time in which A has
                        completed its motion, and let it be represented by K.
                        Then since the motion of A is finite the time will also
                        be finite. But since the movents and the things moved
                        are infinite, the motion EZHO, i.e. the motion that is
                        composed of all the individual motions, must be
                        infinite. For the motions of A, B, and the others may be
                        equal, or the motions of the others may be greater: but
                        assuming what is conceivable, we find that whether they
                        are equal or some are greater, in both cases the whole
                        motion is infinite. And since the motion of A and that
                        of each of the others are simultaneous, the whole motion
                        must occupy the same time as the motion of A: but the
                        time occupied by the motion of A is finite: consequently
                        the motion will be infinite in a finite time, which is
                        impossible.

                            It might be thought that what we set out to prove
                            has thus been shown, but our argument so far does
                            not prove it, because it does not yet prove that
                            anything impossible results from the contrary
                            supposition: for in a finite time there may be an
                            infinite motion, though not of one thing, but of
                            many: and in the case that we are considering this
                            is so: for each thing accomplishes its own motion,

                                But if (as we see to be universally the case)
                                that which primarily is moved locally and
                                corporeally must be either in contact with or

                                all form a single unity: whether this unity is
                                finite or infinite makes no difference to our
                                present argument; for in any case since the
                                things in motion are infinite in number the
                                whole motion will be infinite, if, as is
                                theoretically possible, each motion is either
                                equal to or greater than that which follows it
                                in the series: for we shall take as actual that
                                which is theoretically possible. If, then, A, B,
                                G, D form an infinite magnitude that passes
                                through the motion EZHO in the finite time K,
                                this involves the conclusion that an infinite
                                motion is passed through in a finite time: and
                                whether the magnitude in question is finite or
                                infinite this is in either case impossible.
                                Therefore the series must come to an end, and
                                there must be a first movent and a first moved:
                                for the fact that this impossibility results
                                only from the assumption of a particular case is
                                immaterial, since the case assumed is
                                theoretically possible, and the assumption of a
                                theoretically possible case ought not to give
                                rise to any impossible result.

              the Philosopher now turns to the proof of his main proposition,
              namely, that there exists a first motion and a first mover. About
              this he does two things: First he proposes what he intends;
              Secondly, he proves his proposition, at 892.

                  for all cases that whatever is moved is moved by some other,
                  it must be true even in regard to local motion that whatever
                  is being moved with respect to place is being moved by
                  something else. Now he applies to local motion in particular
                  the very proposition which he proved universally true, because
                  local motion is the first of the motions, as will be proved in
                  Book VIII. Therefore, it is according to this motion that he
                  now proceeds to demonstrate a first mover.

                      Therefore, let us take something that is being moved in
                      regard to place. This thing is being moved by something
                      else. Now that something else is in turn being moved by
                      something else or it is riot. If it, is not, we have the
                      proposition clinched; namely, that there exists a mover
                      that is immovable, which is a property of the first mover.
                      But if that something else is also being moved by
                      something other, this other is being moved by still
                      another which is itself being moved by yet another mover.
                      This, however, cannot go on <i>ad infinitum</i>, but a
                      halt must be made at some mover. Therefore, there will be
                      a first mover which will be the first cause of the motion,
                      and of such a nature that it is itself not being moved but
                      moves the others.

                          gives the proof; Secondly, he shows that the proof he
                          gives is insufficient, at 893; Thirdly, he supplies

                              movers and moved is involved. And he shows that

                                  in respect of place and let it be moved by B;
                                  let B be moved by C, and C by D, and so on ad
                                  infinitum in ascending order. Now it is
                                  evident that, when something moves by virtue
                                  of the fact that it is itself being moved by
                                  another, then both the mover and the mobile
                                  are being moved simultaneously, just as, when
                                  the hand by its motion moves a stick, the hand
                                  and the stick are moved at one and the same
                                  time. Therefore, B is being moved

                                  with C. Therefore, the motion of A and that of
                                  all the others exist together and at the same
                                  time. And we could have considered one by one
                                  each of these infinite motions. Likewise,
                                  although each one of these mobiles is being
                                  moved by some mover—not in the sense that one
                                  is being moved by all, but one by
                                  another—nevertheless, even though there be an
                                  infinitude of movers and mobiles, yet the
                                  motion of each of the mobiles is numerically
                                  one motion. And although all the motions are
                                  infinite in number, they are not infinite in a
                                  privative sense, i.e., as though lacking a
                                  boundary, but the motion of each mobile is
                                  finite and has its own definite boundaries.

                                                      call it Z, and let the

                                                      the others following be
                                                      called IT. Also let the
                                                      time in which A is being
                                                      moved be K. Now, since the
                                                      motion of A is finite,
                                                      then the time K of that
                                                      motion is definite and not
                                                      infinite, because we
                                                      showed in Book VI that the
                                                      finite in time corresponds
                                                      to a finite in motion and
                                                      an infinite in time
                                                      corresponds to an infinite
                                                      in motion. From what we
                                                      have said, however, it is
                                                      clear that in the very
                                                      same time that A is being
                                                      moved, B is being moved,
                                                      and so for all the others;
                                                      hence the motion of all,
                                                      i.e., the motion EZIT,
                                                      occurs in finite time. But
                                                      this motion is infinite,
                                                      since it is the motion of
                                                      an infinite number.
                                                      Therefore it will follow
                                                      that an infinite motion
                                                      occurs in finite time,
                                                      which is impossible. Now
                                                      why does our conclusion

                                                          follow that an
                                                          infinite motion occurs
                                                          in finite time—since
                                                          each of the mobiles
                                                          must have a finite

                                                          slowness. However, it
                                                          is impossible for an
                                                          infinite motion to

                            that which causes alteration, and that which causes
                            increase or decrease. Let us begin with locomotion,
                            for this is the primary motion.

                                    reducible to these.

                                            (cf. 1824) throwing when the movent
                                            causes a motion away from itself
                                            more violent than the natural
                                            locomotion of the thing moved, which

                                            pulling: pushing apart is pushing
                                            off, which may be a motion either
                                            away from the pusher or away from
                                            something else, while pushing
                                            together is pulling, which may be a

                                            well as the puller. We may similarly

                                                processes of combination and
                                                separation (they will all be

                                                except such as are involved in
                                                the processes of becoming and

                                                kind of motion but combination
                                                and separation: for they may all

                                                Again, inhaling is a form of
                                                pulling, exhaling a form of
                                                pushing: and the same is true of
                                                spitting and of all other
                                                motions that proceed through the
                                                body, whether secretive or
                                                assimilative, the assimilative
                                                being forms of pulling, the
                                                secretive of pushing off. All
                                                other kinds of locomotion must
                                                be similarly reduced, for they
                                                all fall under one or other of
                                                our four heads. And again, of
                                                these four, carrying and
                                                twirling are to pulling and
                                                pushing. For carrying always
                                                follows one of the other three
                                                methods, for that which is
                                                carried is in motion
                                                accidentally, because it is in
                                                or upon something that is in
                                                motion, and that which carries
                                                it is in doing so being either
                                                pulled or pushed or twirled;
                                                thus carrying belongs to all the
                                                other three kinds of motion in
                                                common.

              897. In the previous demonstration the Philosopher had assumed
              that a mover is continuous, or at least contiguous, with the
              mobile. This he now intends to prove. First he proves his
              proposition; Secondly, he proves something he had assumed in his
              proof, (L. 4)

                  About the first he does two things: First he states his
                  intention; Secondly, he proves his proposition, at 898.

                      Dicit ergo primo, quod movens et motum sunt simul. Sed
                      aliquid dicitur movere dupliciter. Uno modo sicut finis
                      movet agentem; et tale movens aliquando distans est ab
                      agente quem movet: alio modo sicut movet id quod est

                      He says therefore first (682) that mover and moved are
                      together. But something is said to be “moved” in two
                      senses. In one sense as the end moves the agent, and such
                      a mover is sometimes distant from the agent it moves; in
                      another sense as that moves which is the actual beginner
                      of the motion. It is of this latter that Aristotle speaks,
                      and that is why he adds “not as that for the sake of
                      which, but as that from which the source of motion is.”

                          Item movens sicut principium motus, quoddam est
                          immediatum, et quoddam remotum. Intelligit autem hic
                          de immediate movente, et ideo dixit primum movens; ut
                          per primum significetur immediatum mobili, non autem
                          id quod est primum in ordine moventium.

                          Again, a mover as principle of motion can be immediate
                          or remote. Aristotle speaks of what causes motion
                          immediately and calls it the “first mover” which
                          refers not to what is first in the series of movers
                          but to a mover that is immediate to the mobile.

                              dicit quod movens et motum simul sunt, quod quando
                              unum corpus movetur ab altero, quod oporteat ambo

                              continua sunt simul, quia termini eorum sunt
                              simul, vel quia sunt unum.

                              And because in Book V he had said that things in
                              the same place are together, one might, conclude
                              from that and from the statement that mover and
                              moved are together, that when one body is moved by
                              another they must both be in the same place.
                              Therefore, to prevent this misunderstanding, he
                              adds that “together” is not taken here in the
                              sense of being in the same place, but in the sense
                              that nothing is intermediate between the mover and
                              the moved. It is in this sense that things in
                              contact, or things that are continuous are
                              together, because their extremities are together
                              or are one and the same.

                                  proceeded solely along the line of local
                                  motion, this does not mean that his
                                  proposition is true only in cases of local
                                  motion. Therefore, to exclude this possible
                                  misunderstanding, he adds that the statement
                                  “mover and moved are together” must be taken
                                  in a sense common to all motions, for it is
                                  found in every kind of motion that mover and
                                  moved are together, in the sense explained.

                                          He says therefore first (683) that
                                          there are three kinds of motion: one
                                          is in respect to place and is called
                                          “local motion”; one is in respect of
                                          quantity and is called “growth and
                                          decrease; the third is in respect of
                                          quality and is called “alteration.” He
                                          makes no mention of generation and
                                          ceasing to-be, because they are not
                                          motions, as was explained in Book V.
                                          However, since generation and
                                          ceasing-to-be are the termini of a
                                          motion, i.e., of alteration, as was
                                          proved in Book VI, then if he proves

                                              are together, as will be shown for
                                              each case. But first it must be
                                              proved for local motion: which is

                                                          <i>per se</i>, i.e.,
                                                          so that the whole
                                                          moves itself according

                                                          itself. But if it be

                                                          both ways, it is clear
                                                          that the mover will be
                                                          in what is being
                                                          moved, either in the
                                                          way that a same thing
                                                          is in itself, or as a
                                                          part is in a whole, as

                                                          animal. Thus it will
                                                          follow that the mover

                            For our assumption is that things that are
                            undergoing alteration are altered in virtue of their
                            being affected in respect of their so-called
                            affective qualities, since that which is of a
                            certain quality is altered in so far as it is
                            sensible, and the characteristics in which bodies
                            differ from one another are sensible
                            characteristics: for every body differs from another
                            in possessing a greater or lesser number of sensible
                            characteristics or in possessing the same sensible
                            characteristics in a greater or lesser degree. But
                            the alteration of that which undergoes alteration is
                            also caused by the above-mentioned characteristics,
                            which are affections of some particular underlying
                            quality. Thus we say that a thing is altered by
                            becoming hot or sweet or thick or dry or white: and
                            we make these assertions alike of what is inanimate
                            and of what is animate, and further, where animate
                            things are in question, we make them both of the
                            parts that have no power of sense-perception and of
                            the senses themselves. For in a way even the senses
                            undergo alteration, since the active sense is a
                            motion through the body in the course of which the
                            sense is affected in a certain way. We see, then,
                            that the animate is capable of every kind of
                            alteration of which the inanimate is capable: but
                            the inanimate is not capable of every kind of
                            alteration of which the animate is capable, since it
                            is not capable of alteration in respect of the
                            senses: moreover the inanimate is unconscious of
                            being affected by alteration, whereas the animate is
                            conscious of it, though there is nothing to prevent
                            the animate also being unconscious of it when the
                            process of the alteration does not concern the
                            senses. Since, then, the alteration of that which
                            undergoes alteration is caused by sensible things,
                            in every case of such alteration it is evident that
                            the respective extremities of that which causes and
                            that which undergoes alteration are adjacent.

                                Thus the air is continuous with that which
                                causes the alteration, and the body that
                                undergoes alteration is continuous with the air.
                                Again, the colour is continuous with the light
                                and the light with the sight. And the same is
                                true of hearing and smelling: for the primary
                                movent in respect to the moved is the air.
                                Similarly, in the case of tasting, the flavour
                                is adjacent to the sense of taste. And it is
                                just the same in the case of things that are
                                inanimate and incapable of sense-perception.
                                Thus there can be nothing intermediate between
                                that which undergoes and that which causes
                                alteration.

                                    intermediate between that which suffers and
                                    that which causes increase: for the part of
                                    the latter that starts the increase does so
                                    by becoming attached in such a way to the
                                    former that the whole becomes one. Again,
                                    the decrease of that which suffers decrease
                                    is caused by a part of the thing becoming
                                    detached. So that which causes increase and
                                    that which causes decrease must be
                                    continuous with that which suffers increase
                                    and that which suffers decrease
                                    respectively: and if two things are
                                    continuous with one another there can be
                                    nothing intermediate between them.

              909. After showing that the mover and moved are together in local
              motion, he shows the same for alteration, i.e., that there is
              nothing between the thing altered and the cause of the alteration.
              This he proves first by induction at (693). For in all things that
              are altered, it is clear that the last thing altering, and the
              first thing altered, are together. However this seems to suggest a
              difficulty in certain alterations, e.g. when the sun heats the air
              without heating the intermediate orbs of the planets, or when a
              certain kind of fish held in a net shocks the hand of the one
              holding the net without shocking the net.

                  Sed dicendum est quod passiva recipiunt actionem activorum
                  secundum proprium modum; et ideo media quae sunt inter primum
                  alterans et ultimum alteratum, aliquid patiuntur a primo
                  alterante, sed forte non eodem modo sicut ultimum alteratum.
                  Aliquid igitur patitur rete a pisce stupefaciente, sed non
                  stupefactionem, quia eius non est capax: et orbes medii

                  To this it must be said that things which are passive undergo
                  the action of things that are active in their own special way,
                  and therefore the intermediate between the first cause of an
                  alteration and the last thing altered undergo something from
                  the first cause, but perhaps not in the same way as the last
                  thing affected. For the net undergoes something from the fish
                  that causes the shock, but not a shock, because it is not
                  capable of being shocked. And the intermediate orbs of the
                  planets receive something from the sun, namely, its light, but
                  not its heat.

                      910. Secondly, at (694) he proves the same thing by an
                      argument, which is this: Every alteration is similar to an
                      alteration which affects a sense. But in an alteration
                      which affects a sense the cause of the alteration and the
                      thing altered are together. Therefore, the same is true in
                      every alteration.

                          Primum sic probat. Omnis alteratio fit secundum
                          qualitatem sensibilem, quae est tertia species
                          qualitatis. Secundum illa enim alterantur corpora,
                          quibus primo corpora ab invicem differunt; quae sunt
                          sensibiles qualitates: ut gravitas et levitas,
                          durities et mollities, quae percipiuntur tactu; sonus

                          sonus in actu accipiatur, est qualitas in aere,
                          consequens aliquem motum localem; unde non videtur

                          sunt alia quae sub sensu cadunt, sicut calor et
                          frigus, et lenitas et asperitas, quae etiam tactu
                          comprehenduntur.

                          To prove the major premis, he says that every
                          alteration takes place according to a sensible
                          quality, which is the third species of quality. For
                          bodies are apt to be altered in respect of those
                          qualities by which bodies are primarily distinguished
                          one from the other, i.e. in sensible qualities, such
                          as heaviness, lightness, hardness and softness, which
                          are perceived by touch, sound and non-sound, which are
                          perceived by hearing. (However, if sound is considered
                          in act, it is a quality of the air, resulting from a
                          local motion; consequently, it does not seem that
                          there can be a primary and <i>per se</i> alteration
                          according to a quality of this sort. But if sound is
                          taken in an aptitudinal sense, then it is through some
                          alteration that something becomes soundable or
                          non-soundable.) There are also blackness and
                          whiteness, which pertain to sight; sweetness and
                          bitterness, which pertain to taste; dryness and
                          wetness, density and rarity, which pertain to touch.
                          The same goes for the contraries of these and for the
                          intermediates. Likewise, there are others which are
                          perceptible by sense, such as cold and heat,
                          smoothness and roughness, which are apprehended by
                          touch.

                              All these are passions contained within the genus
                              of quality. And they are called “passions” because
                              they produce a passion in the sense (i.e., the
                              senses come to be in the state of being acted
                              upon) or because they are caused by certain
                              passions, as is explained in the
                              <i>Predicaments</i>. But they are called “passions
                              of sensible bodies” because it is in respect of
                              these that sensible bodies differ, inasmuch as one
                              is hot and another cold, one is heavy and another
                              light, and so on, or inasmuch as someone of them
                              is present in two things, more so in one thing and
                              less so in another. Fire, for example, differs
                              from water by reason of the difference of hot and
                              cold, and from air according to more and. less
                              hot. Again, the difference of sensible bodies is
                              based on the ability of some of them to receive
                              one or the other of these qualities, although it
                              not be in them naturally; for example, we say that
                              heated objects differ from cooled objects and
                              sweetened things from things made bitter, not
                              because they are so by nature, but because they
                              have been acted upon by these qualities.

                                  Hence passion and alteration are more properly
                                  spoken of in regard to the senses than to the
                                  intellect, whose operation does not take place
                                  through a bodily organ.

                                      qualitates, et secundum quoscumque motus,
                                      alterantur corpora inanimata, secundum

                                      non invenitur in corporibus inanimatis.
                                      Non enim corpora inanimata cognoscunt suam
                                      alterationem, sed latet ea; quod non

                                      Thus it is evident that according to
                                      whatever qualities and according to
                                      whatever ways inanimate bodies are
                                      altered, animate bodies are altered
                                      according to the same qualities and in the
                                      same ways. But not vice versa: for an
                                      alteration is found in animate bodies that
                                      is not found in inanimate bodies, i.e.,
                                      the one according to sense. For inanimate
                                      bodies do not perceive the alterations
                                      they undergo—something that would not be,
                                      if they were altered in respect of sense.

                                                  second point, namely, that in
                                                  alterations of the senses, the
                                                  altering cause and the sense
                                                  affected are together, because
                                                  the air is continuous with the
                                                  sense, for example, of sight,
                                                  i.e., they are in immediate
                                                  contacts just as the visible
                                                  body is in contact with the
                                                  air. Indeed, the visible
                                                  body’s surface, which is the
                                                  subject of color, is
                                                  terminated at the light, i.e.,
                                                  at air which is illumined,
                                                  which is terminated at the
                                                  sense. And so it is evident
                                                  that the altered air and what
                                                  alters it are together, as are
                                                  the altered sight and the air

                                                  together, for they are not
                                                  joined by means of an
                                                  extrinsic medium, and the same
                                                  goes for touch. Consequently,

                                                  thing altered are together.

                                                      together, because growing
                                                      is a kind of “adding to,”

                        Everything, we say, that undergoes alteration is altered
                        by sensible causes, and there is alteration only in
                        things that are said to be essentially affected by
                        sensible things. The truth of this is to be seen from
                        the following considerations.

                            of acquiring and losing these: but as a matter of
                            fact in neither of these two classes of things is
                            there alteration.

                                of a thing is completed, we do not call it by
                                the name of its material: e.g. we do not call
                                the statue 'bronze' or the pyramid 'wax' or the
                                bed 'wood', but we use a derived expression and
                                call them 'of bronze', 'waxen', and 'wooden'
                                respectively. But when a thing has been affected
                                and altered in any way we still call it by the
                                original name: thus we speak of the bronze or
                                the wax being dry or fluid or hard or hot.

                                    by the name of its material, it is evident
                                    that becomings of the former kind cannot be
                                    alterations.

                                            the body or of the soul, are not
                                            alterations. For some are

                                            and neither excellence nor defect is
                                            an alteration: excellence is a
                                            perfection (for when anything
                                            acquires its proper excellence we
                                            call it perfect, since it is then if
                                            ever that we have a thing in its
                                            natural state: e.g. we have a
                                            perfect circle when we have one as
                                            good as possible), while defect is a
                                            perishing of or departure from this
                                            condition. So as when speaking of a
                                            house we do not call its arrival at
                                            perfection an alteration (for it
                                            would be absurd to suppose that the
                                            coping or the tiling is an
                                            alteration or that in receiving its
                                            coping or its tiling a house is
                                            altered and not perfected), the same
                                            also holds good in the case of
                                            excellences and defects and of the
                                            persons or things that possess or
                                            acquire them: for excellences are
                                            perfections of a thing's nature and
                                            defects are departures from it:
                                            consequently they are not
                                            alterations.

              that every alteration takes place in respect of what is sensible,
              he now undertakes to prove this. First he proposes what he
              intends; Secondly, he proves the proposition, at 914.

                  altered according to sensible qualities, and that,
                  consequently, to be altered belongs only to those things which

                          sensible qualities (the third species of quality),
                          alteration seems to occur especially in respect to the

                          quantity, namely, form and figure, and to the first
                          species, which contains habits and dispositions. For
                          when such qualities are freshly removed or newly
                          acquired, alteration seems to be involved—for these
                          things seem unable to occur without some changes and a
                          change in respect of quality is alteration, as was
                          said above.

                              fact that when the underlying matter becomes dense
                              or rare, a consequent change of figure results, In
                              like manner, when it becomes hot or cold, there
                              follows a change in regard to health and sickness,
                              which pertain to the first species of quality.
                              Rare and dense, hot and cold are sensible
                              qualities, and so it is clear that there is not
                              alteration in the first and fourth species of
                              quality primarily and <i>per se</i>; rather the
                              receiving or removing of them are a consequence of
                              some alteration affecting sensible qualities.

                                  From this is also plain why he makes no

                                  i.e., natural potency and impotency. For it is

                                      assumed: First, that alteration does not
                                      occur in the fourth species of quality;

                                          In regard to the first he gives two
                                          reasons, the first of which (699) is
                                          based on the way people speak. Here it
                                          must be considered that form and
                                          figure mutually differ in this, that
                                          figure implies termination of
                                          quantity, for the figure is that which
                                          is confined by the terminus or
                                          termini; but form is something which
                                          gives artifacts a kind of species, for
                                          the forms of artifacts are accidents.

                                              He says therefore that that from

                                              to be is not called a form, i.e.,
                                              the matter of the statue is not
                                              predicated of the statue
                                              <i>in principali et recto</i>, and
                                              the same for the figure of a
                                              pyramid or of a couch; rather in
                                              all such cases the matter is
                                              predicated denominatively. For we
                                              say that a triangle is wooden or
                                              golden or waxen. But in things
                                              that are altered, we predicate of
                                              the subject the quality received
                                              by the alteration, for we say that
                                              brass is wet and strong and hot,
                                              and conversely we say that the wet
                                              thing or the hot thing is brass,
                                              i.e., we predicate the matter of
                                              the quality and the quality of the
                                              matter, In fine, we say that a man
                                              is a white thing and that some
                                              white thing is a man. Therefore,
                                              because in forms and figures the
                                              matter is not predicated
                                              conversely with the figure, so
                                              that either could be said of the
                                              other
                                              <i>in principali et recto</i>, but
                                              rather the matter is predicated of
                                              the figure only in a denominative
                                              way, whereas in things that are
                                              altered the subject and the
                                              quality are mutually predicated,
                                              it follows that in forms and
                                              figures there is not alteration
                                              but only in sensible qualities.

                                                  at (700) and it is based on a
                                                  property of a thing. For it is
                                                  foolish to say that a man or a
                                                  house or anything else is
                                                  altered just because it
                                                  receives the end of its
                                                  perfection. For example, if a
                                                  house is made perfect when it
                                                  gets a roof or when it is
                                                  decorated or enclosed with
                                                  walls, it is ridiculous to say
                                                  that the house is being
                                                  altered when it becomes
                                                  roofed. It is also clear that
                                                  alteration does not affect
                                                  things that come to be,
                                                  precisely as coming to be;
                                                  rather a thing becomes perfect
                                                  and comes to be inasmuch as it
                                                  receives its own form and
                                                  figure. Consequently,
                                                  alteration is not involved in
                                                  the receiving of figure and
                                                  form.

                                                      these reasons clearer, we
                                                      should consider that of
                                                      all qualities in a thing,
                                                      it is figure that both
                                                      follows upon the species
                                                      and indicates the species.
                                                      This is particularly
                                                      evident in animals and
                                                      plants in which there is
                                                      no more sure way to judge
                                                      a diversity of species
                                                      than by a diversity of
                                                      figure. The reason for
                                                      this is that just as
                                                      quantity is the nearest of
                                                      all the accidents to the
                                                      substance, so the figure,
                                                      which is a quality
                                                      affecting quantity, is
                                                      nearest to the substantial
                                                      form. Hence, just as some
                                                      philosophers supposed that
                                                      dimensions were the
                                                      substances of things, so
                                                      they supposed that their
                                                      figures were their
                                                      substantial forms. It is
                                                      for this reason that an
                                                      image, which is an express
                                                      representation of a thing,
                                                      is based especially on the

                                                      And since art imitates
                                                      nature, and an artifact is
                                                      an image of a natural
                                                      thing, the forms of
                                                      artificial things are the
                                                      figure or something close
                                                      to the figure. And
                                                      therefore, on account of
                                                      the similarity of forms
                                                      and figures to substantial
                                                      forms, the Philosopher
                                                      says that the receiving of
                                                      form and figure is not
                                                      alteration but perfection.
                                                      And that is also why the

                        Further, we say that all excellences depend upon
                        particular relations. Thus bodily excellences such as
                        health and a good state of body we regard as consisting
                        in a blending of hot and cold elements within the body
                        in due proportion, in relation either to one another or
                        to the surrounding atmosphere: and in like manner we
                        regard beauty, strength, and all the other bodily
                        excellences and defects. Each of them exists in virtue
                        of a particular relation and puts that which possesses
                        it in a good or bad condition with regard to its proper
                        affections, where by 'proper' affections I mean those
                        influences that from the natural constitution of a thing
                        tend to promote or destroy its existence. Since then,
                        relatives are neither themselves alterations nor the
                        subjects of alteration or of becoming or in fact of any
                        change whatever, it is evident that neither states nor
                        the processes of losing and acquiring states are
                        alterations, though it may be true that their becoming
                        or perishing is necessarily, like the becoming or
                        perishing of a specific character or form, the result of
                        the alteration of certain other things, e.g. hot and
                        cold or dry and wet elements or the elements, whatever
                        they may be, on which the states primarily depend. For
                        each several bodily defect or excellence involves a
                        relation with those things from which the possessor of
                        the defect or excellence is naturally subject to
                        alteration: thus excellence disposes its possessor to be
                        unaffected by these influences or to be affected by
                        those of them that ought to be admitted, while defect
                        disposes its possessor to be affected by them or to be
                        unaffected by those of them that ought to be admitted.

                            And the case is similar in regard to the states of
                            the soul, all of which (like those of body) exist in
                            virtue of particular relations, the excellences
                            being perfections of nature and the defects
                            departures from it: moreover, excellence puts its
                            possessor in good condition, while defect puts its
                            possessor in a bad condition, to meet his proper
                            affections. Consequently these cannot any more than
                            the bodily states be alterations, nor can the
                            processes of losing and acquiring them be so, though
                            their becoming is necessarily the result of an
                            alteration of the sensitive part of the soul, and
                            this is altered by sensible objects:

                                remembering what one has experienced or in
                                anticipating what one is going to experience.
                                Thus all pleasure of this kind must be produced
                                by sensible things: and since the presence in
                                any one of moral defect or excellence involves
                                the presence in him of pleasure or pain (with
                                which moral excellence and defect are always
                                concerned), and these pleasures and pains are
                                alterations of the sensitive part, it is evident
                                that the loss and acquisition of these states no
                                less than the loss and acquisition of the states
                                of the body must be the result of the alteration
                                of something else. Consequently, though their
                                becoming is accompanied by an alteration, they
                                are not themselves alterations.

                                    Again, the states of the intellectual part
                                    of the soul are not alterations, nor is
                                    there any becoming of them. In the first
                                    place it is much more true of the possession
                                    of knowledge that it depends upon a
                                    particular relation. And further, it is
                                    evident that there is no becoming of these
                                    states. For that which is potentially
                                    possessed of knowledge becomes actually
                                    possessed of it not by being set in motion
                                    at all itself but by reason of the presence
                                    of something else: i.e. it is when it meets
                                    with the particular object that it knows in
                                    a manner the particular through its
                                    knowledge of the universal.

                                            rest and come to a standstill, and

                                            that he was previously incapable of
                                            using his knowledge, so, too, when
                                            any one originally acquires the
                                            state, it is incorrect to say that
                                            he becomes possessed of knowledge:
                                            for the possession of understanding
                                            and knowledge is produced by the
                                            soul's settling down out of the
                                            restlessness natural to it. Hence,
                                            too, in learning and in forming
                                            judgements on matters relating to
                                            their sense-perceptions children are
                                            inferior to adults owing to the
                                            great amount of restlessness and
                                            motion in their souls. Nature itself
                                            causes the soul to settle down and
                                            come to a state of rest for the
                                            performance of some of its
                                            functions, while for the performance
                                            of others other things do so: but in
                                            either case the result is brought
                                            about through the alteration of
                                            something in the body, as we see in
                                            the case of the use and activity of
                                            the intellect arising from a man's
                                            becoming sober or being awakened. It
                                            is evident, then, from the preceding
                                            argument that alteration and being
                                            altered occur in sensible things and
                                            in the sensitive part of the soul,
                                            and, except accidentally, in nothing
                                            else.

              919. After showing that alteration does not occur in the first
              species of quality in respect of dispositions of the body, the
              Philosopher shows the same about the habits of the soul. First as
              to the appetitive part of the soul; Secondly, as to the
              intellectual part of the soul, at 923.

                  About the first he does two things: First he shows that there
                  is no primary and <i>per se</i> alteration in changes that
                  affect virtues and vices; Secondly, that changes involving
                  virtue and vice are consequences of other alterations, at 921.

                      that with respect to virtues and vices which pertain to
                      the appetitive part of the soul there is no primary and
                      <i>per se</i> alteration. And he mentions this as a
                      conclusion, because he will proceed to prove it with the
                      same arguments as he proved the previous points.

                          Ad hoc autem probandum assumit quandam propositionem,
                          scilicet quod virtus sit perfectio quaedam. Quod
                          quidem sic probat: quia unumquodque tunc est
                          perfectum, quando pertingere potest ad propriam
                          virtutem; sicut naturale corpus tunc perfectum est,
                          quando potest aliud sibi simile facere, quod est
                          virtus naturae. Quod etiam probat per hoc, quia tunc
                          est aliquid maxime secundum naturam, quando naturae
                          virtutem habet; virtus enim naturae est signum
                          completionis naturae: cum autem aliquid habet complete
                          suam naturam, tunc dicitur esse perfectum. Quod non
                          solum in rebus naturalibus verum est, sed etiam in
                          mathematicis, ut eorum forma accipiatur pro eorum
                          natura: tunc enim maxime circulus est, idest perfectus
                          circulus, quando maxime est secundum naturam, idest
                          quando habet perfectionem suae formae. Sic ergo patet,
                          quod cum ad perfectionem formae cuiuslibet rei
                          consequatur virtus eius, quod tunc unumquodque
                          perfectum est, quando habet suam virtutem. Et ita
                          sequitur quod virtus sit perfectio quaedam.

                        <td>
                          Accordingly, in order to prove this he makes the
                          assumption that virtue is a kind of perfection. And
                          this he proves in the following manner: A thing is
                          perfect when it can attain to its own virtue (or
                          power); for example, a natural body is perfect when it
                          can make something like unto itself, and this is a
                          virtue (or power) of the nature. He also proves this
                          by the fact that a thing is most according to nature
                          when it has the virtue of its nature (for virtue in a
                          nature is a sign that the nature is complete), and
                          when a thing has its nature completely, it is said to
                          be perfect. And this is true not only in natural
                          things, but also in mathematical, where their form is
                          taken as the nature, for it is then that a figure is a
                          perfect circle, namely, when it is most according to
                          nature, i.e., when it has the perfection of that form.
                          In this way, then, it is evident that since the virtue
                          of a thing follows upon the perfection of its form, a
                          thing is perfect when it possesses its virtue.
                          Consequently, virtue is a kind of perfection.

                              Ex hac autem propositione sic probata, Commentator
                              sic argumentandum dicit. Omnis perfectio est
                              simplex et indivisibilis: secundum autem nihil
                              simplex et indivisibile est alteratio, neque
                              aliquis motus, ut supra probatum est: ergo
                              secundum virtutem non est alteratio.

                            <td>
                              With the premise proved thus, the Commentator says
                              that the full argument will be this: Every
                              perfection is simple and indivisible; but no
                              alteration or motion can affect what is simple and
                              indivisible; therefore, in respect of virtue there
                              can be no alteration,
                              <tr style="text-align: justify" valign="top">
                                <td>
                                  Sed iste processus non competit in eo quod
                                  subditur de malitia, quod scilicet est
                                  corruptio et remotio perfectionis. Etsi enim
                                  perfectio sit simplex et indivisibilis,
                                  recedere tamen a perfectione non est simplex
                                  et indivisibile, sed multipliciter contingens.
                                  Neque est etiam consuetudo Aristotelis, ut
                                  praetermittat illud ex quo principaliter
                                  conclusio dependet, nisi ex iuxta positis
                                  intelligi possit.

                                  But this reasoning will not apply to what
                                  Aristotle adds about vices, which are the
                                  removal and ceasing-to-be of a perfection. For
                                  although a perfection is simple and
                                  indivisible, yet the departure from perfection
                                  is not simple and indivisible, but occurs in
                                  many different ways. Again, it is not the
                                  custom of Aristotle to ignore a fact on which
                                  the conclusion chiefly depends, unless that
                                  fact is implied by something else he mentions.

                                      et eadem ratione, neque quando

                                      perfectio quaedam, malitia vero corruptio,
                                      secundum virtutem et malitiam non est

                                      Therefore, it is better to say that the
                                      argument here must be like the one used
                                      above for form and figure. For nothing is
                                      said to be altered, when it is being made
                                      perfect, and for the same reason, when it
                                      is being corrupted. Hence, if virtue is a
                                      perfection and vice a corruption, there
                                      will be no alteration in respect of them
                                      any more than there is in respect of forms
                                      and figures.

                                          of some alteration. And first he
                                          proposes what he intends and says that
                                          the receiving of virtue and the
                                          removal of a vice, or vice versa, take
                                          place when something is altered in
                                          such a way that on the occasion of

                                                  hominum de virtute et malitia.
                                                  Stoici enim dixerunt virtutes
                                                  esse impassibilitates quasdam,
                                                  nec posse esse virtutem in

                                                  timor, spes, et huiusmodi.
                                                  Huiusmodi enim passiones
                                                  dicebant esse quasdam animae

                                                  This is seen to be proved in
                                                  two ways. First, according to
                                                  two opinions that men have
                                                  about virtue and vice. For the
                                                  Stoics declared that virtues
                                                  are impassibilities and that
                                                  no virtue can exist in the
                                                  soul unless all the passions
                                                  of the soul are first removed,
                                                  i.e., fear, hope, and so on,
                                                  For they said that such
                                                  passions are disturbances and
                                                  ailments of the soul, whereas
                                                  virtue is a peaceful and
                                                  healthy state of soul.
                                                  Accordingly, they said that
                                                  the very capacity to undergo
                                                  emotion is an evil or vice of
                                                  the soul.

                                                      However, the opinion of
                                                      the Peripatetics, derived
                                                      from Aristotle, is that
                                                      virtue consists in a
                                                      defined control of the
                                                      passions. For a moral
                                                      virtue establishes a mean
                                                      in the passions, as is
                                                      said in <i>Ethics</i> II.
                                                      And according to this,
                                                      even the vice opposed to a
                                                      virtue is not any kind of
                                                      passibility at all, but a
                                                      certain inclination to the
                                                      passions contrary to the
                                                      virtue, which are reckoned
                                                      in terms of excess and
                                                      defect.

                        A difficulty may be raised as to whether every motion is
                        commensurable with every other or not. Now if they are
                        all commensurable and if two things to have the same
                        velocity must accomplish an equal motion in an equal
                        time, then we may have a circumference equal to a
                        straight line, or, of course, the one may be greater or
                        less than the other. Further, if one thing alters and
                        another accomplishes a locomotion in an equal time, we
                        may have an alteration and a locomotion equal to one
                        another: thus an affection will be equal to a length,
                        which is impossible.

                            But is it not only when an equal motion is
                            accomplished by two things in an equal time that the
                            velocities of the two are equal? Now an affection
                            cannot be equal to a length. Therefore there cannot
                            be an alteration equal to or less than a locomotion:
                            and consequently it is not the case that every
                            motion is commensurable with every other.

                                of the circle and the straight line? It would be
                                absurd to suppose that the motion of one in a
                                circle and of another in a straight line cannot
                                be similar, but that the one must inevitably
                                move more quickly or more slowly than the other,
                                just as if the course of one were downhill and

                                    that the one motion must inevitably be
                                    quicker or slower than the other: for then
                                    the circumference can be greater or less
                                    than the straight line; and if so it is
                                    possible for the two to be equal. For if in

                                    distance B' and the slower (G) passes over
                                    the distance G', B' will be greater than G':
                                    for this is what we took 'quicker' to mean:
                                    and so quicker motion also implies that one

                                            always commensurable if the same
                                            terms are applied to them without
                                            equivocation? e.g. a pen, a wine,
                                            and the highest note in a scale are
                                            not commensurable: we cannot say
                                            whether any one of them is sharper
                                            than any other: and why is this?
                                            they are incommensurable because it
                                            is only equivocally that the same
                                            term 'sharp' is applied to them:
                                            whereas the highest note in a scale
                                            is commensurable with the
                                            leading-note, because the term
                                            'sharp' has the same meaning as
                                            applied to both. Can it be, then,
                                            that the term 'quick' has not the
                                            same meaning as applied to straight
                                            motion and to circular motion
                                            respectively? If so, far less will
                                            it have the same meaning as applied
                                            to alteration and to locomotion.

                                                    'one' again is perhaps
                                                    inevitably an equivocal
                                                    term; and if 'one' is
                                                    equivocal, so is 'two'.

              Postquam philosophus ostendit quod in mobilibus et motoribus
              necesse est ponere aliquod primum; quia ea quae sunt unius ordinis
              videntur comparabilia esse, et hoc ipsum quod est prius et
              posterius comparationem importat, vult ex consequenti inquirere de
              motuum comparatione. Et circa hoc duo facit: primo enim ostendit
              qui motus sint comparabiles ad invicem; secundo qualiter motus ad
              invicem comparentur, ibi: quoniam autem movens movet et cetera.

              928. After the Philosopher has shown that it is necessary to posit
              a first in mobiles and movers, now, because things which are of
              one order seem capable of being compared, and because to be
              “prior” and “subsequent” implies a comparison, he wishes to
              inquire about comparison of motions. Concerning this he does two
              things: First, he shows which motions can be mutually compared;
              Secondly, how motions are mutually compared, (L. 9).

                  About the first he does three things: First, he raises a
                  question; Secondly, he objects against both parts of the
                  question, at 929; Thirdly, he settles the question, at 933.

                      First he raises a general question (709) and asks whether
                      just any motion at random may be compared to just any
                      other motion or not. Then he raises a special question
                      about motions in some one genus. Now if any motion at
                      random may be compared to just any other motion with
                      respect to swiftness and slowness (it having been said in
                      Book VI that the equally swift is what is moved in equal
                      time over an equal space), it will follow that a circular
                      motion will be equal, or greater, or less, in swiftness
                      than a rectilinear one, and further, that a curved line
                      will be equal to a straight line in quantity, or larger or
                      smaller, from the fact that the equally swift is that
                      which traverses an equal distance in equal time.

                          Deinde infert dubitationem de motibus diversorum
                          generum. Si enim omnes motus comparabiles sunt in
                          velocitate, sequetur quod si in aequali tempore hoc
                          quidem alteretur, illud vero moveatur secundum locum,
                          quod sit aequalis in velocitate alteratio loci
                          mutationi. Et ulterius, per definitionem aeque
                          velocis, sequetur quod passio, idest passibilis
                          qualitas, secundum quam est alteratio, sit aequalis
                          longitudini spatii, quae pertransitur per motum
                          localem: quod est impossibile manifeste, quia non
                          conveniunt in eadem ratione quantitatis.

                        <td>
                          Then he raises a question about motions in diverse
                          genera. For if all motions may be compared with
                          respect to speed, it will follow that if in an equal
                          time A is altered, and B is moved locally, then a
                          local motion is equal in swiftness to an alteration.
                          Further, by virtue of the definition of the equally
                          swift, it will follow that a passion, i.e., passible
                          quality, in respect of which there is alteration, is
                          equal to the length of the distance traversed by the
                          local motion. But this is plainly impossibles because
                          they do not agree in the same notion of quantity.

                              929. Then at (710) he raises objections against
                              the question proposed: First, he objects against
                              comparing alteration with local motion; Secondly,
                              against comparing circular motion with
                              rectilinear, at 930.

                                  Concludit ergo primo ex praemissa ratione ad
                                  impossibile ducente, contrarium posito; quasi
                                  dicat: dictum est quod inconveniens est
                                  passionem esse aequalem longitudini: sed tunc
                                  aliquid est aequaliter velox, cum in aequali
                                  tempore movetur per aequale: ergo, cum nulla
                                  passio sit aequalis longitudini, sequitur quod
                                  loci mutatio non est aequalis in velocitate
                                  alterationi, neque maior aut minor. Ex quo
                                  ulterius concludi poterit, quod non omnes
                                  motus sint comparabiles.

                                  First (710), therefore, from the foregoing
                                  argument which leads to an impossibility, he
                                  concludes to the contrary of what he posited,
                                  as though saying that, since it has been said
                                  that it is not feasible for a passion to be
                                  equal to a length, while whenever something is
                                  moved through an equal space in equal time, it
                                  is said to be equally swift, therefore, since
                                  no passion is equal to a length, it follows
                                  that a local motion is not equal in swiftness
                                  to an alteration, or greater or less. From
                                  this it may be further concluded that not all
                                  motions can be compared.

                                      circular and rectilinear motion. First he

                                              statim necesse est quod aliquid
                                              velocius aut tardius moveatur, si

                                              He objects first (711) in the
                                              following manner. Circular motion
                                              and rectilinear are differences of
                                              local motion, just as upward and
                                              downward are. But as soon as
                                              something is moved upwards and
                                              something else downwards, it is at
                                              once necessary that one be being
                                              moved faster or slower than the
                                              other—the same is true if the same
                                              thing is moved now upwards and
                                              later downwards. It seems
                                              therefore that in like manner we
                                              must say that a rectilinear motion
                                              is swifter or slower than a
                                              circular one, whether it be the
                                              same thing that is being moved in
                                              a straight line and in a circular
                                              one, or two different things.

                                                  mention of the equally swift
                                                  but of the swifter and slower,

                                                  on the likeness of an upward
                                                  motion—whose principle is
                                                  lightness—to a motion which is
                                                  downward—whose principle is
                                                  heaviness. Some, indeed, have

                            is undergone by one half of a body's length and a

                            absurd, and the reason is that there are different
                            species of motion.

                                    What, then, is the reason of this? Is it
                                    that locomotion is a genus or that line is a
                                    genus? (We may leave the time out of
                                    account, since that is one and the same.) If
                                    the lines are specifically different, the
                                    locomotions also differ specifically from
                                    one another: for locomotion is specifically
                                    differentiated according to the specific
                                    differentiation of that over which it takes
                                    place. (It is also similarly differentiated,
                                    it would seem, accordingly as the instrument
                                    of the locomotion is different:

                                            are of equal velocity in an equal
                                            time they traverse the same
                                            magnitude: and when I call it 'the
                                            same' I mean that it contains no
                                            specific difference and therefore no
                                            difference in the motion that takes
                                            place over it. So we have now to
                                            consider how motion is
                                            differentiated:

              940. After pointing out in general what is required in order that
              things be able to be compared, the Philosopher now applies the
              truth found to the comparison of motions. First in general;
              Secondly, by comparing motions that belong to diverse genera, at
              941; Thirdly, by comparing one motion to another in the same
              genus, at 942.

                  primum susceptivum, et quod sit eadem species; sic et circa

                  He says therefore first (722) that just as in other matters
                  the requirements for comparability are that the things
                  compared be not equivocal, and that there be an identical
                  first receiver, and that they be of the same species, so also
                  in regard to motion, “equally swift” is said of things that
                  are moved in equal time, through such-and-such an equal
                  length, with respect to a change of the same kind.

                      comparatione motuum diversorum generum. Et dicit secundum
                      praemissa, quod si unum mobile alteretur, aliud vero
                      ducatur, idest secundum locum moveatur, numquid potest
                      dici quod alteratio sit aeque velox loci mutationi? Sed
                      hoc dicere esset inconveniens. Cuius causa est, quia motus
                      habet diversas species, et iam dictum est quod ea quae non
                      sunt unius speciei, non sunt comparabilia. Quia ergo loci
                      mutatio non est eiusdem speciei cum alteratione, non sunt
                      comparabiles velocitates alterationis et loci mutationis.

                      941. Then at (723) he discusses the comparison of motions
                      in diverse genera. And he asks, in keeping with what went
                      before, “If one mobile be altered and another moved
                      locally, can the alteration be said to be ‘as swift as’
                      the local motion?” To say “yes” would be unacceptable. The
                      reason is that the two motions are of different
                      species—and it has already been said that things not of
                      the same species cannot be compared. Therefore, since
                      local motion is not of the same species as alteration, the
                      swiftness of the two cannot be compared.

                                  First he shows what is required in order that
                                  two local motions be able to be mutually
                                  compared; Secondly, he shows that one factor
                                  which seems to be required is not, at 945;
                                  Thirdly, he concludes to what he chiefly
                                  intended, at 946.

                                      would follow if all local motions could be
                                      compared; Secondly, he tells why not all

                                          per aequalem magnitudinem in aequali

                                          circulari; alio modo de linea recta et

                                          943. He says therefore first (724)
                                          that if the equally swift are things
                                          moved locally through an equal
                                          magnitude in equal time, and if all
                                          local motions should be equally swift,
                                          it would follow that what is straight
                                          is equal to what is circular. Now,
                                          this statement may be understood in
                                          two senses: first, in respect to a
                                          rectilinear motion and a circular one,
                                          secondly, in respect to a straight
                                          line and a circular one. The latter is
                                          the better sense, because it follows
                                          from the foregoing. For if all
                                          rectilinear and circular motions are
                                          equally swift-and they are so when
                                          they traverse an equal magnitude in
                                          equal time—it follows that a straight
                                          line is equal to a circular one, a
                                          situation that must be rejected as
                                          impossible.

                                              the reason why rectilinear motions
                                              cannot be compared with circular
                                              ones. For since he had concluded
                                              that if they are equal, then the
                                              magnitudes are equal—which is seen
                                              to be impossible—someone might
                                              wonder whether the reason for this
                                              inability to be compared is due to
                                              the motion or to the magnitude.
                                              And this is his question: “Is the
                                              reason why a straight motion is
                                              not as equally swift as a circular
                                              one due to the fact that change of
                                              place is a genus containing
                                              diverse species under it (for it
                                              was said above that things of
                                              diverse species are not
                                              comparable), or is it because line
                                              is a genus containing under it
                                              straight and circular as species?”
                                              Of course, time cannot be the
                                              reason, for all time is “atomic,”
                                              i.e., indivisible, as to species.

                                                  found a difference of species,
                                                  but in such a way,
                                                  nevertheless, that the

                                                  motion is due to the diversity

                                                  occurs has species, it follows

                                                  have species.

                                                      for identity of species
                                                      and comparability in local

                                                      takes place; for example,
                                                      if the feet are the

                                                      motion, it is walking, but
                                                      if wings are, it is called
                                                      flying. Yet this does not

                        extends to something (by 'is always in something' I mean

                        motion, it also has caused motion, so that there must

                                            Hence Zeno's reasoning is false when
                                            he argues that there is no part of

                                            sound: for there is no reason why
                                            any such part should not in any

              956. After showing which motions are mutually comparable, the
              Philosopher now teaches how they are compared: First in local
              motions; Secondly, in other motions, at 962.

                  compared; Secondly, he sets forth the rules of comparison in
                  the light of the foregoing, at 957.

                      sicut in sexto probatum est, semper simul aliquid movet et
                      movit. Probatum est enim ibi, quod omne quod movetur, iam
                      est motum per aliquam partem spatii, et per aliquam partem
                      temporis. Unde sequitur quod et illud quod movetur est
                      aliquod quantum et divisibile, et etiam illud per quod

                      est aliquod quantum esse movens; et de hoc movente hic

                      He says therefore first (738) that the mover in local
                      motion always moves some mobile, in some definite time,
                      and through some quantity of space. And this is required,
                      because, as was proved in Book VI, something always moves
                      and has moved, simultaneously. For it was proved there
                      that whatever is being moved has already been moved
                      through some part of a distance and through some part of
                      time. Hence it follows that what is being moved is
                      something quantitative and divisible, as are the distance
                      and the time involved. However, not every mover is
                      quantified, as will be proved in Book VIII; nevertheless,
                      it is clear that some quantitative things are movers and
                      it is in respect to those that he proposes the following
                      rules of comparison,

                          secundo quando movens dividitur, ibi: et si eadem

                          957. Then at (739) he lays down the rules of
                          comparison. First according to division of the mobile;
                          Secondly, when the mover is divided, at 958.

                              He says therefore first (739): Let A be a mover,
                              and B a mobile, and C the length of space
                              traversed, and D the time in which A moves B
                              through C. If therefore we take another moving
                              power, equal to the power of A, it will follow
                              that it will move half of the mobile B through a
                              distance twice C in the same time; but in half the

                                  Ex his igitur verbis philosophi duae regulae
                                  generales accipi possunt. Quarum prima est,
                                  quod si aliqua potentia movet aliquod mobile
                                  per aliquod spatium in aliquo tempore,
                                  medietatem illius mobilis per duplum spatium
                                  movebit vel aequalis potentia in eodem
                                  tempore, vel eadem in alio aequali.

                                  From these statements of the Philosopher two
                                  general rules may be gathered. The first is
                                  that if some power moves a mobile through some
                                  certain distance in a given time, then it or
                                  an equal power will move half of that mobile
                                  through twice the distance in the same time or
                                  in an equal time.
                                  <tr style="text-align: justify" valign="top">
                                    <td>
                                      Alia regula est, quod medietatem mobilis
                                      movebit per idem spatium aequalis potentia
                                      in medietate temporis. Et horum ratio est,
                                      quia sic conservabitur eadem analogia,
                                      idest eadem proportio. Manifestum est enim
                                      quod velocitas motus est ex victoria
                                      potentiae moventis super mobile: quanto
                                      autem mobile fuerit minus, tanto potentia
                                      moventis magis excedit ipsum: unde
                                      velocius movebit. Velocitas autem motus
                                      diminuit tempus, et auget longitudinem
                                      spatii: quia velocius est quod in aequali
                                      tempore pertransit maiorem magnitudinem,
                                      et aequalem magnitudinem in minori
                                      tempore, ut in sexto probatum est. Ergo
                                      secundum proportionem qua subtrahitur a
                                      mobili, oportet subtrahi de tempore, vel
                                      addi ad longitudinem spatii, dummodo
                                      movens sit idem vel aequale.

                                    <td>
                                      The other rule is that an equal power will
                                      move half the mobile over the same
                                      distance in half the time. The reason
                                      behind these rules is that the same
                                      proportion is being kept. For it is clear
                                      that the swiftness of a motion results
                                      from the victory of the mover’s power over
                                      the mobile, because the weaker the mobile
                                      the more the strength of the mover
                                      prevails over it and the more swiftly will
                                      it move the mobile. The swiftness of a
                                      motion cuts down on the time and increases
                                      the length traversed, for the swifter is
                                      what traverses a greater distance in an
                                      equal time or an equal distance in less
                                      time, as was proved in Book VI. Therefore,
                                      according to the same proportion by which
                                      the mobile is diminished, either the time
                                      is diminished or the length traversed is
                                      increased, provided, of course, that the
                                      mover is the same or an equal mover.

                                              comparison; Secondly, he rejects
                                              some false comparisons, at 959;
                                              Thirdly, from this he answers an
                                              argument of Zeno, at 960.

                                                  the same distance in the given
                                                  time. However, this must be
                                                  understood of a mover that is
                                                  not destroyed by division, for
                                                  he has been speaking in a
                                                  general way without making
                                                  application to the particular
                                                  natures involved. And he gives
                                                  an example: Let E be half of
                                                  power A and let Z be half of
                                                  mobile B, then just as A moved
                                                  B through C in time D, so E
                                                  will move Z through the same
                                                  distance in the same amount of
                                                  time, because the same
                                                  proportion of motive power to
                                                  body mass moved is preserved.
                                                  Hence, it follows that in an
                                                  equal time the motion will
                                                  traverse an equal distance, as
                                                  was said.
