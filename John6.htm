                1 After this Jesus went across the Sea of Galilee, which is that
                of Tiberias. 2 And a great multitude followed him because they
                saw the miracles he worked on those who were sick. 3 Jesus
                therefore went up a mountain, and there sat down with his
                disciples. 4 Now the Passover was near, a festival day of the
                Jews. 5 Then, when Jesus lifted his eyes and saw that a great
                multitude had come to him, he said to Philip,
                <dl>
                  <dd>
                    “Where shall we buy bread that these may eat?”
                    <p>
                      6 He said this, however, to test him, for he knew what he
                      would do. 7 Philip replied, “Two hundred denarii worth of
                      bread would not suffice for each to have a little bit.” 8
                      One of his disciples, Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter,
                      said to him, 9 “There is a boy here who has five barley
                      loaves and two fishes, but what are these for so many?” 10
                      Jesus then said,
                      <dd>
                        “Make the people recline.”
                        <p>
                          There was much grass in the place. Therefore the men
                          reclined, in number about five thousand. 11 Jesus then
                          took the bread, and when he had given thanks, he
                          distributed it to those reclining; he did likewise
                          with the fish, as much as they wanted. 12 When they
                          had their fill, he said to his disciples,
                          <dd>“Gather up the fragments that are left over,</dd>
                          <dd>
                            lest they be wasted.”
                            <p>
                              13 They therefore gathered and filled twelve
                              baskets with the leftovers, from the five barley
                              loaves and the two fishes, that remained after all
                              had eaten.

              838 The Evangelist has presented the teaching of Christ on the
              spiritual life, by which he gives life to those who are born
              again. He now tells us of the spiritual food by which Christ
              sustains those to whom he has given life. First, he describes a
              visible miracle, in which Christ furnished bodily food. Secondly,
              he considers spiritual food (6:26). He does two things about the
              first. First, he describes the visible miracle. Secondly, he shows
              the effect this miracle had (6:14). He tells us two things about
              this miracle. First, its circumstances, secondly, about its actual
              accomplishment (v 5). As to the first he does three things. First
              he describes the crowd that Jesus fed, secondly, the place;
              thirdly, the time (v 4). As to the first he does three things.
              First, he identifies the place where the crowd followed Jesus;
              secondly, the people who followed him; and thirdly, he tells why
              they followed him.

              mystica verba quae dominus de sua potestate dixerat. Mare autem
              istud Galilaeae frequenter in Scriptura et in diversis locis
              nominatur. Quia autem istud mare non est salsum, sed est quaedam
              congregatio aquarum ex influxu Iordanis, ideo a Luca dicitur
              stagnum, ut habetur Lc. V, 1; quia vero secundum proprietatem
              Hebraici idiomatis, omnes congregationes aquarum vocantur maria,
              secundum illud Gen. I, 10:
              <i>congregationesque aquarum appellavit maria</i>, ideo dicitur
              mare. Sed Genesareth cognominatur a natura loci: nam multum
              fluctuat ex reverberatione ventorum, qui ex ipsis aquae
              resolutionibus generantur: unde Genesareth in Graeco, idem est
              quod auram generans. Denominatur etiam Galilaeae a Galilaea
              provincia, in qua est. Tiberiadis vero a civitate sic dicta, quae
              erat ex una parte ipsius maris, ex opposito habens civitatem
              Capharnaum ex alia parte, quae prius vocabatur Zenereth, sed
              postea ab Herode tetrarcha instaurata in honorem Tiberii Caesaris,
              Tiberias appellata fuit.

              839 The Evangelist describes the place to which the crowd followed
              our Lord when he says,
              <b>After this Jesus went across the Sea of Galilee,</b>
              i.e., after the mysterious words Jesus had spoken concerning his
              power. This Sea of Galilee is mentioned frequently in various
              places in Scripture. Luke calls it a lake (Lk 5:1) because its
              water is not salty, but was formed from the waters flowing in from
              the Jordan. Yet it is still called a “Sea,” because in Hebrew all
              bodies of water are called “seas”: “God called the waters ‘seas’”
              (Gn 1:10). It is also called Gennesaret because of the character
              of its location: for this water is tossed about a great deal,
              being buffeted by the winds that come from the vapors rising from
              its surface. Thus in Greek the word “Gennesaret” means “wind
              forming.” It is called the Sea of Galilee from the province of
              Galilee in which it is located. Again, it is called the Sea of
              Tiberias from the city of Tiberias: this city was situated on one
              side of the sea, facing Capernaum on the opposite side. The city
              of Tiberias was formerly called Chinnereth, but later, when it was
              rebuilt by Herod the Tetrarch, it was renamed as Tiberias in honor
              of Tiberius Caesar.

              Ratio autem litteralis quare Iesus abiit trans mare, assignatur a
              Chrysostomo, ut Christus cederet furori et turbationi Iudaeorum,
              quam conceperant contra Christum propter ea quae de se supra
              dixerat. Unde, ut ipse dicit, sicut iacula cum in durum aliquod
              incidunt gravius feriunt, quae autem non habuerint aliquod
              obvians, dissolvuntur cito immissa, et quiescunt; ita et cum
              audacibus hominibus impetuose et resistendo incesserimus, saeviunt
              magis; si autem eis cesserimus, facile mollimus eorum insaniam.
              Propterea Christus furorem Iudaeorum ex praemissis sermonibus
              natum, secedendo trans mare, mitigavit; dans nobis in hoc exemplum
              simile faciendi. Eccli. VIII, 14:

              840 The literal reason why Jesus crossed the sea is given by
              Chrysostom: to give ground to the anger and agitation which the
              Jews felt against Christ because of the things he had said about
              them. As Chrysostom says: just as darts strike a hard object with
              great force if they meet it, but pass on and soon come to rest if
              nothing is in their way, so also the anger of defiant men
              increases when they are resisted, but if we yield a little, it is
              easy to keep their fury within bounds. So Christ, by going to the
              other side of the sea, was able to soften the anger of the Jews,
              caused by what he had said. He thus gives us an example to act in
              the same way: “Do not be provoked by one who speaks evil of you”
              (Sir 8:14).

              Mystice autem per mare, praesens saeculum turbidum designatur; Ps.
              CIII, v. 25:

              dominus quando mare mortalitatis et poenalitatis assumpsit
              nascendo, calcavit moriendo et transiens resurgendo, in gloriam
              resurrectionis pervenit. De isto transitu dicitur infra XIII, 1:
              <i
                >sciens Iesus quia venit hora eius ut transeat ex hoc mundo ad
                patrem</i

                ad te multitudo maris</i

              841 In the mystical sense, the sea signifies this present troubled
              world: “This great sea, stretching wide” (Ps 103:25). Our Lord
              crossed over this sea when he assumed the sea of punishment and
              death by being born, trod it under foot by dying, and then
              crossing over it by his rising, arrived at the glory of his
              resurrection. We read of this crossing: “Jesus knew that his time
              had come to leave this world for the Father” (below 13:1). A great
              crowd, composed of both peoples, has followed him in this
              crossing, by believing in him and imitating him: “Your heart will
              be full of wonder and joy, when the riches of the sea will be
              given to you” (Is 60:5); “Rise up, O Lord, you who demand that
              justice be done; and the people will gather round you” (Ps 7:7).

              843 The reason why they followed him is because he was performing
              miracles, hence he says,
              <b
                >because they saw the miracles he worked on those who were
                sick.</b
              >
              We should point out that some followed Christ because of his
              teachings, that is, those who were better disposed. But there were
              others, i.e., those who were less perfect and less perceptive, who
              followed him because they were attracted by visible miracles;
              “Signs were given to unbelievers, not to believers” (1 Cor 14:22).
              Still others followed him out of devotion and faith, those,
              namely, whom he had cured of some bodily defect: for our Lord had
              so healed their body that they were also completely healed in
              soul: “The works of God are perfect” (Dt 32:4). This is clear,
              because he expressly said to the paralytic, “Do not sin again”
              (above 5:14), and in Matthew (9:2) he says, “Son, your sins are
              forgiven”; and these remarks concern the health of the soul rather
              than that of the body.

              845 Then he gives the location of the miracle, on a mountain;
              hence he says:
              <b>Jesus therefore went up a mountain,</b>
              i.e., privately,
              <b>and there sat down with his disciples.</b>
              Now a mountain is a place well suited for refreshment, for
              according to the Psalm a mountain signifies the perfection of
              justice: “Your justice is like the mountains of God” (Ps 35:7).
              And so, because we cannot be satisfied by earthly things—indeed,
              “Whoever drinks this water will be thirsty again” (above 4:13)—but
              spiritual things will satisfy us, our Lord leads his disciples to
              a higher place to show that full satisfaction and the perfection
              of justice are found in spiritual realities. We read of this
              mountain: “The mountain of God is a rich mountain” (Ps 67:16).
              Thus he also exercised his office of teacher there, sitting with
              his disciples; for he is the one who teaches every man.

              who desires to be refreshed by the bread of the divine Word and by
              the body and blood of’ the Lord, must pass from vices to virtues:
              “Our Passover, Christ, has been sacrificed, and so let us feast
              with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth” (1 Cor 5:7). And

              This is the second Passover the Evangelist has mentioned. However,
              our Lord did not go to Jerusalem this time, as the law commanded.
              The reason for this being that Christ was both God and man: as man
              he was subject to the law, but as God he was above the law. So, he
              observed the law on certain occasions to show that he was a man,
              but he also disregarded the law at other times to show that he was
              God. Further, by not going he indicated that the ceremonies of the
              law would end gradually and in a short time.

              848 The occasion for Christ’s question was his sight of the crowd
              coming to him. Hence he says,
              <b>Then, when Jesus,</b>
              on the mountain with his disciples, i.e., with those who were more
              perfect,
              <b
                >lifted his eyes and saw that a great multitude had come to
                him.</b
              >
              Here we should note two things about Christ. First, his maturity:
              for he is not distracted by what does not concern him, but is
              appropriately concerned with his disciples. He is not like those
              spoken of in Proverbs (30:13): “A generation whose eyes are
              proud.” And, “A man’s dress, and laughter, and his walk, show what
              he is” (Sir 19:27). Secondly, we should note that Christ did not
              sit there with his disciples out of laziness; he was looking right
              at them, teaching them carefully and attracting their hearts to
              himself: “Then he lifted his eyes to his disciples” (Lk 6:20).
              Thus we read:
              <b>Then, when Jesus lifted his</b>
              eyes. In the mystical sense, our Lord’s eyes are his spiritual
              gifts; and he lifts his eyes on the elect, i.e., looks at them
              with compassion, when he mercifully grants these gifts to them:
              This is what the Psalm asks for: “Look upon me, O Lord, and have
              mercy on me” (Ps 85:16).

              Here we should note that every teacher is obliged to possess the
              means of feeding spiritually the people who come to him. And since
              no man possesses of himself the resources to feed them, he must
              acquire them elsewhere by his labor, study, and persistent prayer:
              “Hurry, you who have no money, and acquire without cost wine and
              milk” (Is 55:1). And there follows: “Why do you spend your money,”
              i.e., your eloquence, “for what is not bread,” i.e., not the true
              wisdom which refreshes—“Wisdom will feed him with the bread of
              life and understanding” (Si 15:5)—“and why do you work for what
              does not satisfy you,” i.e., by learning things that drain you
              instead of filling you?

              roaring lion, goes about seeking whom he can devour” (1 Pt 5:8).
              But Christ (and God) does not test us in order to learn, because
              he sees into our hearts; nor in order to ensnare us, for as we
              read in James (1:13): “God does not test [i.e., tempt] anyone.”
              But he does test us that others might learn something from the one
              tested. This is the way God tested Abraham: “God tested Abraham”
              (Gn 22:1); and then it says (v 12): “Now I know that you fear
              God,” i.e., I have made it known that you fear the Lord. He tests
              Philip in the same way: so that those who hear his answer might be
              very certain about the miracle to come.

              Sciendum est autem circa primum, quod Philippus inter alios magis
              tardus et rudis erat, et ideo inter alios frequentius dominum
              interrogabat; infra XIV, 8:

              852 With respect to the first, note that Philip was slower in
              learning than the others, and so he asks our Lord more questions:
              “Lord, show us the Father, and that will be enough for us” (below
              14:8). Here, according to the literal sense, Andrew is better
              disposed than Philip, for Philip does not seem to have any
              understanding or anticipation of the corning miracle. And so he
              suggests that money is the way by which they could feed all the
              people, saying:
              <b
                >Two hundred denarii worth of bread would not suffice for each
                to have a little bit.</b
              >
              And since we do not have that much, we cannot feed them. Here we
              see the poverty of Christ, for he did not even have two hundred
              denarii.

              853 Andrew, however, seems to sense that a miracle is going to
              take place. Perhaps he recalled the miracle performed by Elisha
              with the barley loaves, when he fed a hundred men with twenty
              loaves (2 Kgs 4:42). And so he says,
              <b>There is a boy here who has five barley loaves.</b>
              Still, he did not suspect that Christ was going to perform a
              greater miracle than Elisha: for he thought that fewer loaves
              would be miraculously produced from fewer, and more from a larger
              number. But in truth, he who does not need any material to work
              with could feed a crowd as easily with few or many loaves. So
              Andrew continues:
              <b>but what are these for so many?</b>
              As if to say: Even if you increased them in the measure that
              Elisha did, it still would not be enough.

              854 In the mystical sense, wisdom is a symbol for spiritual
              refreshment. One kind of wisdom was taught by Christ, the true
              wisdom: “Christ is the power of God, and the wisdom of God” (1 Cor
              1:24). Before Christ came, there were two other teachings or
              doctrines: one was the human teachings of the philosophers; the
              other was the teachings found in the written law. Philip mentions
              the first of these when he speaks of buying:
              <b>Two hundred denarii worth of bread would not suffice,</b>
              for human wisdom must be acquired. Now the number one hundred
              implies perfection. Thus two hundred suggests the twofold
              perfection necessary for this wisdom: for there Ire two ways one
              arrives at the perfection of human wisdom, by experience and by
              contemplation. So he says,
              <b>Two hundred denarii worth of bread would not suffice,</b>
              because no matter what human reason can experience and contemplate
              of the truth, it is not enough to completely satisfy our desire
              for wisdom: “Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, nor the
              strong man in his strength, nor the rich man in his riches. But
              let him who glories glory in this: that he knows and understands
              me” (Jer 9:23). For the wisdom of no philosopher has been so great
              that it could keep men from error; rather, the philosophers have
              led many into error.

              This boy had five loaves, that is, the teaching of the law: either
              because this teaching was contained in the five books of Moses,
              “The law was given through Moses” (above 1:17); or because it was
              given to men absorbed in sensible things, which are made known
              through the five senses. These loaves were of barley because the
              law was given in such a way that what was life-giving in it was
              concealed under physical signs: for the kernel in barley is
              covered with a very firm husk. Or, the loaves were of barley
              because the Jewish people had not yet been rubbed free of carnal
              desire, but it still covered their hearts like a husk: for in the
              Old Testament they outwardly experienced hardships because of
              their ceremonial observances: “A yoke, which neither our fathers
              nor we were able to bear” (Acts 15:10). Further, the Jews were
              engrossed in material things and did not understand the spiritual
              meaning of the law: “A veil is over their hearts” (2 Cor 3:15).

              <b>There was much grass in the place.</b>
              This is the literal meaning. In the mystical sense, grass
              indicates the flesh: “All flesh is grass” (Is 40:6). In this sense
              it can refer to two things. First, to the teachings of the Old
              Testament, which were given to a people resting in things of the
              flesh and wise according to the flesh: “If you are willing, and
              listen to me, you will eat the good things of the land” (Is 1:19);
              “The posterity of Jacob dwells in a land of grain, wine and oil”
              (Dt 33:28). Or, it can refer to one who perceives true wisdom,
              which cannot be attained without first abandoning the things of
              the flesh: “Do not imitate this world” (Rom 12:2).

              860 We see his humility because he took the bread and gave it to
              the people. Now although in this miracle Christ could have fed the
              people with bread created from nothing, he chose to do so by
              multiplying bread that already existed. He did this, first, to
              show that sensible things do not come from the devil, as the
              Manichean error maintains. For if this were so, our Lord would not
              have used sensible things to praise God, especially since “The Son
              of God appeared to destroy the works of the devil” (1 Jn 3:8). He
              did it, secondly, to show that they are also wrong in claiming
              that the teachings of the Old Testament are not from God but from
              the devil. Thus, to show that the doctrine of the New Testament is
              none other than that which was prefigured and contained in the
              teachings of the Old Testament, he multiplied bread that already
              existed, implying by this that he is the one who fulfills the law
              and brings it to perfection: “I have not come to destroy the law,
              but to fulfill it,” as we read in Matthew (5:17).

              for the people who were there, for he had to convince them that he
              had come from God. Accordingly, he prays before he works this

                they said: “This is truly the Prophet who is to come into the
                world.” 15 So Jesus, knowing that they would come to seize him
                and make him king, fled again into the mountains, alone. 16 When

              fishes. Now he shows the threefold effect this miracle had on the
              people. First, its effect on their faith; secondly, on their plans
              to honor Jesus; thirdly, how it led them (and the disciples) to
              search for Jesus.

              867 With respect to the first, we should note that the Jews said
              in the Psalm: “We have not seen our signs; there is now no
              prophet” (Ps 73:9). For it was customary in earlier days for the
              prophets to work omany signs; so, when these signs were absent,
              prophecy se emed to have ended. But when the Jews.see such signs,
              they believe that prophecy is returning. Accordingly, the people
              were so impressed by this miracle they just saw that they called
              our Lord a prophet. Thus we read,
              <b>Now when these people,</b> who had been filled with the five
              <b
                >loaves, saw that Jesus had worked a miracle, they said: This is
                truly the Prophet.</b
              >
              However, they did not yet have perfect faith, for they believed
              that Jesus was only a prophet, while he was also the Lord of the
              prophets. Yet, they were not entirely wrong, because our Lord
              called himself a prophet.

              868 Here we should remark that a prophet is called a seer: “He who
              is now called a prophet was formerly called a seer” (I Sm 9:9).
              Further, seeing pertains to the cognitive power. Now in Christ
              there were three kinds of knowledge. First of all, there was sense
              knowledge. And in this respect he had some similarity to the
              prophets, insofar as sensible species could be formed in the
              imagination of Christ to present future or hidden events. This was
              especially due to his passibility, which was appropriate to his
              state as a “wayfarer.” Secondly, Christ had intellectual
              knowledge; and in this he was not like the prophets, but was even
              superior to all the angels: for he was a “comprehensor” in a more
              excellent way than any creature. Again, Christ had divine
              knowledge, and in this way he was the one who inspired the
              prophets and the angels, since all knowledge is caused by a
              participation in the divine Word.

              A person or thing is seized if it is taken in a way that one does

              time for this was not then opportune. Christ had come then, but
              not to reign in the way we ask for his reign when we say, “Your
              kingdom come” (Mt 6:10); at that time he will reign even as man.
              Another time was reserved for this: after the judgment of Christ,
              when the saints will appear in glory. It was about this kingdom
              the disciples asked when they said: “Lord, will you restore the
              kingdom to Israel at this time?” (Acts 1:6).

              king: “You have a mantle, be our ruler” (Is 3:6). Chrysostom says:
              “See the power of gluttony. They are no longer concerned about his
              breaking the Sabbath; they are no longer zealous for God. All

            </td>
            <td>
              Why did Christ flee from the people, since he really is a king?
              There are three reasons for this. First, because it would have
              detracted from his dignity to have accepted a kingdom from men:
              for he is so great a king that all other kings are kings by
              participating in his kingship: “It is by me that kings rule” (Prv
              8:15). Another reason is that it would have been hanuful to his
              teaching if he had accepted this dignity and support from men; for
              he had worked and taught in such a way that everything was
              attributed to divine power and not to the influence of men:
              “Praise from men I do not need” (above 5:41). The third reason was
              to teach us to despise the dignities of this world: “I have given
              you an example that as I have done to you, so you should do also”
              (below 13:15); “Do not seek dignity from men” (Sir 7:4). And so,
              he refused the glory of this world, but still endured its
              punishment of his own will: “Jesus endured the cross, despising
              the shame, for the joy set before him” (Heb 12:2).

              opinion of Augustine, there is no conflict here, because he had
              reason both to flee and to pray. For our Lord is teaching us that
              when a reason for flight draws near, there is great reason to

              874 Note, about the first, that Christ went up into the mountain
              without the knowledge of his disciples. So, they waited there
              until evening came, for they expected that he would come back to
              them. But their love was so great that when evening came they just
              had to go looking for him. Thus he says,
              <b>When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea,</b>
              looking for Jesus.

              In the mystical sense, “evening” signifies our Lord’s passion or
              his ascension. For as long as the disciples enjoyed Christ’s
              physical presence, no trouble disturbed them and no bitterness
              vexed them: “Can the friends of the groom mourn as long as the
              groom is with them?” (Mt 9:15). But when Christ was away, then
              they “went down to the sea,” to the troubles of this world: “This
              great sea, stretching wide” (Ps 103:25).

              According to Augustine, the twenty-five stadia they rowed are the
              five books of Moses. For twenty-five is the square of five, since
              five times five is twenty-five. But a number that is multiplied in
              this way keeps the meaning of its root. Thus, just as five
              signifies the old law, so twenty-five signifies the perfection of
              the New Testament. Thirty, however, signifies that perfection of
              the New Testament which was lacking in the law: for thirty is the
              result of multiplying five by six, which is a perfect number. So,
              Jesus comes to those who row twenty-five or thirty stadia, i.e.,
              to those who fulfill the law or the perfection taught by the
              Gospel; and he comes treading under foot all the waves of pride
              and the dignities of this present world: “You rule the might of
              the sea and calm its waves” (Ps 88:10). And then we will see
              Christ near our boat, because divine help is close: “The Lord is
              near to all who fear him” (Ps 144:18). Thus it is clear that
              Christ is near to all those who seek him rightly. Now the Apostles
              loved Christ very keenly: this is obvious because they tried to go
              to him despite the darkness, the stormy sea, and the distance to
              shore. Consequently, Christ was with them.

              Effectus autem exterior fuit quantum ad duo. Primo, quia sedata
              est tempestas; secundo, quia statim navis fuit ad terram, cum
              multum ab ea distaret: non enim fallacem, sed tranquillam praebuit
              eis navigationem; et volens maius miraculum operari, navem non
              ascendit. Sic ergo triplex hic concurrit miraculum: scilicet
              ambulatio supra mare, subita tempestatis cessatio, et distantis
              navis ad portum deductio: ut discamus, quod fideles in quibus est

              883 There were two exterior effects: the storm abated, and their
              boat suddenly landed, although it had just been at a distance from
              the shore, for our Lord gave them a calm journey, without danger.
              He himself did not enter the boat because he wished to accomplish
              a greater miracle. So here we have three miracles: the walking on
              the sea, the quick calming of the storm, and the sudden arrival of
              the boat on the land although it had been far away. We learn from
              this that the faithful, in whom Christ is present, put down the
              swelling pride of this world, tread under their feet its waves of
              tribulation, and cross quickly to the land of the living: “Your
              good spirit will lead me to land” (Ps 142:10).

              Sed hic est multiplex quaestio. Una est circa litteram, in qua
              videtur Matthaei contrarium dicere: nam, Mt. XIV, 22, dicitur quod
              discipuli venerunt ad mare de mandato domini; hic autem, quod
              descenderunt quaerentes eum. Alia quaestio est, quod Matthaeus

              terram Genesareth; hic autem dicitur, quod venerunt Capharnaum.

              navem; hic autem, quod non.

              884 There are a number of difficulties here. The first concerns
              the literal sense: Matthew (14:22) seems to conflict with our
              present account for he says that the disciples were told by Christ
              to go the shore, while here it says the disciples went there to
              search for him. Another difficulty is that Matthew (14:34) says
              that the disciples crossed over to Gennesaret, while we read here
              that they came to Capernaum. The third difficulty is that Matthew
              (14:32) says that Christ got into the boat, but here he did not.

              Sed de his tribus breviter expediens se Chrysostomus dicit, istud
              non fuisse idem miraculum cum illo Matthaei. Nam, ut ipse dicit,
              Christus frequenter huiusmodi miraculum fecit ambulans supra mare,
              non tamen coram turbis, sed coram discipulis suis, ne turbae
              crederent eum non verum corpus habere. Secundum Augustinum autem
              dicitur, et verius, idem miraculum fuisse quod hic Ioannes narrat,
              et ibi Matthaeus. Et ideo ad primam quaestionem respondens dicit,
              quod non refert quod dicit Matthaeus eos praecepto Christi ad mare
              descendisse. Potuit enim esse quod dominus hoc eis mandasset, et
              ipsi descenderint credentes Christum cum eis navigaturum: unde
              expectarent eum usque ad noctem. Et quia Christus non venit, tunc

              Chrysostom settles these difficulties quite briefly by saying that
              the two accounts do not deal with the same miracle. For, as he
              says, Christ frequently miraculously walked upon the sea in front
              of his disciples, but not for the people, lest they think he did
              not have a real body. But, according to Augustine, and this is the
              better opinion, John and Matthew are describing the same miracle.
              Augustine answers the first difficulty by saying it makes no
              difference that Matthew says the disciples went down to the shore
              because our Lord told them to. For it is possible that our Lord
              did so, and they went believing that he would sail with them. And
              that is why they waited until night, and when Christ did not come,
              they crossed by themselves.

              Ad secundam quaestionem est duplex responsio. Una est, quia

              forte discipuli pervenerunt trans mare in confinio utriusque, ideo
              Matthaeus nominat unam, et Ioannes aliam. Vel potest dici, quod

              There are two answers to the second difficulty. One is that
              Capernaum and Gennesaret are neighboring towns on the same shore.
              And perhaps the disciples landed at a place near both, so that
              Matthew mentions one and John the other. Or, it might be said that
              Matthew does not say that they came to Gennesaret immediately,
              they could have come first to Capernaurn and then to Gennesaret.

                22 On the next day, the crowd that stood on the other side of
                the sea saw that there was no second boat there, but only one,
                and that Jesus had not gone into the boat, but only his
                disciples had gone. 23 But other boats arrived from Tiberias,
                near the place where they had eaten the bread, after having
                given thanks to God. 24 When therefore the people saw that Jesus
                was not there, nor his disciples, they got into the boats and
                set off for Capernaum, looking for Jesus. 25 When they found him
                on the other side of the sea, they said: “Rabbi, when did you
                come here?” 26 Jesus replied and said:

              886 The crowd of people was looking for Christ because of the
              miracle mentioned above, that is, because he had crossed the sea
              without using any boat. They realized this because the other
              evening he had not been on the shore near where he had performed
              the miracle of the bread, and where there had been only one boat
              which had left for the opposite shore with the disciples, but
              without Christ. So that morning, when they could not find Christ
              on this side, since he was already on the other side although
              there was no other boat he could have used, they suspected that he
              had crossed by walking upon the sea. And this is what he says:
              <b>On the next day,</b> following the one on which he had worked
              the miracle of the bread,
              <b>the crowd that stood on the other side of the sea</b>, where he
              had performed this miracle,
              <b>saw that there was no second boat there, but only one,</b>

                had gone.</b

              This one ship signifies the Church, which is one by its unity of
              faith and sacraments: “One faith, one baptism” (Eph 4:5). Again,
              our Lord’s absence from his disciples signifies his physical
              absence from them at the ascension: “After the Lord Jesus spoke to
              them, he was taken up into heaven” (Mk 16:19).

              Augustine says, these people represent those who seek Jesus not
              for himself, but in order to gain certain worldly advantages: as
              those engaged in some business call on clerics and prelates, not
              for the sake of Christ, but so that through their intervention
              they might be advanced into the ranks of those who are important;
              and like those who hurry to the churches, not for Christ, but
              because they have been urged to do so by those who are more
              powerful; and like those who approach our Lord for sacred orders
              not because they desire the merits of the virtues, but because
              they are looking for the satisfactions of this present life, as
              wealth and praise, as Gregory says in his
              <i>Moralia</i>. This is obvious: for to perform miracles is a work
              of divine power, but to eat loaves of bread which have been
              multiplied is temporal. Accordingly, those who do not come to
              Christ because of the power they see in him, but because they eat
              his bread, are not serving Christ but their own stomachs, as we

              895 The power of this food is seen in the fact that it does not
              perish. In this respect we should point out that material things
              are likenesses of spiritual things, since they are caused and
              produced by them; and consequently they resemble spiritual things
              in some way. Now just as the body is sustained by food, so that
              which sustains the spirit is called its food, whatever it might
              be. The food that sustains the body is perishable, since it is
              converted into the nature of the body; but the food that sustains
              the spirit is not perishable, because it is not converted into the
              spirit; rather, the spirit is converted into its food. Hence
              Augustine says in his
              <i>Confessions</i>: “I am the food of the great; grow and you will
              eat me. But you will not change me into yourself, as you do bodily

              So our Lord says: work, i.e., seek by your work, or merit by your
              works,
              <b>not for the food that perishes,</b>
              i.e., bodily food: “Food is for the stomach, and the stomach for
              food, but God will destroy both” (1 Cor 6:13), because we will not
              always need food; but
              <b>work for that which,</b>
              that is, the spiritual food,
              <b>endures to eternal life.</b>
              This food is God himself, insofar as he is the Truth which is to
              be contemplated and the Goodness which is to be loved, which
              nourish the spirit: “Eat my bread” (Prv 9:5); “Wisdom will feed
              him with the bread of life and understanding” (Sir 15:5). Again,
              this food is the obedience to the divine commands: “My food is to
              do the will of him who sent me” (above 4:34). Also, it is Christ
              himself: “I am the bread of life” (6:35); “My flesh truly is food
              and my blood truly is drink” (6:56): and this is so insofar as the
              flesh of Christ is joined to the Word of God, which is the food by
              which the angels live. The difference between bodily and spiritual
              food which he gives here, is like the one he gave before between
              bodily and spiritual drink: “Whoever drinks this water will be
              thirsty again, but whoever drinks the water that I give, will
              never be thirsty again” (4:13). The reason for this is that bodily
              things are perishable, while spiritual things, and especially God,
              are eternal.

              Sed sciendum est, secundum Augustinum in libro de operibus
              monachorum, quod ex hoc verbo, scilicet
              <i>operamini non cibum qui perit</i>, quidam monachi erroris
              causam sumpserunt, dicentes, spirituales viros non debere aliquid
              corporaliter operari. Sed hic intellectus est falsus, quia Paulus,
              qui maxime spiritualis fuit, propriis manibus laboravit, ut
              habetur Ephes. IV, 28, ubi ipse dicit:
              <i
                >qui furabatur, iam non furetur; magis autem laboret manibus
                suis</i
              >. Ergo est verus intellectus, ut opus nostrum, idest principale
              studium et intentionem nostram dirigamus ad quaerendum cibum qui
              ducit ad vitam aeternam, scilicet bona spiritualia. Ad temporalia
              autem non debemus principaliter attendere, sed accessorie, idest
              solum ea procurare ratione corporis corruptibilis, quod sustentari
              oportet quamdiu in hac vita vivimus. Unde contra hoc signanter
              dicit apostolus, II Thess. III, 10:
              <i>qui non laborat non manducet</i>; quasi diceret: qui dicunt
              quod nihil corporale est operandum, quia comestio est quid
              corporale, tales non debent comedere.

              896 We should note that according to Augustine, in his work,
              <i>On the Labor of Monks,</i>
              that certain monks misunderstood our Lord’s saying,
              <b>Do not work for the food that perishes,</b>
              and claimed that spiritual men should not perform physical work.
              But this interpretation is false because Paul, who was most
              spiritual, worked with his hands: as we read in Ephesians, there
              he says (4:28): “Let him who stole, steal no longer, rather let
              him work with his hands.” The correct interpretation, therefore,
              is that we should direct our work, i.e., our main interest and
              intention, to seeking the food that leads to eternal life, that
              is, spiritual goods. In regard to temporal goods, they should not
              be our principal aim but a subordinate one, that is, they are to
              be acquired only because of our mortal body, which has to be
              nourished as long as we are living this present life. So the
              Apostle speaks against this opinion, saying: “If any one will not
              work, neither let him eat” (2 Thes 3:10); as if to say: those who
              maintain that physical work is not to be done should not eat,
              since eating is physical.

              distasteful, and was not able to take it in its spirituality. Thus
              it was necessary for the Son of Man to assume flesh and nourish us
              with it: “You have prepared a table before me” (Ps 22:5).

              when Christ said that his food would endure to eternal life, they
              understood that it would be a divine food. Thus when they question
              Christ, they do not mention this food, but rather the work of God,
              saying:
              <b>What must we do that we may perform the works of God?</b>
              Indeed, they were not far from the truth, since spiritual food is
              nothing else than performing and accomplishing the works of God:

                sent.</b

              Here we should reflect that in Romans (4:2), the Apostle
              distinguished faith from works, saying that Abraham was justified
              by his faith, not by his works. If this is so, why does our Lord
              say here that to have faith, i.e., to believe, is a work of God?
              There are two answers to this. One is that the Apostle is not
              distinguishing faith from absolutely all works, but only from
              external works. External works, being performed by our body, are
              more noticeable, and so the word “works” ordinarily refers to
              them. But there are other works, interior works, performed within
              the soul, and these are known only to the wise and those converted
              in heart.

              testifies. And it is still another thing to say: “I believe in
              God,” (<i>in Deum</i>), for this indicates the end. Thus God can
              be regarded as the object of faith, as the one who testifies, and
              as the end, but in different ways. For the object of faith can be
              a creature, as when I believe in the creation of the heavens.
              Again, a creature can he one who testifies, for I believe Paul (<i

              our mind is directed to God alone as its end. Now the end, since
              it has the character of a good, is the object of love. Thus, to
              believe in God (<i>in Deum</i>) as in an end is proper to faith
              living through the love of charity. Faith, living in this way, is
              the principle of all our good works; and in this sense to believe
              is said to be a work of God.

              ideo signanter dicit, credere esse opus Dei, ut ostendat fidem
              esse donum Dei, ut dicitur Eph. II, 8.

              902 But if faith is a work of God, how do men do the works of God?
              Isaiah (26:12) gives us the answer when he says: “You have
              accomplished all our works for us.” For the fact that we believe,
              and any good we do, is from God: “It is God who is working in us,
              both to will and to accomplish” (Phil 2:13). Thus he explicitly
              says that to believe is a work of God in order to show us that
              faith is a gift of God, as Ephesians (2:8) maintains.

              Three things are done about the first: first, the Jews look for a

              bring in what is narrated in Scripture.

              904 They look for a sign by asking Christ:

                believe you?</b
              >
              This question is explained differently by Augustine and by
              Chrysostom. Chrysostom says that our Lord was leading them to the
              faith. But the evidence that leads one to the faith are miracles:
              “Signs were given to unbelievers” (1 Cor 14:22). And so the Jews
              were looking for a sign in order to believe, for it is their
              custom to seek such signs: “For Jews demand signs” (1 Cor 14:22).
              So they say:
              <b>What sign then are you going to</b>
              give?

              But it seems foolish to ask for a miracle for this reason, for
              Christ had just performed some in their presence which could lead
              them to believe, as multiplying the bread and walking on the
              water. What they were asking was that our Lord always provide them
              with food. This is clear because the only sign they mention is the
              one given by Moses to their ancestors for forty years, and they
              ask in this way that Christ always provide food for them. Thus
              they say:
              <b>Our fathers ate manna in the desert.</b>
              They did not say that God provided their ancestors with the manna,
              so that they would not seem to be making Christ equal to God.
              Again, they did not say that Moses fed their ancestors, so they
              would not seem to be preferring Moses to Christ, trying in this
              way to influence our Lord. We read of this food: “Man ate the
              bread of angels” (Ps 77:25).

              905 According to Augustine, however, our Lord had said that he
              would give them food that would endure to eternal life. Thus, he
              seemed to put himself above Moses. The Jews, on the other hand,
              considered Moses greater than Christ; so they said: “We know that
              God spoke to Moses, but we do not know where this man is from”
              (below 9:29). Accordingly, they required Christ to accomplish
              greater things than Moses; and so they recall what Moses did,
              saying:
              <b>Our Fathers ate manna in the desert.</b>
              As if to say: What you say about yourself is greater than what
              Moses did, for you are promising a food that does not perish,
              while the manna that Moses gave became wormy if saved for the next
              day. Therefore, if we are to believe you, do something greater
              than Moses did. Although you have fed five thousand men once with
              five barley loaves, this is not greater than what Moses did, for
              he fed all the people with manna from heaven for forty years, and
              in the desert too: “He gave them the bread of heaven” (Ps 77:24).

              had been given to their ancestors: the one who gave this food,

              mention these two, for he says that there is another who gives
              this food and another place. He says:

              was a true miracle. But if “true” is contrasted with “symbolic,”
              then that bread was not true, but was a symbol of spiritual bread,
              that is, of our Lord Jesus Christ, whom that manna signified, as
              the Apostle says: “All ate the same spiritual food” (1 Cor 10:3).

              909 When the Psalm (77:24) says, “He gave them the bread of
              heaven,” this seems to conflict with,
              <b>Moses did not give you bread from heaven.</b>
              I answer that the word “heaven” can be understood in three ways.
              Sometimes it can mean the air, as in “The birds of heaven ate
              them” (Mt 13:4); and also in, “The Lord thundered from heaven” (Ps
              14:14). Sometimes “heaven” means the starry sky; as in, “The
              highest heaven is the Lord’s” (Ps 113:16), and in, “The stars will
              fall from heaven” (Mt 24:19). Thirdly, it can signify goods of a
              spiritual nature, as in “Rejoice and be glad, because your reward
              is great in heaven” (Mt 5:12). So the manna was from heaven, not
              the heaven of the stars or of spiritual food, but from the air.
              Or, the manna was said to be from heaven insofar as it was a
              symbol of the true bread from heaven, our Lord Jesus Christ.

                gives life to the world,</b
              >
              he proves that it is from heaven by its effect. For the true
              heaven is spiritual in nature, and has life by its own essence;
              therefore, of itself, it gives life: “It is the spirit that gives
              life” (below 6:64). Now God himself is the author of life.
              Therefore, we know that this spiritual bread is from heaven when
              it produces its proper effect, if it gives life. That bodily bread
              used by the Jews did not give life, since all who ate the manna
              died. But this [spiritual] bread does give life, so he says:
              <b>the true bread,</b> not that symbolic bread,
              <b>is that which descends from heaven.</b>
              This is clear, because it
              <b>gives life to the world:</b> for Christ, who is the true bread,
              gives life to whom he wills: “I came that they may have life”
              (below 10:10). He also descended from heaven: “No one has gone up
              to heaven except the One who came down from heaven” (above 3:13).
              Thus Christ, the true bread, gives life to the world by reason of
              his divinity; and he descends from heaven by reason of his human
              nature, for as we said on the prior text, he came down from heaven
              by assuming human nature: “He emptied himself, taking the form of
              a servant” (Phil 2:7).

              wishing to slake her thirst, said, “Give me this water” (above

              about food in a material way, and asked for it this way, we are
              expected to ask for it as understood in a spiritual way: “Give us
              this day our daily bread” (Mt 6:11), because we cannot live
              without this bread.

              914 Jesus said to them:
              <b>I am the bread of life,</b>
              for as we saw above, the word of wisdom is the proper food of the
              mind, because the mind is sustained by it: “He fed him with the
              bread of life and understanding” (Sir 15:3). Now the bread of
              wisdom is called the bread of life to distinguish it from material
              bread, which is the bread of death, and which serves only to
              restore what has been lost by a mortal organism; hence material
              bread is necessary only during this mortal life. But the bread of
              divine wisdom is life-giving of itself, and no death can affect
              it. Again, material bread does not give life, but only sustains
              for a time a life that already exists. But spiritual bread
              actually gives life: for the soul begins to live because it
              adheres to the word of God: “For with you is the fountain of
              life,” as we see in the Psalm (35:10). Therefore, since every word
              of wisdom is derived from the Only Begotten Word of God—The
              fountain of wisdom is the Only Begotten of God” (Sir 1:5)—this
              Word of God is especially called the bread of life. Thus Christ
              says,
              <b>I am the bread of life.</b>
              And because the flesh of Christ is united to the Word of God, it
              also is life-giving. Thus, too, his body, sacramentally received,
              is life-giving: for Christ gives life to the world through the
              mysteries which he accomplished in his flesh. Consequently, the
              flesh of Christ, because of the Word of the Lord, is not the bread
              of ordinary life, but of that life which does not die. And so the
              flesh of Christ is called bread: “The bread of Asher is rich” (Gn
              49:20).

              915 Next (v 35), he gives the reason for this from the effect of

              permanently take away our hunger, since it must be destroyed in

              come to God with bodily steps, but with those of the mind, the
              first of which is faith. To eat and to drink are also the same:

              desiderium restat ex sumendo. Alia vero est, quia corrumpuntur,
              unde remanet memoria ex corrupto, et generatur iterato desiderium
              eorum. Spiritualia vero et simul sumuntur, et non corrumpuntur nec

                tua</i

              One reason why temporal things do not take away our thirst
              permanently is that they are not consumed altogether, but only bit
              by bit, and with motion, so that there is always still more to be
              consumed. For this reason, just as there is enjoyment and
              satisfaction from what has been consumed, so there is a desire for
              what is still to come. Another reason is that they are destroyed;
              hence the recollection of them remains and generates a repeated
              longing for those things. Spiritual things, on the other hand, are
              taken all at once, and they are not destroyed, nor do they run
              out; and consequently the fulness they produce remains forever:
              “They will neither hunger nor thirst” (Rv 7:16); “Your face will
              fill me with joy; the delights in your right hand (i.e., in
              spiritual goods) will last forever,” as the Psalm (16:11) says.

              916 Then (v 36), we see why Christ had to explain these things.
              For someone could say: We asked for bread; but you did not answer,
              “I will give it to you,” or “I will not.” Rather, you say, I am
              the bread of life; and so your answer does not seem to be
              appropriate. But our Lord shows that it is a good answer, saying,
              <b
                >I have told you that you have both seen me and do not
                believe.</b
              >
              This is the same as a person having bread right in front of him
              without his knowing it, and then being told: Look! The bread is
              right before you. And so Christ says:
              <b
                >I have told you (I am the bread of life) that you have both
                seen me and do not believe,</b
              >
              i.e., you want bread, and it is right before you; and yet you do
              not take it because you do not believe. In saying this he is
              censuring them for their unbelief: “They have seen and hated both
              me and my Father” (below 15:24).

              918 Concerning the first, we should note that the very fact that
              we believe is a gift of God to us: “You are saved by grace,
              through faith; and this is not due to yourself, for it is the gift
              of God” (Eph 2:8); “It has been granted to you not only to believe
              in him, but also to suffer for him” (Phil 1:29). Sometimes, God
              the Father is said to give those who believe to the Son, as here:
              <b>All that the Father gives me shall come to me.</b>
              At other times, the Son is said to give them to the Father, as in
              1 Corinthians (15~24): “He will hand over the kingdom to God and
              the Father.” We can see from this that just as the Father does not
              deprive himself of the kingdom in giving to the Son, neither does
              the Son in giving to the Father. The Father gives to the Son
              insofar as the Father makes a person adhere to his Word: “Through
              whom (that is, the Father) you have been called into the
              fellowship of his Son” (1 Cor 1:9). The Son, on the other hand,
              gives to the Father insofar as the Word makes the Father known: “I
              have made known your name to those you have given me” (below
              17:6). Thus Christ says:
              <b>All that the Father gives me shall come to me,</b>
              i.e., those who believe in me, whom the Father makes adhere to me
              by his gift.

              only the habit, which is faith, but also the interior impulse to
              believe. So, everything which contributes to salvation is a gift
              of God.

              God whom the Father gives him. Thus, those who do not come are not
              responsible, since they are not given to him. I answer that they
              are not responsible if they cannot come to the faith without the
              help of God. But those who do not come are responsible, because
              they create an obstacle to their own coming by turning away from
              salvation, the way to which is of itself open to all.

              secretum sine taedio, sine amaritudine malarum cogitationum, sine

              rectitudo conscientiae, quae est spirituale gaudium; et de hoc

              We should point out that since all visible things are said to be
              exterior with respect to spiritual things, then the more spiritual
              something is the more interior it is. What is interior is twofold.
              The first is the most profound, and is the joy of eternal life.
              According to Augustine, this is a sweet and most interior retreat,
              without any weariness, without the bitterness of evil thoughts,
              and uninterrupted by temptations and sorrows. We read of this:
              “Share the joy of your Lord” (Mt 25:21); and, “You will hide them
              in the secret of your face,” that is, in the full vision of your
              essence (Ps 30:2 1). From this interior no one is cast out: “He
              who conquers, I will make him a pillar in the temple of the living
              God; and he will no longer leave it” (Rv 3:12), because “the just
              will go to everlasting life,” as we see from Matthew (25:46). The
              other interior is that of an upright conscience; and this is a
              spiritual joy. We read of this: “When I enter into my house I will
              enjoy repose” (Wis 8:16); and “The king has brought me into his
              storerooms” (Sg 1:3). It is from this interior, that some are cast
              out.

              So, when our Lord says,
              <b>the one who comes to me I will not cast out,</b>
              we can understand this in two ways. In one way, those who come to
              him are those who have been given to him by the Father through
              eternal predestination. Of these he says:
              <b>the one who comes to me,</b>
              predestined by the Father,
              <b>I will not cast out:</b>
              “God has not rejected his people, the people he chose” (Rom 11:2).
              In a second way, those who do go out are not cast out by Christ,
              rather, they cast themselves out, because through their unbelief
              and sins they abandon the sanctuary of an upright conscience. Thus
              we read:
              <b>I will not cast out</b>
              such; but they do cast themselves out: “You are the burden, and I
              will cast you aside, says the Lord” (Jer 23:33). It was in this
              way that the man who came to the wedding feast without wedding
              clothes was cast out (Mt 22:13).

              Circa primum sciendum est, quod littera ista potest legi
              dupliciter. Uno modo secundum Augustinum, alio modo secundum
              Chrysostomum. Secundum Augustinum quidem sic:
              <i>eum qui venit ad me, non eiiciam foras</i>, et hoc ideo, quia
              ille venit ad me qui meam humilitatem imitatur. Matth. XI, 28, cum
              diceret dominus: <i>venite ad me, omnes, qui laboratis</i>,
              consequenter subdit:
              <i>discite a me, quia mitis sum et humilis corde</i>. Vera autem
              filii Dei mititas in hoc est, quia voluntatem suam supposuit
              voluntati patris. Et ideo dicit
              <i
                >non eiiciam, quia descendi de caelo non ut faciam voluntatem
                meam, sed voluntatem eius qui misit me</i
              >. Propterea anima a Deo exiit, quia superba erat; et ideo necesse
              est humilitate regredi veniendo ad Christum per imitationem suae
              humilitatis, quae in hoc est quod non facit voluntatem suam solum,
              sed Dei patris.

              923 Concerning the first, we should note that this passage can be
              read in two ways: either as Augustine does, or following the
              interpretation of Chrysostom. Augustine understands it this way:
              <b>the one who comes to me I will not cast out;</b>
              and this is because the one who comes to me imitates my humility.
              In Matthew (11:29), after our Lord said, “Come to me, all you who
              labor,” he added, “Learn from me, for I am gentle and humble of
              heart.” Now the true gentleness of the Son of God consists in the
              fact that he submitted his will to the will of the Father. Thus he
              says,
              <b
                >the one who comes to me I will not cast out, because I have
                come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of
                him who sent me.</b
              >
              Since a soul abandons God because of its pride, it must return in
              humility, coming to Christ by imitating his humility; and this
              humility of Christ was in not doing his own will, but the will of
              God the Father.

              Sciendum est autem, quod in Christo fuit duplex voluntas. Una
              secundum humanam naturam, quae est sibi propria, et natura, et
              voluntate patris; alia secundum naturam divinam, quae est eadem
              cum voluntate patris. Voluntatem ergo suam, scilicet humanam,
              ordinavit sub voluntate divina, quia obedientiam suam sub effectu
              paternae voluntatis ostendit ipse, volens voluntatem patris
              explere. Ps. XXXIX, 9:
              <i>ut faciam voluntatem tuam, Deus meus, volui</i>. Hanc
              voluntatem fieri in nobis petimus cum dicimus, Matth. VI, 10:
              <i>fiat voluntas tua</i>. Illi ergo non eiiciuntur foras, qui non
              faciunt voluntatem suam, sed voluntatem Dei. Nam Diabolus volens
              facere voluntatem suam, quod est superbiae, eiectus est de caelo,
              et primus homo de Paradiso.

            <td>
              Here we should note that there were two wills in Christ. One
              pertains to his human nature, and this will is proper to him, both
              by nature and by the will of the Father. His other will pertains
              to his divine nature, and this will is the same as the will of the
              Father. Christ subordinated his own will, that is, his human will,
              to the divine will, because, wishing to accomplish the will of the
              Father, he was obedient to the Father’s will: “My God, I desired
              to do your will” (Ps 39:9). We ask that this will be accomplished
              in our regard when we say, “Your will be done” (Mt 6:10). Thus,
              those who do the will of God, not their own will, are not cast
              out. The devil, who wanted to do his own will out of pride, was
              cast from heaven; and so too the first man was expelled from
              paradise.

              Secundum Chrysostomum vero sic. Ideo non eiicio foras eum qui

              Chrysostom explains the passage this way. The reason I do not cast
              out one who comes to me is because I have come to accomplish the
              will of the Father concerning the salvation of men. So, if I have
              become incarnate for the salvation of men, how can I cast them
              out? And this is what he says: I will not cast out one who comes,
              <b
                >because I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will,
                my</b
              >
              human will, so as to obtain my own benefit,
              <b>but the will of him who sent me</b>, that is, the Father, “He
              desires the salvation of all men” (1 Tim 2:4). And therefore, so
              far as I am concerned, I do not cast out any person: “For if, when
              we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his
              Son, now much more, having been reconciled, we will be saved by
              his life” (Rom 5:10).

              925 He says: I will not cast out those who come to me, because I

              of those given to Christ through eternal predestination will be
              among them: “The way of the wicked will perish” (Ps 1:7). Those,
              on the other hand, who are preserved until then, will not be lost.

              homines, quia ipse est fons vitae. Et quia aeternus est, quantum

              927 Now he gives the reason for the divine will (v 40). The reason
              why the Father wills that I lose nothing of all that he has given
              me is that the Father wills to bring men to life spiritually,
              because he is the fountain of life. And since the Father is
              eternal, he wills, absolutely speaking, that every one who comes
              to me should have eternal life. And this is what he says:
              <b
                >For this is the will of my Father, who sent me, that every one
                who sees the Son and believes in him, should have eternal
                life.</b
              >
              Note that he said above: “Whoever hears my voice and believes in
              him who sent me, possesses eternal life” (above 5:24), while here
              he says:
              <b>every one who sees the Son and believes in him.</b>
              We can understand from this that the Father and the Son have the
              same divine nature; and it is the vision of this, through its
              essence, that is our ultimate end and the object of our faith.
              When he says here,
              <b>sees the Son,</b>
              he is referring to the physical sight of Christ which leads to
              faith, and not to this vision through essence which faith
              precedes. Thus he expressly says,
              <b>every one who sees the Son and believes in him:</b>
              “Whoever believes in him... will not encounter judgment, but has
              passed from death to life” (above 5:24); “These things are written
              that you may believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and that
              believing you may have life in his name” (below 20:3 1).

              930 He continues that some of the people were grumbling over what
              Christ had said, that is, because Christ had said,
              <b>I am the living bread that has come down from heaven,</b>
              a spiritual bread they did not understand or desire. And so they
              grumbled because their minds were not fixed on spiritual things.
              They were following in this case the custom of their ancestors:
              “They grumbled in their tents” (Ps 105:25); “Do not grumble, as
              some of them did” (1 Cor 10:10). As Chrysostom says, they had not
              complained till now because they still hoped to obtain material
              food; but as soon as they lost that hope, they began to grumble,
              although they pretended that it was for a different reason. Yet
              they did not contradict him openly due to the respect they had for
              him arising from his previous miracle.

              I answer that what we read here about the Father drawing us does
              not imply coercion, because there are some ways of being drawn
              that do not involve compulsion. Consequently, the Father draws men
              to the Son in many ways, using the different ways in which we can
              be drawn without compulsion. One person may draw another by
              persuading him with a reason. The Father draws us to his Son in
              this way by showing us that he is his Son. He does this in two
              ways. First, by an interior revelation, as in: “Blessed are you,
              Simon Bar-Jona, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you
              (that is, that Christ is the Son of the living God), but it was
              done so by my Father” (Mt 16:17). Secondly, it can be done through
              miracles, which the Son has the power to do from the Father: “The
              very works which my Father has given me to perform... they bear
              witness to me” (above 5:36).

              Item aliquis trahit alium alliciendo; Prov. VII, 21:
              <i>blanditiis labiorum suorum protraxit eum</i>. Et hoc modo illi
              qui attendunt ad Iesum propter auctoritatem paternae maiestatis,
              trahuntur a patre. Quicumque enim credit in Christum propter hoc
              quod credit eum filium Dei, hunc pater trahit ad filium, idest
              paterna maiestas. Hoc modo non trahitur Arius qui Christum non

              a filio, admirabili delectatione et amore veritatis, quae est ipse

              authority of the paternal greatness. For the Father, i.e., the
              paternal greatness, draws those who believe in Christ because they
              believe that he is the Son of God. Arius—who did not believe that
              Christ was the true Son of God, nor begotten of the substance of
              the Father—was not drawn in this way. Neither was Photinus—who
              dogmatized that Christ was a mere man. So, this is the way those
              who are captivated by his greatness are drawn by the Father. But
              they are also drawn by the Son, through a wonderful joy and love
              of the truth, which is the very Son of God himself. For if, as
              Augustine says, each of us is drawn by his own pleasure, how much
              more strongly ought we to be drawn to Christ if we find our
              pleasure in truth, happiness, justice, eternal life: all of which
              Christ is! Therefore, if we would be drawn by him, let us be drawn
              through love for the truth, according to: “Take delight in the
              Lord, and he will give you the desires of your heart” (Ps 36:4).
              And so in the Song of Solomon, the bride says: “Draw me after you,
              and we will run to the fragrance of your perfume” (1:4).

              An external revelation or an object are not the only things that
              draw us. There is also an interior impulse that incites and moves
              us to believe. And so the Father draws many to the Son by the
              impulse of a divine action, moving a person’s heart from within to
              believe: “It is God who is working in us, both to will and to
              accomplish” (Phil 2:13); “1 will draw them with the cords of Adam,

              936 The second problem is this. We read that it is the Son who
              draws us to the Father: “No one knows the Father but the Son, and
              he to whom the Son wishes to reveal him” (Mt 11:26); “1 have made
              your name known to those you have given me” (below 17:6). So how
              can it say here that it is the Father who draws us to the Son?
              This can be answered in two ways: for we can speak of Christ
              either as a man, or as God. As man, Christ is the way: “I am the
              way” (below 14:6); and as the Christ, he leads us to the Father,
              as a way or road leads to its end. The Father draws us to Christ
              as man insofar as he gives us his own power so that we may believe
              in Christ: “You are saved by grace, through faith; and this is not
              due to yourself, for it is the gift of God”’ (Eph 2:8). Insofar as
              he is Christ, he is the Word of God and manifests the Father. It
              is in this way that the Son draws us to the Father. But the Father
              draws us to the Son insofar as he manifests the Son.

              937 The third problem concerns his saying that no one can come to
              Christ unless the Father draws him. For according to this, if one
              does not come to Christ, it is not because of himself, but is due
              to the one who does not draw him. I answer and say that, in truth,
              no one can come unless drawn by the Father. For just as a heavy
              object by its nature cannot rise up, but has to be lifted by
              someone else, so the human heart, which tends of itself to lower
              things, cannot rise to what is above unless it is drawn or lifted.
              And if it does not rise up, this is not due to the failure of the
              one lifting it, who, so far as lies in him, fails no one; rather,
              it is due to an obstacle in the one who is not drawn or lifted up.

              In this matter we can distinguish between those in the state of
              integral nature, and those in the state of fallen nature. In the
              state of integral nature, there was no obstacle to being drawn up,
              and thus all could share in it. But in the state of fallen nature,
              all are equally held back from this drawing by the obstacle of
              sin; and so, all need to be drawn. God, in so far as it depends on
              him, extends his hand to every one, to draw every one; and what is
              more, he not only draws those who receive him by the hand, but
              even converts those who are turned away from him, according to:
              “Convert us, O Lord, to yourself, and we will be converted” (Lam
              5:21); and “You will turn, O God, and bring us to life,” as one
              version of the Psalm (84:7) puts it. Therefore, since God is ready
              to give grace to all, and draw them to himself, it is not due to
              him if someone does not accept; rather, it is due to the person
              who does not accept.

              Quare autem non omnes aversos trahit, sed aliquos, licet sint

              938 A general reason can be given why God does not draw all who
              are turned away from him, but certain ones, even though all are
              equally turned away. The reason is so that the order of divine
              justice may appear and shine forth in those who are not drawn,
              while the immensity of the divine mercy may appear and shine in
              those who are drawn. But as to why in particular he draws this
              person and does not draw that person, there is no reason except
              the pleasure of the divine will. So Augustine says: “Whom he draws
              and whom he does not draw, why he draws one and does not draw
              another, do not desire to judge if you do not wish to err. But
              accept and understand: If you are not yet drawn, then pray that
              you may be drawn.” We can illustrate this by an example. One can
              give as the reason why a builder puts some stones at the bottom,
              and others at the top and sides, that it is the arrangement of the
              house, whose completion requires this. But why he puts these
              particular stones here, and those over there, this depends on his
              mere will. Thus it is that the prime reason for the arrangement is
              referred to the will of the builder. So God, for the completion of
              the universe, draws certain ones in order that his mercy may
              appear in them; and others he does not draw in order that his
              justice may be shown in them. But that he draws these and does not
              draw those, depends on the pleasure of his will. In the same way,
              the reason why in his Church he made some apostles, some
              confessors, and others martyrs, is for the beauty and completion
              of the Church. But why he made Peter an apostle, and Stephen a
              martyr, and Nicholas a confessor, the only reason is his will. We
              are now clear on the limitations of our human ability, and the
              assistance given to us by divine help.

              not only to a natural life, but even too the life of glory; and
              this on the last day. For the Catholic Faith teaches that the
              world will be made new: “Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth”
              (Rv 2 1:1), and that among the changes accompanying this renewal
              we believe that the motion of the heavens will stop, and
              consequently, time. “And the angel I saw standing on the sea and

              says that he swore that “time will be no more” (v 6). Since at the

              consequently, they should be disposed according to the different

              942 The manner in which we are drawn is appropriate, for God draws

              Bede says that this comes from Joel. But it does not seem to be
              there explicitly, although there is something like it in: “O
              children oi Zion, rejoice and be joyful in the Lord your God,
              because he will give you a teacher of justice” (JI 2:23). Again,
              according to Bede, he says, in the prophets, so that we might
              understand that the same meaning can be gathered from various
              statements of the prophets. But it is Isaiah who seems to state
              this more explicitly: “All your children will be taught by the
              Lord” (is 54:13). We also read: “I will give you shepherds after
              my own heart, and they will feed you with knowledge and doctrine”

              omnes de mundo erunt docibiles, ergo omnes venient ad Christum.
              Sed hoc est falsum, quia non omnium est fides. Sed ad hoc
              tripliciter respondetur. Nam, secundum Chrysostomum, primo modo

              <i>omnes</i>, idest plurimi; secundum quem modum dicitur Matth.
              VIII, 11: <i>multi venient ab oriente et occidente</i>, et cetera.
              Secundo, quod <i>omnes</i>, quantum est ex Deo,
              <i>erunt docibiles</i>; sed quod aliqui non doceantur, est ex
              parte eorum. Sol enim quantum est de se, omnes illuminat; potest
              autem ab aliquibus non videri, si claudant oculos, vel si sint
              caeci. Et hoc modo dicit apostolus, I Tim. II, 4:
              <i
                >vult omnes homines salvos fieri, et ad agnitionem veritatis
                venire</i
              >. Tertio modo, secundum Augustinum, quod haec est accommoda
              distributio, ut dicatur <i>omnes erunt docibiles Dei</i>; idest
              omnes qui docentur, a Deo docentur, sicut loquimur de aliquo
              litterarum magistro. Dicimus enim, si est in civitate: solus iste
              docet omnes pueros de civitate, quia nullus docetur in ea nisi ab
              illo. Et hoc modo dicitur supra I, 9:
              <i
                >erat lux vera, quae illuminat omnem hominem venientem in hunc
                mundum</i

              If we understand it in the first way, it does not seem to be true,
              for he immediately adds,
              <b
                >Every one who has heard the Father and has learned, comes to
                me.</b
              >
              Therefore, if every one in the world is taught [by God], then
              every one will come to Christ. But this is false, for not every
              one has faith. There are three answers to this. First, one could
              say, as Chrysostom does, that he is speaking of the majority: all,
              i.e., very many shall be taught, just as we find in Matthew: “Many
              will come from the East and the West” (Mt 8:11). Secondly, it
              could mean, all, so far as God is concerned, shall be taught, but
              if some are not taught, that is due to themselves. For the sun, on
              its part, shines on all, but some are unable to see it if they
              close their eyes, or are blind. From this point of view, the
              Apostle says: “He desires the salvation of all men, and that all
              come to the knowledge of the truth” (1 Tim 2:4). Thirdly, we could
              say, with Augustine, that we must make a restricted application,
              so that
              <b>They shall all be taught by God,</b>
              means that all who are taught, are taught by God. It is just as we
              might speak of a teacher of the liberal arts who is working in a
              city: he alone teaches all the boys of the city, because no one
              there is taught by anyone else. It is in this sense that it was
              said above: “He was the true light, which enlightens every man
              coming into this world” (1:9).

              inhaeret doctrinae humanae, sed doctrinae Dei. Doctrina enim
              veteris testamenti data fuit per prophetas; sed doctrina novi
              testamenti est per ipsum filium Dei; Hebr. I, 1:

              docet interius; Matth. c. XXIII, 10:
              <i>unus est magister vester Christus</i>. Nam intelligentia, quae
              necessaria est praecipue ad doctrinam, est nobis a Deo.

              944 If we explain these words as referring to those who are
              gathered into the Church, it says: They shall all, all who are in
              the Church, be taught by God. For we read: “All your children will
              be taught by the Lord” (Is 54:13). This shows the sublimity of the
              Christian faith, which does not depend on human teachings, but on
              the teaching of God. For the teaching of the Old Testament was
              given through the prophets; but the teaching of the New Testament
              is given through the Son of God himself. “In many and various ways
              (i.e., in the Old Testament) God spoke to our fathers through the
              prophets; in these days he has spoken to us in his Son” (Heb 1:1);
              and again in (2:3): “It was first announced by the Lord, and was
              confirmed to us by those who heard him.” Thus, all who are in the
              Church are taught, not by the apostles nor by the prophets, but by
              God himself. Further, according to Augustine, what we are taught
              by men is from God, who teaches from within: “You have one
              teacher, the Christ” (Mt 23:10). For understanding, which we
              especially need for such teaching, is from God.

              He comes in three ways: through a knowledge of the truth; through
              the affection of love; and through imitative action. And in each
              way it is necessary that one hear and learn. The one who comes
              through a knowledge of the truth must hear, when God speaks
              within: “I will hear what the Lord God will speak within me” (Ps
              84:9); and he must learn, through affection, as was said. The one
              who comes through love and desire—“If any one thirsts, let him
              come to me and drink” (below 7:37)—must hear the word of the
              Father and grasp it, in order to learn and be moved in his
              affections. For that person learns the word who grasps it
              according to the meaning of the speaker. But the Word of the
              Father breathes forth love. Therefore, the one who grasps it with
              eager love, learns. “Wisdom goes into holy souls, and makes them
              prophets and friends of God” (Wis 7:27). One comes to Christ
              through imitative action, according to: “Come to me, all you who
              labor and are burdened, and I will refresh you” (Mt 11:28). And
              whoever learns even in this way comes to Christ: for as the
              conclusion is to things knowable, so is action to things
              performable. Now whoever learns perfectly in the sciences arrives
              at the conclusion; therefore, as regards things that are
              performable, whoever learns the words perfectly arrives at the
              right action: “The Lord has opened my ear; and I do not resist”
              (Is 50:5).

              will hear and learn from the Father through a vision, he adds:
              <b>Not that any one has seen the Father,</b>
              that is, a person living in this life does not see the Father in
              his essence, according to: “Man will not see me and live” (Ex
              33:20),
              <b>except the one,</b>
              that is the Son,
              <b>who is from God—he has seen the Father,</b>
              through his essence. Or,
              <b>Not that any one has seen the Father,</b>
              with a comprehensive vision: neither man nor angel has ever seen
              or can see in this way;
              <b>except the one who is from God,</b>
              i.e., the Son: “No one knows the Father except the Son” (Mt
              11:27).

              The reason for this, of course, is that all vision or knowledge
              comes about through a likeness: creatures have a knowledge of God
              according to the way they have a likeness to him. Thus the
              philosophers say that the intelligences know the First Cause
              according to this likeness which they have to it. Now every
              creature possesses some likeness to God, but it is infinitely
              distant from a likeness to his nature, and so no creature can know
              him perfectly and totally, as he is in his own nature. The Son,
              however, because he has received the entire nature of the Father
              perfectly, through an eternal generation, sees and comprehends
              totally.

              948 Note how the words used are appropriate: for above, when he
              was speaking of the knowledge others have, he used the word
              “heard”; but now, in speaking of the Son’s knowledge, he uses the
              word “seen,” for knowledge which comes through seeing is direct
              and open, while that which comes through hearing comes through one
              who has seen. And so we have received the knowledge we have about
              the Father from the Son, who saw him. Thus, no one can know the
              Father except through Christ, who makes him known; and no one can
              come to the Son unless he has heard from the Father, who makes the
              Son known.

              949 After our Lord quieted the grumbling of the Jews, he now
              clears up the doubt they had because of his saying, “I am the
              bread that has come down from heaven.” he intends to show here
              that this is true. This is the way he reasons: The bread which
              gives life to the world descended from heaven; but I am the bread
              that gives life to the world: therefore, I am the bread which
              descended from heaven. He does three things concerning this.
              First, he presents the minor premise of his reasoning, that is,
              <b>I am the bread of life.</b> In the second place, he gives the
              major premise, that is, that the bread that descended from heaven
              ought to give life (v 49). Thirdly, we have the conclusion (v 5
              1). As to the first he does two things. First, he states his
              point; secondly, he expresses it as practically proved (v 48).

              Now Christ is within us in two ways: in our intellect through
              faith, so far as it is faith; and in our affections through love,
              which informs or gives life to our faith: “He who abides in love,
              abides in God, and God in him” (1 Jn 4:16). So he who believes in
              Christ so that he tends to him, possesses Christ in his affections
              and in his intellect. And if we add that Christ is eternal life,
              as stated in “that we may be in his true Son, Jesus Christ. This
              is the true God and eternal life” (1 Jn 5:20), and in “In him was
              life” (above 1:4), we can infer that whoever believes in Christ
              has eternal life. He has it, I say, in its Cause and in hope, and

              <b>in the desert:</b> for they were not given manna for a long
              period of time; and they had it only while in the desert, and not
              when they entered the promised land (Jos 5). But the other bread
              [from the true heaven] preserves and nourishes one forever.
              Thirdly, he states an inadequacy in that bread, that is, it did
              not preserve life without end; so he says, and they are dead. For
              we read in Joshua (c 5) that all who grumbled, except Joshua and
              Caleb, died in the desert. This was the reason for the second
              circumcision, as we see here, because all who had left Egypt died
              in the desert.

              954 One might wonder what kind of death God is speaking of here.
              If he is speaking of physical death, there will be no difference
              between the bread the Jews had in the desert and our bread, which
              came down from heaven, because even Christians who share the
              latter bread die physically. But if he is speaking of spiritual
              death, it is clear that both then among the Jews and now among the
              Christians, some die spiritually and others do not. For Moses and
              many others who were pleasing to God did not die, while others
              did. Also, those who eat this bread [of the Christians]
              unworthily, die spiritually: “He who eats and drinks unworthily,
              eats and drinks judgment upon himself” (1 Cor 11:29).

              We may answer this by saying that the food of the Jews has some
              features in common with our spiritual food. They are alike in the
              fact that each signifies the same thing: for both signify Christ.
              Thus they are called the same food: “All ate the same spiritual
              food” (1 Cor 10:3). He calls them the same because each is a
              symbol of the spiritual food. But they are different because one
              [the manna] was only a symbol; while the other [the bread of the
              Christians] contains that of which it is the symbol, that is,
              Christ himself. Thus we should say that each of these foods can be
              taken in two ways. First, as a sign only, i.e., so that each is
              taken as food only, and without understanding what is signified;
              and taken in this way, they do not take away either physical or
              spiritual death. Secondly, they may be taken in both ways, i.e.,
              the visible food is taken in such a way that spiritual food is
              understood and spiritually tasted, in order that it may satisfy
              spiritually. In this way, those who ate the manna spiritually did
              not die spiritually. But those who eat the Eucharist spiritually,
              both live spiritually now without sin, and will live physically
              forever. Thus, our food is greater than their food, because it
              contains in itself that of which it is the symbol.

              955 Having presented the argument, he draws the conclusion:
              <b>This is the bread that comes, down from heaven.</b>
              He says,
              <b>This,</b> the Gloss says, to indicate himself. But our Lord
              does not understand it this way as it would be superfluous, since
              he immediately adds,
              <b>I am the living bread that has come down from heaven.</b>
              So we should say that our Lord wants to say that the bread which
              can do this, i.e., give life, comes from heaven; but I am that
              bread: thus, I am that bread that comes down from heaven. Now the
              reason why that bread which comes down from heaven gives a life
              which never ends is that all food nourishes according to the
              properties of its nature; but heavenly things are incorruptible:
              consequently, since this food is heavenly, it is not corrupted,
              and as long as it lasts, it gives life. So, he who eats it, will
              not die. Just as if there were some bodily food which never
              corrupted, then in nourishing it would always be life-giving. This
              bread was signified by the tree of life in the midst of Paradise,
              which somehow gave life without end: “He must not be allowed to
              stretch out his hand and take from the tree of life and eat, and
              live forever” (Gn 3:22). So if the effect of this bread is that
              anyone who eats it will not die, and I am such, then [anyone who
              eats of me will not die].

              Christ is the Church, which arises out of many believers forming a
              bodily unity: “We are one body” (Rom 12:5). And so because bread

              divinitas. Similiter etiam si in triduo mortis suae aliquis
              consecrasset, non fuisset ibi anima Christi, sed tale corpus quale
              erat in cruce, seu in sepulcro. Ideo autem potius dicit
              <i>caro</i>, quia cum hoc sacramentum sit dominicae passionis
              rememorativum, secundum illud I Cor. XI, 26:
              <i
                >quotiescumque manducabitis panem hunc, et calicem bibetis,
                mortem domini annuntiabitis</i
              >, passio autem Christi fuit ex infirmitate, secundum illud II
              Cor. ult., v. 4:
              <i>mortuus est ex infirmitate</i>
              etc.: ut ergo insinuetur infirmitas ex qua mortuus est, potius
              dicit
              <i>caro mea est</i>: nam hoc nomen infirmitatem significat.

              Since the whole Christ is contained in this sacrament, why did he
              just say, this
              <b>is my flesh</b>
              ? To answer this, we should note that in this mystical sacrament
              the whole Christ is really contained: but his body is there by
              virtue of the conversion; while his soul and divinity are present
              by natural concomitance. For if we were to suppose what is really
              impossible, that is, that the divinity of Christ is separated from
              his body, then his divinity would not be present in this
              sacrament. Similarly, if someone had consecrated during the three
              days Christ was dead, his soul would not have been present there
              [in the sacrament], but his body would have been, as it was on the
              cross or in the tomb. Since this sacrament is the commemoration of
              our Lord’s passion—according to “As often as you eat this bread
              and drink this cup, you proclaim the death of the Lord” (1 Cor
              11:26)—and the passion of Christ depended on his
              weakness—according to “He was crucified through weakness” (2 Cor
              13:4)—he rather says,
              <b>is my flesh,</b>
              to suggest the weakness through which he died, for “flesh”
              signifies weakness.

              963 The usefulness of this sacrament is great and universal. It is
              great, indeed, because it produces spiritual life within us now,
              and will later produce eternal life, as was said. For as is clear
              from what was said, since this is the sacrament of our Lord’s
              passion, it contains in itself the Christ who suffered. Thus,
              whatever is an effect of our Lord’s passion is also an effect of
              this sacrament. For this sacrament is nothing other than the
              application of our Lord’s passion to us. For it was not fitting
              for Christ to be always with us in his own presence; and so he
              wanted to make up for this absence through this sacrament. Hence
              it is clear that the destruction of death, which Christ
              accomplished by his death, and the restoration of life, which he
              accomplished by his resurrection, are effects of this sacrament.

              We should note that this sacrament is different from the others:
              for the other sacraments have individual effects: as in baptism,
              only the one baptized receives grace. But in the immolation of
              this sacrament, the effect is universal: because it affects not
              just the priest, but also those for whom he prays, as well as the
              entire Church, of the living and of the dead. The reason for this
              is that it contains the universal cause of all the sacraments,
              Christ. Nevertheless, when a lay person receives this sacrament it
              does not benefit others
              <i>ex opere operato</i>
              [by its own power] considered as a receiving. However, due to the
              intention of the person who is acting and receiving, it can be
              communicated to all those to whom he directs his intention. It is
              clear from this that lay persons are mistaken when they receive
              the Eucharist for those in purgatory.

              unitatis, quo qui reficiuntur, efficiuntur unanimes, secundum
              illud Ps. LXVII, v. 4:
              <i
                >iusti epulentur, et exultent in conspectu Dei, et laetentur in

              cibum concordiae non sumpserant, ideo ad invicem litigabant; Is.
              LVIII, 4: <i>ecce ad lites et contentiones ieiunatis</i>. Ex hoc
              autem quod litigabant cum aliis, se esse carnales ostendebant; I
              Cor. III, 3:
              <i>cum sit inter vos zelus et contentio, nonne carnales estis?</i>
              Et ideo haec verba domini carnaliter intelligebant; scilicet quod
              caro Christi manducaretur sicut cibus carnalis; unde dicunt
              <i>quomodo potest hic carnem suam dare ad manducandum?</i>

              906 As to the first, note that the Evangelist brings in the
              dispute among the Jews in the form of a conclusion,
              <b>saying, The Jews therefore disputed among themselves.</b>
              And this is fitting: for according to Augustine, our Lord had just
              spoken to them about the food of unity, which makes into one those
              who are nourished on it, according to, “Let those who are just
              feast and rejoice before God,” and then it continues, according to
              one reading, “God makes those who agree to live in one house” (Ps
              67:4). And so, because the Jews had not eaten the food of harmony,
              they argued with each other: “When you fast, you argue and fight”
              (Is 58:4). Further, their quarreling with others shows that they
              were carnal: “For while you are envious and quarreling, are you
              not carnal?” (1 Cor 3:3). Therefore, they understood these words
              of our Lord in a carnal way, i.e., as meaning that our Lord’s
              flesh would be eaten as material food. Thus they say,
              <b>How can this man give us his flesh to eat?</b> As if to say:
              This is impossible. Here they were speaking against God just as
              their fathers did: “We are sick of this useless food” (Nm 21:5).

              967 Our Lord stops this argument. First, he states the power that
              comes from taking this food; secondly, he amplifies on it (v 55).

              in a spiritual way or in a sacramental way. If we understand it as
              referring to a spiritual eating, it does not cause any difficulty.
              For that person eats the flesh of Christ and drinks his blood in a
              spiritual way who shares in the unity of the Church; and this is
              accomplished by the love of charity: “You are one body, in Christ”
              (Rom 12:5). Thus, one who does not eat in this way is outside the
              Church, and consequently, without the love of charity.
              Accordingly, such a one does not have life in himself: “He who
              does not love, remains in death” (1 Jn 3:14).

              Si vero referatur ad sacramentalem, dubium habet quod dicitur; nam

              et cetera. Cum ergo Baptismus sit sacramentum necessitatis,
              videtur etiam quod Eucharistia. Sed hoc quidem Graeci concedunt,
              unde et pueris baptizatis dant Eucharistiam: et in hoc habent pro
              eis ritum Dionysii, qui dicit, quod perceptio cuiuslibet
              sacramenti debet consummari in communione Eucharistiae, quae est

              reverentia et devotio, quam illi qui non habent usum liberi
              arbitrii, sicut sunt pueri et amentes, habere non possunt; et ideo

            <td>
              But if we refer this statement to eating in a sacramental way, a
              difficulty appears. For we read above: “Unless one is born again
              of water and the Holy Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God”
              (3:5). Now this statement was given in the same form as the
              present one:
              <b>Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man.</b>
              Therefore, since baptism is a necessary sacrament, it seems that
              the Eucharist is also. In fact, the Greeks think it is; and so
              they give the Eucharist to newly baptized infants. For this
              opinion they have in their favor the rite of Denis, who says that
              the reception of each sacrament should culminate in the sharing of
              the Eucharist, which is the culmination of all the sacraments.
              This is true in the case of adults, but it is not so for infants,
              because receiving the Eucharist should be done with reverence and
              devotion, and those who do not have the use of reason, as infants
              and the insane, cannot have this. Consequently, it should not be
              given to them at all.

              We should say, therefore, that the sacrament of baptism is
              necessary for everyone, and it must be really received, because
              without it no one is born again into life. And so it is necessary
              that it be received in reality, or by desire in the case of those
              who are prevented from the former. For if the contempt within a
              person excludes a baptism by water, then neither a baptism of
              desire nor of blood will benefit him for eternal life. However,
              the sacrament of the Eucharist is necessary for adults only, so

              I answer that it was the custom of the early Church for all to
              receive both the body and blood of Christ; and certain Churches
              have still retained this practice, where even those assisting at
              the altar always receive the body and blood. But in some Churches,
              due to the danger of spilling the blood, the custom is for it to
              be received only by the priest, while the rest receive Christ’s
              body. Even so, this is not acting against our Lord’s command,
              because whoever receives Christ’s body receives his blood also,
              since the entire Christ is present under each species, even his
              body and blood. But under the species of bread, Christ’s body is
              present in virtue of the conversion, and his blood is present by
              natural concomitance; while under the species of wine, his blood

              972 There is great usefulness in eating this sacrament, for it
              gives eternal life; thus he says,
              <b>Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life.</b>
              For this spiritual food is similar to material food in the fact
              that without it there can be no spiritual life, just as there
              cannot be bodily life without bodily food, as was said above. But
              this food has more than the other, because it produces in the one
              who receives it an unending life, which material food does not do:
              for not all who eat material food continue to live. For, as
              Augustine says, it can happen that many who do take it die because
              of old age or sickness, or some other reason. But one who takes
              this food and drink of the body and blood of our Lord
              <b>has eternal life.</b>
              For this reason it is compared to the tree of life: “She is the
              tree of life for those who take her” (Prv 3:18); and so it is
              called the bread of life: “He fed him with the bread of life and
              understanding” (Sir 15:3). Accordingly, he says,
              <b>eternal life,</b>
              because one who eats this bread has within himself Christ, who is
              “the true God and eternal life,” as John says (1 Jn 5:20).

              the sacrament; and one eats and drinks spiritually or in a
              spiritual way, if he attains to the reality of the sacrament. This
              reality of the sacrament is twofold: one is contained and
              signified, and this is the whole Christ, who is contained under
              the species of bread and wine. The other reality is signified but
              not contained, and this is the mystical body of Christ, which is
              in the predestined, the called, and the justified. Thus, in
              reference to Christ as contained and signified, one eats his flesh
              and drinks his blood in a spiritual way if he is united to him
              through faith and love, so that one is transformed into him and
              becomes his member: for this food is not changed into the one who
              eats it, but it turns the one who takes it into itself, as we see
              in Augustine, when he says: “I am the food of the robust. Grow and
              you will eat me. Yet you will not change me into yourself, but you
              will be transformed into me.” And so this is a food capable of
              making man divine and inebriating him with divinity. The same is
              true in reference to the mystical body of Christ, which is only
              signified [and not contained], if one shares in the unity of the
              Church. Therefore, one who eats in these ways
              <b>has eternal life.</b>
              That this is true of the first way, in reference to Christ, is
              clear enough. In the same way, in reference to the mystical body
              of Christ, one will necessarily have eternal life if he
              perseveres: for the unity of the Church is brought about by the
              Holy Spirit: “One body, one Spirit... the pledge of our eternal
              inheritance” (Eph 4:4; 1:14). So this bread is very profitable,
              because it gives eternal life to the soul; but it is so also
              because it gives eternal life to the body.

              973 And therefore he adds,
              <b>and I will raise him up on the last day.</b>
              For as was said, one who eats and drinks in a spiritual way shares
              in the Holy Spirit, through whom we are united to Christ by a
              union of faith and love, and through him we become members of the
              Church. But the Holy Spirit also merits the resurrection: “He who
              raised Jesus Christ our Lord form the dead, will raise our mortal
              bodies because of his Spirit, who dwells in us” (Rom 8:11). And so
              our Lord says that he will raise up to glory whoever eats and
              drinks; to glory, and not to condemnation, as this would not be
              for their benefit. Such an effect is fittingly attributed to this
              sacrament of the Eucharist because, as Augustine says and as was
              said above, it is the Word who raises up souls, and it is the Word
              made flesh who gives life to bodies. Now in this sacrament the
              Word is present not only in his divinity, but also in the reality
              of his flesh; and so he is the cause of the resurrection not just
              of souls, but of bodies as well: “For as death came through a man,
              so the resurrection of the dead has come through a man” (1 Cor
              15:21). It is now clear how profitable it is to take this
              sacrament.

              Chrysostom explains this statement in the following way. Food and
              drink are taken for man’s refreshment. Now there are two parts in
              man: the chief part is the soul, and the second is the body. It is
              the soul which makes man to be man, and not the body; and so that
              truly is the food of man which is the food of the soul. And this

              is true of the blood of Christ. “He has led me to the waters that
              refresh” (Ps 22:2). As if to say: This refreshment is especially

              Augustine explains these words this way. A thing is truly said to
              be such and such a thing if it produces the effect of that thing.
              Now the effect of food is to fill or satisfy. Therefore, that
              which truly produces fulness is truly food and drink. But this is
              produced by the flesh and blood of Christ, who leads us to the
              state of glory, where there is neither hunger nor thirst: “They
              will neither hunger nor thirst” (Rv 7:16). And so he says:

              body of Christ and drink his blood not just sacramentally, but
              really. And there is another way by which those who eat do not
              abide in Christ nor Christ in them. This is the way of those who
              approach [the sacrament] with an insincere heart: for this
              sacrament has no effect in one who is insincere. There is
              insincerity when the interior state does not agree with what is
              outwardly signified. In the sacrament of the Eucharist, what is
              outwardly signified is that Christ is united to the one who
              receives it, and such a one to Christ. Thus, one who does not
              desire this union in his heart, or does not try to remove every
              obstacle to it, is insincere. Consequently, Christ does not abide
              in him nor he in Christ.

              respect, though not in all respects, which is, that he exists from
              another. For to be from another is common to Christ the Son of God
              and to creatures. But they are unlike in another way: the Son has
              something proper to himself, because he is from the Father in such
              a way that he receives the entire fulness of the divine nature, so
              that whatever is natural to the Father is also natural to the Son.
              Creatures, on the other hand, receive a certain particular
              perfection and nature. “Just as the Father possesses life in
              himself, so he has given it to the Son to have life in himself”
              (above 5:26). He shows this because, when speaking of his
              procession from the Father, he does not say: “As I eat the Father
              and I live because of the Father, “ as he said, when speaking of
              sharing in his body and blood, whoever eats me, he also will live
              because of me. This eating makes us better, for eating implies a
              certain sharing. Rather, Christ says that he lives because of the
              Father, not as eaten, but as generating, without detriment to his
              equality.

              If we explain this statement as applying to Christ as man, then in
              some respect the “as” implies a similarity between Christ as man
              and us: that is, in the fact that as Christ the man receives
              spiritual life through union with God, so we too receive spiritual
              life in the communion or sharing in this Sacrament. Still, there
              is a difference: for Christ as man received life through union
              with the Word, to whom he is united in person; while we are united
              to Christ t through the sacrament of faith. And so he says two
              things:
              <b>sent me</b>
              and
              <b>Father</b>. If we refer these words to the Son of God, then he
              is saying,
              <b>I live because of the Father,</b>
              because the Father himself is living. But if they are referred to
              the Son of Man, then he is saying,
              <b>I live because of the Father,</b>
              because the Father has sent me, i.e., made me incarnate. For the
              sending of the Son is his incarnation: “God sent his Son, made
              from a woman” (Gal 4:4).

              Per hoc ergo, secundum Hilarium, excluditur error Arii; nam si nos

              978 According to Hilary, this is a rejection of the error made by
              Arius. For if we live because of Christ, because we have something
              of his nature (as he says, “Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my
              blood has eternal life”), then Christ too lives because of the
              Father, because he has in himself the nature of the Father (not a
              part of it, for it is simple and indivisible). Therefore, Christ
              has the entire nature of the Father. It is because of the Father,
              therefore, that the Son lives, because the Son’s birth did not
              involve another and different nature [from that of the Father].

              980 With respect to the first, we should note that the Jews had
              been troubled because he had said, “I am the living bread that has
              come down from heaven” (v 51). Therefore, in opposition to them,
              he arrives at this same conclusion again, from his statement, “I
              live because of the Father,” when he says,
              <b>This is the bread that has come down from heaven.</b>
              For to come down from heaven is to have an origin from heaven; but
              the Son has his origin from heaven, since he lives because of the
              Father: therefore, Christ is the one who has come down from
              heaven. And so he says,
              <b>This is the bread that has come down from heaven,</b>
              i.e., from the life of the Father.
              <b>Come down</b>, in relation to his divinity; or
              <b>come down</b>, even in his body, so far as the power that
              formed it, the Holy Spirit, was from heaven, a heavenly power.
              Thus, those who eat this bread do not die; as our fathers died,
              who ate the manna that was neither from heaven, nor was living
              bread, as was said above. How those who ate the manna died is
              clear from what has been mentioned before.

              983 After our Lord put an end to the complaining and arguing among
              the Jews, he now removes the scandal given to his disciples.
              First, we see the scandal of those disciples who left him;
              secondly, the devotion of those who remained with him (v 68).
              Concerning the first, he does three things: first, we see the

              takes it away (v 62); and thirdly, the stubbornness and unbelief

              They said: <b>This is a hard saying!</b> Now that is said to be
              hard which is difficult to divide, and which offers resistance.
              Accordingly, a saying is hard either because it resists the
              intellect or because it resists the will, that is, when we cannot
              understand it with our mind, or when it does not please our will.
              And this saying was hard for them in both ways. It was hard for
              their intellects because it exceeded the weakness of their
              intellects: for since they were earthly minded, they were
              incapable of understanding what he said, namely, that he would
              give them his flesh to eat. And it was hard for their wills,
              because he said many things about the power of his divinity: and
              although they believed him as a prophet, they did not believe that
              he was God. Consequently, it seemed to them that he was making
              himself greater than he was. “His letters are strong” (2 Cor
              10:10), “Wisdom is exceedingly unpleasant to the unlearned” (Sir
              (, 21). And so it reads on. <b>Who can accept it?</b> They said
              this as an excuse: for since they had given themselves to him,
              they should have accepted what he said. But because he was not
              teaching them things that were pleasing to them, they were waiting
              for an occasion to leave him: “A fool does not accept words of
              wisdom unless You tell him what he desires” (Prv 18:2).

              that Christ had to mention such things because his teaching
              required it. For they had pleaded with him for material food, when
              he had come to strengthen their desire for spiritual food; and so
              he had to make known to them his teaching on spiritual food.

              to give teachers a reason for consolation and patience with those
              who belittle what they say, since even the disciples presumed to

              989 The occasion for their scandal was when they heard our Lord
              say divine things about himself. And so, because they believed
              that he was the son of Joseph, they were upset at what he said
              about himself. God takes away this reason by showing them his
              divinity more openly, and says: You are upset over the things I
              have said about myself;
              <b

                before?</b

              What would you say then? As if to say: You can never deny that I
              came down from heaven, or that I am the one who gives and teaches
              eternal life. He did the same thing before with Nathanael. When
              Nathanael said to him, “You are the King of Israel” our Lord,
              wanting to lead him to more perfect knowledge, answered him: “You
              will see greater things than this” (above 1:5 0). And here too,
              our Lord reveals to them something greater about himself which
              would happen in the future, saying,
              <b
                >What if you should see the Son of Man ascending to where he was
                before?</b
              >
              Indeed, he did ascend into heaven in the sight of his disciples
              (Acts 1:9). If, therefore, he does ascend to where he was before,
              then he was in heaven before: “No one has gone up to heaven except
              the one who came down from heaven” (above 3:13).

              summit of things, that is, in the Father. It is according to his
              human nature that it belongs to him to ascend to
              <b>where he was before,</b>
              that is, to heaven, where he had not been in his human nature.
              (This is in opposition to the teaching of Valentinus, who claimed
              that Christ had assumed a heavenly body). Thus, Christ ascended in
              the sight of his apostles to where he was before according to his
              divinity; and he ascended, by his own power, according to his
              humanity: “I came forth from the Father, and I have come into the
              world. Now I am leaving the world and am going to the Father”
              (below 16:28).

              991 Augustine understands this passage differently. He said that
              the disciples were scandalized when our Lord said that he would
              give him them his flesh to eat because they understood this in a
              material minded way, as if they were literally to eat this flesh,
              just like the flesh of an animal. Our Lord rejected this
              interpretation and said.
              <b>What if you should see the Son of Man ascending,</b>
              with his entire body,
              <b>to where he was before?</b>
              Would you say that I intended to give you my flesh to eat like you

              words could be understood. And secondly, he showed which way was

              With respect to the first, we should note that Christ’s words can
              be understood in two senses: in a spiritual way, and in a material
              way. Thus he says,
              <b>It is the spirit that gives life,</b>
              that is, if you understand these words according to the spirit,
              i.e., according to their spiritual meaning, they will give life.
              <b>Flesh profits nothing,</b>
              that is, if you understand them in a material way, they will be of
              no benefit to you, they will, rather, be harmful, for “If you live
              according to the flesh you will die” (Rom 8:13).

              What our Lord said about eating his flesh is interpreted in a
              material way when it is understood in its superficial meaning, and
              as pertaining to the nature of flesh. And it was in this way that
              the Jews understood them. But our Lord said that he would give
              himself to them as spiritual food, not as though the true flesh of
              Christ is not present in this sacrament of the altar, but because
              it is eaten in a certain spiritual and divine way. Thus, the
              correct meaning of these words is spiritual, not material. So he
              says,
              <b>The words that I have spoken to you</b>, about eating my flesh,
              <b>are spirit and life</b>, that is, they have a spiritual
              meaning, and understood in this way they give life. And it is not
              surprising that they have a spiritual meaning, because they are
              from the Holy Spirit: “It is the Spirit who tells mysteries” (1
              Cor 14:2). And therefore, the mysteries of Christ give life: “I
              will never forget your justifications, because through them you
              have brought me to life” (Ps 118:93).

              Secundum Augustinum vero aliter exponitur: nam hoc quod dixit
              <i>caro non prodest quidquam</i>, intelligitur de carne Christi.
              Manifestum est enim quod caro Christi, ut coniuncta verbo et
              spiritui, multum prodest per omnem modum: alioquin frustra verbum
              caro factum esset, frustra ipsum pater manifestasset in carne, ut
              dicitur I Tim. c. IV. Et ideo dicendum est quod caro Christi in se
              considerata non prodest quidquam, et non habet effectum proficuum,
              nisi sicut alia caro. Si enim per intellectum separetur a
              divinitate et spiritu sancto, non habet aliam virtutem quam alia
              caro; sed si adveniat spiritus et divinitas, multis prodest, quia
              facit sumentes manere in Christo: est enim spiritus caritatis per
              quem homo in Deo manet; I Io. IV, 13:
              <i
                >in hoc cognoscimus quia in Deo manemus et ipse in nobis,
                quoniam de spiritu suo dedit nobis</i
              >. Et ideo dicit dominus: hunc effectum, scilicet vitae aeternae
              quem ego promitto vobis, non debetis attribuere carni in se
              consideratae, quia
              <i>caro</i>
              sic
              <i>non prodest quidquam</i>; sed si spiritui attribuatis, et
              divinitati coniunctae carni, sic praestat vitam aeternam; Gal. V,
              25: <i>si spiritu vivimus, spiritu et ambulemus</i>. Et ideo
              subdit <i>verba quae locutus sum vobis, spiritus et vita sunt</i>;

              intellecta, vita sunt, scilicet animae. Nam sicut corpus vivit
              vita corporali per spiritum corporalem, ita et anima vivit vita
              spirituali per spiritum sanctum; Ps. CIII, 30:

              993 Augustine explains this passage in a different way, for he
              understands the statement, flesh profits nothing, as referring to
              the flesh of Christ. It is obvious that the flesh of Christ, as
              united to the Word and to the Spirit, does profit very much and in
              every way; otherwise, the Word would have been made flesh in vain,
              and the Father would have made him known in the flesh in vain, as
              we see from 1 Timothy (c 4). And so we should say that it is the
              flesh of Christ, considered in itself, that profits nothing and
              does not have any more beneficial effect than other flesh. For if
              his flesh is considered as separated from the divinity and the
              Holy Spirit, it does not have different power than other flesh.
              But if it is united to the Spirit and the divinity, it profits
              many, because it makes those who receive it abide in Christ, for
              man abides in God through the Spirit of love: “We know that we
              abide in God and God in us, because he has given us his Spirit” (1
              Jn 4:13). And this is what our Lord says: the effect I promise
              you, that is, eternal life, should not be attributed to my flesh
              as such, because understood in this way,
              <b>flesh profits nothing.</b>
              But my flesh does offer eternal life as united to the Spirit and
              to the divinity. “If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by
              the Spirit” “Gal 5:25). And so he adds,
              <b>The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life,</b>
              i.e., they must be understood of the Spirit united to my flesh;
              and so understood they are life, that is, the life of the soul.
              For as the body lives its bodily life through a bodily spirit, so
              the soul lives a spiritual life through the Holy Spirit: “Send
              forth your Spirit, and they will be created” (Ps 103:30).

              997 Our Lord next mentioned the cause of their unbelief, which was
              the withdrawal of attracting grace. Thus he said: This is why I
              said to you. As if to say: Thus it was necessary to tell you what
              I told you before:
              <b>that no one can come to me,</b>
              i.e., through faith,
              <b>unless it be given him by my Father.</b>
              It follows from this, according to Augustine, that the act of
              believing itself is given to us by God. Why it is not given to
              everyone we discussed above, where our Lord used almost the same
              words (6:44). They are repeated here for two reasons. First, to
              show that Christ received them in the faith more for their
              advantage and benefit than for his own: “It has been granted to
              you to believe in him” (Phil 1:29). As if to say: It is good for
              you to believe. Thus Augustine says: “It is a great thing to
              believe: rejoice, because you have believed.” Secondly, to show
              that Christ was not the son of Joseph, as they thought, but of
              God, for it is God the Father who draws men to the Son, as is
              clear from what has been said.

              nihilominus tamen perseverant in infidelitate: et ideo dicit, quod
              <i>multi discipuli eius abierunt retro</i>. Non dixit recesserunt
              sed, <i>abierunt retro</i>, a fide, quam secundum virtutem
              habebant, et praecisi a corpore Christi, vitam perdiderunt, quia
              forte nec in corpore fuerunt, ut dicit Augustinus. Sunt enim
              aliqui qui simpliciter vadunt retro: illi scilicet qui sequuntur
              Diabolum, cui dictum est, Matth. IV, 10:
              <i>vade retro, Satana</i>. Et de quibusdam feminis dicitur I Tim.
              V, 15: <i>quaedam conversae sunt retro post Satanam</i>. Non sic
              vadit retro Petrus, sed post Christum; Matth. XVI, 23:
              <i>vade retro me, Satana</i>. Isti autem abierunt post Satanam.

              998 Then (v 67), we see the stubbornness of the disciples: for
              although our Lord had rebuked them and had taken away the cause of
              their difficulty so far as it concerned himself, they still would
              not believe. Thus he says,
              <b>From this time on, many of his disciples turned back.</b>
              He did not say, “they left,” but that they
              <b>turned back,</b>
              i.e., from the faith, which they had in a virtuous way; and cut
              off from the body of Christ, they lost life, because perhaps they
              were not in the body, as Augustine says. There are some who turn
              back in an absolute way, that is, those who follow the devil, to
              whom our Lord said, “Go back, Satan” (Mt 4:10). We also read of
              certain women that “Some turned back after Satan” (1 Tim 5:15).
              But Peter did not turn back in this way; he rather turned after
              Christ: “Follow after me, Satan” (Mt 16:23). But the others
              followed after Satan.

              1000 Our Lord examined the Twelve who remained as to their
              willingness to stay on; and so he said to the Twelve, that is, to
              the Apostles, Do you too wish to leave? He asked them this for two
              reasons. First, so that they would not take pride, thinking it was
              due to their own goodness, in the fact that they stayed on while
              the others left, and think that they were doing Christ a favor.
              And so he showed that he did not need them by holding them off,
              but still giving them strength: “If you live rightly, what do you
              give him, or what does he receive from your hand?” (Jb 35:7).
              Secondly, it sometimes happens that a person would really prefer
              to leave another but is kept from doing so by shame or
              embarrassment. Our Lord did not want them to stay with him because
              they were forced to do so out of embarrassment (because to serve
              unwillingly is not to serve at all), and so he took away any
              embarrassment in their leaving or necessity for their staying, and
              left it to their own judgment whether they wanted to stay with him
              or leave, because “God loves a cheerful giver” (2 Cor 9:7).

              For in our faith there are two things above all that must be

              these two Peter professed here. He professed the mystery of the
              Trinity when he said, you are the Son of God: for in calling
              Christ the Son of God he mentioned the person of the Father and
              that of the Son, along with the person of the Holy Spirit, who is
              the love of the Father and of the Son, and the bond or nexus of
              both. He professed the mystery of the Incarnation when he said,
              you are the Christ: for in Greek, the word “Christ” means
              “anointed”; anointed, that is, with the invisible oil of the Holy
              Spirit. He was not anointed according to his divine nature,
              because one who is anointed by the Holy Spirit is Made better by
              that anointing. But Christ, so far as he is God, is not made
              better. Thus, Christ was anointed as man.

              usus Deus, dum tradi se pertulit ut nos redimeret. Vel dicendum
              quod electio duodecim apostolorum non refertur hic ad personas,
              sed ad numerum; quasi dicat: ego elegi in vobis duodenarium
              numerum. Hic enim numerus congrue consecratur eis qui fidem
              sanctae Trinitatis per quatuor mundi cardines praedicaturi erant;
              qui quidem numerus non periit, quia in locum pereuntis proditoris
              surrogatus est Mathias. Vel, secundum Ambrosium, ideo elegit Iudam
              malum, ut consolaretur infirmitatem nostram, si aliquando
              contigerit nos ab amicis prodi, cum legimus a discipulo proditum
              dominum et magistrum.

              1007 But if Christ chose Judas, who was later to become evil, it
              seems that our Lord made a mistake in choosing him. First, we
              might answer this as Chrysostom does, and say that this choice was
              not for predestination, but for some task, and in reference to a
              condition of present justice. Sometimes a person is chosen this
              way, not in relation to the future, but according to present
              realities; for being chosen in this way does not destroy one’s
              free choice or the possibility of sinning: hence we read, “Let him
              who thinks that he stands, take heed so he will not fall” (1 Cor
              10:12). And so our Lord did choose Judas, but not as evil at that
              time; and being so chosen did not take away his possibility of
              sinning. Secondly, we could answer with Augustine, who said that
              our Lord did chose Judas as evil. And although he knew that he was
              evil, because it is characteristic of a good person to use evil
              for good, God made good use of this evil in allowing himself to be
              betrayed in order to redeem us. Or, we could say that the choice
              of the Twelve does not refer here to the persons, but rather to
              the number; as if to say: I have chosen Twelve. For this number is
              fittingly set apart for those who would preach the faith of the
              Holy Trinity to the four corners of the world. And indeed, this
              number did not pass away, because Matthias was substituted for the
              traitor. Or, according to Ambrose, Jesus chose Judas as evil so
              that when we read that our Lord and Master was betrayed by his
              disciple, we might be consoled if sometimes our friends betray us.

              Sed quaeritur hic, quare cum dicit dominus
              <i>unus ex vobis Diabolus est</i>, nihil dicunt discipuli; et
              postea cum dicit, infra XIII, 21, <i>unus ex vobis me tradet</i>,
              dixerunt,
              <i>numquid ego sum, domine?</i>
              Respondeo dicendum, quod huius ratio est, quia hic dominus
              generaliter locutus est, dicens, unum ex eis esse Diabolum, quod
              potest referri ad quamcumque malitiam, et ideo non sunt commoti:
              ibi vero tantum facimus audientes, proditionem scilicet magistri,
              se continere non valent. Vel dicendum ad hoc, quod cum dominus
              haec verba dixit, quilibet eorum de sua virtute confidebat, et
              ideo non timebant de se. Sed quando Petrus audivit:
              <i>vade post me, Satana</i>, territi sunt, et infirmiora de se
              senserunt: et ideo vacillantes dicebant:

              1008 We could ask here why the disciples did not say anything
              after our Lord said,
              <b>one of you is a devil;</b>
              for later on, when he says, “One of you will betray me” (below
              13:21), they reply, “Is it I, Lord?” (Mt 26:22). 1 answer that the
              reason for this is that our Lord was speaking here in a general
              way when he said that one of them was a devil; for this could mean
              any kind of malice, and so they were not disturbed. But later on,
              when they heard of such a great crime, that their Master would be
              betrayed, they could not keep quiet. Or, we could say that when
              our Lord said this, each of them had confidence in his own virtue,
              and so none feared for himself; but after he said to Peter,
              “Follow after me, Satan” (Mt 16:23), they were afraid, and
              realized their own weakness. That is why they asked in that
              indecisive way, “Is it I, Lord?”
