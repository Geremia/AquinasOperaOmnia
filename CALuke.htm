          <td><b>Glossa</b>: Inter cetera incarnationis Christi mysteria, quae Isaias propheta diligenter et aperte praenuntiat, dicit induam caelos tenebris etc., ex quibus verbis accipere possumus Evangelii secundum Lucam materiam, modum scribendi, finem et conditionem scriptoris.
          <td><b>Gloss</b>: Among the mysteries of the incarnation of Christ, which Isaiah diligently and openly foretold, he says: "I will clothe the heavens" etc. From these words we can gather, for the Gospel according to Luke, the matter, the manner of writing, the purpose and the condition of the writer.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Cons. Evang</b>: Lucas enim circa sacerdotalem domini stirpem atque personam magis occupatus videtur, unde per vitulum significatus est, propter maximam victimam sacerdotis.
          <td><b>Augustine, On the consistency of the Gospel</b>: For Luke seems preoccupied with the royal lineage and person of the Lord. Therefore he is typified by the bull, because it is the chief victim of the priest.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius in Luc</b>: Vitulus enim sacerdotalis est victima, unde bene congruit vitulo hic Evangelii liber, qui a sacerdotibus inchoavit et consummavit in vitulo, qui omnium peccata suscipiens pro totius mundi vita est immolatus; et ipsam vituli immolationem Lucas stylo quodam pleniore diffudit.
          <td><b>Ambrose, on Luke</b>: For the priestly boois is the victim; therefore this Gospel book fits the bull well, because it starts from priests and vinishes in the book who took the sins of all and was sacrificed for the life of the world. And Luke gave a fuller treatment to the immolation of the bull.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Glossa</b>: Quia igitur passionem Christi principaliter exponere Lucas intendit, huius Evangelii materia significari potest in eo quod dicitur induam caelos tenebris, et saccum ponam operimentum eorum; nam ad litteram in passione Christi tenebrae factae sunt, et in discipulis fides obscurata est.
          <td><b>Gloss</b>: Because Luke principally intended to treat of the passion of Christ, the matter of this Gospel can be represented by the statement: "I will clothe the heavens with darkness, and place a sack as their covering," for in the passion of Christ darkness literally took pllace, and the faith of the disciples was darkened.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Hieronymus super Isaiam</b>: Et Christus despectus erat et ignobilis quando pendebat in cruce; et absconditus est vultus eius atque despectus, ut humano corpore divina potentia celaretur.
          <td><b>Jerome, on Isaiah</b>: Christ was despised and without honor when he hung on the cross. His face was hidden and despised, so that the divine power would be hidden by a human body.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Hieronymus de viris illustribus</b> Sermo autem Lucae tam in Evangelio quam in actibus apostolorum comptior est et saeculari redolet eloquentia. Unde subditur dominus dedit mihi linguam eruditam.
          <td><b>Jerome, on illustrious men</b>: Luke's narration, both in the Gospel and in the Acts of the Apostles, is refined and full of secular eloquence. Therefore Isaiah adds: "The Lord gave me an eloquent tongue."
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius in Luc</b>: Nam licet Scriptura divina mundanae evacuet sapientiae disciplinam, quod maiore fucata verborum ambitu quam rerum ratione subnixa sit; tamen si quis in Scripturis divinis etiam illa quae imitanda illi putant, quaerat, inveniet. Sanctus enim Lucas velut quemdam historicum ordinem tenuit, et plura nobis gestorum domini miracula revelavit; ita tamen ut omnes sapientiae virtutes Evangelii ipsius complecteretur historia. Quid enim praecellentius ad sapientiam naturalem, quam quod spiritum sanctum creatorem etiam dominicae incarnationis extitisse reseravit? Docet moralia in eodem libro, quemadmodum scilicet amare inimicum debeam; docet etiam rationalia, cum lego quoniam qui fidelis est in minimo, et in magno fidelis est.
          <td><b>Ambrose, on Luke</b>: Although Scripture defeats human wisdom, which relies more on a rich vocabulary than on reality, nevertheless, if anyone looks in divine Scripture for what they think should be imitated, he will find it. For St. Luke held to an historical order, and made known to us very many miracles worked by the Lord. At the same time the historical narration of this Gospel embraces all the powers of wisdom. For what could surpass natural wisdom more than that he brought into play the Holy Creator Spirit also for the Lord's incarnation. He teaches morals in the same book, such as that I must love my enemy. He also teaches reasonable things, as when I read that he who is faithful in little things, will be faithful in great things.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Eusebius in Eccles. Hist</b> Is ergo genere quidem Antiochenus, arte medicus, secundum hanc medicinam quam ex apostolorum vel societate vel traditione susceperat, duos nobis medicinales libros, quibus non corpora sed animae curentur explicuit. Unde sequitur ut sciam sustentare eum qui lapsus est verbo.
          <td><b>Eusebius, Ecclesiastical History</b>: From Antiochene stock, he was a medical practitioner, according to the medicine that he learned from the company of the apostles or from tradtion. He left us two medical books, where he explained how not bodies, but souls are cured. Therefore, Isaiah continues: "so that I can sustain the fallen by my word."
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Hieronymus super Isaiam</b>: Dicit enim se a domino accepisse sermonem, quomodo lapsum errantemque populum sustentet, et revocet ad salutem.
          <td><b>Jerome, on Isaiah</b>: He says that he received from the Lord his account on how to raise up a falling and erring people, and call them back to salvation.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Graecus expositor</b>: Cum autem Lucas bonae indolis esset et capacitatis strenuae, Graecorum scientiam consecutus est. Grammaticam siquidem atque poesim adeptus perfecte, rethoricam autem et persuadendi leporem assecutus ad plenum, neque philosophiae muneribus caruit; denique et medicinam acquirit, et quoniam naturae velocitate satis de humana gustaverat sapientia, ad altiorem convolat. Accelerat igitur ad Iudaeam, et visibiliter et verbo tenus Christum adit. Cumque veritatem cognosceret, verus efficitur Christi discipulus, plurimum magistro commoratus.
          <td><b>A Greek expositor</b>: Since Luke was well endowed and could work hard, he acquired Greek learning. He fully mastered grammar, poetry, rhetoric and the ability to persuade, nor did he lack philosophical talent. Lastly, he acquired medical science, and since by natural precosity he tasted his full of human wisdom, he flew to a higher level. So he hurred to Judaea, and went to Christ, seeing him and hearing him. Since he knew the truth, he became a true disciple of Christ, staying with his Master for a long time.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Glossa</b>: Unde subditur erigit mane, quasi a iuventute ad saecularem sapientiam; mane erigit mihi aurem ad divina, ut audiam quasi magistrum, scilicet ipsum Christum.
          <td><b>Gloss</b>: There follows: "He awakens me in the morning," that is, from his youth with secular wisdom. He awakens me to divine things, so that I may hear him as a Master, that is, Christ himself.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Eusebius in Eccles. Hist</b>: Tradunt autem quod Evangelium suum ex Pauli ore conscripserit, sicut et Marcus quae ex Petri ore fuerant praedicata conscripsit.
          <td><b>Eusebius, Ecclesiastical History</b>: The tradition is that he wrote his Gospel from the mouth of Paul, as Mark wrote what Peter preached.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus super Matthaeum</b>: Uterque autem eorum magistrum imitatus est; hic quidem Paulum super flumina fluentem, ille autem Petrum breviloquio studentem.
          <td><b>Chrysostom, on Matthew</b>: Each of them imitated their master, Luke imitating Paul flowing on the rivers, Mark imitating Peter who kept to brief speech.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Cons. Evang</b>: Eo autem tempore scripserunt quo non solum ab Ecclesia Christi, verum etiam ab ipsis adhuc in carne manentibus apostolis probari meruerunt.
          <td><b>Augustine, on the consistency of the Gospels</b>: At that time they wrote, they received the approbation no only of the Church of Christ, but also of the apostles who were still living.

          <td><b>Eusebius Eccles. Hist</b>: Lucas in initio Evangelii sui, causam cur scripserit indicavit, videlicet quoniam multi alii temere praesumpserant enarrare res quae sibi magis erant ad liquidum compertae: et hoc est quod dicit quoniam quidem multi conati sunt ordinare narrationem rerum.
          <td><b>EUSEBIUS</b>; St. Luke at the commencement of his Gospel has told us the reason of his writing, which was, that many others had rashly taken upon themselves to give accounts of those things of which he had a more certain knowledge. And this is his meaning when he says, <span style="color: #ff0000">Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of things.</span>
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius in prooem. in Lucam</b>: Nam sicut multi in Iudaeorum populo divino infusi spiritu prophetaverunt, alii autem pseudoprophetae erant potius quam prophetae; sic et nunc in novo testamento multi Evangelia scribere conati sunt, quae boni nummularii non probarunt: et aliud quidem fertur Evangelium quod duodecim scripsisse dicuntur: ausus est etiam Basilides Evangelium scribere: fertur aliud secundum Thomam, et aliud secundum Matthiam.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; For as many among the Jewish people prophesied by inspiration of the Spirit of God, but others were false prophets rather than prophets, so now also travel many attempted to write Gospels which the good moneychanger refuses to pass. One gospel is mentioned which the twelve Apostles are said to have written; another Basilides presumed to write; and another is said to have been by Matthias.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Multos ergo eos non tam numerositate quam haereseos multifariae diversitate connumerat, qui non spiritus sancti munere donati, sed vacuo labore conati, magis ordinaverunt narrationem, quam historiae texuerunt veritatem.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; The many who are mentioned, he reckons not so much by their number, as by the variety of their manifold heresies; men who were not endued with the gift of the Holy Spirit, but engaging in a vain work, have rather set forth in order a relation of events, than woven a true history
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Qui enim conatus est ordinare, suo labore conatus est, nec implevit suo conatu: sine conatu sunt enim donationes et gratia Dei, quae ubi se infuderit, rigare consuevit, ut non egeat, sed redundet scriptoris ingenium: et ideo bene dicit rerum quae in nobis completae sunt, vel quae in nobis redundant: quod enim redundat, nulli deficit, et de completo nemo dubitat, cum fidem effectus astruat, exitus prodat.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Now they who have attempted to set forth these things in order have labored by themselves, and have not succeeded in what they attempted. For without the assistance of man come the gifts and the grace of God, which, when it is infused, is wont so to flow, that the genius of the writer is not exhausted, but ever abounding. He well says therefore, <span style="color: #ff0000">Of things which have been fully accomplished among us</span>, or which abound among us. For that which abounds is lacking to none, and no one doubts about that which is fulfilled, since the accomplishment builds up our faith, and the end manifests it.

            <b>Origenes in Lucam</b>: Dicit autem rerum, quia non secundum phantasiam, iuxta haereticos, exercuit Iesus carnalem ipsius adventum; sed cum veritas esset, revera negotium prosecutus est.
            <p>Affectum autem suum indicat ex hoc quod ait quae in nobis completae sunt; idest, quae in nobis manifestissimae sunt ostensae: id enim quod Graece legitur peplirophorimenon uno verbo Latinus sermo non explicat: certa enim fide et ratione cognoverat, neque in aliquo fluctuabat.

            <b>TITUS BOSTRENSIS</b>; He says, <span style="color: #ff0000">of things</span>, because not by shadows, as the heretics say, did Jesus accomplish His advent in the flesh, but being as He was the Truth, so in very truth He performed His work.
            <p><b>ORIGEN</b>; The effect upon his own mind, St. Luke explains by the expression, <span style="color: #ff0000">of the things which have been fully accomplished among us</span>, i.e. have had their full manifestation among us, (as the Greek word signifies, which the Latin cannot not express in one word,) for he had been convinced of them by sure faith and reason, and wavered not in

          <td><b>CHRYSOSTOM</b>; The Evangelist was so far from being content with his single testimony, that he refers the whole to the Apostles, seeking from them a confirmation of his words; and therefore he adds, <span style="color: #ff0000">as they handed them down to us, who were themselves from the beginning eyewitnesses</span>.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Eusebius Eccles. Hist</b>: Certus est quod veritatem, vel Paulo exponente, vel aliis apostolis qui ab initio ipsi viderant, vel sibi tradiderant, consecutus sit.
          <td><b>EUSEBIUS</b>; Luke is a sure witness, because he obtained his knowledge of the truth either from St. Paul’s instructions, or the instructions and traditions of the other Apostles, who were themselves eyewitnesses from the beginning.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Dicit autem viderunt, quia hoc maxime robur nanciscitur credulitatis, quod addiscitur ab his qui praesentialiter viderunt.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He says, <span style="color: #ff0000">were eyewitnesses</span>, because this is our chief ground for believing in a thing, that we derive it from those who were actually eyewitnesses.

Et ideo postquam significaverat scientiam ex hoc quod dixerat ipsi viderunt, demonstrat opera ex hoc quod sequitur: et ministri fuerunt sermonis vel verbi.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; It is plain that of one kind of knowledge, the end is in the knowledge itself, as in geometry; but of another kind, the end is counted to be in the work, as in medicine; and so it is in the word of God, and therefore having signified the knowledge by the words <span style="color: #ff0000">were themselves eyewitnesses</span>, he points out the work by what follows, <span style="color: #ff0000">and were ministers of the word.</span>

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; This expression is used, not that we should suppose the ministry of the word to consist rather in seeing than hearing, but that, because by the word was meant not a word that can be spoken by the mouth, but one of real existence, we may understand <span style="color: #ff0000">that</span> to have been not a common, but a Heavenly Word, to which the Apostles ministered.

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; In what he says of the Apostles having been eyewitnesses of the word, he agrees with John, who says, The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw His glory. For the Word by means of the flesh was made visible.

Sed propterea ita scriptum est ut ostenderetur nobis aliis videri oculis vocem domini, quibus illi aspiciunt qui merentur. Porro in Evangelio non vox cernitur, sed sermo qui voce praestantior est.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; It is written in Exodus, The people saw the voice of the Lord. Now a voice is rather heard than seen. But it was so written, to show us that men see the voice of the Lord with other eyes, which they only have who are worthy of them. Again in the Gospel, it is not the voice that is perceived, but the Word, which is more excellent than the voice.

          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; St. Luke hereby explains to us the source of his writing; seeing that what things he wrote, he gained not from report, but had himself traced them up from the beginning.

Consulto autem quae ab aliis sunt scripta praeteriit, ut propriis quibusdam singuli Evangeliorum libri mysteriorum gestorumque miraculis eminerent.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; When he says, It seemed good to me, he does not deny that it seemed good to God for it is God who predisposes the wills of men. Now no one has doubted that this book of the Gospel is more full of details than the others; by these words then he claims to himself, not any thing that is false, but the truth; and therefore he says, “It seemed good to me, having investigated every thing, to write.” Not to write every thing, but from a review of every thing; “for if all the things which Jesus did were written, I do not think the world itself could contain them.” But purposely has Luke passed by things that were written by others, in order that each book of the Gospel might be distinguished by certain mysteries and miracles peculiar to itself.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Theophilus means, “loving God,” or “being loved by God.” Whoever then loses God, or desires to be loved by Him, let him think this Gospel to have been written to him, and preserve it as a gift presented to him, a pledge entrusted to his care. The promise was not to explain the meaning of certain new and strange things to Theophilus, but to set forth the truth of those words in which he had been instructed; as it is added, <span style="color: #ff0000">That you might know the truth of those words in which you have been instructed</span>; that is, “that you might be able to know in what order each thing was said or done by the Lord.”

          <td><b>THEOPHYLACT</b>; For frequently, when a thing is asserted by any one, and not expressed in writing, we suspect it of falsehood; but when a man has written what he asserts, we are the more inclined to believe it, as if, unless he thought it to be true, he would not commit it to writing.

Totum Evangelistae prooemium duo continet: conditionem eorum qui ante eum Evangelium scripserant, puta Matthaei et Marci; et rursum cur et ipse scribere proposuit. Cum vero dixisset conati sunt, vocabulum protulit potens applicari et ad praesumptuose aggredientes materiam, et ad honeste pertractantes illam. Duabus enim additionibus dubiam sententiam certificat. Primo quidem quia dixit quae in nobis completae sunt rerum; secundo quia dixit sicut tradiderunt nobis qui ab initio ipsi viderunt. Simul autem hoc quod dico tradiderunt indicare mihi videtur quod et ipsi moneantur propagare; velut enim illi tradiderunt, ipsos quoque oportebit accipientes seriatim ad invicem promulgare. Nondum autem commendantibus Scripturae quae tradita fuerint, contingebat inconvenientia plurima provenire diuturnitate temporis, unde merito quae de primis visoribus verbi et ministris verbi acceperant, in scriptis universo mundo traditionem praestiterunt, et calumnias propellentes, et oblivionem destruentes, et ex ipsa traditione integritatem accomodantes.
          <td><b>GREEK EX</b>. The whole preface of in this Evangelist contains two things; first, the condition of those who wrote Gospels before him, (Matthew and Mark for example;) secondly, the reason why he also himself proposed to write one. Having said, “attempted,” a word which may be applied both to those who presumptuously engage upon a subject, and those who reverently handle it, he determines the doubtful expression by two additions; first, by the words, <span style="color: #ff0000">Of things which have been fully accomplished among us</span>; and secondly, <span style="color: #ff0000">As they handed them down to us, who were eyewitnesses from the beginning.</span> The word <span style="color: #ff0000">handed down</span> seems to show, that the eye-witnesses themselves had a commission to transmit the truth. For as they handed it down, so it became others also receiving it in due order, in their turn to publish it. But from the not depositing in writing what had been delivered, several difficulties through lapse of time sprang up. Rightly then did those who had received the tradition from the first eye-witnesses of the Word, establish it in writing for the whole world; thereby repelling falsehood, destroying forgetfulness, and making up from tradition itself a perfect whole.

For since a virgin was about to become a mother, it had been fore-ordained by grace that the old should previously conceive. He fixes the time, when he says, In the days of Herod, and in the following words adds his rank, king of Judea. There was another Herod, who killed John; he was tetrarch, whereas this one was king.

For from the time that our fathers came out of Egypt, they were governed by judges of their own nation, until the Prophet Samuel; and then by kings, until the carrying away to Babylon. But after the return from Babylon, the chief power was in the hands of priests, until the time of Hyrcanus, who was both king and high priest. He was slain by Herod, after which the government of the kingdom was delivered over by the command of Augustus Caesar to this same Herod, a foreigner, in whose thirty-first year, according to the prophecy we have mentioned, Shiloh came.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Divine Scripture teaches us with respect to those whom we commemorate, that not only the characters of the men themselves, but of their parents also, ought to be praised, that they might be distinguished by an inheritance, as it were, handed down to them of unspotted purity. Now not only from his parents, but also from his ancestors, St. John derives his illustrious descent, a descent not exalted by secular power, but venerable from its sanctity. Complete then is that praise which comprehends birth, character, office, actions, and judgments. The office was that of the Priesthood, as it is said, A certain Priest of the name of Zacharias.

Non autem frustra primus novi testamenti praeco in octavae sortis iure nascitur: quia sicut septenario saepe numero propter sabbatum vetus testamentum, sic novum aliquoties per octonarium propter sacramentum dominicae vel nostrae resurrectionis exprimitur.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; There were Princes of the Sanctuary or High Priests, both of the sons of Eleazar and the sons of Thamar, whose courses according to their respective services when they entered into the House of God David divided into twenty-four lots, of which the family of Abia (from which Zacharias was descended) obtained the eighth lot. But it was not without meaning that the first preacher of the new covenant was born with the rights of the eighth lot; because as the old Covenant is often expressed by the seventh number on account of the Sabbath, so frequently is the new Covenant by the eighth, because of the sacrament of our Lord’s or our resurrection.

          <td><b>Ambrosius in Lucam</b>: Et sic mores in aequitate comprehendit. Bene autem dicit ante Deum. Fieri enim potest ut aliquis affectata bonitate populari iustus videatur mihi, iustus autem ante Deum non sit, si iustitia non ex mentis simplicitate formetur, sed adulatione simuletur.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Here their whole character is comprehended in their justice, but it is well said before God, for a man by affecting a popular good-will might seem just to me, but not be just before God, if that justice instead of springing from simpleness of heart, was a mere presence carried on by flattery. Perfect then is the praise, “that a man is just before God;” for he only is perfect who is approved by Him who cannot be deceived. St. Luke comprehends the action in the commandment, the doing justice in the justification. Hence it follows, walking in all the commandments and justifications of the Lord. For when we obey the command of heaven we walk in the commandments of the Lord, when we observe justice we seem to possess the justification of the Lord. But to be “blameless” we must “provide things honest”, not only before God, but also before men; there is no blame when both motive and action are alike good, but a too austere righteousness often provokes censure.

          <td><b>CHRYSOSTOM</b>; Not only Elisabeth, but the wives of the Patriarchs also, Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, were barren, which was counted a disgrace among the ancients. Not that their barrenness was the effect of sin, since all were just and virtuous, but ordained rather for our benefit, that when you saw a virgin giving birth to the Lord, you might not be faithless, or perplexing your mind with respect to the womb of the barren.

          <td><b>CHRYSOSTOM</b>; When Zacharias entered into the temple to offer up prayers to God for all men, interceding between God and man, he saw an angel standing within, as it is said, And there appeared to him an angel.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; It is well said that there appeared an angel to Zacharias, who suddenly beheld him; and this is the expression especially used by Divine Scripture with respect to angels or God, that what cannot be seen beforehand may be said to appear. For things which are the objects of our senses are not seen as He is seen, Who is seen only as He will, and Whose nature is not to be seen.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; It was not without good reason that the angel appeared in the temple, for the coming of the true High Priest was now announced, and the Heavenly Sacrifice was preparing at which angels were to minister. For one cannot doubt that an angel stands by where Christ is sacrificed. But he appeared at the right hand of the altar of incense, because he brought down the token of Divine mercy. For the Lord is on my right hand, so that I should not be moved.

Sicut autem auriga perterrito, loraque dimittente, corruunt equi praecipites, totaque quadriga pervertitur; sic accidere consuevit animae quoties ab aliquo stupore vel sollicitudine deprimitur: unde et hic subditur et timor irruit super eum.
          <td><b>CHRYSOSTOM</b>; The justest of men can not without fear behold an angel; Zacharias therefore, not sustaining the sight of the angel’s presence, nor able to withstand his brightness, is troubled, as it is added, Zacharias was troubled. But as it happens, when a charioteer is frightened, and has let loose his reins, the horses run headlong, and the chariot is overturned; so is it with the soul, when it is taken by any surprise or alarm; as it is here added and fear fell upon him.

Usque adeo autem ille iam se habiturum filios desperabat, ut hoc Angelo promittenti non crederet. Ergo quod ei dicitur exaudita est deprecatio tua, pro populo intelligendum est; cuius populi quoniam salus et redemptio et peccatorum abolitio per Christum futura erat, adhuc nuntiatur Zachariae nasciturus filius, quia praecursor Christi destinabatur.
          <td><b>AUGUSTINE</b>; Now here we must first consider that it is not likely that Zacharias, when offering sacrifice for the sins or for the salvation or redemption of the people, would neglect the public petitions, to pray (though himself an old man, and his wife also old) that he might receive children; and, next, above all that no one prays for what he despairs of ever obtaining. And even up to this time, so much had he despaired of ever having children, that he would not believe, even when an angel promised it to him The words, Your prayer is heard, must be understood therefore to refer to the people; and as salvation, redemption, and the putting away of the sins of the people was to be through Christ, it is told Zacharias that a son shall be born to him, because that son was ordained to be the forerunner of Christ.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Vel quod exaudita sit eius deprecatio, probat per hoc quod gignendus erat ei filius, clamans: ecce agnus Dei qui tollit peccata mundi.
          <td><b>CHRYSOSTOM</b>; Or it means, that this was to be the proof of his prayer having been heard, namely, that a son should be born to him, crying, Behold the Lamb of God!

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Or, as follows; Divine mercy is ever full and overflowing, not narrowed to a single gift, but pouring in an abundant store of blessings; as in this case, where first the fruit of his prayer is promised; and next, that his barren wife shall bear a child, whose name is announced as follows; And you shall call his name John.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Singularis meriti indicium datur, quoties hominibus a Deo vel imponitur nomen vel nuntiatur.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Illud quoque oportet exprimere, quoniam in quibus ab ipsa teneritate infantiae virtus refulgere debebat, a principio divinitus sumebant nomina; his vero qui postea debebant excrescere, nomen postea imponebatur.
          <td><b>CHRYSOSTOM</b>; Which must be the meaning here, for those who from their earliest years were destined to shine forth in virtue, received their names at the very first from a divine source; while those who were to rise up in later years, had a name given them afterwards.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Ioannes ergo interpretatur in quo est gratia, vel domini gratia: quo nomine declaratur primo parentibus eius gratiam, quibus decrepitis nasceretur filius, esse donatam; deinde ipsi Ioanni, qui magnus coram domino erat futurus; postremo etiam filiis Israel, quos ad dominum erat conversurus: unde sequitur et erit gaudium tibi et exultatio.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; John is therefore interpreted, “one in whom is grace, or the grace of God;” by which name it is declared, first, that grace was given to his parents, to whom in their old age a son was to be born, next, to John himself, who was to become great before the Lord; lastly, also to the children of Israel, whom he was to convert to the Lord. Hence it follows, And he shall be a joy to you, and a cause of rejoicing.

Proprium vero in lege Nazaraeorum erat, vino et sicera tempore obsecrationis abstinere: unde Ioannes, ceterique tales, ut semper Nazaraei, idest sancti, manere possint, semper his abstinere satagunt: non enim decet vino, in quo est luxuria, inebriari eum qui musto spiritus sancti desiderat impleri: unde recte cui vini ebrietas tollitur, spiritus gratia cumulatur. Sequitur autem et spiritu sancto replebitur adhuc ex utero matris suae.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Sicera is interpreted “drunkenness,” and by the word the Hebrews understand any drink that can intoxicate, (whether made from fruits, corn, or any other thing.) But it was part of the law of the Nazarites to give up wine and strong drink at the time of their consecration. Hence John, and others like him, that they might always remain Nazarites, (i.e. holy,) are careful always to abstain from these things. For he ought not to be drunk with wine (in which is licentiousness) who desires to be filled with the new wine of the Holy Spirit; rightly then is he, from whom all drunkenness with wine is utterly put away, filled with the grace of the Spirit. But it follows, And he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit.

Alius est spiritus vitae huius, alius gratiae; ille nascendo sumit exordium, moriendo defectum; iste non aetatibus coercetur, non obitu extinguitur, non alvo matris excluditur.

There is one spirit of this life, another of grace. The former has its beginning at birth, its end at death; the latter is not tied down to times and seasons, is not quenched by death, is not shut out of the womb.

For the forerunner of Christ preached, not himself, but the Lord; and therefore it follows, And he shall go before Him.

In deserto Elias, in deserto Ioannes; ille Achab regis gratiam non quaesivit, hic sprevit Herodis; ille Iordanem divisit, hic ad lavacrum salutare convertit; hic prioris, ille sequentis domini praecursor adventus.

Power, so that he turned back the false hearts of the people to faith; power of abstinence, and patience, and the spirit of prophecy. Elijah was in the wilderness, in the wilderness also was John. The one sought not the favor of king Ahab; the other despised that of Herod.

An unseasonable time of life, an ill-suited nature; the planter infirm, the soil barren. But it is thought by some a thing unpardonable. in the priest, that he raises a course of objections; for whenever God declares any thing, it becomes us to receive it in faith, and moreover, disputes of this kind are the mark of a rebellious spirit.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; During the time of their course, the priests of the temple were so occupied by their office, that they kept themselves not only from the society of their wives, but even from the very threshold of their houses. Hence it is said, And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days were accomplished, &amp;c. For as there was then required a priestly succession from the root of Aaron, of necessity then a time was appointed for keeping up the inheritance. But as now not a carnal succession, but spiritual perfection, is looked for, the priests are enjoined (in order that they might ever be able to serve the altar) the perpetual observance of chastity. It follows: But after those days, &amp;c. that is, after the days of Zacharias’s ministration were completed. But these things were done in the month of September, the twenty-second day of the month, upon which the Jews were bound to observe the feast of the Tabernacles, just before the equinox, at which the night began to be longer than the day, because Christ must increase, but John must decrease And those days of fasting were not without their meaning; for by the mouth of John, repentance and mortification were to be preached to men.

At ubi et matura aevi senectus successerit, et aetas est regendis liberis habilior quam creandis, pudor est legitimi licet coitus gestare indicia, et gravari alienae aetatis onere, et tumescere alvum non sui temporis fructu. Pudebat ergo eam propter aetatem: unde intelligi potest causa, quia iam non conveniebant inter se concubitu coniugali: neque enim ea quae senilem non erubesceret coitum, erubesceret partum; haec tamen erubescit onus parentis, quamdiu nescit mysterium religionis. Sed quae occultabat se quia conceperat filium, iactare se coepit, quia generabat prophetam.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; What reason then for concealment, except shame? For there are certain allowed times in wedlock, when it is becoming to attend to the begetting of children; while the years thrive, while there is hope of child-bearing. But when in good time old age has come on, and the period of life is more fitted for governing children, than begetting them, it is a shame to bear about the signs of pregnancy, however lawful. It is a shame to be laden with the burden of another age, and for the womb to swell with the fruit of not one’s own time of life. It was a shame then to her on account of her age; and hence we may understand the reason why they did not at this time come together, for surely she who blushed not at their coming together in their old age, would not blush at her child-bearing; and yet she blushes at the parental burden, while she yet is unconscious of the religious mystery. But she who hid herself because she had conceived a son, began to glory that she carried in her womb a prophet.

Erant ambo iusti, quia bona est lex, et sacerdotium pro illo tempore sanctum: ambo processerant in diebus suis, quia adveniente Christo iam incurvantur ad senium. Ingreditur Zacharias templum, quia sacerdotum est intrare in sanctuarium mysteriorum caelestium; foris erat multitudo, quia mystica penetrare nequit. Dum altari thymiama imponit, nasciturum Ioannem agnoscit: quia dum doctores flamma divinae lectionis ardent, gratiam Dei per Iesum prodituram reperiunt; et hoc per Angelum, quia lex per Angelos ordinata est.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Now mystically by Zacharias may be signified the Jewish Priesthood, by Elisabeth the law itself; which, well administered by the teaching of the Priests, ought to have borne spiritual children to God, but was not able, because the Law made no one perfect. Both were just, because the law is good, and the Priesthood for that time holy; both were well stricken in years, because at Christ’s coming both the Law and Priesthood were just bending to old age. Zacharias enters the temple, because it is the priest’s office to enter into the sanctuary of heavenly mysteries. There was a multitude without the doors, because the multitude cannot penetrate mysteries. When he places frankincense on the altar, he discovers that John will be born; for while the teachers are kindled with the flame of divine reading, they find the grace of God flow to them through Jesus: and this is done by all angel, for the Law was ordained by angels.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; And yet Elisabeth conceives John, because the more inward parts of the Law abound with sacraments of Christ. She conceals her conception five months, because Moses in five books set forth the mysteries of Christ; or because the dispensation of Christ is represented by the words or deeds of the saints, in the five ages of the world.

We must understand the sixth month to be March, on the twenty-fifth day of which our Lord is reported to have been conceived, and to have suffered, as also to have been born on the twenty-fifth day of December. But if either the one day we believe to be the vernal equinox, or the other the winter solstice, it happens that with the increase of light He was conceived or born Who lightens every man that comes into the world. But if any one shall prove, that before the time of our Lord’s nativity or conception, light began either to increase, or supersede the darkness, we then say, that it was because John, before the appearance of His coming, began to preach the kingdom of heaven.

The angel announces the birth to the virgin not after the conception, lest she should be thereby too much troubled, but before the conception he addresses her, not in a dream, but standing by her in visible shape.

Maluit autem dominus aliquos de suo ortu quam de matris pudore dubitare: sciebat enim teneram esse virginis verecundiam et lubricam famam pudoris nec putavit ortus sui fidem matris iniuriis astruendam. Servatur itaque sanctae Mariae sicut pudore integra, ita et inviolabilis opinione virginitas: nec decuit sinistra virginibus opinione viventibus velamen excusationis relinqui, quod infamata mater quoque domini videretur. Quid autem Iudaeis, quid Herodi posset ascribi, si natum viderentur ex adulterio persecuti? Quemadmodum autem ipse diceret: non veni legem solvere, sed adimplere, si videretur coepisse a legis iniuria, cum partus innuptae lege damnetur? Quid quod etiam fides Mariae verbis maior adsciscitur, et mendacii causa removetur? Videretur enim culpam obumbrare voluisse mendacio innupta praegnans. Causam autem mentiendi desponsata non habuit, cum coniugii praemium et gratia nuptiarum partus sit feminarum. Non mediocris quoque causa est ut virginitas Mariae falleret principem mundi, qui cum desponsatam viro cerneret, partum non potuit habere suspectum.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Scripture has rightly mentioned that she was espoused, as well as a virgin, a virgin, that she might appear free from all connection with man; espoused, that she might not be branded with the disgrace of sullied virginity, whose swelling womb seemed to bear evident marks of her corruption. But the Lord had rather that men should cast a doubt upon His birth than upon His mother’s purity. He knew how tender is a virgin’s modesty, and how easily assailed the reputation of her chastity, nor did He think the credit of His birth was to be built up by His mother’s wrongs. It follows therefore, that the holy Mary’s virginity was of as untainted purity as it was also of unblemished reputation. Nor ought there, by an erroneous opinion, to be left the shadow of an excuse to living virgins, that the mother of our Lord even seemed to be evil spoken of. But what could be imputed to the Jews, or to Herod, if they should seen to have persecuted an adulterous offspring? And how could He Himself say, I came not to abolish the law, but to fulfill it, if He should seem to have had his beginning from a violation of the law, for the issue of an unmarried person is condemned by the law? Not to add that also greater credit is given to the words of Mary, and the cause of falsehood removed? For it might seem that unmarried becoming pregnant, she had wished to shade her guilt by a lie; but an espoused person has no reason for lying, since to women child-birth is the reward of wedlock, the grace of the marriage bed. Again, the virginity of Mary was meant to baffle the prince of the world, who, when he perceived her espoused to a mall, could cast no suspicion on her offspring.

When she heard the joyful words, she pondered them in her mind, and neither openly resisted through unbelief, nor forthwith lightly complied; avoiding equally the inconstancy of Eve, and the insensibility of Zacharias. Hence it is said, And she cast in her mind what manner of salutation this was, it is not said conception for as yet she knew not the vastness of the mystery.

For no one has known the Son but the Father. But He in Whom exists the infallible knowledge of His Son, is the true interpreter as to the name which should be given Him, when He says, This is my beloved Son; for such indeed from everlasting He is, though His name was not revealed till now; therefore he says, He shall be called, not shall be made or begotten. For before the worlds He was of like substance with the Father.

How subdued her answer is, compared with the words of the Priest. Then said Mary to the Angel, How shall this be? She says, How shall this be? He answers, Whereby shall I know this? He refuses to believe that which he says he does not know, and seeks as it were still further authority for belief. She avows herself willing to do that which she doubts not will be done, but how, she is anxious to know. Mary had read, Behold, she shall conceive and bear a son. She believed therefore that it should be but how it was to take place she had never read, for even to so great a prophet this had not been revealed.

These words of Mary are a token of what she was pondering in the secrets of her heart; for if for the sake of the marriage union she had wished to be espoused to Joseph, why was she seized with astonishment when the conception was made known to her? seeing in truth she might herself be expecting at the time to become a mother according to the law of nature. But because it was meet that her body being presented to God as an holy offering should be kept inviolate, therefore she says, Seeing that I know not a man.

Nay rather, shall it happen to you for this very reason, that you have never known a husband. For if you had, you would not have been thought worthy of the mystery, not that marriage is unholy, but virginity more excellent. It became the common Lord of all both to take part with us, and to differ with us in His nativity; for the being born from the womb, He shared in common with us, but in that He was born without cohabitation, He was exalted far above us.

For it is written, that Aaron, the first High Priest according to the law, took from the tribe of Judah for his wife Elisabeth, the daughter of Aminadab.

Potest enim facere quod aliquid non sit quod erat: velut cum aliquem qui coepit esse nascendo, faciat non esse moriendo. Quis autem dicat ut id quod iam non est, faciat non esse? Quidquid enim praeteritum est, iam non est; si de ipso fieri aliquid potest, adhuc est de quo fiat. Et si est, quomodo praeteritum est? Non ergo est quod vere diximus fuisse; sed ideo verum est illud fuisse, quia in nostra sententia verum est, non in ea re quae iam non est: hanc autem sententiam Deus falsam facere non potest. Omnipotentem autem Deum non ita dicimus ac si eum etiam mori posse credamus. Ille plane omnipotens vere solus dicitur qui vere est, et a quo solo est quidquid aliquo modo est.
          <td><b>AUG</b>, But whoever says, “If God is omnipotent, let Him cause those things which have been done to have not been done,” does not perceive that he says, “Let Him cause those things which are true, in that very respect in which they are true to be false.” For He may cause a thing not to be which was, as when He makes a man who began to be by birth, not to be by death. But who can say that He makes not to be that which no longer is in being? For whatever is past is no longer in being. But if aught can happen to a thing, that thing is still in being to which any thing happens, and if it is, how is it past? Therefore that is not in being which we have truly said has been, because the truth is, in our opinions, not in that thing which no longer is. But this opinion God can not make false; and we do not so call God omnipotent as supposing also that He could die. He plainly is alone truly called omnipotent, who truly is, and by whom alone that is, whatever in any wise exists, whether spirit or body.

At the same time also by calling herself handmaid, she claimed to herself in no other way the prerogative of such great grace than that she might do what was commanded her. For about to bring forth One meek and lowly, she was bound herself to show forth lowliness. As it follows, Be it to me according to your word. You have her submission, you see her wish.

But in order to say this, as the Evangelist has premised, she was filled with the Holy Spirit, by whose revelation undoubtedly she knew what that leaping of the child meant; namely, that the mother of Him had come to her, whose forerunner and herald that child was to be. Such then might be the meaning of so great an event; to be known indeed by grown up persons, but not understood by a little child; for she said not, “The babe leaped in faith in my womb,” but leaped for joy. Now we see not only children leaping for joy, but even the cattle; not surely from any faith or religious feeling, or any rational knowledge. But this joy was strange and unwonted, for it was in the womb; and at the coming of her who was to bring forth the Savior of the world. This joy, therefore, and as it were reciprocal salutation to the mother of the Lord, was caused (as miracles are) by Divine influences in the child, not in any human way by him. For even supposing the exercise of reason and the will had been so far advanced in that child, as that he should be able in the bowels of his mother to know, believe, and assent; yet surely that must be placed among the miracles of Divine power, not referred to human examples.

So then through Christ circumcision ceased, and baptism came in its place; but first it was right that John should be circumcised; as it is said, And it came to pass, that on the eighth day, &amp;c. For the Lord had said, Let the child of eight days be circumcised among you. But this measurement of time I conceive was ordered by Divine mercy for two reasons. First, because in its most tender years the child the more easily bears the cutting of the flesh. Secondly, that from the very operation itself we might be reminded that it was done for a sign; for the young child scarcely distinguishes any of the things that are around him. But after the circumcision, the name was conferred, as it follows, And they called him. But this was done because we must first receive the seal of the Lord, then the name of man. Or, because no man except he first cast aside his fleshly lusts, which circumcision signifies, is worthy to have his name written in the book of life.

          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Mire autem sanctus Evangelista praemittendum putavit quod plurimi infantem patris nomine Zachariam appellandum putarunt; ut advertas, matri non nomen alicuius displicuisse de genere; sed id sancto infusum spiritu, quod ab Angelo ante Zachariae fuerat praenuntiatum. Et quidem ille mutus intimare vocabulum filii nequivit uxori; sed per prophetiam Elisabeth didicit quod non didicerat a marito: unde sequitur et respondens mater eius dixit: nequaquam; sed vocabitur Ioannes. Nec mireris, si nomen mulier quod non audivit asseruit, quando spiritus ei sanctus, qui Angelo mandaverat, revelavit: neque poterat domini ignorare praenuntium, qui prophetaverat Christum. Et bene sequitur et dixerunt ad illam: quia nemo est in cognatione tua qui vocetur hoc nomine: ut intelligas nomen non generis esse, sed vatis. Zacharias quoque nutu interrogatur: unde sequitur innuebant autem patri eius quem vellet vocari eum. Sed quia incredulitas ei affatum eripuerat, et auditum; quod voce non poterat, manu et litteris est locutus: unde sequitur et postulans pugillarem, scripsit dicens: Ioannes est nomen eius: hoc est, non ei nos nomen imponimus qui iam a Deo nomen accepit.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; The holy Evangelist has especially remarked, that many thought the child should be called after his father Zacharias, in order that we might understand, not that any name of his kinsfolk was displeasing to his mother, but that the same word had been communicated to her by the Holy Spirit, which had been foretold by the Angel to Zacharias. And in truth, being dumb, Zacharias was unable to mention his son’s name to his wife, but Elisabeth obtained by prophecy what she had not learnt from her husband. Hence it follows, And she answered, &amp;c. Marvel not that the woman pronounced the name which she had never heard, seeing the Holy Spirit who imparted it to the Angel revealed it to her; nor could she be ignorant of the forerunner of the Lord, who had prophesied of Christ. And it well follows, And they said to her, &amp;c. that you might consider that the name belongs not to the family, but to the Prophet. Zacharias also is questioned, and signs made to him, as it follows, And they made signs to the father, &amp;c. But since unbelief had so bereft him of utterance and hearing, that he could not use his voice, he spoke by his hand-writing, as it follows, And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is John; that is, we give no name to him who has received his name from God.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Origenes in Lucam</b>: Zacharias quidem interpretatur memor Dei; Ioannes autem significat demonstrantem: ceterum et absentis memoria, et praesentis demonstratio est. Debebat autem Ioannes non memoriam Dei ut absentis exprimere, immo digito demonstrare praesentem, dicens: ecce agnus Dei.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; Zacharias is by interpretation “remembering God,” but John signifies “pointing to.” Now “memory” relates to something absent, “pointing to,” to something present. But John was not about to set forth the memory of God as absent, but with his finger to point him out as present, saying, Behold the Lamb of God.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But the name John is also interpreted the grace of God. Because then by the favor of Divine grace not by nature, Elisabeth conceived this son, they engraved the memory of the benefit on the name of the child.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. And because with the mother the dumb father also agreed as to the name of the child, it follows, And they all marveled. For there was no one of this name among their kinsfolk that any one could say that they had both previously determined upon it.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius Nazianzenus</b>: Editus ergo Ioannes Zachariae solvit silentium: unde sequitur apertum est autem illico os eius et lingua eius. Absurdum enim erat ut cum vox verbi progressa fuisset, pater maneret elinguis.
          <td><b>GREG. NAZ</b>. The birth of John then broke the silence of Zacharias, as it follows, And his mouth was opened. For it were unreasonable when the voice of the Word had come forth, that his father should remain speechless.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Merito etiam continuo resoluta est lingua eius: quia quam vinxerat incredulitas, solvit fides. Credamus igitur et nos, ut lingua nostra, quae incredulitatis vinculis est ligata, rationis voce solvatur: scribamus spiritu mysteria, si volumus loqui. Scribamus praenuntium Christi, non in tabulis lapideis sed in tabulis cordis carnalibus: etenim qui Ioannem loquitur, Christum prophetizat: sequitur enim et loquebatur benedicens Deum.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Rightly also, from that moment was his tongue loosed for that which unbelief had bound, faith set free. Let us then also believe, in order that our tongue, which has been bound by the chains of unbelief, may be loosed by the voice of reason. Let us write mysteries by the Spirit if we wish to speak. Let us write the forerunner of Christ, not on tables of stone, but on the fleshly tablets of the heart. For he who names John, prophesies Christ. For he who names John prophesies Christ. For it follows, And he spoke, giving thanks.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Allegorice autem Ioannis celebrata nativitas, gratia novi testamenti est inchoata; cui vicini et cognati nomen patris quam Ioannis imponere malebant: quia Iudaei qui ei legis observatione, quasi affinitate, iuncti erant, magis iustitiam quae ex lege est sectari, quam fidei gratiam suscipere cupiebant. Sed Ioannis, hoc est gratiae Dei, vocabulum, mater verbis, pater litteris nuntiare satagunt: quia et lex ipsa Psalmique et prophetae apertis sententiarum vocibus gratiam Christi praedicant, et sacerdotium illud vetus figuratis caeremoniarum ac sacrificiorum umbris eidem testimonium perhibet. Pulchreque Zacharias octavo die prolis editae loquitur: quia per domini resurrectionem, quae octava die, hoc est post septimum sabbati, facta est, occulta legalis sacerdotii arcana patuerunt.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Now in an allegory, the celebration of John’s birth was the beginning of the grace of the New Covenant. His neighbors and kinsfolk had rather give him the name of his father than that of John. For the Jews, who by the observance of the Law were united to him as it were by ties of kindred, chose rather to follow the righteousness which is the Law, than receive the grace of faith. But the name of John, (i.e. the grace of God,) his mother in word, his father in writing, suffice to announce, for both the Law itself as well as the Psalms and the Prophecies, in the plainest language foretell the grace of Christ; and that ancient priesthood, by the foreshadowing of its ceremonies and sacrifices, bears testimony to the same. And well does Zacharias speak on the eighth day of the birth of his child, for by the resurrection of the Lord, which took place on the eighth day, i.e. the day after the sabbath, the hidden secrets of the legal priesthood were revealed.

          <td><b>Beda</b>: Dixerat dominum, iuxta eloquia prophetarum, in domo David nasciturum: dicit eumdem, ad explendum testamentum quod Abrahae disposuit, nos esse liberaturum: quia his praecipue patriarchis de suo semine vel congregatio gentium vel Christi est incarnatio promissa. Praemittitur autem David, quia Abrahae sanctus Ecclesiae coetus est promissus; David autem, quod ex eo Christus nasciturus esset, audivit. Et ideo post id quod dictum est de David, subdit de Abraham, dicens ad faciendam misericordiam cum patribus nostris.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Having announced that the Lord, according to the declaration of the Prophet, would be born of the house of David, he now says, that the same Lord to fulfill the covenant He made with Abraham will deliver us, because chiefly to these patriarchs of Abraham’s seed was promised the gathering of the Gentiles, or the incarnation of Christ. But David is put first, because to Abraham was promised the holy assembly of the Church; whereas to David it was told that from him Christ was to he born. And therefore after what was said of David, he adds concerning Abraham the words, To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, &amp;c.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Origenes in Lucam</b>: Ego puto quod in adventu domini salvatoris et Abraham et Isaac et Iacob fruiti sint misericordia Dei. Non est enim credibile ut qui prius viderunt diem illius et laetati sunt, postea in adventu ipsius nihil utilitatis acciperent: cum scriptum sit: pacem faciens per sanguinem crucis suae, sive super terram, sive in caelis.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; I think that at the coming of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, both Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, were partakers of His mercy. For it is not to be believed, that they who had before seen His day, and were glad, should afterwards derive no advantage from His coming, since it is written, Having made peace through the blood of his Cross, whether in earth or in heaven.

          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Christi etiam gratia se usque ad illos extendit qui mortui extiterunt quia per eum resurgemus non solum nos, sed et qui fuerunt ante mortui. Fecit et misericordiam cum patribus nostris, secundum quod eorum spem et desiderium implevit: unde sequitur et memorari testamenti sui sancti, illius scilicet de quo dicitur: benedicens benedicam tibi et multiplicabo te. Multiplicatus est enim Abraham in omnibus gentibus per imitationem fidei eius adoptatis in filios: sed etiam patres videntes suos filios talia beneficia recepisse, congaudent et recipiunt misericordiam in seipsis: unde sequitur iusiurandum quod iuravit ad Abraham patrem nostrum daturum se nobis.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. The grace of Christ extends even to those who are dead, because through Him we shall rise again, not only we, but they also who have been dead before us. He performed His mercy also to our forefathers in fulfilling all their hopes and desires. Hence it follows, And to remember his holy covenant, that covenant, namely, wherein he said, Blessing, I will bless you, and multiplying, I will multiply you. For Abraham was multiplied in all nations, who became his children by adoption, through following the example of his faith. But the fathers also, seeing their children enjoy these blessings, rejoice together with them, just as if they received the mercy in themselves. Hence it follows, The oath which he swore to our father Abraham, that he would grant to us.

          <td><b>BASIL</b>; But let no one, hearing that the Lord had sworn to Abraham, be tempted to swear. For as when the wrath of God is spoken of, it does not signify passion but punishment; so neither does God swear as man, but His word is in very truth expressed to us in place of an oath, confirming by an unchangeable sentence what He promised.

Duo praedicta non facile reperiet aliquis sese comitantia: plures enim evitant pericula, sed vita gloriosa privantur; sicut sceleris patratores, qui de carcere ex indulgentia regia absolvuntur: e contra gaudent alii gloria, sed ob hanc periclitari coguntur; sicut milites bellicosi vitam inclytam amplexantes, securitate multoties caruerunt. Sed hoc cornu et salvat et glorificat: salvat quidem eripiens a manibus hostium, non leviter, sed mirifice, ut non sit ultra timendum: et hoc est quod dicit ut sine timore.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Having said that a horn of salvation had risen up to us from the house of David, he shows that through it we are partakers of His glory, and escape the assaults of the enemy As he says, That being delivered out of the hands of our enemies, we might serve him without fear. The two things above mentioned will not easily be found united. For many escape danger, but fail of a glorious life, as criminals discharged from prison by the king’s mercy. On the other hand, some reap glory, but are compelled for its sake to encounter dangers, as soldiers in war embracing a life of honor are oftentimes in the greatest peril. But the horn brings both safety and glory. Safety indeed as it rescues us from the hands of our enemies, not slightly but in a wonderful manner, insomuch that we have no more fear, which are his very words; that being delivered from the hand of our enemies, we might serve him without fear.

          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; Or in another way; Frequently are men delivered from the hands of the enemy, but not without fear. For when fear and peril have gone before, and a man is then plucked from the enemies’ hand, he is delivered indeed, but not without fear. Therefore said he, that the coming of Christ caused us to be snatched from the enemies’ hands without fear. For we suffered not from their evil designs, but He suddenly parting us from them, has led us out to our own allotted resting place.

Dicit autem non coram hominibus, ut hypocritae volentes hominibus placere, sed coram Deo, sicut hi quorum commendatio non est ab hominibus, sed a Deo; et hoc non semel aut ad tempus, sed singulis diebus et quamdiu vixerint: unde dicit omnibus diebus nostris.

Zacharias glorifies the Lord, because He has made us to serve Him with full confidence, not in the flesh as Judah did with the blood of victims, but in the spirit with good works. And this is what he means by in holiness and righteousness. For holiness is, a proper observance of our duty towards God, righteousness of our duty towards man; as, for example, when a man devoutly performs the Divine commands, and lives honorably among his fellow men. But he does not say “before men,” as of hypocrites desirous to please men, but “before God,” as of those whose praise is not of men, but of God; and this not once or for a time; but all the days of their life, as it is said, all our days.

Sciebat propheta alias esse aures prophetae, quae spiritu Dei, non corporis aetate reserantur. Habebat intelligendi sensum qui exultandi habebat affectum.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Now perhaps some may think it an absurd extravagance of the mind to address a child of eight days old. But if we keep our eyes fixed upon higher things, we surely can understand that the son might hear the voice of his father, who before he was born heard the salutation of Mary. The Prophet knew that there were certain organs of healing in a Prophet which were unclosed by the Spirit of God, not by the growth of the body. He possessed the faculty of understanding who was moved by the feeling of exultation.

And this is what follows, For you shall go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways.

His will ever tending to better things, was making its own advances, and his mind ever contemplating something more divine, while his memory was exercising itself, that it might lay up more and more things in its treasury, and more firmly retain them. But he adds, And he waxed strong. For human nature is weak, as we learn, the flesh is weak. It must therefore be made strong by the Spirit, for the Spirit is ready. Many wax strong in the flesh, but the wrestler of God must be strengthened by the Spirit that he may crush the wisdom of the flesh. He retires therefore to escape the noise of cities, and the thronging of the people. For it follows, And he was in the deserts. Where the air is purer, the sky more clear, and God a closer friend, that as the time had not yet arrived for his baptism and preaching, he might have leisure for praying, and might hold converse with the angels, calling upon God and fearing Him, saying, Behold, here am I.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; The Son of God, about to be born in the flesh, as by His birth of a virgin He showed that the grace of virginity was most pleasing in His sight, is therefore begotten in the most peaceful time of the world, because He taught men to seek peace, and condescends to visit those who follow it. But there could be no greater sign of peace than for the whole world to be brought together under one taxing, while its ruler Augustus reigned with so great peace for the twelve years, about the time of our Lord’s nativity, that war having been quelled throughout the whole world, there seemed to be a literal fulfillment of the Prophet’s prediction, They shall beat their swords into ploughshares, &amp;c.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Graecus</b>: Tunc etiam nascitur Christus cum principes Iudaeorum defecerant, et ad Romanos principes translatum erat imperium, quibus Iudaei tributa solvebant; et sic impletur prophetia praedicens: non deficere ducem de Iuda, nec principem de femoribus eius, donec veniat qui mittendus est. Iam vero Caesare Augusto quadragesimum secundum annum imperii peragente, exiit ab eo edictum totum orbem conscribi ad tributa solvenda; quod cuidam Cyrino Caesar commiserat, quem Iudaeae et Syriae praesidem statuit: unde sequitur haec descriptio prima facta est a praeside Syriae Cyrino.
          <td><b>GREEK EX</b>. Christ is born also at a time when the princes of Judah had failed, and the kingdom was transferred to Roman governors, to whom the Jews paid tribute; and then was fulfilled the, prophecy, saying, There shall not fail a leader from Judah, nor a prince from between his feet, until he shall come who is to be sent. And now when Caesar Augustus was in the 42 <sup>nd</sup> year of his reign, there went forth an edict from him that all the world should be taxed for the payment of tribute, the management of which he committed to a certain Cyrinus whom he made governor of Judea and Syria; and so it follows, This taxing was first made, &amp;c.

Now he added, a city of David, that he might declare that the promise made by God to David, namely, that from the fruit of his loins there should go before him a king for ever, was already fulfilled. Whence it follows, Because he was of the house and lineage of David. But since Joseph was of t e family of David, it pleased the Evangelist to make known also that the Virgin herself was of the same family, because the Divine law enjoined marriages between those of the same line; and therefore it follows, With Mary his espoused wife.

Denique ut scias censum non Augusti esse, sed Christi, totus orbis profiteri iubetur. Quis autem poterat professionem totius orbis exigere, nisi qui totius orbis habebat imperium?

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; There is described a secular registration, implied a spiritual, to be laid before the King not of earth but of Heaven; a registering of faith: a census of souls. For the old census of the Synagogue was abolished, a new census of the Church was preparing. And to decide that the census was not of Augustus, but of Christ, the whole world is ordered to be registered. For who could demand the registration of the whole world but He who had dominion over it, for the earth is not of Augustus, but the earth is the Lord’s?

          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; To those who attentively consider it, there seems to be expressed a kind of sacrament, in its being necessary that Christ should be put down in the registration of the whole world; in order that His name being written with all, He might sanctify all, and being placed in the census with the whole world, He might impart to the world the communion of Himself.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; As at that time in the reign of Augustus and under the governorship of Cyrinus, every one went to his own city to make returns of his property; so now when Christ reigns through His teachers (the governors of the Church) ought we to make returns of righteousness.

          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Haec est ergo prima professio mentium domino, cui omnes profitentur, non praeconis evocatione, sed vatis dicentis: omnes gentes, plaudite manibus. Denique ut sciant censum esse iustitiae, veniunt ad eum Ioseph et Maria, hoc est iustus et virgo: ille qui verbum servaret, ista quae pareret.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; This was then the first public enrollment of souls to the Lord, to Whom all enroll themselves not at the voice of the crier, but of the Prophet, who says, O clap your hands, all you people. But in order that men might know that the taxing was just, there came up to it Joseph and Mary, the just man and the virgin. He who kept the word and she who obeyed it.

Unde et bene Ioseph auctus interpretatur, indicans ipso nomine, quod instantia loquentis magistri nil valet, nisi augmentum superni iuvaminis, ut audiatur, acceperit.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Our city and country is the resting-place of the blessed, to which we ought to be traveling with daily increasing virtues. But day by day does Holy Church wait upon her Teacher, and going up from the course of worldly business (which the name of Galilee signifies) to the city of Judah, i.e. the city of confession and praise, make returns of her devotion to the Eternal King. She, after the example of the blessed Virgin Mary, a Virgin has conceived us of the Spirit. Though espoused to another, she is made fruitful by Him; and while visibly joined to the Pontiff who is placed over her, is invisibly filled with the graces of the Spirit. And hence Joseph is well interpreted increased, declaring by his very name, that the earnestness of the master speaking is of no avail, except he receive increasing help from above, that he may be heard.

          <td><b>Gregorius Nyssenus</b>: Apparens enim ut homo, non per omnia legibus humanae naturae subicitur: nam quod ex muliere nascitur, humilitatem redolet; virginitas vero, quae ortui deservivit, ostendit quam transcenderet hominem. Huius ergo iucunda portatio, ortus immaculatus, partus facilis, absque corruptela nativitas: nec ex luxu incipiens, nec doloribus edita: quia namque ea quae naturae nostrae mortem per culpam inseruit, damnata est ut cum doloribus pareret, oportebat parentem vitae cum gaudio partum perficere. Eo autem tempore per incorruptionem virgineam ad vitam transmigrat mortalium in quo diminui incipiunt tenebrae, et nocturna immensitas exuberantia radii deficere cogitur. Mors enim peccati finem pravitatis attigerat; sed de cetero tendit ad nihilum propter verae lucis praesentiam, quae radiis evangelicis totum orbem lustravit.
          <td><b>GREG. NYSS</b>. Though coming in the form of man, yet not in every thing is He subject to the laws of man’s nature; for while His being born of a woman, tells of human nature; virginity becoming capable of childbirth betokens something above man. Of Him then His mother’s burden was light, the birth immaculate, the delivery without pain, the nativity without defilement, neither beginning from wanton desire, nor brought to pass with sorrow. For as she who by her guilt engrafted death into our nature, was condemned to bring forth in trouble, it was meet that she who brought life into the world should accomplish her delivery with joy. But through a virgin’s purity He makes His passage into mortal life at a time in which the darkness was beginning to fail, and the vast expanse of night to fade away before the exceeding brightness of the light. For the death of sin had brought an end of wickedness which from henceforth tends to nothing by reason of the presence of the true light which has illuminated the whole world with the rays of the Gospel.

Daily in the Virgin’s womb, i.e. in the mind of believers, Christ is conceived by faith, born by baptism. It follows, and she brought forth her firstborn son.

Nos autem ita definimus. Unigenitus est primogenitus, non omnis primogenitus est unigenitus. Primogenitum non esse dicimus eum quem alii subsequuntur, sed ante quem nullus: alioquin si non est primogenitus nisi is quem sequantur et fratres, tamdiu sacerdotibus primogenita non debentur, quamdiu et alii fuerint procreati, ne forte partu postea non sequente, unigenitus sit, et non primogenitus.
          <td><b>JEROME</b>; From this Helvidius strives to prove that no one can be called firstborn who has not brothers, as he is called only-begotten who is the only son of his parents. But we thus determine the matter. Every only-begotten is firstborn, not every firstborn is only-begotten. We say not that he is first-begotten whom others follow, but before whom there is no one; (otherwise, supposing there is no firstborn but who has brothers following him, there are then no firstlings due to the priests as long as there are no others begotten;) lest perchance when no birth follows afterward, there should be an only-begotten and not a firstborn.

But the Angel went not to Jerusalem, sought not for Scribes and Pharisees, (for they were corrupt and tormented with envy.) But these were simple men living in the ancient practices of Moses and the Patriarchs. There is a certain road which leads by innocence to Philosophy.

For Angels before the coming of the Savior could bring little help to those entrusted to them, for scarcely did one single Gentile believe in God. But now whole nations come to the faith of Jesus.

But because He is both God and man, rightly do they sing Peace to men and Glory to God. As it follows, Praising God and saying, Glory to God in the highest. As soon as one Angel, one messenger, had brought the good tidings that God was born in the flesh, the multitude of the heavenly host broke forth in the praise of the Creator, in order both to fix their devotion on Christ, and to instruct us by their example, that as often as any of the brethren shall sound forth the word of sacred learning, or we ourselves shall have brought these holy things home to our minds, we should with our whole heart, our mouths and hands, return praise to God.

Falluntur autem destruentes sua principia. Si enim fateretur Ebion Christum Deum caelitus descendentem octavo die fuisse circumcisum, tunc praeberet circumcisioni materiam argumenti; sed cum nudum hunc asserit hominem, non puer est causa ut circumcidatur, sicut nec infantes sunt suae circumcisionis auctores. Nos enim Deum ipsum fatemur caelitus descendentem, et in claustro virgineo moram debitam fetibus protraxisse, quoadusque sibi ex utero virgineo humanitatis carnem perfecte componeret, in qua circumcisus est veraciter, non apparenter octavo die, quatenus cum ad spiritualem effectum figurae pervenerint, tam ab ipso, quam a suis discipulis divulgentur non ultra figurae, sed veritas.
          <td><b>EPIPHAN</b>. Now the followers of Ebion and Cerinthus say, “It is enough for a disciple if he be as his Master. But Christ circumcised Himself. Be you therefore circumcised.” But herein do they deceive themselves, destroying their own principles; for if Ebion should confess that Christ as God descended from heaven and was circumcised on the eighth day, it might then afford the ground of an argument for circumcision; but since he affirms Him to be mere man, surely as a boy he cannot be the cause of Himself being circumcised, as neither are infants the authors of their own circumcision. But we confess that it is God Himself who has descended from heaven, and that enclosed in a virgin’s womb, He abode there the whole time necessary for her delivery, until He should perfectly form to Himself of the virgin’s womb a human body; and that in this body He was not in appearance but truly circumcised on the eighth day, in order that the figures having come to this spiritual fulfillment, both by Himself and His disciples, might now be spread abroad no longer the figures but the reality.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Origenes in Lucam</b>: Sicut enim mortui sumus cum illo moriente, et consurreximus resurgenti; sic cum eo circumcisi sumus: unde nequaquam nunc indigemus circumcisione carnali.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; As we have died with Him at His death, and risen together with Him at His resurrection, so with Him have we been circumcised, and therefore need not now circumcision in the flesh.

          <td><b>Epiphanius</b>: Pluribus autem ex causis circumcisus est Christus. Et primo quidem ut ostendat carnis veritatem contra Manichaeum et illos qui apparenter eum dicunt prodiisse: deinde ut pateat quod nequaquam deitati consubstantiale corpus extiterit, ut fatur Apollinaris; neque caelitus detulit illud, ut asserit Valentinus: et ut confirmet circumcisionem, quam olim instituerat eius adventui servientem: quin etiam ut nulla sit Iudaeis excusatio: nam nisi circumcisus fuisset, obicere poterant quod non possent incircumcisum Christum recipere.
          <td><b>EPIPHAN</b>. Christ was circumcised for several reasons. First indeed to show the reality of His flesh, in opposition to Manichaus and those who say that He came forth in appearance only. Secondly, that He might prove that His body was not of the same substance with the Deity, according to Apollinaris, and that it descended not from heaven, as Valentinian said. Thirdly, to add a confirmation to circumcision which He had of old instituted to wait His coming. Lastly, to leave no excuse to the Jews. For had He not been circumcised, they might have objected that they could not receive Christ uncircumcised.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Ut etiam nobis obediendi virtutem commendaret exemplo, et ut eos qui sub lege positi legis onera portare nequiverant, sua compassione iuvaret; ut qui in similitudine carnis peccati advenit, remedium quo caro peccati consueverat mundari, non respuat. Idem enim salutiferae curationis auxilium circumcisio in lege contra originalis peccati vulnus agebat quod nunc Baptismus revelatae gratiae tempore consuevit; excepto quod regni caelestis ianuam nondum intrare poterant, sed in sinu Abrahae post mortem beata requie consolati supernae pacis ingressum spe felici expectabant.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; He was circumcised also that He might enjoin upon us by His example the virtue of obedience and might take compassion on them who being placed under the law, were unable to bear the burdens of the law, to the end that He who came in the likeness of sinful flesh might not reject the remedy with which sinful flesh was wont to be healed. For circumcision brought in the law the same assistance of a saving cure to the wound of original sin which Baptism does in the time of the grace of revelation, except that as yet the circumcised could not enter the gates of the heavenly kingdom, but comforted after death with a blessed rest in Abraham’s bosom, they waited with a joyful hope for their entrance into eternal peace.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Athanasius</b>: Nihil enim aliud exprimebat circumcisio nisi generationis vetustae spoliationem per hoc quod circumcidebatur pars corporis quae corporalis nativitatis causa existit. Hoc autem tunc temporis agebatur in signum futuri per Christum Baptismatis. Idcirco postquam venit signatum, cessavit figura: ubi namque tota vetustas tollitur per Baptismum, superfluum est quod partis sectio praefigurat.
          <td><b>ATHAN</b>. For circumcision expressed nothing else, but the stripping off of the old birth, seeing that part was circumcised which caused the birth of the body. And thus it was done at that time as a sign of the future baptism through Christ. Therefore as soon as that of which it was a sign came, the figure ceased. For since the whole of the old man Adam is taken away by baptism, there remains nothing which the cutting of a part prefigures.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Now in His resurrection was prefigured the resurrection of each of us both in the flesh and the Spirit, for Christ has taught us by being circumcised that our nature must both now in itself be purged from the stain of vice, and at the last day be restored from the plague of death. And as the Lord rose on the eighth day, i.e. the day after the seventh, (which is the Sabbath,) so we also after six ages of the world and after the seventh, which is the rest of souls, and is now carrying on in another life, shall rise as on the eighth day.

Sed ut nos a legis vinculo solveremur, sicut Christus, ita et beata Maria legi est sponte subiecta.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; If you diligently examine the words of the law, you will find indeed that the mother of God as she is free from all connection with man, so is she exempt from any obligation of the law. For not every woman who brings forth, but she who has received seed and brought forth, is pronounced unclean, and by the ordinances of the law is taught that she must be cleansed, in order to distinguish probably from her who though a virgin has conceived and brought forth. But that we might be loosed from the bonds of the law, as did Christ, so also Mary submitted herself of her own will to the law.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">

Sequitur tulerunt illum in Ierusalem, ut sisterent eum domino.
          <td><b>TITUS BOST</b>. Therefore the Evangelist has well observed, that the days of her purification were come according to the law, who since she had conceived of the Holy Spirit, was free from all uncleanness. It follows, They brought him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord.

Sicut enim non gratia sui homo factus est et circumcisus in carne, sed ut nos per gratiam faceret deos, et ut spiritualiter circumcidamur; sic propter nos sistitur domino, ut discamus Deo praesentare nosipsos.
          <td><b>ATHAN</b>. But when was the Lord hid from His Father’s eye, that He should not be seen by Him, or what place is excepted from His dominion, that by remaining there He should be separate from His Father unless brought to Jerusalem and introduced into the temple? But for us perhaps these things were written. For as not to confer grace on Himself was He made man and circumcised in the flesh, but to make us Gods through grace, and that we might be circumcised in the Spirit, so for our sakes is He presented to the Lord, that we also might learn to present ourselves to the Lord.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">

Sequitur sicut scriptum est in lege domini.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; On the thirty-third day after His circumcision He is presented to the Lord, signifying in a mystery that no one but he who is circumcised from his sins is worthy to come into the Lord’s sight, that no one who ho has not severed himself from all human ties can perfectly enter into the joys of the heavenly city. It follows, As it is written in the law of the Lord.

          <td><b>Origenes in Lucam</b>: Ubi sunt qui Deum legis negant a Christo fuisse in Evangelio praedicatum? An putandum est quod filium suum bonus Deus sub lege inimici fecit, quam ipse non dederat? In lege enim Moysi scriptum est quod sequitur: quia omne masculinum adaperiens vulvam sanctum domino vocabitur.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; Where are they who deny that Christ proclaimed in the Gospel the law to be of God, or can it be supposed that the righteous God made His own Son under a hostile law which He Himself had not given? It is written in the law of Moses as follows, Every male which opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Quod dicit adaperiens vulvam, et hominis et pecoris primogenitum significat; quod utrumque sanctum domino vocari, atque ideo sacerdotis esse, praeceptum est; ita dumtaxat ut pro hominis primogenito pretium acciperet et omne animal immundum redimi faceret.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; By the words, opening the womb, he signifies the first-born both of man and beast, and each one of which was, according to the commandment, to be called holy to the Lord, and therefore to become the property of the priest, that is, so far that he was to receive a price for every first-born of man, and oblige every unclean animal to be ransomed.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius Nyssenus</b>: Hoc autem legis decretum in solo incarnato Deo, singulariter et ab aliis differenter, impleri videtur: ipse namque solus ineffabiliter conceptus ac incomprehensibiliter editus, virginalem uterum aperuit, non ante a connubio reseratum; servans et post partum mirabile inviolabiliter signaculum castitatis.
          <td><b>GREG. NYSS</b>. Now this commandment of the law seems to have had its fulfillment in the incarnate God, in a very remarkable and peculiar manner. For He alone, ineffably conceived and incomprehensibly brought forth, opened the virgin’s womb, till then unopened by marriage, and after this birth miraculously retaining the seal of chastity.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius in Lucam</b>: Non enim virilis coitus vulvae virginalis secreta reseravit: sed immaculatum semen inviolabili utero spiritus sanctus infudit. Qui ergo vulvam sanctificavit alienam ut nasceretur propheta, hic est qui aperuit matri suae vulvam, ut immaculatus exiret.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; For no union with man disclosed the secrets of the virgin’s womb, but the Holy Spirit infused the immaculate seed into an inviolate womb. He then who sanctified another womb in order that a prophet should be born, He it is who has opened the womb of His own mother, that the Immaculate should come forth.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Quod ergo ait adaperiens vulvam, consuetae nativitatis more loquitur; non quod dominus sacri ventris hospitium, quod ingressus sanctificarat, egressus devirginasse credendus sit.
          <td>By the words opening the womb, he speaks of birth after the usual manner, not that the sacred abode of the virgin’s womb, which our Lord in entering sanctified, should now be thought by His proceeding forth from it to be deprived of its virginity.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius Nyssenus</b>: Solus autem hic partus masculinus spiritualiter esse conspicitur qui nil de femineitate culpae portavit: unde revera sanctus vocatus est: unde et Gabriel quasi hoc decretum ad ipsum solum pertinere memorans, dicebat: quod ex te nascetur sanctum, vocabitur filius Dei. Et in ceteris quidem primogenitis sanctos illos vocari evangelica solertia statuit, tamquam oblatione divina sortitos huiusmodi nomen: at in totius primogenito creaturae, quod nascitur sanctum pronuntiat Angelus, quasi proprie sanctum existens.
          <td><b>GREG. NYSS</b>. But the offspring of this birth is alone seen to be spiritually male, as contracting no guilt from being born of a woman. Hence He is truly called holy, and therefore Gabriel, as if announcing that this commandment belonged to Him only, said, That Holy thing which shall be born of you shall be called, the Son of God. Now of other first-borns the wisdom of the Gospel has declared that they are called holy from their being offered to God. But the first-born of every creature, That holy thing which is born, &amp;c. the Angel pronounces to be in the nature of its very being holy.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Solus enim per omnia in natis de femina sanctus dominus Iesus, qui terrenae contagia corruptelae immaculati partus novitate non senserit, et caelesti maiestate depulerit: nam si litteram sequimur, quomodo sanctus omnis masculus, cum multos sceleratissimos fuisse non lateat? Sed ille sanctus quem in figura futuri mysterii legis divinae praescripta signabant; eo quod solus sanctae Ecclesiae virginis ad generandos populos aperiret genitale secretum.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; For among those that are born of a woman, the Lord Jesus alone is in every thing holy, who in the newness of His immaculate birth experienced not the contagion of earthly defilement, but by His Heavenly Majesty dispelled it. For if we follow the letter, how can every male be holy, since it is undoubted that many have been most wicked? But He is holy whom in the figure of a future mystery the pious ordinances of the divine law prefigured, because He alone was to open the hidden womb of the holy virgin Church for the begetting of nations.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: O profunditas scientiarum sapientiae et scientiae Dei.

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Oh the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! He offers victims, Who in each victim is honored equally with the Father. The Truth preserves the figures of the law. He who as God is the Maker of the law, as man has kept the law. Hence it follows, And that they should give a victim as it was ordered in the law of the Lord, a pair of turtle doves or two young pigeons.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Hostia autem haec pauperum erat; praecepit quippe dominus in lege ut qui possent agnum pro filio aut filia, simul et turturem sive columbam offerrent: qui vero non sufficiebant ad offerendum agnum, duos iam turtures vel duos columbae pullos offerrent. Ergo dominus cum dives esset, pauper fieri dignatus est, ut nos sua paupertate divitiarum suarum donaret esse participes.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Now this was the victim of the poor. For the Lord commanded in the law that they who were should offer a lamb for a son or a daughter as well as a turtle dove or pigeon; but they who were not able to offer a lamb should give two turtle doves or two young pigeons. Therefore the Lord, though he was rich, deigned to become poor, that by his poverty He might make us partakers of His riches.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Videndum autem quid haec oblata insinuant. Nimirum loquacissima est turtur in avibus; et columba est animal mansuetum. Talis autem factus est erga nos salvator, mansuetudinem perfecte colens, et ut turtur orbem allexit, replens hortum suum propriis melodiis. Occidebatur ergo turtur aut columba, ut ipse per figuras nobis pandatur passurus in carne pro vita mundi.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; But let us see what these offerings mean. The turtle dove is the most vocal of birds, and the pigeon the gentlest. And such was the Savior made unto us; He was endowed with perfect meekness, and like the turtle dove entranced the world, filling His garden with His own melodies. There was killed then either a turtle dove or a pigeon, that by a figure He might be shown forth to us as about to suffer in the flesh for the life of the world.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Vel columba simplicitatem, turtur indicat castitatem: quia et columba simplicitatis, et castitatis amator est turtur; ita ut si coniugem casu perdiderit, non ultra aliam quaerere curet. Merito ergo turtur et columba domino offeruntur in hostiam: quia simplex et pudica fidelium conversatio est illi iustitiae sacrificium gratum.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Or the pigeon denotes simplicity, the turtle dove chastity, for the pigeon is a lover of simplicity, and the turtle dove of chastity, so that if by chance she has lost her mate, she heeds not to find another. Rightly then are the pigeon and turtle dove offered as victims to the Lord, because the simple and chaste conversation of the faithful is a sacrifice of righteousness well pleasing to Him.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Athanasius</b>: Ideo vero bina iussit offerri, quia homine consistente ex anima et corpore, duplum a nobis poscit Deus, castitatem et mansuetudinem, non solum corporis, sed etiam animae: alioquin erit homo fictor et hypocrita, gerens in tegumentum occultae malitiae innocentiam apparentem.
          <td><b>ATHAN</b>. He ordered two things to be offered, because as man consists of both body and soul, the Lord requires a double return from us, chastity and meekness, not only of the body, but also of the soul. Otherwise, man will be a dissembler and hypocrite, wearing the face of innocence to mask his hidden malice.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Cum vero utraque avis propter consuetudinem gemendi praesentes sanctorum luctus designet; in hoc tamen differunt, quod turtur solivagus, columba autem gregatim volare consuevit; et ob id iste secretas orationum lacrymas, illa publicos Ecclesiae conventus insinuat.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; But while each bird, from its habit of wailing, represents the present sorrows of the saints, in this they differ, that the turtle is solitary, but the pigeon flies about in flocks, and hence the one points to the secret tears of confession, the other to the public assembling of the Church.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Vel columba, quae gregatim volat, activae vitae frequentiam demonstrat; turtur qui singularitate gaudet, speculativae vitae culmina denuntiat. Et quia aeque utraque conditori accepta est hostia, consulte Lucas utrum turtures an pulli columbarum pro domino sint oblati non dixit, ne unum alteri vivendi ordinem praeferret, sed utrumque sequendum doceret.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Or the pigeon which flies in flocks sets forth the busy intercourse of active life. The turtle, which delights in solitariness, tells of the lofty heights of the contemplative life. But because each victim is equally accepted by the Creator, St. Luke has purposely omitted whether the turtles or young pigeons were offered for the Lord, that he might not prefer one mode of life before another, but teach that both ought to be followed.

For scarcely is righteousness preserved without fear, I mean not that fear which dreads the loss of worldly goods, (which perfect love casts out,) but that holy fear of the Lord which abides for ever, by which the righteous man, the more ardent his love to God, is so much the more careful not to offend Him.

In a most especial manner then he threatens them with not only a fall from spiritual freedom, but also the destruction of their city, and of those who dwelt among them. But a resurrection is promised to believers, partly indeed as subject to the law, and about to be delivered from its bondage, but partly as buried together with Christ, and rising with Him.

For the language of prophecy declared that there shall be a stone of falling, and a rock of offense, that they who believe on Him should not be confounded. The fall therefore is to them who are offended with the meanness of His coming in the flesh; the rising again to those who acknowledge the steadfastness of the Divine purpose.

          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; But we must take care lest by chance the Savior should not come to some equally for the fall and rising again; for when I stood in sin, it was first good for me to fall, and die to sin. Lastly, Prophets and Saints when they were designing some great thing, used to fall on their faces, that by their fall their sins should be the more fully blotted out. This it is that the Savior first grants to you. You were a sinner, let that which is sin fall in you, that you may thence rise again, and say, If we be dead with Him, we shall also live with Him.

          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; But all the things which history relates of Christ are spoken against, not that those who believe on Him speak against Him, (for we know that all the things which are written of Him are true,) but that every thing which has been written of Him is with the unbelievers a sign which is spoken against.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; No history tells us that Mary departed this life by being slain with the sword, therefore since not the soul but the body is killed with iron, we are left to understand that sword which is mentioned, And a sword in their lips, that is, grief because of our Lord’s passion passed through her soul, who although she saw Christ the very Son of God die a voluntary death, and doubted not that He who was begotten of her flesh would overcome death, could not without grief see Him crucified.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or by this is signified that Mary also, through whom was performed the mystery of the incarnation, looked with doubt and astonishment at the death of her Lord, seeing the Son of God so humbled as to come down even to death. And as a sword passing close by a man causes fear, though it does not strike him; so doubt also causes sorrow, yet does not kill; for it is not fastened to the mind, but passes through it as through a shadow.

Vel hoc dictum est, quatenus tempore passionis pateant ex plurium cordibus meditationes, et emendentur per resurrectionem: velox enim illis post ambiguitatem certitudo supervenit: nisi forte revelationem illuminationem quis aestimet, ut solitum est Scripturae.

The word that marks the non event; it is not used causatively; for when all these events took place, there followed the discovery of many men’s intentions. For some confessed God on the cross, others even then ceased not from their blasphemies and revilings. Or this was said, meaning that at the time of the passion the thoughts of men’s hearts should be laid open, and be corrected by the resurrection. For doubts are quickly superseded by certainty. Or perhaps by revealing may be meant, the enlightening of the thoughts, as it is often used in Scripture.

Si enim revelaverimus peccata nostra non solum Deo, sed his qui possunt mederi vulneribus nostris, delebuntur peccata nostra.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; But the evil thoughts of men were revealed, that He Who died for us might slay them; for while they were hidden, it was impossible to utterly destroy them. Hence also when we have sinned we ought to say, Mine iniquity have I not hid. For if we make known our sins not only to God, but to whoever can heal our wounds, our sins will be blotted out.

For the highest blessing, if any can possess it, is the grace of virginity, but if this cannot be, and it chance to a woman to lose her husband, let her remain a widow, which indeed not only after the death of her husband, but even while he is living, she ought to have in her mind, that supposing it should not happen, her will and determination might be crowned by the Lord, and her words should be, “This I vow, and promise, that if a certain condition of this life be mine, (which yet I wish not,) I will do nothing else but remain inviolate and a widow.” Most justly then was this holy woman thought worthy to receive the gift of prophecy, because by long chastity and long fastings she had ascended to this height of virtue, as It follows, Who departed not from the temple with fastings and prayers, &amp;c.

            <p><b>ORIGEN</b>; But because Anna’s words were nothing remarkable, and of no great note respecting Christ, the Gospel does not give the particulars of what she said, and perhaps for this reason one may suppose that Simeon anticipated her, since he indeed bore the character of the law, (for his name signifies obedience,) but she the character of grace, (which her name is by interpretation,) and Christ came between them. Therefore He let Simeon depart dying with the law, but Anna he sustains living beyond through grace.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; According to the mystical meaning, Anna signifies the Church, who at present is indeed a widow by the death of her Husband; the number also of the years of her widowhood marks the time of the Church, at which established in the body, she is separated from the Lord. For seven times twelve make eighty-four, seven indeed referring to the course of this world, which revolves in seven days; but twelve had reference to the perfection of Apostolic teaching, and therefore the Universal Church, or any faithful soul which strives to devote the whole period of its life to the following of Apostolic practice, is said to serve the Lord for eighty-four years. The term also of seven years, during which she lived with her husband, coincides. For through the prerogative of our Lord’s greatness, whereby abiding in the flesh, He taught, the simple number of seven years was taken to express the sign of perfection. Anna also favors the mysteries of the Church, being by interpretation its “grace,” and being both the daughter of Phanuel, who is called “the face of God,” and descended from the tribe of Aser, i.e. the blessed.

For the Evangelists individually are wont to omit certain things which they either know to have been, or in the Spirit foresee will be, related by others, so that in the connected chain of their narrative, they seem as it were to have omitted nothing, whereas by examining the writings of another Evangelist, the careful reader may discover the places where the omissions have been.

Sed intelligendum est, ubi Angelus in somnis in Aegypto dixit ad Ioseph: surge, et accipe puerum et matrem eius, et vade in terram Israel, sic intellectum primo esse a Ioseph, ut putaret iussum se esse pergere in Iudaeam: ipsa enim intelligi primitus potuit terra Israel. Porro autem postea, quoniam comperit illic regnare filium Herodis Archelaum, noluit obicere se illi periculo; cum posset terra Israel etiam sic intelligi, ut etiam Galilaea illi deputaretur, quia et ipsam populus Israel incolebat.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Perhaps it may strike you as strange that Matthew should say that His parents went with the young Child into Galilee because they were unwilling to go to Judea for fear of Archelaus, when they seem to have gone into Galilee rather because their city was Nazareth in Galilee, as Luke in this place explains it. But we must consider, that when the Angel said in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, Rise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel, it was at first understood by Joseph as a command to go into Judea, for so at first sight the land of Israel might have been taken to mean. But when afterwards he finds that Herod’s son Archelaus was king, he was unwilling to be exposed to that danger, seeing the land of Israel might also be understood to include Galilee also as a part of it, for there also the people of Israel dwelt.

          <td><b>GREEK EX</b>. Or again, Luke is here describing the time before the descent to Egypt, for before her purification Joseph had not taken Mary there But before they went down into Egypt, they were not told by God to go to Nazareth but as living more freely in their own country, thither of their own accord they went; for since the going up to Bethlehem was for no other reason but the taxing, when that was accomplished they go down to Nazareth.

          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Si enim dum parvus aetate erat, omnem sapientiam demonstrasset, videretur prodigium; sed per profectum aetatis seipsum ostendebat, ut totum impleret orbem. Non autem quasi suscipiens sapientiam, spiritu confortari dicitur: quod enim ab initio perfectissimum est, quomodo potest deinde perfectius fieri? Unde sequitur plenus sapientia; et gratia Dei erat in illo.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. For if while yet a little child, He had displayed His wisdom, He would have seemed a miracle, but together with the advance of age He gradually showed Himself, so as to fill the whole world. For not as receiving wisdom is He said to be strengthened in spirit. For that which is most perfect in the beginning, how can that become any more perfect. Hence it follows, Filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was in him.

          <td><b>Beda</b>: Sapientia quidem, quia in ipso habitat omnis plenitudo divinitatis corporaliter; gratia autem, quia homini Iesu Christo magna gratia donatum est ut ex quo homo fieri coepisset, perfectus esset et Deus; multo autem magis in eo quod verbum Dei et Deus erat, nec confortari indigebat, nec habebat augeri. Adhuc autem cum parvulus esset, habebat gratiam Dei; ut quomodo in illo omnia mirabilia fuerant, ita et pueritia mirabilis esset, ut Dei sapientia compleretur. Sequitur et ibant parentes eius per omnes annos in Ierusalem, in die solemni Paschae.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Wisdom truly, for in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, but grace, because it was in great grace given to the man Christ Jesus, that from the time He began to be man He should be perfect man and perfect God. But much rather because He was the word of God, and God needed not to be strengthened, nor was in a state of growth. But while He was yet a little child He had the grace of God, that as in Him all things were wonderful, His childhood also might be wonderful, so as to be filled with the wisdom of God. It follows, And his parents went every year to Jerusalem, at the feast of the Passover.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. At the feast of the Hebrews the law commanded men not, only to observe the time, but the place, and so the Lord’s parents wished to celebrate the feast of the Passover only at Jerusalem.

          <td><b>Augustinus de Cons. Evang</b>: Quomodo autem ibant parentes eius per omnes annos pueritiae Christi in Ierusalem, si Archelai timore illuc prohibebantur accedere? Hoc mihi dissolvere non esset difficile, nec si aliquis Evangelistarum expressisset quamdiu regnaret Archelaus: fieri enim poterat ut per diem festum inter tam ingentem turbam latenter ascenderent mox reversuri; ubi tamen aliis diebus habitare metuerunt, ut nec solemnitate praetermissa essent irreligiosi, nec continua mansione conspicui. Cum vero etiam de regno Archelai omnes quam fuerit diuturnum tacuerint, iste quoque intellectus patet: quod Lucas dicit, per omnes annos eos ascendere solitos in Ierusalem, tunc accipimus factum, cum iam non timeretur Archelaus.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But it may be asked, how did His parents go up all the years of Christ’s childhood to Jerusalem, if they were prevented from going there by fear of Archelaus? This question might be easily answered, even had some one of the Evangelists mentioned how long Archelaus reigned. For it were possible that on the feast day amid so great a crowd they might secretly come, and soon return again, at the same time that they feared to remain there on other days, so as neither to be wanting in religious duties by neglecting the feast, nor leave themselves open to detection by a constant abode there. But now since all have been silent as to the length of Archelaus’ reign, it is plain that when Luke says, They were accustomed to go up every year to Jerusalem, we are to understand that to have been when Archelaus was no longer feared.

It is said, When the days were accomplished, because the feast lasted seven days. But the reason of His tarrying behind in secret was, that His parents might not be a hindrance to His carrying on the discussion with the lawyers; or perhaps to avoid appearing to despise his parents by not obeying their commands. He remains therefore secretly, that he might neither be kept away nor be disobedient.

To which it is answered, that the custom of the children of Israel while assembling at Jerusalem on the feast days, or returning to their homes, was for the women and men to go separately, and the infants or children to go with either parent indiscriminately. And so both Mary and Joseph each thought in turn that the Child Jesus, whom they saw not with them, was returning with the other parent.

Seek Him in the Church, and seek Him among the masters who are in the temple. For if you wilt so seek Him, you shall find Him.

And this He did as a duty of reverence, that He might set us an example of the proper behavior of children, though they be wise and learned, rather to hear their masters than teach them, and not to vaunt themselves with empty boasting.

But why sought they Him sorrowing? Was it that he might have perished or been lost? It could not be. For what should cause them to dread the loss of Him whom they knew to be the Lord? But as whenever you read the Scriptures you search out their meaning with pains, not that you suppose them to have erred or to contain any thing incorrect, but that the truth which they have inherent in them you are anxious to find out; so they sought Jesus, lest perchance leaving them he should have returned to heaven, thither to descend when He would.

Super haec autem omnia nihil ascendit super verticem eius, nec humana manus, excepta materna. Hinc autem possumus utilitatem consequi: dum enim Mariam increpat dominus quaerentem ipsum inter propinquos, omissionem vinculorum sanguinis apertissime suggerit; ostendens quod non contingit metam perfectionis attingere eum qui adhuc vagatur in his quae corpori conferunt; et quod homo deficit a perfectione per affectum cognatorum. Sequitur et ipsi non intellexerunt verbum quod locutus est ad illos.
          <td><b>GREEK EX</b>. This is the first demonstration of the and power of the Child Jesus. For as to what are called you acts of His childhood, we can not but suppose them to be the work not only of a childish but even of a devilish mind and perverse will, attempting to revile those things which are contained in the Gospel and the sacred prophecies. But should one desire to receive only such things as are generally believed, and are not contrary to our other declarations, but accord also with the words of prophecy, let it suffice that Jesus was distinguished in form above the sons of men; obedient to His mother, gentle in disposition; in appearance full of grace and dignity; eloquent in words, kind and thoughtful of the wants of others, known among all for a power and energy, as of one who was filled with all wisdom; and as in other things, so also in all human conversation, though above man, Himself the rule and measure. But that which most distinguished Him was His meekness, and that a razor had never come upon His head, nor any human hand except His mother’s. But from these words we may derive a lesson; for when the Lord reproves Mary seeking Him among His relations, He most aptly points to the giving up of all fleshly ties, showing that it is not for him to attain the goal of perfection who is still encompassed by and walks among the things of the body, and that men fall from perfection through love of their relations.

For shortly after seeking our salvation He poured out His own life. But sometimes He first sets forth in Himself an example, and afterwards, as far as words can go, draws therefrom rules of life, as He does here, showing forth by His work these three things above the rest, the love of God, honor to parents, but the preferring God also to our parents. For when He was blamed by His parents, He counts all other things of less moment than those which belong to God; again, He gives His obedience also to His parents.

          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; Let us then also ourselves be subject to our parents. But if our fathers are not let us be subject to those who are our fathers. Jesus the Son of God is subject to Joseph and Mary. But I must be subject to the Bishop who has been constituted my father.

          <td><b>BASIL</b>; But from His very first years being obedient to His parents, He endured all bodily labors, humbly and reverently. For since His parents were honest and just, yet at the same time poor, and ill supplied with the necessaries of life, (as the stable which administered to the holy birth bears witness,) it is plain that they continually underwent bodily fatigue in providing for their daily wants.

Let then the heretic so raise his head as to assert that He who is sent has need of other help; yet why should He need human help, in obeying His mother’s authority? He was obedient to a handmaid, He was obedient to His pretended father, and do you wonder whether He obeyed God; Or is it a mark of duty to obey man, of weakness to obey God.

Further, she pondered upon both His divine words and works, so that nothing that was said or done by Him was lost upon her, but as the Word itself was before in her womb, so now she conceived the ways and words of the same, and in a manner nursed them in her heart. And while indeed she thought upon one thing at the time, another she wanted to be more clearly revealed to her; and this was her constant rule and law through her whole life.

For if He really increased after that He was made flesh, as having before existed imperfect, why then do we give Him thanks as having thence become incarnate for us? But how if He is the true wisdom can He be increased, or how can He who gives grace to others be Himself advanced in grace. Again, if bearing that the Word humbled Himself, no one is offended (thinking slightingly of the true God,) but rather marvels at His compassion, how is it not absurd to be offended at hearing that He increases? For as He was humbled for us, so for us He increased, that we who have fallen through sin might increase in Him. For whatever concerns us, Christ Himself has truly undertaken for us, that He might restore us to a better state.

Iosephus enim refert, quod Valerius Graccus Anna a sacerdotio deturbato, Ismaelem pontificem designavit filium Baphi; sed etiam hunc non multo post abiiciens, Eleazarum Ananiae pontificis filium surrogavit: post annum vero et hunc arcet officio, et Simoni cuidam Caiphae filio pontificatus tradidit ministerium; quo non amplius ipse quam unius anni spatio perfunctus, Iosephum, cui et Caiphas nomen fuit, accepit successorem: itaque omne hoc tempus quo dominus noster docuisse describitur, intra quadriennii spatia coarctatur.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Both Annas and Caiaphas, when John began his preaching, were the High Priests, but Annas held the office that year, Caiaphas the same year in which our Lord suffered on the cross. Three others had held the office in the intervening time, but these two, as having particular reference to our Lord’s Passion, are mentioned by the Evangelist. For at that time of violence and intrigue, the commands of the Law being no longer in force, the honor of the High Priest’s office was never given to merit or high birth, but the whole affairs of the Priesthood were managed by the Roman power. For Josephus relates, that Valerius Gratus, when Annas was thrust out of the Priesthood, appointed Ismael High Priest, the son of Baphas; but not long after casting him off, he put in his place Eleazar the son of the High Priest Ananias. After the space of one year, he expelled him also from the office, and delivered the government of the High Priesthood to a certain Simon, son of Caiaphas, who holding it not longer than a year, had Joseph, whose name also was Caiaphas, for his successor; so that the whole time during which our Lord is related to have taught is included in the space of four years.

Quoniam igitur haec erat causa malorum; ut peccata agnoscerent ad redemptorem quaerendum, venit Ioannes hortans illos poenitentiam agere, ut per poenitentiam effecti meliores atque contriti ad recipiendam veniam satagant. Apte ergo, cum dixisset quod venit praedicans Baptismum poenitentiae, addidit in remissionem peccatorum; quasi dicat: idcirco suadebat illis poenitere, ut subsequentem veniam facilius impetrarent, credentes in Christum, nam nisi poenitentia ducerentur, nequaquam exposcerent gratiam: unde Baptisma illud nullam aliam habet causam, nisi quod praeparatorium erat ad fidem Christi.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. For as the sacrifice had not yet been offered up, nor had the holy Spirit descended, how could remission of sins be given? What is it then that St. Luke means by the words, for the remission of sins, seeing the Jews were ignorant, and knew not the weight of their sins? Because this was the cause of their evils, in order that they might be convinced of their sins and seek a Redeemer, John came exhorting them to repentance, that being thereby made better and sorrowful for their sins, they might be ready to receive pardon. Rightly then after saying, that he came preaching the baptism of repentance, he adds, for the remission of sins. As if he should say, The reason by which he persuaded them to repent was that thereby they would the more easily obtain forgiveness [by believing in Christ. For, if they were not led by repentance, in vain could they ask for grace, other than as a preparation for faith in Christ.

          <td><b>Gregory</b>: Or John is said to preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins, because the baptism which was to take away sin, as he could not give, he preached; just as the Incarnate Word of the Father preceded the word of preaching, so the baptism of repentance, which was able to take away sin, preceded John's baptism, which could not take away sin.

Est quoque quartum Baptisma, quod fit per martyrium et sanguinem, quo etiam ipse Christus est baptizatus; quod ceteris est venerabilius nimis, eatenus, quatenus iteratis contagiis non foedatur.

Jesus baptizes but with the Spirit, and this is perfect baptism. There is also a fourth baptism, namely by martyrdom and blood, by which also Christ Himself was baptized, and which is so far more glorious than the others, as it is not sullied by repeated acts of defilement. There is also a fifth, the most painful, according to which David every night washed his bed and his couch with tears.

There are some ways and paths by no means easy to travel, being in some places hilly and rugged, in others steep and precipitous; to remove which it says, <i>Every valley shall he filled, every mountain and hill shall he brought low</i>. Some roads are most unequally constructed, and while in one part rising, in another sloping downwards, are very difficult to pass. And here he adds, <i>And the crooked ways shall be made straight, and the rough ways shall be made smooth</i>. But this was in a spiritual manner brought to pass by the power of our Saviour. For formerly to pursue an Evangelical course of life was a difficult task, for men's minds were so immersed in worldly pleasures.

Si quis ergo velit baptizari, egrediatur: unde signanter dicitur et dicebat ad turbas quae exibant, ut baptizarentur ab ipso. Egredientibus itaque ad lavacrum turbis, loquitur quae sequuntur; si enim iam egressi essent, nequaquam ad eos diceret genimina viperarum.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; No one that remains in his old state, and forsakes not his old habits and practices, can rightly come to be baptized; whoever then wishes to be baptized, let him go forth. Hence are those words significantly spoken, And he said to the multitude that went forth to be baptized of him. To the multitudes then who are going forth to the laver of baptism, He speaks the following words, for if they had already gone forth, He would not have said, O generation of vipers.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Ille itaque cultor deserti videns omnes incolas Palaestinae circumstantes ipsum et admirantes, non flectebatur pro tanta reverentia, sed insurgens in ipsos arguebat eos. Sacra autem Scriptura, secundum stimulantes passiones, plerumque ferarum nomina imponit hominibus; interdum canes eos nominans causa procacitatis, equos ob luxum, asinos propter dementiam, et leones et pardos causa rapacitatis et petulantiae, aspides causa doli, serpentes et viperas causa veneni et calliditatis. Unde et nunc Ioannes Iudaeos audacter genimina viperarum vocat.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. The dweller in the wilderness, when he saw all the people of Palestine standing round him and wondering, bent not beneath the weight of such respect, but rose up against them and reproved them. The holy Scripture often gives the names of wild beasts to men, according to the passions which excite them, calling them sometimes dogs because of their impudence, horses on account of their lust, asses for their folly, lions and panthers for their ravening and wantonness, asps for their guile, serpents and vipers for their poison and cunning; and so in this place John calls the Jews a generation of vipers.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Basilius contra Eunom</b>: Oportet autem scire, quod haec nomina natus et filius de animalibus dicuntur; genimen vero potest dici fetus antequam effingatur; fructus etiam palmarum genimina dicuntur; raro autem in animalibus accipiuntur, et semper in malo.
          <td><b>BASIL</b>; Now it may be observed, that the following words natus and filius are spoken of animals, but genimen may be said of the fetus before it is formed in the womb; the fruit of the palm trees is also called genimina, but that word is very seldom used with respect to animals, and when it is, always in a bad sense.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Matthaeum</b>: Ferunt autem viperam matrem coeundo necare, cuius semen excrescens perimit matrem; et sic prodit in lucem scisso parentis utero, in vindictam quodammodo parentis genitoris; itaque parricida est proles viperea. Tales erant Iudaei, qui patres spiritales eorum atque doctores occidebant. Quid autem si non invenit eos peccantes, sed incipientes converti? Non debebat eis conviciari, sed permulcere. Dicendum, quod non adhibebat mentem his quae fiebant exterius; mentis enim eorum arcana cognoverat domino revelante: nimis enim se iactabant in progenitoribus. Hanc ergo radicem scindens nominat illos genimina viperarum, non quidem vituperans patriarchas, aut eos viperas nominans.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Now they say that the female viper kills the male in copulation, and the fetus as it increases in the womb kills the mother, and so comes forth into life, bursting open the womb in revenge as it were of its father’s death; the viper progeny therefore are parricides. Such also were the Jews, who killed their spiritual fathers and teachers. But what if he found them not sinning, but beginning to be converted? He ought not surely to rebuke them, but to comfort them. We answer, that he gave not heed to those things which are outward, for he knew the secrets of their hearts, the Lord revealing them to him; for they vaunted themselves too much in their forefathers. Cutting therefore at this root, he calls them a generation of vipers, not indeed that he blamed the Patriarchs, or called them vipers.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius in Evang</b>: Sed quia per hoc quod bonis invident eosque persequuntur, patrum suorum carnalium vias sequentes, quasi venenati filii de veneficis parentibus nati sunt. Quia vero supradicta sententia intendit quod extremo Christus examine ab omni carne videbitur, recte subditur quis ostendit vobis fugere a ventura ira? Ventura ira est animadversio ultionis extremae.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. Because the Jews hated good men, and persecuted them, following the steps of their carnal parents, they are by birth the poisonous sons, as it were, of poisonous or sorcerous parents. But because the preceding verse declares that at the last judgment Christ shall be seen by all flesh, it is rightly added, Who has warned you to flee from the wrath to come? The wrath to come being the awarding of final punishment.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Ostenditur autem his Dei miseratione infusa prudentia, ut gerant suorum poenitentiam delictorum, futuri terrorem iudicii provida devotione metuentes: aut fortasse, iuxta quod scriptum est: estote prudentes sicut serpentes, ostenduntur habere prudentiam naturalem, qui profutura videant et sponte deposcant, sed adhuc noxia non relinquant.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; We see these men through the compassion of God, inspired with prudence to seek repentance of their crimes, dreading with wise devotion the terror of the judgment to come. Or perhaps, according to the precept, Be you wise as serpents, they are shown to have a natural prudence, who perceive what is coming, and earnestly desire help, though they still forsake not what is hurtful.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius</b>: Quia vero tunc fugere ab ira peccatorum non valet qui nunc ad lamenta poenitentiae non recurrit, subditur facite ergo fructus dignos poenitentiae.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. But because he cannot then flee from the wrath of God, who now has not recourse to the sorrows of repentance, it is added, "Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance."
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Non enim satis est poenitentibus peccata dimittere, sed opus est eius fructus ferre, secundum illud: declina a malo, et fac bonum; sicut non sufficit ad sanationem sagittam evellere, sed oportet ulceri medicamentum apponere. Non autem dicit fructum, sed fructus, copiam designans.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. For it is not sufficient for the penitent to leave off his sins, he must also bring forth the fruits of repentance, as it is in the Psalms, depart from evil and do good, just as in order to heal, it will not do to pluck out the arrow only, but we must also apply a salve to the wound. But he says not fruit, but fruits, signifying abundance.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius</b>: Nec solum fructus poenitentiae, sed dignos poenitentiae admonet esse faciendos. Quisquis enim illicita nulla commisit, huic conceditur ut licitis utatur; at si quis in culpam lapsus est, tanto a se licita debet abscindere, quanto meminit se perpetrasse illicita. Neque enim par fructus esse boni operis debet eius qui minus, et qui amplius deliquit: aut eius qui in nullis, et eius qui in quibusdam facinoribus cecidit. Per hoc ergo cuiuslibet conscientia convenitur, ut tanto maiora quaerat bonorum lucra per poenitentiam, quanto graviora sibi intulit damna per culpam.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. He warns them that they must bring forth not only the fruits of repentance, but fruits worthy of repentance. For he that has violated no law, to him it is permitted to use what is lawful, but if a man has fallen into sin, he ought so to cut himself off from what is lawful, as he remembers to have committed what is unlawful. For the fruit of good works ought not to be equal in the man who has sinned less, anti the man who has sinned more, nor in him who has fallen into no crimes, and him who has fallen into some. In this way it is adapted to the conscience of each man, that they should seek for so much the greater blessing on good works through repentance, as they have by guilt brought on themselves the heavier penalties.

          <td><b>Maximus</b>: Poenitentiae fructus est impassibilitas animae, qua plenarie non fruimur, dum interdum passionibus instigamur: nondum enim fructus poenitentiae dignos peregimus. Poeniteamus ergo veraciter, ut a passionibus expediti, peccatorum veniam consequamur.
          <td><b>MAXIMUS</b>; The fruit of repentance is an equanimity of soul, which we do not fully obtain, as long as we are at times affected by our passions, for not as yet have we performed the fruits worthy of repentance. Let us then repent truly, that being delivered from our passions we may obtain the pardon of their sins.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius</b>: Sed Iudaei de generis nobilitate gloriantes, idcirco se agnoscere peccatores nolebant, quia de Abrahae stirpe descenderant: quibus recte dicitur et ne coeperitis dicere: patrem habemus Abraham.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. But the Jews glorying in their noble birth were unwilling to acknowledge themselves sinners, because they were descended from the stock of Abraham. So then it is lightly said, And begin not to say within yourselves, we have Abraham for our father.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Non hoc indicans quod ab Abraham naturali origine non descenderent; sed quia nihil prodest ab Abraham descendisse, nisi secundum virtutem cognationem observent. Cognationis namque leges consuevit Scriptura vocare non eas quae secundum naturam consistunt, sed quae derivantur a virtute vel vitio; quibus namque se quisque conformem statuit, horum filius, vel frater vocatur.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Not meaning thereby that they had not descended in their natural course from Abraham, but that it avails them nothing to have Abraham for their father, unless they observed the relationship in respect of virtue. For Scripture is accustomed to entitle laws of relationship, such as do not exist by nature, but are derived from virtue or vice. To whichever of these two a man conforms himself, he is called its son or brother.

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; For what profits the nobleness we inherit through the flesh, unless it be supported by kindred feelings in us? It is folly then to boast of our worthy ancestors, and fall away from their virtues.

          <td><b>Basilius</b>: Neque enim equum velocem esse facit patris erga cursum strenuitas; sed veluti ceterorum animalium probitas consideratur in singulis, sic quoque laus propria viri discernitur quam praesentium bonorum in se comprobat argumentum. Turpe namque est alienis ornari decoribus quem virtus propria non venustat.
          <td><b>BASIL</b>; For neither does the speed of its sire make the horse swift; but as the goodness of other animals is looked for in individuals, so also that is reckoned to be man’s legitimate praise which is decided by the test of his present worth. For it is a disgraceful thing for a man to be adorned with the honors of another, when he has no virtue of his own to commend him.

          <td><b>Gregorius Nyssenus</b>: Sic igitur Iudaeorum promulgato exilio, consequenter ingerit convocationem gentilium, quos lapides appellat: unde sequitur dico enim vobis, quia potest Deus de lapidibus istis suscitare filios Abrahae.
          <td><b>GREG. NYSS</b>. So then having foretold the casting away of the Jews, He goes on to allude to the calling of the Gentiles, whom He calls stones. Hence it follows, For I say to you, &amp;c.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Matthaeum</b>: Quasi dicat: ne putetis quod, si vos perieritis, filiis privetur patriarcha: potest enim Deus etiam ex lapidibus homines illi praebere, et ad illum perducere sanguinem: nam et ab ipso principio sic evenit: ei namque quod est ex lapidibus homines fieri, aequipollet exitus filii ab illo emortuo utero Sarae.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. As if He said, Think not that if you perish the Patriarch will be deprived of sons, for God even from stones can produce men unto him, and prolong the line of his descendants. For so has it been from the beginning, seeing that for men to be made from stones to Abraham is but equivalent to the coming forth of a son from the dead womb of Sarah.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Sed licet Deus possit diversas convertere et mutare naturas, tamen mihi plus mysterium quam miraculum prodest. Quid enim aliud quam lapides habebantur qui lapidibus serviebant, similes utique his qui fecerant eos? Prophetatur igitur saxosis gentilium fides infundenda pectoribus, et futuros per fidem Abrahae filios oraculo pollicetur. Ut autem scias quia lapidibus comparati sunt homines, arboribus quoque homines comparavit, cum subdit iam enim securis posita est ad radicem arboris. Exempli autem ideo facta est mutatio, ut illo comparationis processu quidam intelligatur homini clementior iam profectus.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; But although God can alter and change the most diverse natures, yet in my mind a mystery is of more avail than a miracle. For what else than stones were they who bowed down to stones, like indeed to them who made them. It is prophesied therefore that faith shall be poured into the stony hearts of the Gentiles, and through faith the oracles promise that Abraham shall have sons. But that you may know who are the men compared to stones, he has also compared men to trees, adding, For now the ax is laid to the root of the tree. This change of figure was made, that by means of comparison might be understood to have now commenced a more kindly growth of manhood.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Origenes in Lucam</b>: Et quidem si iam ingrueret consummatio et temporum finis instaret, nulla mihi quaestio nasceretur: dicerem enim propterea hoc prophetatum esse, quia illo tempore complebitur. Cum autem tanta post saecula fluxerint ex quo spiritus sanctus hoc dixit, ego puto Israelitico populo prophetari, quod praecisio eius vicina sit. His enim qui egrediebantur ad eum ut baptizarentur, haec inter cetera loquebatur.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; If the completion of all things had been then already begun, and the end of time close at hand, I should have no question but that the prophecy was given, because at that time it was to be fulfilled. But now that many ages have elapsed since the Spirit spoke this, I think it was prophesied to the people of Israel, because their cutting off was approaching. For to those that went out to him that they should be baptized, he gave this warning among others.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Securim ergo in praesenti nominat mortiferam iram, quae divinitus irruit in Iudaeos propter exercitam impietatem in Christum. Non tamen haesisse radici securim praenuntiat, sed ad radicem, idest iuxta radicem positam: decisi namque fuerunt rami, nec radicitus extirpata est planta; reliquiae enim Israel salvae fient.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; By the ax then he declares the deadly wrath of God, which fell upon the Jews on account of the impieties they practiced against Christ; he does not pronounce the ax to be yet fixed to the root, but that it was laid (ad radicem) i.e. near the root. For though the branches were cut down, the tree itself was not yet entirely destroyed. For a remnant of Israel shall be saved.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius</b>: Vel aliter. Arbor huius mundi est universum genus humanum: securis vero est redemptor noster, qui velut ex manubrio et ferro, tenetur ex humanitate, sed incidit ex divinitate: quae videlicet securis iam ad radicem arboris posita est, quia etsi per patientiam expectata, videtur tamen quid factura est. Et notandum, quod non iuxta ramos securim positam, sed ad radicem dicit: cum enim malorum filii tolluntur, quid aliud quam rami infructuosae arboris abscinduntur? Cum vero tota simul progenies cum parente tollitur, infructuosa arbor a radice abscissa est. Unusquisque autem perversus paratam citius Gehennae concremationem invenit, qui fructum boni operis contemnit; unde sequitur omnis ergo arbor quae non facit fructum bonum excidetur, et in ignem mittetur.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. Or we may take it in this way; The tree represents the whole human race in this world, but the ax is our redeemer, who by the handle and iron, as it were, is held indeed in the hand of man, but strikes by the power of God. Which ax indeed is now laid at the root of the tree; for although it waits patiently, yet it is plain what it is about to do. And we must observe that the said ax is to be laid not at the branches, but at the root. For when the children of the wicked are taken away, what is this but the cutting off of the branches of an unfruitful tree But when the whole family together with the parent is removed, the unfruitful tree is cut off from the very root. But every hardened sinner finds the fire of hell the quicker prepared for him, as he disdains to bring forth the fruits of good works. Hence it follows, Every one then.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Eleganter dictum est non faciens fructum, et adicitur bonum: officiosum enim hoc animal Deus creavit, et naturalis est sibi exercitiorum instantia, otium vero innaturale. Obest enim inertia etiam cunctis corporis membris, nulli autem ut animae: ea namque cum continuo sit naturaliter mobilis, otiari non patitur. Sicut autem otium malum est, ita et indecens exercitium. Ex eo autem quod praemisit poenitentiam, praedicat quod securis adiacet, non quidem incidens, sed terrorem incutiens.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. It is elegantly said, that bears not fruit, and it is added, good. For God created man an animal fond of employment, and constant activity is natural to him, but idleness is unnatural. For idleness is hurtful to every member of the body, but much more to the soul. For the soul being by nature in constant motion does not admit of being slothful. But as idleness is an evil, so also is an unworthy activity. But having before spoken of repentance, he now declares that the ax lies near, not indeed actually cutting, but only striking terror.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Faciat ergo fructum qui potest gratiae, et qui debet poenitentiae. Adest dominus qui fructum requirat, fecundos vivificet, steriles reprehendat.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Let him then that is able bring forth fruit unto grace, him who ought, unto repentance. The Lord is at hand seeking for His fruit, who shall cherish the fruitful, but rebuke the barren.

          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Et quidem publicanis et militibus a malo abstinere praecepit; turbis autem, quasi non malitiosis existentibus, bonum aliquod praecepit observari; unde sequitur respondens autem dicebat illis: qui habet duas tunicas, det non habenti.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Now to the Publicans and soldiers he gives a commandment to abstain from evil, but the multitudes, as not living in an evil condition, he commands to perform some good work, as it follows, He that has two coats, let him give one.

          <td><b>GREG</b>. Because a coat is more necessary for our use than a cloak, it belongs to the bringing forth of fruits worthy of repentance, that we should divide with our neighbors not only our superfluities but those which are absolutely necessary to us, as our coat, or the meat with which we support our bodies; and hence it follows, And he who has meat, let him do likewise.

          <td><b>GREG</b>. For because it was written in the law, You shall love your neighbor as yourself, he is proved to love his neighbor less than himself, who does not share with him in his distress, those things which are even necessary to himself. Therefore that precept is given of dividing with one’s neighbor the two coats, since if one is divided no one is clothed. But we must remark in this, of how much value are works of mercy, since of the works worthy of repentance these are enjoined before all others.

It is therefore a common commandment to all, to contribute to him that has not.

          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; But this place admits of a deeper meaning, for as we ought not to serve two masters, so neither to have two coats, lest one should be the clothing of the old man, the other of the new, but we ought to cast off the old man, and give to him who is naked. For one man has one coat, another has none at all, the strength therefore of the two is exactly contrary, and as it has been written that we should cast all our crimes to the bottom of the sea, so ought we to throw from us our vices and errors, and lay them upon him who has been the cause of them.

Those also who pursue the gain of this world by traffic are denoted by the same titles, all of whom, each in his own sphere, he equally forbids to practice deceit, that so by first keeping themselves from desiring other men’s goods, they might at length come to share their own with their neighbors. It follows, But the soldiers also asked him. In the justest manner he advises them not to seek gain by falsely accusing those whom they ought to benefit by their protection. Hence it follows, And he says to them, Strike no one, (i.e. violently,) nor accuse any falsely, (i.e. by unjustly using arms,) and be content with your wages.

Is it that men die, who some time or other must die, that the conquerors might rule in peace? To blame this is the part of timid not religious men. The desire of injury, the cruelty of revenge, a savage and pitiless disposition, the fierceness of rebellion, the lust of power, and such like things are the evils which are justly blamed in wars, which generally for the sake of thereby bringing punishment upon the violence of those who resist, are undertaken and carried on by good men either by command of God or some lawful authority, when they find themselves in that order of things in which their very condition justly obliges them either to command such a thing themselves, or to obey when others command it.

          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; It was meet that more deference should be paid to John than to other men, for he lived such as no other man.

Sed consideremus cuius gratia: Dei enim munus est qui revelat, non virtus hominis qui divino magis adiuvatur beneficio, quam naturali cernit officio. Cito autem respondens probavit non esse se Christum, qui visibili operatur officio: nam cum ex duabus naturis, idest ex anima homo subsistat et corpore, visibile per visibilia, invisibile per invisibile mysterium consecratur: aqua enim corpus abluitur, spiritu animae delicta mundantur: licet etiam in ipso fonte sanctificatio divinitatis aspiret: et ideo aliud fuit Baptisma poenitentiae, aliud est gratiae: istud Baptisma ex utroque, illud ex uno: opus hominis est gerere poenitentiam delictorum, Dei munus est gratiam implere mysterii. Declinans ergo maiestatis invidiam, non verbo sed opere declaravit non esse se Christum; unde sequitur venit enim fortior me post me.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Or: John saw into the secrets of the heart; but let us remember by whose grace, for it is of the gift of God to reveal things to man, not of the virtue of man, which is assisted by the Divine blessing, rather than capable of perceiving by any natural power of its own. But quickly answering them, he proved that he was not the Christ, for his works were by visible operations. For as man is compounded of two natures, i.e. soul and body, the visible mystery is made holy by the visible, the invisible by the invisible; for by water the body is washed, by the Spirit the soul is cleansed of its stains. It is permitted to us also in the very water to have the sanctifying influence of the Deity breathed upon us. And therefore there was one baptism of repentance, another of grace. The latter was by both water and Spirit, the former by one only; the work of man is to bring forth repentance for his sin, it is the gift of God to pour in the grace of His mystery. Devoid therefore of all envy of Christ’s greatness, he declared not by word but by work that he was not the Christ. Hence it follows, There comes after me one mightier than I. In those words, mightier than I, he makes no comparison, for there can be none between the Son of God and man, but because there are many mighty, no one is mightier but Christ. So far indeed was as he from making comparison, that he adds, Whose shoes latched I am not worthy to unloose.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Cons. Evang</b>: Matthaeus quidem dicit: cuius non sum dignus calceamenta portare. Itaque si ad rem pertinet aliud intelligere in eo quod dictum est: calceamenta portare, et corrigiam calceamentorum solvere, ut unus Evangelistarum hoc, alii aliud dicerent, omnes verum narraverunt: si autem nihil intendit Ioannes, cum de calceamentis domini diceret, nisi excellentiam eius et humilitatem suam; quodlibet horum dixerit, sive de solvenda calceamentorum corrigia, sive de portandis calceamentis, eamdem tamen sententiam tenuit quisquis etiam verbis suis per calceamentorum memoriam, eamdem significationem humilitatis expressit.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Matthew says, Whose shoes I am not worthy to bear. If therefore it is worth while to understand any difference in these expressions, we can only suppose that John said one at one time, another at another, or both together, To bear his shoes, and to loose the latchet of his shoes, so that though one Evangelist may have related this, the others that, yet all have related the truth. But if John intended no more when he spoke of the shoes of our Lord but His excellence and his own humility, whether he said loosing the latchet of the shoes, or bearing them, they have still kept the same sense who by the mention of shoes have in their own words expressed the same signification of humility.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Per hoc etiam quod dicit: cuius non sum dignus calceamenta portare, evangelicae praedicationis ostendit in apostolos gratiam esse collatam, qui sunt calceati in Evangelium. Videtur tamen ideo hoc dicere quod plerumque Ioannes personam accipit populi Iudaeorum.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; By the words, Whose shoes I am not worthy to bear, he shows that the grace of preaching the Gospel was conferred upon the Apostles, who were shod for the Gospel. He seems however to say it, because John frequently represented the Jewish people.

Mos enim apud veteres fuit ut si quis eam quae sibi competeret, accipere nollet uxorem, ille ei calceamentum solveret qui ad hanc sponsus iure propinquitatis veniret. Vel quia calceamenta ex mortuis animalibus fiunt, incarnatus dominus quasi calceatus apparuit, qui morticina nostrae corruptionis assumpsit. Corrigia ergo calceamenti est ligatura mysterii. Ioannes itaque solvere corrigiam calceamenti eius non valet: quia incarnationis mysterium nec ipse investigare sufficit qui hanc per prophetiae spiritum agnovit.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. But John denounces himself as unworthy to loose the latchet of Christ’s shoes: as if he openly said, I am not able to disclose the footsteps of my Redeemer, who do not presume unworthily to take unto myself the name of bridegroom, for it was an ancient custom that when a man refused to take to wife her whom he ought, whoever should come to her betrothed by right of kin, was to loose his shoe. Or because shoes are made from the skins of dead animals, our Lord being made flesh appeared as it were with shoes, as taking upon Himself the carcass of our corruption. The latchet of the shoe is the connection of the mystery. John therefore can not loose the latchet of the shoe, because neither is he able to fathom the mystery of the Incarnation, though he acknowledged it by the Spirit of prophecy.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Matthaeum</b>: Et quia dixerat quod suum Baptisma nil plus haberet quam aquam, consequenter ostendit excellentiam exhibiti per Christum Baptismatis, cum subdit ipse vos baptizabit in spiritu sancto et igni: per ipsam dicti metaphoram ostendens abundantiam gratiae: non enim ait: dabit vobis spiritum sanctum, sed baptizabit: ac rursus per id quod de igne subicit, ostendit virtutem gratiae; et sicut Christus aquam vocat spiritus gratiam, ostendens per vocabulum aquae, nitorem qui contingit ex ea, et consolationem immensam quae mentibus capacibus illius ingeritur; sic et Ioannes per ignis vocabulum exprimit fervorem et rectitudinem gratiae, necnon et peccatorum consumptionem.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. And having said that his own baptism was only with water, he next shows the excellence of that baptism which was brought by Christ, adding, He shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit, and fire, signifying by the very metaphor which he uses the abundance of grace. For he says not, “ He shall give you the Holy Spirit,” but He shall baptize you. And again, by the addition of fire, he shows the power of grace. And as Christ calls the grace of the Spirit, water, meaning by water the purity resulting from it, and the abundant consolation which is brought to minds which are capable of receiving Him; so also John, by the word fire, expresses the fervor and uprightness of grace, as well as the consuming of sins.

Sunt qui ita exponunt, quod in praesenti in spiritu, et in futuro baptizaremur in igne; ut videlicet, sicut in remissionem omnium peccatorum ex aqua et spiritu renascimur; ita et tunc de levibus quibusdam peccatis Purgatorii ignis ante ultimum iudicium Baptismate permundemur.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; The Holy Spirit also may be understood by the word fire, for He kindles with love and enlightens with wisdom the hearts which He fills. Hence also the Apostles received the baptism of the Spirit in the appearance of fire. There are some who explain it, that now we are baptized with the Spirit, hereafter we shall be with fire, that as in truth we are now born again to the remission of our sins by water and the Spirit, so then we shall be cleansed from certain lighter sins by the baptism of purifying fire.

To add or take away ought thereof excludes from eternal life.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Graecus</b>: Per hoc ergo quod dicit baptizabit in spiritu sancto, ostendit abundantiam gratiae et beneficii copiam. Ne autem aliqui putent quod dona largiri et potestas et voluntas est creatori: punire vero inobedientes nullam sibi fore causam; ob hoc subdit cuius ventilabrum in manu eius: ostendens quod non solum munificus est dignis, sed etiam praevaricationum ultor.

          <td><b>GREEK EX</b>. By these words then, He shall baptize with the Holy Spirit, He signifies the abundance of His grace, the plenteousness of His mercy; but lest any should suppose that while to bestow abundantly is both in the power and will of the Creator, He will have no occasion to punish the disobedient, he adds, whose fan is in his hand, showing that He is not only the rewarder of the righteous, but the avenger of them that speak lies. But the fan expresses the promptitude of His judgment. For not with the process of passing sentence on trial, but in an instant and without any interval he separates those that are to be condemned from the company of those that are to be saved.

The purging of which floor is even now carried on individually, when every perverse offender is either cast out of the Church for his open sins, (by the hands of the Priesthood,) or for his secret sins is after death condemned by Divine judgment. And at the end of the world it will be accomplished universally, when the Son of Man shall send His angels, and they shall gather out of His kingdom every thing that has offended.

By this comparison, the Lord shows that on the day of judgment He will discern the solid merits and fruits of virtue from the unfruitful lightness of empty boasting and vain deeds, about to place the men of more perfect righteousness in His heavenly mansion. For that is indeed the more perfect fruit which was thought worthy to be like to Him who fell as a grain of wheat, that He might bring forth fruit in abundance.

          <td><b>GREG NYSS</b>. But it is well to know, that the treasure which according to the promises are laid up for those who live honestly, are such as the words of man cannot express, as eye has not seen, nor the ear heard, nor has it entered into the heart of man to conceive. And the punishments which await sinners bear no proportion to any of those things which now affect the senses. And although some of those punishments are called by our names, yet their difference is very great. For when you hear of fire, you are taught to understand something else from the expression which follows, that is not quenched, beyond what comes into the idea of other fire.

Miramur autem Ioannem, quo inter natos mulierum maior nemo fuerit, quod in tantam opinionem meritis virtutis ascenderit ut a plerisque Christus putaretur; sed illud multo mirabilius, quod non timuit Herodem, non formidavit interitum; unde sequitur Herodes autem tetrarcha cum corriperetur ab illo, et cetera.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; And as in the Gospel according to St. John it is related of Christ that He spoke many other things, so also in this place we must understand Luke to say the same of John the Baptist, since certain things are announced by John too great to be entrusted to writing. But we marvel at John, because among them that are born of women there was not a greater than he, for by his good deeds he had been exalted to so high a fame for virtue, that by many he was supposed to be Christ. But what is much more marvelous he feared not Herod, nor dreaded death, as it follows, But Herod the tetrarch being reproved by him.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">

Super hoc Herodem reprehenderat Baptista. Primo quidem diligenter eius audiebat sermones, cum sciret eos ponderosos, et consolatione plenos; sed Herodiadis concupiscentia cogebat eum aspernari verba Ioannis: unde et eum detrudit in carcerem; et hoc est quod dicitur adiecit et hoc super omnia, et inclusit Ioannem in carcere.
          <td><b>EUSEBIUS</b>. He is called the tetrarch, to distinguish him from the other Herod, in whose reign Christ was born, and who was king, but this Herod was tetrarch. Now his wife was the daughter of Aretas, king of Arabia, but he had sacrilegiously married his brother Philip’s wife, though she had offspring by his brother. For those only were allowed to do this whose brothers died without issue. For this the Baptist had censured Herod. First indeed he heard him attentively, for he knew that his words were weighty and full of consolation, but the desire of Herodius compelled him to despise the words of John, and he then thrust him into prison. And so it follows, And he added this a above all, that he shut up John in prison.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; But John was not imprisoned in those days. According to St. John’s Gospel it was not till after some miracles had been performed by our Lord, and after His baptism had been noised abroad but according to Luke he had been seized beforehand by the redoubled malice of Herod, who, when he saw so man flock to the preaching of John, and the soldiers believing, the publicans repenting, and whole multitudes receiving baptism on the contrary not only despised John, but having put him in prison, slew him.

Et intelligendum magis quod a Ioanne dominus baptizatus est, quam expressum reliquit; unde dicitur factum est autem, cum baptizaretur omnis populus, et Iesu baptizato et orante, apertum est caelum. Baptizatus est autem dominus, non mundari volens, sed mundare aquas; ut ablutae per carnem Christi, qui peccatum non cognovit, Baptismatis ius haberent.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; In a matter which has been related by others Luke has rightly given us only a summary, and has left more to be understood than expressed in the fact, that our Lord was baptized by John. As it is said, Now when all were baptized, it came to pass. Our Lord was baptized not that He might be cleansed by the waters but to cleanse them, that being purified by the flesh of Christ who knew no sin, they might possess the power of baptism.

Quae est ergo iustitia, nisi quia quod alterum tibi facere velis, prior ipse incipias, et tuo alios horteris exemplo? Nemo igitur refugiat lavacrum gratiae, quando Christus lavacrum poenitentiae non refugit.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; But the cause of our Lord’s baptism He Himself declares when He says, Thus it becomes us to fulfill all righteousness. But what is righteousness, except that what you would have another do to you, you should first begin yourself, and so by your example encourage others? Let none then avoid the laver of grace, since Christ avoided not the laver of repentance.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Fuerat autem Baptisma Iudaicum quod sordes carnis amovebat, non conscientiae crimina; nostrum autem Baptisma separat a peccatis, lavat animam, et spiritus copiam elargitur. Baptisma vero Ioannis Iudaico praestantius fuit: neque enim ad observantiam corporalium mundificationum inducebat, sed monebat a vitio in virtutem converti: nostro vero Baptismate minus, eo quod nec spiritum sanctum administrabat, nec remissionem quae per gratiam sit exhibebat; cum quasi finis quidam esset utrorumque Baptismatum. Sed neque Iudaico Baptismate, nec nostro baptizatus est Christus: quia nec indulgentia peccatorum egebat, nec illa caro expers erat spiritus sancti quae per spiritum sanctum ab ipso principio concepta est. Sed baptizatus est Ioannis Baptismate, ut ex ipsa natura Baptismatis scias quia neque causa peccati, neque propter indigentiam doni baptizatus est. Dicit autem baptizato et orante, ut perpendas quod, suscepto Baptismate, opportuna sit iugis oratio.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Now there was a Jewish baptism which removed the pollutions of the flesh, not the guilt of the conscience; but our baptism parts us from sin, washes the soul, and gives us largely the outpouring of the Spirit. But John’s baptism was more excellent than the Jewish; for it did not bring men to the observance of bodily purifications, but taught them to turn from sin to virtue. But it was inferior to our baptism, in that it conveyed not the Holy Spirit, nor showed forth the remission which is by grace, for there was a certain end as it were of each baptism. But neither by the Jewish nor our own baptism was Christ baptized, for He needed not the pardon of sins, nor was that flesh destitute of the Holy Spirit which from the very beginning was conceived by the Holy Spirit; He was baptized by the baptism of John, that from the very nature of the baptism, you might know that He was not baptized because He needed the gift of the Spirit. But he says, fitting baptized and praying, that you might consider how fitting to one who has received baptism is constant prayer.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Quia etsi peccata sunt omnia in Baptismo laxata, non adhuc terrenae carnis est fragilitas solidata: nam quasi transito mari rubro gratulamur submersos Aegyptios; sed in deserto mundanae conversationis hostes concurrunt alii, qui duce Christi gratia nostro sudore vincantur, donec perveniamus ad patriam.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Because though all sins are forgiven in baptism, not as yet is the weakness of this fleshly substance made strong. For we rejoice at the overwhelming of the Egyptians having now crossed the Red sea, but in the wilderness of worldly living there meet us other foes, who, the grace of Christ directing us, may by our exertions be subdued until we come to our own country.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But he says, The heavens opened, as if till then they had been shut. But now the higher and the lower sheep-fold being brought into one, and there being one Shepherd of the sheep, the heavens opened, and man was incorporated a fellow citizen with the Angels.

          <td><b>Beda</b>: Non enim ei caelum tunc apertum est cuius oculi interiora cernebant; sed virtus ibi Baptismatis ostenditur, de quo quisque cum egreditur, regni caelestis ei ianua aperitur, dumque caro innoxia frigentibus tangitur aquis, opposita quondam noxiis rhomphaea extinguitur ignea.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; For not then were the heavens opened to Him whose eyes scanned the innermost parts of the heaven, but therein is shown the virtue of baptism, that when a man comes forth from it the gates of the heavenly kingdom are opened to him, and while his flesh is bathed unharmed in the cold waters, which formerly dreaded their hurtful touch, the flaming sword is extinguished.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Descendit etiam spiritus sanctus ad Christum tamquam ad generis nostri principium, ut in Christo sit primo, qui non sibi, sed nobis potius illum suscepit: unde sequitur et descendit spiritus sanctus corporali specie, sicut columba, in ipsum. Non existimet aliquis quod cum non habuit eum, suscepit ipsum: ipse namque illum desursum tamquam Deus mittebat; at idem ut homo recipiebat inferius. Igitur ex eo devolavit in eum, ex ipsius deitate ad eius humanitatem.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. The Holy Spirit descended also upon Christ as upon the Founder of our race, that He might be in Christ first of all who received Him not for Himself, but rather for us. Hence it follows: And the Holy Spirit descended. Let not any one imagine that He received Him because He had Him not. For He as God sent Him from above, and as man received Him below. Therefore from Him the Spirit fled down to Him, i.e. from His deity to His humanity.

          <td><b>Augustinus de Trin</b>: Absurdissimum autem est, cum iam triginta annorum esset, accepisse spiritum sanctum: sed venit ad Baptismum sicut sine peccato, ita non sine spiritu sancto. Si enim de Ioanne scriptum est: spiritus sancto replebitur ab utero matris suae, quid de homine Christo credendum est, cuius carnis ipsa conceptio non carnalis, sed spiritualis fuit? Nunc ergo corpus suum, idest Ecclesiam, praefigurare dignatus est, in qua baptizati praecipue accipiunt spiritum sanctum.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But it is most strange that He should receive the Spirit when he was thirty years old. But as without sin He came to baptism, so not without the Holy Spirit. For if it was written of John, He shall be filled with the Spirit from his mother’s womb, what must we believe of the man Christ, the very conception of whose flesh was not carnal but spiritual. Therefore He condescended now to prefigure His body, i.e. the Church, in which the baptized especially receive the Holy Spirit.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Redolebat illud Baptisma aliquid vetustatis, et partim sapiebat novitatem: quod enim Baptisma susciperet a propheta, ostendebat aliquid vetustatis: quod autem spiritus descenderit, novum aliquid designabat.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. That baptism savored partly of antiquity, partly of novelty. For that he should receive baptism from a Prophet showed antiquity, but the Spirit’s descent denoted something new.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Now the Spirit rightly showed Himself in the form of a dove, for He is not seen in His divine substance. Let us consider the mystery why like a dove? Because the grace of baptism requires innocence, that we should be innocent as doves. The grace of baptism requires peace, which under the emblem of an olive branch the dove once brought to that ark which alone escaped the deluge.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Or to show the meekness of the Lord, the Spirit now appears in the form of a dove, but at Pentecost like fire, to signify punishment. For when He was about to pardon offenses, gentleness was necessary; but having obtained grace, there remains for us the time of trial and judgment.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Christ indeed had already manifested Himself at His birth by many oracles, but because men would not consult them, He who had in the mean time remained secret, again more clearly revealed Himself in a second birth. For formerly a star in the heavens, now the Father at the waves of Jordan declared Him, and as the Spirit descended upon Him, pouring forth that voice over the head of Him who was baptized, as it follows, And a voice came from heaven, You are my beloved Son.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; We have seen the Spirit, but in a bodily shape, and the Father whom we cannot see we may hear. He is invisible because He is the Father, the Son also is invisible in His divinity, but He wished to manifest Himself in the body.

Christus ergo non simpliciter dicitur Dei filius, sed cum articuli additione, ut comprehendamus quoniam ipse solus est qui revera et secundum naturam est filius; quamobrem et unigenitus dicitur: nam si secundum insaniam Arii dicitur filius, sicut qui hoc nomen per gratiam assequuntur; in nullo a nobis differre videbitur. Restat ergo, secundum alium intellectum, fatendum esse Christum filium Dei, secundum quem Isaac filius Abrahae esse cognoscitur: quod enim ab alio naturaliter gignitur, non autem ab extrinseco sumit exordium, filium natura recenset. Sed dicitur: numquid ut hominis est passibilis nativitas filii? Minime; sed Deus cum sit indivisibilis, impassibiliter pater est filii: unde verbum patris dicitur: quia nec ipsum verbum humanum passibiliter producitur; et cum simplex sit natura divina, unius solius filii pater est; et propter hoc additur dilectus.
          <td><b>ATHAN</b>. The holy Scriptures by the name of Son set forth two meanings; one similar to that spoken of in the Gospel, He gave to them power that they should become the sons of God; another according to which Isaac is the son of Abraham. Christ is not then simply called a Son of God, but the article is prefixed, that we should understand that He alone is really and by nature the Son; and hence He is said to be the Only begotten. For if according to the madness of Arius He is called Son, as they are called who obtain the name through grace, He will seem in no way to differ from us. It remains therefore that in another respect we must confess Christ to be the Son of God, even as Isaac is acknowledged to be the son of Abraham. For that which is naturally begotten of another, and takes not its origin from any thing besides nature, accounts a son. But it is said, Was then the birth of the Son with suffering as of a man? By no means. God since He cannot be divided is without suffering the Father of the Son. Hence He is called the Word of the Father, because neither is the word of man even produced with suffering and since God is by nature one, He is the Father of one only Son, and therefore it is added, Beloved.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Cum enim quis unum solum possidet filium, maxime diligit; si vero pater factus sit plurium, dispertitus affectus remittitur.

And since the Omnipotent Father spoke of sinners after the manner of men, saying, It repents me that I have made man, He (so to speak) displeased Himself in the sinners whom He had created.

But Matthew wished to show that by the words, This is my beloved Son, it was meant rather to declare to the hearers, that He was the Son of God. For that was not revealed to Christ which He knew, but they heard it who were present, and for whom the voice came.

Secundum dictum est adversus insurgentes contra dispensatores mysterii: siquidem ipsi dignitate praecellunt. Tertium editum est illis qui de iuventa confidunt, et quodlibet tempus arbitrantur ad praelationem vel doctrinam spectare.

          <td><b>GREG. NAZ</b>. We must therefore consider who He was who was baptized, and by whom and when: seeing He was pure, baptized by John, and at a time when His miracles had begun, that we might thence derive the lesson of purifying ourselves beforehand, and of embracing humility, and of not beginning to preach until the maturity of our spiritual and natural life. The first of these was said for their sakes who are receiving baptism; for although the gift of baptism brings remission, yet we must fear lest we return again to our vomit. The second is pointed at those who exalt themselves against the stewards of the mysteries, whom they may excel in rank. The third was uttered for those who trust in their youth, and imagine that any age is fit for promotion and teaching. Jesus is cleansed, and cost you despise purification? By John, and cost you say ought against your teacher. At thirty years old, but cost you in teaching precede your elders? But the example of Daniel and the like are ready in your mouth, for every guilty person is ready with an answer.

But you will say, Christ is baptized at thirty years old, and He was Clod, but you bid us to hasten our baptism. In that you said God, the objection was done away: He needed no cleansing, nor was any danger hanging over Him while He put off His baptism. But with you it extends to no slight calamity, if you pass from this life born in corruption, but not if you have put on the robe of incorruption. And truly it is a blessed thing to keep unsullied the clean robe of baptism, but it is better at times to be slightly stained, than to be altogether devoid of grace.

          <td><b>Ambrosius in Lucam</b>: Bene ut putabatur, qui vere non erat; sed ideo putabatur, quia eum Maria, quae Ioseph viro suo erat desponsata genuerat. Cur autem Ioseph magis quam Mariae generatio describitur, cum Maria de spiritu sancto genuerit Christum, et Ioseph a generatione domini videatur alienus, dubitare possemus, nisi consuetudo nos instrueret Scripturarum, quae semper viri originem quaerit: maxime cum in Ioseph origine etiam origo sit Mariae: nam cum vir iustus fuerit Ioseph, utique ex tribu sua et ex patria sua accepit uxorem: itaque et census tempore ascendit Ioseph de domo et de patria David, ut profiteretur cum Maria uxore sua. Quae ex eadem domo et ex eadem patria professionem defert, utique eiusdem tribus et eiusdem patriae se esse designat: unde generationem Ioseph explicans subdit qui fuit Heli. Illud autem advertamus, quod sanctus Matthaeus Iacob, qui fuit pater Ioseph, filium Nathan esse commemorat; Lucas vero Ioseph, cui desponsata fuit Maria, filium Heli esse descripsit. Quomodo unius duo patres, scilicet Heli et Iacob, esse potuerunt?
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Rightly as was supposed, since in reality He was not, but was supposed to be so, because Mary who was espoused to Joseph was His mother. But we might doubt why the descent of Joseph is described rather than that of Mary, (seeing that Mary brought forth Christ of the Holy Spirit, while Joseph seemed to be out of the line of our Lord’s descent,) were we not informed of the custom of the Holy Scripture, which always seeks the origin of the husband, and especially in this case, since in Joseph’s descent we also find that of Mary. For Joseph being a just man took a wife really from his own tribe and country, and so at the time of the taxing Joseph went up from the family and country of David to be taxed with Mary his wife. She who gives in the returns from the same family and country, shows herself to be of that family and country. Hence He goes on in the descent of Joseph, and adds, Who was the son of Eli. But let us consider the fact, that St. Matthew makes Jacob, who was the father of Joseph, to be son of Nathan, but Luke says that Joseph (to whom Mary was espoused) was the son of Eli. How then could there be two fathers, (namely, Eli and Jacob,) to one man.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius Nazianzenus</b>: Dicunt autem quidam quod unica est successio a David usque ad Ioseph; licet diversis nominibus ab utroque Evangelista narratur. Sed hoc absurde fatentur: quoniam initium huius generationis duos fratres obtinuit, Nathan scilicet et Salomonem: unde generationes diversimode profluxerunt.
          <td><b>GREG. NAZ</b>. But some say that there is one succession from David to Joseph, which each Evangelist relates under different names. But this is absurd, since at the beginning of this genealogy, two brothers come in Nathan and Salomon, from whom the lines are carried in different ways.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Eusebius Eccl. Hist</b>: Ipsorum ergo verborum sententiae intellectum attentius explicemus: si enim approbante Matthaeo Ioseph esse filium Iacob, Lucas similiter approbasset Ioseph esse filium Heli, esset aliqua controversia. Ceterum cum approbante Matthaeo, Lucas plurium opinionem declararet, non propriam, dicens ut putabatur, non arbitror aliquod relinqui dubium. Cum enim essent inter Iudaeos diversae opiniones de Christo, et omnes reducerent ipsum ad David propter promissiones ei factas; plurimi autem assererent Christum a David esse futurum per Salomonem et alios reges; quidam hanc opinionem vitabant, eo quod plurima de regibus dicuntur enormia; et quia de Iechonia Ieremias dixit, quod non oriretur semen ex eo collocandum in sede David: quorum opinionem commemorat Lucas, sentiens enarrare Matthaeum qualis esset veritas generationis: et haec est prima ratio. Est et alia profundior. Matthaeus enim cum inciperet scribere ante conceptionem Mariae, et carnalem nativitatem Iesu, opportune velut in historia praemittit carnalem progeniem: unde et generationem a superioribus derivat descendens: cum enim verbum Dei carnem acciperet, descendebat. Sed Lucas ad factam per lavacrum regenerationem prosilit, et ibi aliam generum successionem exponit, et ab imis ad prima sublevans, pariter et peccatorum, quos narravit Matthaeus, memoriam abdicat (eo quod quicumque in Deo renascitur, sit alienus a criminosis parentibus, Dei filius factus), et eorum qui secundum Deum vitam duxerunt honestam, meminit. Sic enim Abrahae dictum est: tu proficisceris ad patres tuos, non quidem carnales, sed in Deo patres, propter similitudinem honestatis. Igitur ei qui in Deo nascitur ascribit parentes, qui sunt secundum Deum per aequiparantiam morum.
          <td><b>EUSEBIUS</b>. Let us then more carefully explain the meaning of the words themselves. For if when Matthew affirmed Joseph to be the son of Jacob, Luke had in like manner affirmed that Joseph was the son of Eli, there would be some dispute. But seeing the case is that Matthew gives his opinion, Luke repeats the common opinion of many, not his own, saying, as was supposed, I do not think that there is any room for doubt. For since there were among the Jews different opinions of the genealogy of Christ, and yet all traced Him up to David because to him the promises were made, while many affirmed that Christ would come through Solomon and the other kings, some shunned this opinion because of the many crimes related of their kings, and because Jeremiah said of Jechonias that “a man should not rise of his seed to sit on the throne of David.” This last view Luke takes, though conscious that Matthew gives the real truth of the genealogy. This is the first reason. The next is a deeper one. For Matthew when he began to write of the things before the conception of Mary and the birth of Jesus in the flesh, very fitly as in a history commences with the ancestry in the flesh, and descending from thence deduces His generation from those who went before. For when the Word of God became flesh, He descended. But Luke hastens forward to the regeneration which takes place in baptism, and then gives another succession of families, and rising up from the lowest to the highest, keeps out of sight those sinners of whom Matthew makes mention, (because that he who is born again in God is separated from his guilty parents, being made the son of God,) and relates those who have led a virtuous life in the sight of God. For thus it was said to Abraham, You shall set out to your fathers, not fathers in the flesh, but in God, on account of their likeness in virtue. To him therefore who is born in God he ascribes parents who are according to God on account of this resemblance in character.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de quaest. Nov. et Vet. Testam</b>: Vel aliter. Matthaeus a David per Salomonem descendit ad Ioseph; Lucas vero ab Heli, qui tempore fuit salvatoris, ascendit per traducem Nathan filii David, et Heli et Ioseph iunxit tribum, ostendens unius generis esse utrumque; ac per hoc non solum Ioseph filium esse salvatorem, sed et Heli. Ipsa enim ratione qua Ioseph filius dicitur esse salvator, ipsa etiam est Heli filius, et caeterorum omnium qui de eadem tribu sunt. Hinc est quod dicit apostolus: quorum patres, et ex quibus Christus secundum carnem.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or in another way; Matthew descends from David through Salomon to Joseph: but Luke beginning from Eli, who was in the line of our Savior, ascends through the line of; Nathan the son of David, and joins the tribes of Eli and Joseph, showing that they are both of the same family, and thereby that the Savior was not only the Son of Joseph, but also of Eli. For by the same reason by which the Savior is called the son of Joseph, he is also the son of Eli, and of all the rest who are of the same tribe. Hence that which the Apostle says, Of whom are the fathers, and from whom. Christ came according to the flesh.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de quaest. Evang</b>: Vel tres causae concurrunt, quarum aliquam Evangelista secutus sit: aut enim unus Evangelista patrem eius a quo genitus est, nominavit, alter vero vel avum maternum, vel aliquem de cognatis maioribus posuit: aut unus erat Ioseph naturalis pater et alter eum adoptavit: aut more Iudaeorum, cum sine filiis unus decessisset, eius uxorem propinquus recipiens, filium quem genuit propinquo mortuo deputavit.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or there occur three reasons, by one of which the Evangelist was led. For either one Evangelist has mentioned the father by whom Joseph was, begotten, but the other his maternal grandfather, or some one of his ancestors. Or one of the fathers mentioned was the natural father of Joseph, the other his father who had adopted him. Or after the manner of the Jews, when a man has died without children, the next of kin taking his wife ascribes to his dead kinsman the son whom he has himself begotten.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Traditur enim, Nathan, qui a Salomone genus duxit, Iacob generasse filium, et uxore superstite decessisse, quam postea Melchi accepit uxorem, ex qua generatus est Heli; rursus Heli, fratre Iacob sine liberis decedente, copulatus est fratris uxori, et generavit alium Ioseph, qui iuxta legem Iacobi filius dicitur: quoniam semen fratris defuncti iuxta legis veteris seriem suscitabat.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; For it is related that Matthas, who was descended from Salomon, begat Jacob as his son, and died leaving his wife living, whom Melchi took unto him as wife, and from her Eli was born. Again, Eli, when his brother Jacob died without children, was joined to his brother’s wife, and begot a son Joseph, who according to law is called the son of Jacob, since Eli raised up seed to his deceased brother, according to the: order of the ancient law.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Vel aliter. Iacob fratris Heli sine liberis defuncti uxorem de mandato legis accipiens genuit Ioseph, natura quidem germinis filium suum, secundum vero legis praeceptum efficitur filius Heli.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Or else, Jacob, taking the wife of his brother Eli who had died without children according to the command of the law, begot Joseph, by natural parentage his own son, but by the ordinance of the law the son of Eli.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de quaest. Nov. et Vet. Testam</b>: Probabilius enim intelligimus Lucam adoptantis originem tenuisse, qui noluit Ioseph genitum dicere ab illo cuius filium esse narravit. Commodius enim filius dictus est eius a quo fuerat adoptatus, quam diceretur ab illo genitus cuius carne non erat natus. Matthaeus autem dicens: Abraham genuit Isaac, Isaac autem genuit Iacob, atque in hoc verbo, quod est genuit, perseverans donec in ultimo diceret: Iacob autem genuit Ioseph, satis expressit ad eum se patrem perduxisse originem generantium, a quo Ioseph non adoptatus, sed genitus erat. Quamquam si etiam genitum Lucas diceret Ioseph ab Heli, nec sic nos hoc verbum perturbare deberet: neque enim absurde quisque dicitur non carne, sed caritate genuisse quem sibi filium adoptavit. Merito autem Lucas adoptionis originem suscepit: quia per adoptionem efficiuntur filii Dei; per carnalem vero generationem filius Dei potius propter nos filius hominis factus est.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. It is most probable that Luke took the origin by adoption, as not being willing to say that Joseph, was begotten by him whose son he related him to be. For more easily is a man said to be his son by whom he was adopted, than to be begotten by him from whose flesh he was not born. But Matthew saying, “Abraham begat Isaac, and Isaac begat Jacob,” and continuing in the word “begat,” until at last he says, but “Jacob begat Joseph,” has sufficiently expressed that he has carried through the succession of the fathers, to that father by whom Joseph was not adopted, but begotten. Although even supposing that Luke should say that Joseph was begotten by Eli, neither ought that word to perplex us. For it is not absurd to say that a man has begotten not in the flesh but in love the Son whom he has adopted. But rightly has Luke taken the origin by adoption, for by adoption are we made the sons of God, by believing on the Son of God, but by His birth in the flesh, the Son of God has rather for our sakes become the Son of man.

Est enim ex nudis nominibus copiosum haurire thesaurum, quia plurimum rerum indicativa sunt nomina: nam et divinam clementiam, et oblatas a mulieribus gratiarum actiones sapiunt: cum enim filios impetrabant, nomen imponebant a dono.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b> But because this part of the Gospel consists of a series of names, men think there is nothing valuable to be derived therefrom. Lest then we should feel this, let us try to examine every step. For from the mere name we may extract an abundant treasure, for names are indicative of many things. For they savor of the Divine mercy and the offerings of thanks by women, who when they obtained sons gave a name significant of the gift.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Luke rightly thought, seeing that he could not embrace more of the sons of Jacob, lest he should seem to be wandering from the line of descent in a superfluous course, that the ancient names of the Patriarchs though occurring in others far later, Joseph Judah, Simeon, and Levi, should not be omitted. For we recognize in these four kinds of virtue; in Judah, the mystery of our Lord’s Passion prophesied by figure; in Joseph, an example of chastity going before; in Simeon the punishment of injured modesty; in Levi, the priestly office. Hence it follows, Who was the son of Melchi, i.e. “my King.” Who was the son of Janna, i.e. “a right hand”. Who was the son of Joseph, i.e. “growing up,” but this was a different Joseph. Who was the son of Mattathias, i.e. “the gift of God,” or “sometimes.” Who was the son of Amos, i.e. “loading, or he loaded.” Who was the son of Naum i.e. “help me.” Who was the son of Matthat i.e. “desire.” Who was the son of Mattathias, as above.

For Luke thought that the origin of Christ should be referred to God, because God is the true progenitor of Christ, or the Father according to the true birth, or the Author of the mystical gift according to baptism and regeneration, and therefore he did not from the first begin to describe His generation, but not till after he had unfolded His baptism, that both by nature and by grace he might declare Him to be the Son of God.

Hoc autem septies propterea ducitur, ut motu hominis facta significetur illa transgressio: ternario enim numero incorporea pars hominis significatur; quaternario vero corpus; motus autem in numeris non exprimitur, cum dicimus: unum, duo, tria; sed cum dicimus: semel, bis, ter. Unde per septies undecim significatur motu hominis facta transgressio.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But most fitly with regard to our baptized Lord does Luke reckon the generations through seventy-seven persons. For both the ascent to God is expressed, to whom we are reconciled by the abolition of sins, and by baptism is brought to man the remission of all his sins, which are signified by that number. For eleven times seven are seventy-seven. But by the tenth number is meant perfect happiness. Hence it is plain that the going beyond the tenth marks the sin of one through pride coveting to have more. But this is said to be seven times to signify that the transgression was caused by the moving of man. For by the third number the immortal part of man is represented, but by the fourth the body. But motion is not expressed in numbers, as when we say, one, two, three; but when we say, once, twice, thrice. And so by seven times eleven, is signified a transgression wrought by man’s action.

For as if you should say, These vessels are full of wine or oil, you would not thereby affirm them to be equally full, so Jesus and Paul were full of the Holy Spirit, but Paul’s vessel was far less than that of Jesus, and yet each was filled according to its own measure. Having then received baptism, the Savior, being full of the Holy Spirit, which came upon Him from heaven in the form of a dove, was led by the Spirit, because, as many as are led by the Spirit, they are the sons of God, but He was above all, especially the Son of God.

In a mystery, it was to deliver that Adam from exile who was cast out of Paradise into the wilderness. By way of example, it was to show us that the devil envies us, whenever we strive after better things; and that then we must use caution, lest the weakness of our minds should lose us the grace of the mystery.

For the periods of years run in courses of four, but forty contains four tens. Again, those ten are completed by the number one successively advancing on to four more. This plainly shows that the fast of forty days, i.e. the humiliation of the soul, the Law and the Prophets have consecrated by Moses and Elias, the Gospel by the fast of our Lord Himself.

          <td><b>BASIL</b>; But because not to suffer hunger is above the nature of man, our Lord took upon Himself the feeling of hunger, and submitted Himself as it pleased Him to human nature, both to do and to suffer those things which were His own. Hence it follows: And those days being ended, he was as a hungered. Not forced to that necessity which overpowers nature, but as if provoking the devil to the conflict. For the devil, knowing that wherever hunger is there is weakness, sets about to tempt Him, and as the deviser or inventor of temptations, Christ permitting him tries to persuade Him to satisfy His appetite with the stones. As it follows; But the devil said to him, If you are the Son of God, command these stones that they be made bread.

Inde ergo coepit unde iam vicit, scilicet Adam. Discamus igitur cavere gulam, cavere luxuriam, quia telum est Diaboli. Sed quid sibi vult talis sermo: si filius Dei es, nisi quia cognoverat Dei filius esse venturum, sed venisse per hanc infirmitatem corporis non putabat? Aliud est explorantis, aliud tentantis: ideo profitetur se credere, et homini conatur illudere.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; There are three especial weapons which we are taught the devil is wont to arm himself with, that he may wound the soul of man. One is of the appetite, another of boasting, the third ambition. He began with that wherewith he had already conquered, namely, Adam. Let us then beware of the appetite, let us beware of luxury, for it is a weapon of the devil. But what mean his words, If you are the Son of God, unless he had known that the Son would come, but supposed Him not to have come from the weakness of His body. He first endeavors to find Him out, then to tempt Him. He professes to trust Him as God, then tries to deceive Him as man.

          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; I suppose also that even now at this very time the devil shows a stone to men that he may tempt them to speak, saying to them, Command this stone to be made bread.

          <td><b>BASIL</b>; But Christ while He vanquishes temptation, banishes not hunger from our nature, as though that were the cause of evils, (which is rather the preservative of life, but confining nature within its proper bounds, shows of what kind its nourishment is, as follows; And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; You see then what kind of arms He uses to defend man against the assaults of spiritual wickedness, and the allurements of the appetite. He does not exert His power as God, (for how had that profited me,) but as man He summons to Himself a common aid, that while intent upon the food of divine reading He may neglect the hunger of the body, and gain the nourishment of the word. For he who seeks after the word cannot feel the want of earthly bread for divine things doubtless make up for the loss of human. At the same time by saying, Man lives not by bread alone, He shows that man was tempted, that is, our flesh which He assumed, not His own divinity.

There is one good use of the world, another of perfect virtue. It is good to seek God; it is a good thing that the desire of becoming acquainted with God should be hindered by no worldly business. But if he who seeks God, is from the weakness of the flesh, and the narrowness of his mind, often tempted, how much more is he exposed who seeks the world?

          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; Or, to view the whole in another light. Two kings are earnestly contending for a kingdom; The king of sin who reigns over sinners, that is, the devil; The king of righteousness who rules the righteous, that is, Christ. The devil, knowing that Christ had come to take away his kingdom, shows Him all the kingdoms of the world; not the kingdoms of the Persians and of the Medes, but his own kingdom whereby he reigned in the world, whereby some are under the dominion of fornication, others of covetousness. And he shows Him them in a moment of time, that is, in the present course of time, which is but a moment in comparison of eternity. For the Savior needed not to be shown for any longer time the affairs of this world, but as soon as He turned His eyes to look, He beheld sins reigning, and men made slaves to vice. The devil therefore says to Him, Came You to contend with me for dominion? Worship me, and behold I give You the kingdom I hold. Now the Lord would indeed reign, but being Righteousness itself, would reign without sin; and would have all nations subject to Him, that they might obey the truth, but would not so reign over others as that He Himself should be subject to the devil. Hence it follows, And Jesus answering said to him, It is written, You shall worship the Lord your God.

          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; Or else, All these, he says, I would have subject to me, that they might worship the Lord God, and serve Him alone. But do you wish sin to begin from Me, which I came hither to destroy?

          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Hoc autem mandatum eius tetigit intima; ante adventum enim eius ipse ubique colebatur: lex autem divina eiciens ipsum a dominio usurpato, adorare statuit solum eum qui naturaliter Deus est.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; This command touched him to the quick; for before Christ’s coming he was every where worshipped. But the law of God casting him down from his usurped dominion, establishes the worship of Him alone who is really God.

          <td><b>Beda</b>: Quaeret autem aliquis quomodo conveniat quod hic praecipitur, soli domino serviendum, apostoli verbo, qui dicit: per caritatem servite invicem.

Iubemur ergo per caritatem servire invicem, quod est Graece duleuin; iubemur uni Deo servire, quod est Graece latreuin: unde hic dicitur et illi soli servies; quod est Graece latreuis.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; But some one may ask how this injunction agrees with the word of the Apostle, which says, Beloved, serve one another. In the Greek, signifies a common service, (i.e. given either to God or man,) according to which we are bid to serve one another; but is the service due to the worship of the Deity, with which we are bid to serve God alone.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; It is the fate of boasting, that while a man thinks he is climbing higher, he is by his pretension to lofty deeds brought low. Hence it follows, And he said, to him, you are the Son of God, throw yourself down.

          <td><b>Athanasius</b> Non autem contra divinitatem certamen Diabolus iniit, neque enim audebat; et ideo dicebat si filius Dei es: sed cum homine certamen iniit, quem quondam seducere potuit.
          <td><b>ATHAN</b>. The devil entered not into a contest with God, (for he durst not, and therefore said, you are the Son of God,) but he contended with man whom once he had power to deceive.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Vere autem diabolica vox est quae mentem hominis de gradu altiori meritorum praecipitare contendit. Simul infirmitatem suam Diabolus malitiamque designat: quia nemini potest nocere nisi ipse deorsum se miserit: nam qui relictis caelestibus terrena eligit, voluntarium quoddam praecipitium vitae labentis incurrit. Simul quoniam telum suum Diabolus vidit obtusum, qui omnes proprie subiecerat potestati, plus coepit quam hominem iudicare. Transfigurat autem se Satanas velut Angelum lucis, et de Scripturis saepe divinis laqueum fidelibus parat; unde sequitur scriptum est enim: quoniam Angelis suis mandavit de te, ut conservent te, et quia in manibus tollent te, ne forte offendas ad lapidem pedem tuum.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; That is truly the devil’s language, which seeks to cast down the soul of man from the high ground of its good deeds, while he shows at the same time both his weakness and malice, for he can injure no one that does not first cast himself down. For he who forsaking heavenly things pursues earthly, rushes as it were willfully down the self-sought precipice of a falling life. As soon then as the devil perceived his dart blunted, he who had subdued all men to his own power, began to think he had to deal with more than man. But Satan transforms himself into an angel of light, and often from the Holy Scriptures weaves his mesh for the faithful: hence it follows, It is written, He shall give, &amp;c.

          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; Whence know you, Satan, that those things are written? Have you read the Prophets, or the oracles of God? You have read them indeed, but not that yourself might be the better for the reading, but that from the mere letter you might slay them who are friends to the letter. You know that if you were to speak from His other books, you would not deceive.

Quare autem siles quod sequitur: super aspidem et basiliscum ambulabis, nisi quia tu es basiliscus, tu draco, tu leo?
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; But mark how wily he is even in this testimony. For he would fain throw a slur upon the glory of the Savior, as though He needed the assistance of angels, and would stumble were He not supported by their hands. But this was said not of Christ, but of the saints generally; He needs not the aid of angels, Who is greater than angels. But let this teach you, Satan, that the angels would stumble did not God sustain them; and you stumble because you refuse to believe in Jesus Christ the Son of God. But why are you silent as to what follows, You shall walk upon the asp and the basilisk, except that you are the basilisk, you are the dragon and the lion?

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; But the Lord, to prevent the thought that those things which had been prophesied of Him were fulfilled according to the devil’s will, and not by the authority of His own divine power, again so foils his cunning, that he who had alleged the testimony of Scripture, should by Scripture himself be overthrown. Hence it follows, And Jesus answering said, It is said, You shall not tempt the Lord thy God.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Diabolicum enim est seipsum inicere ad pericula, et tentare si eripiat Deus.

          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Non enim tentantibus largitur Deus auxilia, sed credentibus in eum: unde Christus tentantibus eum non ostendebat miracula, quibus dicebat: generatio prava signum quaerit, et non dabitur ei.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; God gives not help to those who tempt Him, but to those who believe on Him. Christ therefore did not show ills miracles to them that tempted Him, but said to them, An evil generation seeks a sign, and no sign shall be given to them.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Aspice autem quomodo non turbatus est dominus; immo de Scripturis humillime cum iniquo disceptat, ut conformeris Christo pro posse. Novit Diabolus arma Christi, quibus succubuit: ex mansuetudine eum cepit, ex humilitate devicit. Tu quoque, cum videris hominem effectum Diabolum, et tibi obviantem, eo modo devincas, doceas animam tuam formare os condecens ori Christi: sicut enim cum Romanus forsan residet iudex, non exaudiet responsum ignorantis eo modo loqui quo ipse, sic et Christus nisi suo modo loquaris, non exaudiet te, nec vacabit tibi.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But mark how the Lord, instead of being troubled, condescends to dispute from the Scriptures with the wicked one, that you, as far as you are able, might become like Christ. The devil knew the arms of Christ, beneath which he sunk. Christ took him captive by meekness, He overcame him by humility. Do you also, when you see a man who has become a devil coming to meet you, subdue him in like manner. Teach your soul to conform its words to those of Christ. For as a Roman judge, who on the bench refuses to hear the reply of one who knows not how to speak as he does; so also Christ, except you speak after His manner, will neither hear you nor protect you.

          <td><b>GREG NYSS</b>. In lawful contests the battle is terminated either when the adversary surrenders of his own accord to the conqueror, or is defeated in three falls, according to the rules of the art of fighting. Hence it follows, And all the temptation being completed, &amp;c.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Non dixisset Scriptura omnem tentationem consummatam, nisi in tribus praemissis esset omnium materia delictorum: quia causae tentationum, causae cupiditatum sunt: scilicet carnis oblectatio, spes gloriae, aviditas potentiae.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; He would not have said that all the temptation was ended, had there not been in the three temptations which have been described the materials for every crime; for the causes of temptations are the causes of desire, namely, the delight of the flesh, the pomp of vain-glory, greediness of power.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Athanasius</b> Accesserat quidem ad eum hostis ut ad hominem; non inveniens autem in ipso antiqui sui seminis signa, discessit.

          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Vides ergo ipsum Diabolum in stadio non esse pertinacem, cedere verae solere virtuti; et si invidere non desinat, tamen instare formidat, quia frequentius refugit triumphari. Audito itaque Dei nomine, recessit, inquit, usque ad tempus; postea enim non tentaturus, sed aperte pugnaturus venit.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; You see then that the devil is not obstinate on the field, is wont to give way to true virtue; and if he ceases not to hate, he yet dreads to advance, for so he escapes a more frequent defeat. As soon then as he heard the name of God, he retired (it is said) for a season, for afterwards he comes not to tempt, but to fight openly.

          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Vel quia de voluptate tentaverat in deserto, recessit ab eo usque ad tempus crucis, in quo eum erat de tristitia tentaturus.

        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Maximus</b>: Vel Diabolus in deserto Christo suggesserat praeferre mundi materiam divino amori; quem dominus retrocedere iussit, quod erat indicium divini amoris: unde postea satagebat praevaricatorem eum facere dilectionis ad proximos; et ideo docente eo semitas vitae provocabat ad illius insidias Pharisaeos et Scribas, ut ad eorum odium perverteretur. Sed dominus dilectionis intuitu, quem habebat in eos, monebat, arguebat, beneficia conferre non cessabat.
          <td><b>MAXIM</b> US; Or the devil had prompted Christ in the desert to prefer the things of the world to the love of God. The Lord commanded him to leave Him, (which itself was a mark of Divine love.) It was afterwards then enough to make Christ appear the false advocate of love to His neighbors, and therefore while He was teaching the paths of life, the devil stirred up the Gentiles and Pharisees to lay traps for Him that He might be brought to hate them. But the Lord, from the feeling of love which He had towards them, exhorted, reproved, ceased not to bestow mercy upon them.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Cons. Evang</b>: Totum autem hoc similiter Matthaeus narrat, sed non eodem ordine: unde incertum est quid prius factum sit: utrum regna terrae prius demonstrata sint ei et postea in pinnam templi levatus sit; an hoc prius et illud postea: nihil tamen ad rem, dum omnia facta esse manifestum sit.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. The whole of this narrative Matthew relates in a similar manner, but not in the same order. It is uncertain therefore which took place first, whether the kingdoms of the earth were first shown to Him, and He was afterwards taken up to the pinnacle of the temple; or whether this came first, and the other afterwards. It matters little however which, as long as it is clear that they all took place.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Maximus</b>: Ob hoc autem Evangelistarum hanc iste, illam vero ille praemittit, quia inanis gloria et avaritia ad invicem sese gignunt.
          <td><b>MAXIM</b> US; But the reason why one Evangelist places this event first, and another that, is because vain-glory and covetousness give birth in turn to one another.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Origenes in Lucam</b>: Ioannes autem, quia a Deo exordium fecerat, dicens: in principio erat verbum, tentationem domini non descripsit, quia Deus tentari non potest, de quo ei erat sermo: quia vero in Matthaei Evangelio et in Luca generatio hominis scribitur et in Marco: homo autem est qui tentatur; ideo Matthaeus, Lucas et Marcus tentationem domini descripserunt.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; But John, who had commenced his Gospel from God, saying, In the beginning was the Word, did not describe the temptation of the Lord, because God can not be tempted, of whom he wrote. But because in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke the human generations are given, and in Mark it is man who is tempted, therefore Matthew, Luke, and Mark have described the temptation of the Lord.

But it was right that from that time He should become known, and that the mystery of His humanity should shine forth among those who were of the seed of Israel.

Verum differt inter synagogam quae congregatio, et Ecclesiam quae convocatio interpretatur: quia scilicet et pecora et quaeque res congregari in unum possunt; convocari non possunt nisi ratione utentia: ideo novae gratiae populum quasi maiore dignitate praeditum, rectius Ecclesiam quam synagogam nominare apostolicis doctoribus visum est.

Synagogue, which is a Greek word, is rendered in Latin congregatio. By this name then the Jews were accustomed to call not only the gathering together of people, but also the house where they met together to hear the word of God; as we call by the name of Church, both the place and the company of the faithful. But there is this difference between the synagogue which is called congregation, and the Church which is interpreted convocation, that flocks and cattle, and any thing else can be gathered together in one, but only rational beings can be called together. Accordingly the Apostolical doctors thought right to call a people which was distinguished by the superior dignity of a new grace rather by the name of Church, than Synagogue.

As it follows, To preach the acceptable year of the Lord. Some say that, according to the simple meaning of the word, the Savior preached the Gospel throughout Judea in one year, and that this is what is meant by preaching the acceptable year of the Lord. Or, the acceptable year of the Lord is the whole time of the Church, during which while present in the body, it is absent from the Lord.

He read standing, because while explaining those Scriptures which were written of Him, He condescended to work in the flesh; but having returned the book, He sits down, because He restored Himself to the throne of heavenly rest. For standing is the part of the workman, but sitting of one who is resting or judging. So also let the preacher of the word rise up and read and work and preach, and sit down, i.e. wait for the reward of rest. But He opens the book and reads, because sending the Spirit, He taught His Church all truth; having shut the book, He returned it to the minister, because all things were not to be said to all, but He committed the word to the teacher to be dispensed according to the capacity of the hearers.

Videte igitur quid mali invidia afferat: indigna propter invidiam patria iudicatur in qua civis operetur, quae digna fuit in qua Dei filius nasceretur.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; But this is given for an example, that in vain can you expect the aid of Divine mercy, if you grudge to others the fruits of their virtue. The Lord despises the envious, and withdraws the miracles of His power from them that are jealous of His divine blessings in others. For our Lord’s Incarnation is an evidence of His divinity, and His invisible things are proved to us by those which are visible. See then what evils envy produces. For envy a country is deemed unworthy of the works of its citizen, which was worthy of the conception of the Son of God.

          <td><b>Origenes in Lucam</b>: Quantum ad Lucae historiam pertinet, nondum in Capharnaum fecisse aliquod signum describitur: nam antequam veniret in Capharnaum, in Nazareth dixisse legitur quaecumque audivimus facta in Capharnaum. Unde puto in praesenti sermone aliquid latitare mysterii, et Nazareth in typo Iudaeorum, Capharnaum in typo praecessisse gentium. Erit enim tempus quando dicturus est populus Israel: quae ostendis universo orbi, ostende et nobis; praedica sermonem tuum populo tuo Israel, ut saltem cum subintraverit plenitudo gentium, tunc omnis Israel salvus fiat. Quamobrem videtur mihi convenienter respondisse salvator nemo propheta acceptus est in patria sua, plus iuxta sacramentum quam iuxta litteram, licet et Ieremias in Anathoth patria sua non fuerit acceptus, et reliqui prophetae; sed magis videtur mihi intelligi ut dicamus patriam omnium prophetarum fuisse populum circumcisionis. Et nationes quidem susceperunt vaticinium Iesu Christi, magis habentes Moysen et prophetas de Christo praedicantes, quam illi qui ex his non susceperunt Iesum.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; As far as Luke’s narrative is concerned, our Lord is not yet said to have worked any miracle in Capernaum. For before He came to Capernaum, He is said to have lived at Nazareth. I cannot but think therefore that in these words, “whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum,” there lies a mystery concealed, and that Nazareth is a type of the Jews, Capernaum of the Gentiles. For the time will come when the people of Israel shall say, “The things which you have shown to the whole world, show also to us.” Preach your word to the people of Israel, that then at least, when the fullness of the Gentiles has entered, all Israel may be saved. Our Savior seems to me to have well answered, No prophet is accepted in his own country, but rather according to the type than the letter; though neither was Jeremiah accepted in Anathoth his country, nor the rest of the Prophets. But it seems rather to be meant that we should say, that the people of the circumcision were the countrymen of all the Prophets. And the Gentiles indeed accepted the prophecy of Jesus Christ, esteeming Moses and the Prophets who preached of Christ, far higher than they who would not from these receive Jesus.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; By a very apt comparison the arrogance of envious citizens is put to shame, and our Lord’s conduct shown to agree with the ancient Scriptures. For it follows, But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias: not that the days were his, but that he performed his works in them.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He himself, an earthly angel, a heavenly man, who had neither house, nor food, nor clothing like others, carries the keys of the heavens on his tongue. And this is what follows, When the heaven was shut. But as soon as he had closed the heavens and made the earth barren, hunger reigned and bodies wasted away, as it follows, when there was as famine through the land.

Multi autem tunc temporis opulenti erant; sed nullus tale aliquid fecit ut vidua; reverentia enim mulieris ad prophetam, non praediorum, sed voluntatis fiebant divitiae.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But when the stream was dried up by which the cup of the righteous man was filled, God said, Go to Sarepta, a city of Sidon; there I will command a widow woman to feed you. As it follows, But to none of them was Elias sent, save to Sarepta, a city of Sidon, to a woman that was a widow. And this was brought to pass by a particular appointment of God. For God made him go a long journey, as far as Sidon, in order that having seen the famine of the country he should ask for rain from the Lord. But there were many rich men at that time, but none of them did any thing like the widow. For in the respect shown by the woman toward the prophet, consisted her riches not of lands, but of good will.

In vidua autem illa ad quam Elias directus est, typus Ecclesiae praemissus est.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; But he says in a mystery, “In the days of Elias,” because Elias brought the day to them who saw in his works the light of spiritual grace, and so the heaven was opened to them that beheld the divine mystery, but was shut when there was famine, because there was no fruitfulness in acknowledging God. But in that widow to whom Elias was sent was prefigured a type of the Church.

          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; For when a famine came upon the people of Israel, i.e. of hearing the word of God, a prophet came to a widow, of whom it is said, For the I desolate has many more children than she which has an husband; and when he had come, he multiplies her bread and her nourishment.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Sidonia signifies a vain pursuit, Sarepta fire, or scarcity of bread. By all which things the Gentiles are signified, who, given up to vain pursuits, (following gain and worldly business,) were suffering from the flames of fleshly lusts, and the want of spiritual bread, until Elias, (i.e. the word of prophecy,) now that the interpretation of the Scriptures had ceased because of the faithlessness of the Jews, came to the Church, that being received into the hearts of believers he might feed and refresh them.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; It can not be wondered at that they lost their salvation who cast the Savior out of their city. But the Lord who taught His Apostles by the example of Himself to be all things to all men, neither repels the willing, nor chooses the unwilling; neither struggles against those who cast Him out, nor refuses to hear those who supplicate Him. But that conduct was the result of no slight enmity, which, forgetful of the feelings of fellow citizens, converts the causes of love into the bitterest hatred. For when the Lord Himself was extending His blessings among the people, they began to inflict injuries upon Him, as it follows, And they led him to the brow of the hill, that they might cast him down.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Worse are the Jewish disciples than their master the Devil. For he says, Cast yourself down; they actually attempt to cast Him down.

          <td><b>Beda</b>: Quasi dicat: paululum a me vexando quiesce, cui nulla est societas cum nostra fraude.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; As if he said, Abstain a while from troubling me, you who have no fellowship with our designs.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Nec quemquam movere debet quod Iesu Nazareni nomen in hoc libro Diabolus dixisse primus inducitur: nec enim ab eo Christus nomen accepit, quod de caelo Angelus ad virginem detulit. Est huius impudentiae Diabolus, ut inter homines aliquid primus usurpet, et ad homines quasi novum deferat, quo terrorem suae potestatis incutiat; unde sequitur scio enim te, quia sis sanctus Dei.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; It ought not to shock any one that the devil is mentioned in this book as the first to have spoken the name of Jesus of Nazareth. For Christ received not from him that name which an Angel brought down from heaven to the Virgin. The devil is of such effrontery, that he is the first to use a thing among men and bring it as something new to them, that he may strike people with terror at his power. Hence it follows: For I know you who you are, the Holy One of God.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Athanasius</b> Non dicebat eum sanctum Dei, quasi aliis sanctis similis, sed quasi eo singulariter sancto existente cum articuli adiectione: ipse est enim naturaliter sanctus, cuius participatione omnes alii sancti vocantur: neque tamen hoc dicebat quasi eum veraciter nosset, sed se cognoscere fingebat.
          <td><b>ATHAN</b>. He spoke of Him not as a Holy One of God, as if He were like to the other saints, but as being in a remarkable manner the Holy One, with the addition of the article. For He is by nature holy by partaking of whom all others are called holy. Nor again did He speak this as if He knew it, but He pretended to know it.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Putaverunt enim Daemones quod per huiusmodi laudem facerent ipsum inanis gloriae amatorem, ut abstineret ab eorum contrarietate, utpote pro gratia gratiam recompensans.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; For the devils thought by praises of this sort to make Him a lover of vainglory, that He might be induced to abstain from opposing or destroying them by way of grateful return.

Nefas est enim ut cum adsit nobis Scriptura divina, instruamur a Diabolo; unde sequitur et increpavit illum, dicens: obmutesce, et exi ab illo.
          <td><b>ATHAN</b>. Although he confessed the truth he controlled his tongue, lest with the truth he should also publish his own disgrace, which should teach us not to care for such, although they speak the truth, for we who know the divine Scripture, must not be taught by the devil, as it follows: And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be silent, &amp;c.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Divina autem permissione liberandus a Daemone homo proicitur in medium, ut virtus patefacta salvatoris plures ad viam salutis invitet; unde sequitur et cum proiecisset illum Daemonium in medium, exiit ab illo, nihilque illi nocuit. Videtur autem repugnare quod hic dicitur Marco qui ait: et discerpens eum spiritus immundus, et exclamans voce magna, exivit ab eo, nisi intelligamus hoc dixisse Marcum: discerpens eum, quod Lucas dicit et cum proiecisset illum in medium; ut quod secutus ait nihilque illi nocuit, intelligatur quia iactatio illa membrorum atque vexatio non eum debilitavit, sicut solent exire Daemonia etiam quibusdam membris amputatis aut evulsis. Unde merito pro tam integra restitutione sanitatis mirantur; nam sequitur et factus est pavor in omnibus, et colloquebantur ad invicem, dicentes: quod est hoc verbum quod in potestate et virtute imperat immundis spiritibus, et exeunt?
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; But by the permission of God, the man who was to be delivered from the devil is thrown into the midst, that the power of the Savior being manifested might bring over many to the way of salvation. As it follows: And when he had thrown him in the midst. But this seems to be opposed to Mark, who says, And the unclean spirit tearing him, and crying with a loud voice, went out of him, unless we understand that Mark meant by tearing him the same as Luke by these words, And when he had thrown him in the midst, so that what follows, and hurt him not, might be understood to mean, that that twisting of limbs, and sore troubling, did not weaken him, as is often the case when devils depart from a man, leaving him with limbs cut and torn off. Well then do they wonder at such complete restoration of health. For it follows: And fear came upon all.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Quasi dicant: quale est praeceptum hoc quod praecepit exi ab eo, et exit?
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. As if they said, What is this word by which he commands, Go out, and he went out?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Holy men were able by the word of God to cast out devils, but the Word Himself does mighty works by His own power.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Mystice autem qui in synagoga spiritum habebat immundum, populus est Iudaeorum, qui innodatus Diaboli laqueis, simulatam corporis munditiam interioris mentis sordibus inquinabat: et bene spiritum immundum habebat, quia spiritum sanctum amiserat: introierat enim Diabolus, unde Christus exierat.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; In a mystery, the man in the synagogue with the unclean spirit is the Jewish people, which being fast bound in the wiles of the devil, defiled its vaunted cleanliness of body by the pollution of the heart. And truly it had an unclean spirit, because it had lost the Holy Spirit. For the devil entered whence Christ had gone out.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Sciendum est etiam, quod multi nunc Daemonia habent, scilicet qui Daemoniorum desideria implent, ut furiosi habent Daemonium irae, et sic de ceteris. Sed dominus in synagogam venit, cum mens hominis fuerit congregata, et tunc dicit Daemoni inhabitanti obmutesce; et statim eiciens eum in medium, egreditur ab eo; non enim decet hominem semper iracundum esse, bestiale namque hoc est; nec semper absque ira, insensibile namque hoc est: sed medium iter ambulare oportet, et iram contra mala habere; et sic proicitur homo cum immundus spiritus ab eo egreditur.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. We must know also that many now have devils, namely, such as fulfill the desires of devils, as the furious have the demon of anger; and so of the rest. But the Lord came into the synagogue when the thoughts of the man were collected, and then says to the demon that dwelt there, Hold your peace, and immediately throwing him into the middle he departs out of him. For it becomes not a man always to be angry, (that is, like the brutes,) nor always to be without anger, (for that is want of feeling,) but he must take the middle path, and have anger against what is evil; and so the man is thrown into the midst when the unclean spirit departs from him.

Applicuerant enim ad ipsum populi, apostolorum sequentes vestigia; dominus autem gaudebat detentus, sed mandabat ut eum dimitterent, ut etiam alii participes forent eius doctrinae, quasi tempore suae praesentiae non multum duraturo; unde sequitur quibus ait: quia et aliis civitatibus oportet me evangelizare regnum Dei, quia ideo missus sum. Marcus dicit: ad hoc veni, ostendens divinitatis eius celsitudinem, et voluntariam exinanitionem; Lucas vero dicit ad hoc missus sum, idest incarnationem ostendens, necnon beneplacitum patris missionem appellans; et ille quidem simpliciter dicit: ut praedicem, iste vero regnum Dei adiungit, quod est ipse Christus.
          <td><b>GREEK EX</b>. Now when Mark says that the Apostles came to him, saying, All seek you, but Luke, that the people came, there is no difference between them, for the people came to Him following in the footsteps of the Apostles. But the Lord rejoiced in being held back, yet bid them let Him go, that others also might partake of His teaching, as the time of His presence would not last long; as it follows, And he said to them, I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also, &amp;c. Mark says, to this I came, showing the loftiness of His divine nature, and His voluntary emptying Himself of it. But Luke says, to this am I sent, showing His incarnation, and calling also the decree of the Father, a sending Him forth; and one simply says, To preach, the other added, the kingdom of God, which is Christ Himself.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Simul etiam considera, quod poterat in eodem loco manendo, omnes attrahere ad se; non tamen hoc fecit, praebens nobis exemplum ut perambulemus et requiramus pereuntes, sicut pastor ovem perditam, et medicus accedit ad infirmum: una enim anima recuperata, poterit aliquis mille delicta abolere; unde et hic sequitur et erat praedicans in synagogis Galilaeae. Frequentabat quidem synagogas, docens illos quod non esset seductor: nam si iugiter inhabitata coleret, diffamarent eum velut latitantem.

He did not however do so, giving us an example to go about and seek those who are perishing, as the shepherd his lost sheep, and as the physician the sick. For by recovering one soul, we may be able to blot out a thousand sins. Hence also it follows, And he was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee. He frequently indeed went to the synagogues, to show them that He was no deceiver. For if He were constantly to dwell in the desolate places, they would spread abroad that He was concealing Himself.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; When the Lord had performed many and various kinds of cures, the multitude began to heed neither time nor place in their desire to be healed. The evening came, they followed; a lake is before them, they still press on; as it is said, And it came to pass, as the people pressed upon him.

Quis noluisset solam prospicere faciem, et os talia loquens? Neque enim in agendo miracula solum admirabilis erat; sed visus eius abundabat plurima gratia; unde et loquentem eum audiunt in silentio, seriem locutionis non irrumpentes; dicitur enim ut audirent verbum Dei, et ipse stabat secus stagnum Genezareth.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. For they clung to Him with love and admiration, and longed to keep Him with them. For who would depart while He performed such miracles? who would not be content to see only His face, and the mouth that uttered such things? Nor as performing miracles only was He an object of admiration, but His whole appearance was overflowing with grace. Therefore when He speaks, they listen to Him in silence, interrupting not the chain of His discourse; for it is said, that they might hear the word of God, &amp;c. It follows, And he stood near the lake of Gennesaret.

Porro Genezareth a laci ipsius natura, quae crispantibus aquis de seipso sibi excitare auram perhibetur, Graeco vocabulo quasi generans sibi auram dicitur: neque enim in stagni morem sternitur aqua, sed frequentibus auris spirantibus agitatur, haustu dulcis, et ad potandum habilis. Sed Hebraeae linguae consuetudine omnis aquarum congregatio, sive dulcis, sive salsa, mare nuncupatur.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; The lake of Gennesaret is said to be the same as the sea of Galilee or the sea of Tiberias; but it is called the sea of Galilee from the adjacent province, the sea of Tiberias from a neighboring city. Gennesaret, however, is the name given it from the nature of the lake itself, (which is thought from its crossing waves to raise a breeze upon itself,) being the Greek expression for “making a breeze to itself.” For the water is not steady like that of a lake, but constantly agitated by the breezes blowing over it. It is sweet to the taste, and wholesome to drink. In the Hebrew tongue, any extent of water, whether it be sweet or salt, is called a sea.

For so great was their poverty, that they patched up their old nets, not being able to buy new ones. But our Lord was very desirous to collect the multitudes, that none might remain behind, but they might all behold Him face to face; He therefore enters into a ship, as it is said, And he entered into a ship, which was Simon’s, and prayed him.

Piscatores sunt Ecclesiae doctores, qui nos per rete fidei comprehendunt, et quasi littori, sic terrae viventium advehunt. Sed haec retia modo laxantur in capturam, modo lota plicantur: quia non omne tempus est habile doctrinae; sed nunc exercenda est lingua doctoris, et nunc suimet cura gerenda. Navis Simonis est Ecclesia primitiva, de qua Paulus dicit: qui operatus est Petro in apostolatum circumcisionis; bene una dicta, quia multitudinis credentium erat cor unum et anima una.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Now mystically, the two ships represent circumcision and uncircumcision. The Lord sees these, because in each people He knows who are His, and by seeing, i.e. by a merciful visitation, He brings them nearer the tranquillity of the life to come. The fishermen are the doctors of the Church, because by the net of faith they catch us, and bring us as it were ashore to the land of the living. But these nets are at one time spread out for catching fish, at another washed and folded up. For every time is not fitted for teaching, but at one time the teacher must speak with the tongue, and at another time we must discipline ourselves. The ship of Simon is the primitive Church, of which St. Paul says, He that wrought effectually in Peter to the Apostleship of circumcision. The ship is well called one, for in the multitude of believers there was one heart and one soul.

          <td><b>Augustinus de quaest. Evang</b>: De qua docebat turbas, quia de auctoritate Ecclesiae docet gentes. Quod autem dominus ascendens in navim rogat eum a terra reducere pusillum, significat temperate utendum verbo ad turbas, ut nec terrena eis praecipiantur, nec a terrenis in profunda sacramentorum recedatur. Vel prius in proximis regionibus gentibus praedicandum, ut quod postea dicit duc in altum, ad remotiores gentes postea praedicandum praecipiat.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. From which ship He taught the multitude, for by the authority of the Church He teaches the Gentiles. But the Lord entering the ship, and asking Peter to put off a little from the land, signifies that we must be moderate in our words to the multitude, that they may be neither taught earthly things, nor from earthly things rush into the depths of the sacraments. Or, the Gospel must first be preached to the neighboring countries of the Gentiles, that (as He afterwards says, Launch out into the deep) He might command it to be preached afterwards to the more distant nations.

But our Lord, since he had taught the people out of the ship, left not the master of the ship without reward, but conferred on him a double kindness, giving him first a multitude of fishes, and next making him His disciple: as it follows, And when they had done this, they enclosed a great multitude of fishes. They took so many fishes that they could not pull them out, but sought the assistance of their companions; as it follows, But their net broke, and they beckoned to their partners who were in the other ship to come, &amp;c.

That took place after our Lord’s resurrection at the lake of Tiberias, and not only the time, but the miracle itself is very different. For in the latter the nets being let down on the right side took one hundred and fifty-three fishes, and these of large size, which it was necessary for the Evangelist to mention, because though so large the nets were not broken, and this would seem to have reference to the event which Luke relates, when from the multitude of the fishes the nets were broken.

Non turbatur ista quae Petrum habet; turbatur illa quae Iudam habet: in utraque Petrus; sed qui suis meritis firmus est, turbatur alienis. Caveamus igitur proditorem, ne per unum plurimi fluctuemus. Illic turbatio ubi modica fides; hic securitas ubi perfecta dilectio. Denique etsi aliis imperatur ut laxent retia sua, soli tamen Petro dicitur duc in altum, hoc est in profundum disputationum. Quod est tam altum quam scire Dei filium? Quae sunt autem apostolorum quae laxari iubentur retia, nisi verborum complexiones, et quasi quidam orationis sinus, et disputationum recessus, qui eos quos ceperint non amittant? Et bene apostolica instrumenta piscandi retia sunt, quae non captos perimunt, sed reservant, et fluctuantes de infimis ad superna transducunt. Dicit autem praeceptor, per totam noctem laborantes nihil cepimus: quia non hoc humanae facundiae opus, sed supernae vocationis est munus.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Now in a mystery, the ship of Peter, according to Matthew, is beaten about by the waves, according to Luke, is filled with fishes, in order that you might understand the Church at first wavering, at last abounding. The ship is not shaken which holds Peter; that is which holds Judas. In each was Peter; but he who trusts in his own merits is disquieted by another’s. Let us beware then of a traitor, lest through one we should many of us be tossed about. Trouble is found there where faith is weak, safety here where love is perfect. Lastly, though to others it is commanded, Let down your nets, to Peter alone it is said, Launch out into the deep, i.e. into deep researches. What is so deep, as the knowledge of the Son of God! But what are the nets of the Apostles which are ordered to be let down, but the interweaving of words and certain folds, as it were, of speech, and intricacies of argument, which never let those escape whom they have once caught. And rightly are nets the Apostolical instruments for fishing, which kill not the fish that are caught, but keep them safe, and bring up those that are tossing about in the waves from the depths below to the regions above. But he says, Master, we have toiled the whole night and have caught nothing; for this is not the work of human eloquence but the gift of divine calling. But they who had before caught nothing, at the word of the Lord enclosed a great multitude of fishes.

For the sinking of the ships is when men, by vicious habits, fall back into that world from which they have been elected by faith.

In his admiratur Petrus; unde sequitur stupor enim circumdederat eum, et omnes qui cum illo erant, in captura piscium quam ceperant; similiter autem Iacobum et Ioannem filios Zebedaei, qui erant socii Simonis.
          <td><b>GREG. NYSS</b>. When Christ commanded to let down the nets, the multitude of the fishes taken was just as great as the Lord of the sea and land willed. For the voice of the Word is the voice of power, at whose bidding at the beginning of the world light and the other creatures came forth.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Say you also, Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord, that God may answer, Fear not. Confess your sin, and the Lord will pardon you. See how good the Lord is, who gives so much to men, that they have the power of making alive. As it follows, From henceforth you shall catch men.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Hoc ad ipsum Petrum specialiter pertinet: exponit enim ei dominus quid haec captura piscium significet; quod scilicet ipse sicut nunc per retia pisces, sic aliquando per verba sit capturus homines: totusque facti huius ordo quid in Ecclesia, cuius ipse typum tenet, quotidie geratur, ostendit.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; This especially belongs to Peter himself, for the Lord explains to him what this taking of fish means; that in fact as now he takes fishes by the net, so hereafter he will catch men by words. And the whole order of this event shows what is daily going on in the Church, of which Peter is the type.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Considera autem eorum fidem et obedientiam; habentes enim opus prae manibus appetibilis piscationis, cum audissent mandantem, non distulerunt, sed relictis omnibus sequebantur.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But mark their faith and obedience. For though they were eagerly engaged in the employment of fishing, yet when they heard the command of Jesus, they delayed not, but forsook all and followed Him. Such is the obedience which Christ demands of us; we must not forego it, even though some great necessity urges us. Hence it follows, And having brought their ships to land.

          <td><b>Augustinus de Cons. Evang</b>: Matthaeus et Marcus breviter hoc perstringunt quemadmodum gestum sit, quod Lucas hic apertius explicavit.

Sed potuit utique prius hoc Petro dici, cum de capta ingenti multitudine piscium miraretur, quod Lucas insinuavit; ambobus postea, quod illi duo commemoraverunt. Vel intelligendum est hoc primo fuisse factum quod Lucas commemorat; nec tunc eos a domino vocatos, sed tantum fuisse praedictum Petro quod homines esset capturus: non autem quod numquam pisces esset capturus: unde datur locus intelligere eos ad capturam piscium remeasse, ut postea fieret quod Matthaeus et Marcus narrant: tunc enim non subductis ad terram navibus, tamquam cura redeundi, sed ita eum secuti sunt, tamquam vocantem aut iubentem. Sed si, secundum Ioannem, iuxta Iordanem secuti sunt eum Petrus et Andreas; quomodo ab aliis Evangelistis dicitur quod eos in Galilaea piscantes invenit et ad discipulatum vocavit, nisi quia intelligendum est, non sic eos vidisse dominum iuxta Iordanem ut ei inseparabiliter cohaererent, sed tantum cognovisse quis esset, eumque miratos ad propria remeasse?
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Matthew and Mark here briefly state the matter, and how it was done. Luke explains it more at large. There seems however to be this difference, that he makes our Lord to have said to Peter only, From henceforth you shall catch men, whereas they related it as having been spoken to both the others. But surely it might have been said at first to Peter, when he marveled at the immense draught of fishes, as Luke suggests, and afterwards to both, as the other two have related it. Or we must understand the event to have taken place as Luke relates, and that the others were not then called by the Lord, but only it was foretold to Peter that he should catch men, not that he should no more be employed in fishing; and hence there is room for supposing that they returned to their fishing, so that afterwards that might happen which Matthew and Mark speak of. For then the ships were not brought to land, as if with the intention of returning, but they followed Him as calling or commanding them to come. But if according to John, Peter and Andrew followed Him close by Jordan, how do the other Evangelists say that He found them fishing in Galilee, and called them to the discipleship? Except we understand that they did not see the Lord near Jordan so as to join Him inseparably, but knew only who He was, and marveling at Him returned to their own.

Non enim hoc voce linguae dicunt homines bonis ministris Dei, ut eos a se repellant; sed voce morum et actuum suadent a se recedi, ne per bonos regantur, et eo vehementius quo deferunt eis honorem; ut honorificentiam eorum significaverit Petrus cadens ad pedes domini, mores autem in eo quod dixit exi a me.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or, Peter speaks in the character of A the Church full of carnal men, Depart from me, for I am a sinful man. As if the Church, crowded with carnal men, and almost sunk by their vices, throws off from it, as it were, the rule in spiritual things, wherein the character of Christ chiefly shines forth. For not with the tongue do men tell the good servants of God that they should depart from them, but with the utterance of their deeds and actions they persuade them to go away, that they may not be governed by the good. And yet all the more anxiously do they hasten to pay honors to them, just as Peter testified his respect by falling at the feet of our Lord, but his conduct in saying, Depart from me.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">

          <td><b>Augustinus de quaest. Evang</b>: Dominus autem dum non recessit ab eis, significat, in bonis et spiritualibus viris non esse oportere hanc voluntatem ut peccatis turbarum commoti, quo quasi securius tranquilliusque vivant, munus ecclesiasticum deserant. Quod autem subductis ad terram navibus, relictis omnibus secuti sunt eum, potest significare finem temporis quo ab huius mundi salo, qui Christo inhaeserunt penitus recessuri sunt.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But the Lord did not depart from them, showing thereby that good and spiritual men, when they ere troubled by the wickedness of the many, ought not to wish to abandon their ecclesiastical duties, that they might live as it were a more secure and tranquil life. But the bringing their ships to land, and forsaking all to follow Jesus, may represent the end of time, when those who have clung to Christ shall altogether depart from the storms of this world.

          <td><b>ATHAN</b>. Now the leper worshipped the Lord God in His bodily form, and thought not the Word of God to be a creature because of His flesh, nor because He was the Word did he think lightly of the flesh which He put on; nay rather in a created temple he adored the Creator of all things, falling down on his face, as it follows, And when he saw Jesus he fell on his face, and besought him.

The law forbids to touch the leprous man, but He who is the Lord of the law submits not to the law, but makes the law; He did not touch because without touching He was unable to make him clean, but to show that he was neither subject to the law, nor feared the contagion as man; for He could not be contaminated Who delivered others from the pollution.

Besides, whatsoever things are of the same power, are wont to be of the same substance. Again; let us then admire in these things Christ working both divinely and bodily. For it is of God so to will that all things are done accordingly, but of man to stretch forth the hand. From two natures therefore is perfected one Christ, for that the Word was made flesh.

For the body declared the Deity hidden in it, when he by touching it afforded a remedy, but the soul, by the mighty power of its will, marked the Divine strength. For as the sense of touch is the property of the body, so the motion of the will of the soul. The soul wills, the body touches.

Sed ne lepra transire possit in medicum, unusquisque dominicae humilitatis exemplo iactantiam vitet; nam sequitur et praecepit illi ut nemini diceret: ut scilicet doceret non vulganda nostra beneficia, sed premenda, ut non solum a mercede abstineamus pecuniae, sed etiam gratiae.

But there is nothing intervening between God’s work and His command, that we may see in the inclination of the healer the power of the work. Hence it follows, And immediately the leprosy departed from him. But lest leprosy should become rife among us, let each avoid boasting after the example of our Lord’s humility. For it follows, And he commanded him that he should tell it to no one, that in truth he might teach us that our good deeds are not to be made public, but to be rather concealed, that we should abstain not only from gaining money, but even favor. Or perhaps the cause of His commanding silence was that He thought those to be preferred, who had rather believed of their own accord than from the hope of benefit.

Evang</b>: Videtur hic approbare sacrificium quod per Moysen praeceptum est, cum id non recipiat Ecclesia: quod ideo iussisse intelligi potest, quia nondum coeperat esse sacrificium sanctum sanctorum, quod corpus eius est: non enim oportebat auferri significativa sacrificia priusquam illud quod significabatur confirmatum esset contestatione apostolorum praedicantium, et fide credentium populorum.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. He seems here to approve of the sacrifice which had been commanded through Moses though the Church does not require it. It may therefore be understood to have been commanded, because not as yet had commenced that most holy sacrifice which is His body. For it was not fitting that typical sacrifices should be taken away before that which was typified should be confirmed by the witness of the Apostles’ preaching, and the faith of believers.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Vel quia lex spiritualis est, videtur sacrificium mandasse spirituale; unde dixit sicut praecepit Moyses; denique addidit in testimonium illis.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Or because the law is spiritual He seems to have commanded a spiritual sacrifice. Hence he said, As Moses commanded. Lastly, he adds, for a testimony to them.

          <td><b>Titus</b>: Haeretici perperam hoc accipiunt, dicentes in opprobrium legis esse dictum. Qualiter autem iuberet offerre pro emundatione secundum praeceptum Moysi?
          <td>The heretics understand this erroneously, saying, that it was meant as a reproach to the law. But how would he order an offering for cleansing, according to Moses’ commandments, if he meant this against the law?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Matthaeum</b>: Dicit ergo in testimonium illis, quia ex hoc facto ostenditur Christum incomparabili excellentia Moysi praeferri; quia enim Moyses insufficiens erat a sorore leprae pellere morbum, orabat dominum ut eam liberaret; sed salvator in potestate divina protulit volo, mundare.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; He says then, for a testimony to them, because this deed makes manifest that Christ in His incomparable excellence is far above Moses. For when Moses could not rid his sister of the leprosy, he prayed the Lord to deliver her. But the Savior, in His divine power, declared, I will, be you clean.

          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Vel in testimonium illis, hoc est ad reprehensionem eorum, et ad probationem quod legem revereor.

Et quamvis dominus impendens remedia, moneret nemini dicere, instruens nos evitare superbiam; fama tamen eius volabat, undique installans auditui cunctorum miraculum; unde sequitur perambulabat magis sermo de illo.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Or, for a testimony against them, i.e. as a reproof of them, and a testimony that I respect the law. For now too that I have cured you, I send you for the examination of the priests, that you should bear me witness that I have not played false to the law. And although the Lord in giving out remedies advised telling them to no one, instructing us to avoid pride; yet His fame flew about every where, instilling the miracle into the ears of every one, as it follows, But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him.

          <td><b>Beda</b>: Unius autem perfecta salvatio multas ad dominum cogit turbas: unde sequitur et conveniebant turbae multae, ut audirent et curarentur ab infirmitatibus suis. Ut enim leprosus exterius se sanatum doceret, perceptum beneficium, ut Marcus ait, etiam iussus non tacet.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Now the perfect healing of one brings many multitudes to the Lord, as it follows, And great multitudes came together that they should be healed. For the leprous man that he might show both his outward and inward cure, even though forbid ceases not, as Mark says, to tell of the benefit he had received.

          <td><b>GREG</b>. Our Redeemer performs His miracles by day, and passes the night in prayer, as it follows, And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed, hinting, as it were, to perfect preachers, that as neither they should entirely desert the active life from love of contemplation, so neither should they despise the joys of contemplation from an excess of activity, but in silent thought imbibe that which they might afterwards give back in words to their neighbors.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Now that He retired to pray, you would not ascribe to that nature which says, I will, be you clean, but to that which putting forth the hand touched the leprous man, not that according to Nestorius there is a double person of the Son, but of the same person, as there are two natures, so are there two operations.

          <td><b>GREG NAZ</b>. And His works He indeed performed among the people, but He prayed for the most part in the wilderness, sanctioning the liberty of resting a while from labor to hold converse with God with a pure heart. For He needed no change or retirement, since there was nothing which could be relaxed in Him, nor any place in which He might confine Himself, for He was God, but it was that we might clearly know that there is a time for action, a time for each higher occupation.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Typice autem leprosus humanum genus languidum peccatis designat, plenum lepra: quia omnes peccaverunt, et egent gratia Dei, ut scilicet extenta manu, idest verbo Dei humanam contingente naturam, a prisci erroris varietate mundentur, et offerant Deo pro emundatione corpora sua hostiam vivam.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; How typically the leprous man represents the whole race of man, languishing with sins full of leprosy, for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God; that so by the hand put forth, i.e. the word of God partaking of human nature, they might be cleansed from the vanity of their old errors, and offer for cleansing their bodies as a living sacrifice.

Quia vero necessarium erat, ubi tanta Scribarum et Pharisaeorum turba convenerat, aliquid fieri ex his quae virtuti attestarentur ipsius coram eis qui eum parvipendebant, factum est quoddam miraculum in paralytico: in quo quia defecisse videbatur medicinalis ars, portabatur a proximis ad supernum et caelestem medicum; unde sequitur et ecce viri portantes in lecto hominem qui erat paralyticus; et quaerebant eum inferre, et ponere ante eum.

Hence it is said, And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees sitting by, &amp;c. And the power of the Lord was present to heal them. Not as though He borrowed the power of another, but as God and the Lord He healed by His own inherent power. Now men often become worthy of spiritual gifts, but generally depart from the rule which the giver of the gifts knew. It was not so with Christ, for the divine power went on abounding in giving remedies. But because it was necessary where so great a number of Scribes and Pharisees had come together, that something should be done to attest His power before those men who slighted Him, He performed the miracle on the man with the palsy, who since medical art seemed to fail, was carried by his kinsfolk to a higher and heavenly Physician. As it follows, And behold men brought him.

But unroofing the house they let down the couch, and place the paralytic in the midst, as it follows, And they let him down through the tilings. Some one may say, that the place was let down, from which they lowered the couch of the palsied man through the tilings.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Mighty is the Lord who pardons one man for the good deed of another, and while he approves of the one, forgives the other his sins. Why, O man, with you does not your fellowman prevail, when with God a servant has both the liberty to intercede in your behalf, and the power of obtaining what he asks? If you despair of the pardon of heavy sins, bring the prayers of others, bring the Church to pray for you, and at sight of this the Lord may pardon what man denies to you.

Let us then remove the fountain of evil, and the waters of sickness will cease to flow. But from fear of the multitude, the Pharisees durst not openly expose their designs, but only meditated them in their hearts.

For it is both more powerful evidence when men confess unwillingly, and a more fatal error when they who deny are left to the consequence of their own assertions.

Great is the madness of an unbelieving people, who though they have confessed that it is of God alone to forgive sins, believe not God when He forgives sins.

Palam quidem est quia consolidare corpus facilius est: quanto namque nobilior est anima corpore, tanto est excellentior absolutio criminum: verum, quia illud non creditis eo quod lateat, adiciam quod minus est; apertius tamen, quatenus quod est magis occultum per hoc demonstretur.

Again, another that I make whole the body of the palsied man. Hence He adds, Whether is it easier? It is very plain that it is easier to restore the body to health. For as the soul is far nobler than the body, so is the forgiveness of sins more excellent than the healing of the body. But since you believe not the former, because it is hid; I will add that which is inferior, yet more open, in order that thereby that which is secret may be made manifest. And indeed in addressing the sick man, He said not, I forgive you your sins, expressing His own power, but, Your sins are forgiven you. But they compelled Him to declare more plainly His own power to them, when He said, But that you may know.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Now Luke and Mark, for the honor of the Evangelist, are silent as to his common name, but Matthew is the first to accuse himself, and gives the name of Matthew and publican, that no one might despair of salvation because of the enormity of his sins, when he himself was changed from a publican to an Apostle.

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; For Levi had been a publican, a rapacious man, of unbridled desires after vain things, a lover of other men’s goods, for this is the character of the publican, but snatched from the very worship of malice by Christ’s call. Hence it follows, And he said to him, Follow me.

Nec solum cum eo discumbit, immo cum pluribus; unde sequitur et erat turba multa publicanorum et aliorum qui cum illis erant discumbentes. Convenerant enim publicani ad eum sicut ad collegam, et hominem eiusdem officii, sed et ipse glorians de praesentia Christi, convocavit omnes. Christus etiam quodlibet genus remedii exhibebat, et non solum disputando et praestando sanitatis remedia, vel etiam redarguendo aemulos, sed etiam comedendo, nonnullos errantium corrigebat; inde nos instruens quod quodlibet opus et tempus potest nobis utilitatem afferre. Sed nec publicanorum participationem vitavit propter utilitatem sequentem, more medici, qui nisi tangeret saniem, non liberaret a morbo.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But the Lord honored Levi, whom He had called, by immediately going to his feast. For this testified the greater confidence in him. Hence it follows, And Levi made him a great feast in his own house. Nor did He sit down to meat with him alone, but with many, as it follows, And there was a great company of Publicans and others that sat down with them. For the publicans came to Levi as to their colleague, and a man in the same line with themselves, and he too glorying in the presence of Christ, called them all together. For Christ displayed every sort of remedy, and not only by discoursing and displaying cures, or even by rebuking the envious, but also by eating with them, He corrected the faults of some, thereby giving us a lesson, that every time and occasion brings with it its own profit. But He shunned not the company of Publicans, for the sake of the advantage that might ensue, like a physician, who unless he touch the afflicted part cannot cure the disease.

        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Cons. Evang</b>: Videtur autem Lucas hoc aliquanto differentius ab aliis Evangelistis commemorasse: non enim dicit tantum domino obiectum esse quod cum publicanis et Pharisaeis manducaret et biberet, sed discipulis; quod de ipso ac de ipsis acciperetur. Propterea enim Matthaeus et Marcus de Christo discipulis obiectum narrant: quia quod discipuli cum publicanis et peccatoribus manducabant, magistro magis obiciebatur, quem sectando imitabantur. Una ergo sententia est, tanto melius insinuata quanto quibusdam verbis, manente veritate variata.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Now St. Luke seems to have related this somewhat different from the other Evangelists. For he does not say that to our Lord alone it was objected that He eat and drank with publicans and sinners, but to the disciples also, that the charge might be understood both of Him and them. But the reason that Matthew and Mark related the objection as made concerning Christ to His disciples, was, that seeing the disciples ate with publicans and sinners, it was the rather objected to their Master as Him whom they followed and imitated; the meaning therefore is the same, vet so much the better conveyed, as while still keeping to the truth, it differs in certain words.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Ipse autem dominus in contrarium eorum sermonem convertit, ostendens non esse culpam cum peccatoribus conversari, sed etiam consonum misericordiae propriae; unde sequitur et respondens Iesus dixit ad illos: non egent medico qui sani sunt, sed qui male habent; in quo commonet eos communis infirmitatis, et de numero languentium eos esse ostendit; se vero medicum esse latenter subiungit non enim veni vocare iustos, sed peccatores.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But our Lord c refutes all their charges, showing, that so far from its being a fault to mix with sinners, it is but a part of His merciful design, as it follows, And Jesus answering said to them, They that are whole need not a physician; in which He reminds them of their common infirmities, and shows them that they are of the number of the sick, but adds, He is the Physician. It follows, I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius Nyssenus</b>: Quasi dicat: adeo peccatores non abominor, quod eorum tantum gratia veni, non ut maneant peccatores, sed ut convertantur, et boni fiant.

        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Cons. Evang</b>: Unde addit in poenitentiam, quod ad explanandam sententiam valet, ne quisquam peccatores ob hoc ipsum quod peccatores sunt, diligi arbitretur a Christo; cum et illa similitudo de aegrotis bene intimet quid velit Deus vocando peccatores, tamquam medicus aegrotos, ut ab iniquitate tamquam ab aegritudine salvi fiant.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Hence He adds, to repentance, which serves well to explain the passage, that no one should suppose that sinners, because they are sinners, are loved by Christ, since that similitude of the sick plainly suggests what our Lord meant by calling sinners, as a Physician, the sick, in order that from iniquity as from sickness they should be saved.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Sed quomodo dum iustitias dilexit, neque vidit David iustum derelictum, si iustus derelinquitur, peccator asciscitur? Nisi intelligas quod eos iustos dicit qui ex lege praesumant, et Evangelii gratiam non requirant. Nemo autem iustificatur ex lege, sed redimitur ex gratia. Non vocat ergo eos qui se iustos dicunt: usurpatores enim iustitiae non vocantur ad gratiam: nam si gratia est ex poenitentia, utique qui fastidit poenitentiam, abdicat gratiam.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; But how does God love righteousness, and David has never seen the righteous man forsaken, if the righteous are excluded, the sinner called; unless you understand that at He meant by the righteous those who boast of the law, and seek not the grace of the Gospel. Now no one is justified by the law, but redeemed by grace. He therefore calls not those who call themselves righteous, for the claimers to righteousness are not called to grace. For if grace is from repentance, surely he who despises repentance renounces grace.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Peccatores autem vocat eos qui sua mala attendentes, nec per legem iustificari se posse putantes, Christi gratiae se poenitendo subiciunt.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; But He calls those sinners, who considering their guilt, and feeling that they cannot be justified by the law, submit themselves by repentance to the grace of Christ.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Ironice autem dicit illos iustos, sicut quando dicitur: ecce Adam factus est quasi unus nostrum. Quod autem nullus erat iustus super terram, ostendit Paulus dicens: omnes peccaverunt et egent gratia Dei.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Now He speaks of the righteous ironically, as when He says, Behold Adam is become as one of us. But that there was none righteous upon the earth St. Paul shows, saying, All have sinned, and need the grace of God.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius Nyssenus</b>: Vel dicit non egere sanos et iustos medico, scilicet Angelos; sed male habentes et peccatores, idest nos: quia morbum peccati incurrimus, qui in caelis non est.
          <td><b>GREG NYSS</b>. Or, He means that the sound and righteous need no physician, i.e. the angels, but the corrupt and sinners, i. e. ourselves do; since we catch the disease of sin, which is not in heaven.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Now by the election of Matthew is signified the faith of the Gentiles, who formerly gasped after worldly pleasures, but now refresh the body of Christ with zealous devotion.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Vel publicanus est qui principi mundi servit, et debitum carni reddit; cui gulosus reddit escas, adulter voluptatem, et alius aliud.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Or the publican is he who serves the prince of this world, and is debtor to the flesh, to which the glutton gives his food, the adulterer his pleasure, and another something else. But when the Lord saw him sitting at the receipt of custom, and not stirring himself to greater wickedness, He calls him that he might be snatched from the evil, and follow Jesus, and receive the Lord into the house of his soul.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Qui autem domicilio Christum recipit interno, maximis delectationibus exuberantium pascitur voluptatum. Itaque libenter dominus ingreditur, et in eius recumbit affectu. Sed rursus accendit invidia perfidorum, et futurae poenae species praefiguratur: epulantibus enim fidelibus in regno caelorum, perfidia ieiuna torquebitur.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; But he who receives Christ into his inner chamber, is fed with the greatest delights of overflowing pleasures. The Lord therefore willingly enters, and reposes in his affection; but again the envy of the treacherous is kindled, and the form of their future punishment is prefigured; for while all the faithful are feasting in the kingdom of heaven, the faithless will be cast out hungry.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Vel per hoc designatur Iudaeorum invidia, quae de gentium salute torquetur.

Et ideo, qui animo ieiunabant, murmurabant.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; At the same time also is shown the difference between those who are zealous for the law and those who are for grace, that they who follow the law shall suffer eternal hunger of soul, while they who have received the word into the inmost soul, refreshed with abundance of heavenly meat and drink, can neither hunger nor thirst. And so they who fasted in soul murmured.

Quasi dicant: comeditis cum publicanis et peccatoribus, cum iubeat lex immundo non communicare; sed in excusationem praevaricationis vobis accedit misericordia. Cur ergo non ieiunatis, ut mos est secundum legem volentibus vivere? Sed sancti quidem idcirco ieiunant ut corpus affligentes, quietent passiones ipsius; sed Christus non egebat ieiunio ad perfectionem virtutis, cum tamquam Deus absolutus esset a quolibet vinculo passionis; sed nec eius comitiva ieiunio egebat, sed particeps gratiae eius sine ieiunio decorata virtuose conversabatur. Quod si Christus quadraginta diebus ieiunaverat, non hoc fuit ut in se passionem mortificaret, sed ut normam abstinentiae ostendat carnalibus.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>: As soon as they have received the first answer from Christ, they proceed from one thing to another, with the intent to show that the holy disciples, and Jesus Himself with them, cared very little for the law. Hence it follows, <i>Why do the disciples of John fast, but you eat?</i> As if they said, You eat with publicans and sinners, whereas the law forbids to have any fellowship with the unclean, but compassion comes in as an excuse for your transgression; why then do you not fast, as they are wont to do who ho wish to live according to the law? But holy men indeed fast, that by the mortification of their body they may quell its passions. Christ needed not fasting for the perfecting of virtue, since as God He was free from every yoke of passion. Nor again did His companions need fasting, but being made partakers of His grace without fasting they were ere strengthened in all holy and godly living. For when Christ fasted for forty days, it was not to mortify His passions, but to manifest to carnal men the rule of abstinence.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. Now Luke evidently relates that this was spoken not by men of themselves, but by others concerning them. How then does Matthew say, Then came to him the disciple of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast; unless that they themselves also came, and were all eager, as far as they were able, to put the question to Him?

          <td><b>AUG</b>. Now there are two fasts, one is in tribulation, to propitiate God for our sins; another in joy, when as carnal things delight us less, we feed the more on things spiritual.

And first of the fast of tribulation; for it follows, And he said to them, Can you make the children of the bridegroom fast when the bridegroom is with them?

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; For the showing forth of our Savior in this world was nothing else but a great festival, spiritually uniting our nature to Him as His bride, that she who was formerly barren might become fruitful.

Or else, The gift of the Holy Spirit being received, there is a kind of fast, which is of joy, which they who are already renewed to a spiritual life most seasonably celebrate. Before they receive this gift, He says they are as old garments, to which a new piece of cloth is most unsuitably sewed on, i.e. any part of the doctrine which relates to the soberness of the new life; for if this takes place, the very doctrine itself also is in a measure divided, for it teaches a general fast not from pleasant food only, but from all delight in temporal pleasures, the part of which that appertains to food He said ought not to be given to men still devoted to their old habits, for therein seems to be a rent, and it agrees not with the old. He says also, that they are like to old skins, as it follows, And no one puts wine into old skins.

But they were new skins at that time, when after the ascension of the Lord they received the Holy Spirit, when from desire of His consolation they were renewed by prayer and hope. Hence it follows, But the new wine must be put into new bottles, and both are preserved.

          <td><b>GREG NYSS</b>. For wine newly drawn forth, evaporates on account of the natural heat in the liquor, throwing off from itself the scum by natural action. Such wine is the new covenant, which the old skins because of their unbelief contain not, and are therefore burst by the excellence of the doctrine, and cause the grace of the Spirit to flow in vain; because into an evil soul wisdom will not enter.

Sequitur et nemo bibens vetus, statim vult novum; dicit enim: vetus melius est: quia Iudaeis vitae veteris saliva imbutis, novae gratiae praecepta sordebant: quia maiorum traditionibus commaculati dulcedinem spiritualium verborum percipere non valebant.

They also who wish to mix the precepts of the Law with the Gospel, as the Galatians did, put new wine into old bottles. It follows, No man also having drank old wine straightway desires new, for he said, the old is better. For the Jews, imbued with the taste of their old life, despised the precepts of the new grace, and being defiled with the traditions of their ancestors, were not able to perceive the sweetness of spiritual words.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; But herein is a great mystery. For the field is the whole world, the corn is the abundant harvest of the saints in the seed of the human race, the ears of corn are the fruits of the Church, which the Apostles shaking off by their works fed upon, nourishing themselves with our increase, and by their mighty miracles, as it were out of the bodily husks, plucking forth the fruits of the mind to the light of faith.

        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Sed hoc putabant Iudaei sabbato non licere; Christus autem novae gratiae munere designabat otium legis opus gratiae: mire tamen secundo primum, non primo secundum sabbatum dixit: quia sabbatum illud ex lege solutum est quod erat primum; et hoc primum factum est quod secundo constitutum est. Sabbatum igitur dicitur secundum iuxta numerum, primum iuxta operationis gratiam: melius est enim sabbatum quo impunitas datur, quam quo poena praescribitur. Aut hoc forte primum est in praedestinatione consilii, et secundum in sanctione decreti. Deinde quod David cum sociis fugit, hic praefiguratus in lege Christus est, qui cum apostolis principem mundi lateret. Quomodo autem ille observator legis atque defensor panes et ipse manducavit, et dedit his qui secum erant, quos non licebat manducare nisi sacerdotibus; nisi ut per illam demonstraret figuram, sacerdotalem cibum ad usum transire populorum; sive quod omnes vitam sacerdotalem debemus imitari; sive quod omnes filii Ecclesiae sacerdotes sunt? Ungimur enim in sacerdotium sanctum, offerentes nosmetipsos Deo hostias spirituales. Si autem sabbatum propter homines factum est; utilitas autem hominum postulabat esurientem hominem, qui diu fuerit terrae fructibus abdicatus, veteris famis vitare ieiunia: non utique lex solvitur, sed impletur.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Now the Jews thought this unlawful on the Sabbath, but Christ by the gift of new grace represented hereby the rest of the law, the work of grace. Wonderfully has He called it the second-first sabbath, not the first-second, because that was loosed from the law which was first, and this is made first which was ordained second. It is therefore called the second sabbath according to number, the first according to the grace of the wolf. For that sabbath is better where there is no penalty, than that where there is a penalty prescribed. Or this perhaps was first in the foreknowledge of wisdom, and second in the sanction of the ordinance. Now in David escaping with his companions, there was a foreshadowing of Christ in the law, who with His Apostles escaped the prince of the world. But how was it that the Observer and Defender of the law Himself both eat the bread, and gave it to those that were with Him, which no one was allowed to eat but the priests, except that He might show by that figure that the priests’ bread was to come over to the use of the people, or that we ought to imitate the priests’ life, or that all the children of the Church are priests, for we are anointed into a holy priesthood, offering ourselves a spiritual sacrifice to God. But if the sabbath was made for men, and the benefit of men required that a man when hungry (having been long without the fruits of the earth) should forsake the abstinence of the old fast, the law is surely not broken but fulfilled.

Haec omnia sufficiunt ad animam erigendam: tunc non vexat inanis gloria, non acedia, non concitatio occupat; non sic ignis ferri sequestrat rubiginem, velut nocturna oratio aeruginem peccatorum. Quem de die solis aestus perussit, nocte refrigeratur. Quemlibet rorem superant nocturnae lacrymae; et contra concupiscentiam valent, et quemlibet timorem. Si vero praedicto rore non foveatur, homo arescit sub die. Quapropter licet non multum ores, semel ora vigilando, et sufficit: ostende quod non solum ad corpus nox pertinet, sed etiam ad animam.

But if you look upon the heaven itself studded with stars as with unnumbered eyes, if you think that they who wanton and do unjustly in day time are then nothing different from the dead, you will loathe all human undertakings. All these things serve to raise the mind. Vain-glory then disquiets not, no tumult of passion has the mastery; fire does not so destroy the rust of iron as nightly prayer the blight of sin. He whom the heat of the sun has fevered by day is refreshed by tile dew; nightly tears are better than any dew, and are proof against desire and fear. But if a man is not cherished by the dew we speak of, he withers in the day. Wherefore although you pray not much at night, pray once with watching, and it is enough; show that the night belongs not only to the body, but to the soul.

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; But mark the great carefulness of the. Evangelist. He not only says that the holy Apostles were chosen, but he enumerates them by name, that no one should dare to insert any others in the catalogue; Simon, whom he also called Peter, and Andrew his brother.

          <td><b>Beda</b>: Non modo primum eum cognominavit, sed longe prius; cum ab Andrea adducto dicitur: tu vocaberis Cephas, quod interpretatur Petrus. Sed volens Lucas nomina apostolorum enumerare, cum necesse haberet Petrum dicere, breviter voluit innuere quod non hoc antea cognominaretur, sed ita dominus cognominaverit.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; He not only surnamed Peter first, but long before this, when he was brought by Andrew, it is said, You shall be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, a stone. But Luke, wishing to mention the names of the disciples, since it was necessary to call him Peter, wished shortly to imply that this was not his name before, but the Lord had given it to him.

Matthaeus vero ex his qui prius census exigebant vocatus est, de quo subdit Matthaeum et Thomam.
          <td><b>EUSEBIUS</b>. The two next are James and John, as it follows, James and John, both indeed sons of Zebedee, who were also fishermen. After them he mentions Philip and Bartholomew. John says Philip was of Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter. Bartholomew was a simple man, devoid of all worldly knowledge and guile. But Matthew was called from those who used to collect taxes; concerning whom he adds Matthew and Thomas.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. With respect to the name of Judas the brother of James, Luke seems to differ from Matthew, who calls him Thaddaeus. But what prevented a man from being called by two or three names? Judas the traitor is chosen, not unwittingly but knowingly, for Christ had indeed taken to Himself the weakness of man, and therefore refused not even this share of human infirmity. He was willing to be betrayed by His own Apostle, that you when betrayed by your friend may bear calmly your mistaken judgment, your kindness thrown away.

Neque enim alienam virtutem accipiebat Christus: sed cum naturaliter esset Deus, propriam virtutem super infirmos emittens sanabat omnes.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; But after that the High Priest had made publicly known His choice of Apostles, He did many and great miracles, that the Jews and Gentiles who had assembled might know that these were ere invested by Christ with the dignity of the Apostleship, and that He Himself was not as another man, but rather was God, as being the Incarnate Word. Hence it follows, And, the whole multitude sought to touch him, for there went virtue out of him. For Christ did not receive virtue from others, but since He was as by nature God oaf, sending out His own virtue upon the sick, He healed them all.

The touch of the Savior then is the work of salvation, whom to touch is to believe on Him, to be touched is to be healed by His precious gifts.

        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Quatuor autem tantum beatitudines Lucas posuit, octo vero Matthaeus; sed in istis octo illae sunt quatuor, et in istis quatuor illae octo. Hic enim quatuor velut virtutes amplexus est cardinales; ille in illis octo mysticum ordinem reseravit: sicut enim spei nostrae octava perfectio est, ita octava summa virtutum est. Primam autem beatitudinem paupertatis uterque Evangelista posuit: ordine enim prima est, et parens quaedam virtutum: quia qui contempserit saecularia, ipse merebitur sempiterna: nec potest quisquam meritum regni caelestis adipisci qui a mundi cupiditate pressus emergendi non habet facultatem; unde sequitur dicebat: beati pauperes.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Now Luke mentions only four blessings, but Matthew eight; but in those eight are contained these four, and in these four those eight. For the one has embraced as it were the four cardinal virtues, the other has revealed in those eight the mystical number. For as the eighth is the accomplishment of our hope, so is the eighth also the completion of the virtues. But each Evangelist has placed the blessings of poverty first, for it is the first in order, and the purest, as it were, of the virtues; for he who has despised the world shall reap an eternal reward. Now can any one obtain the reward of the heavenly kingdom who, overcome by the desires of the world, has no power of escape from them? Hence it follows, He said, Blessed are the poor.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: In Evangelio quidem quod est secundum Matthaeum, beatos fieri dixit pauperes spiritu, ut intelligamus esse pauperem spiritu, habentem intellectum modestum, et quodammodo remissum: unde dicit salvator: discite a me, quia mitis sum et humilis corde. Hic autem beatos asserit pauperes, non addito spiritu, pauperes appellans divitias contemnentes: decebat enim ut cum praenuntiaturi essent salutiferi Evangelii dogma, mentem non gererent cupidam, sed promptum affectum haberent erga maiora.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; In the Gospel according to St. Matthew it is said, Blessed are the poor in spirit, that we should understand the poor in spirit to be one of a modest and somewhat depressed mind. Hence our Savior says, Learn from me, for I am meek and lowly of heart. But Luke says, Blessed are the poor, without the addition of spirit, calling those poor who despise riches. For it became those who were to preach the doctrines of the saving Gospel to have no covetousness, but their affections set upon higher things.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Basilius</b>: Non autem omnis quem paupertas premit, beatus est, sed qui Christi praeceptum mundanis praetulerit opibus. Plures enim pauperes sunt in substantia, avarissimi tamen secundum affectum; quos non salvat paupertas, sed affectus damnat. Nihil enim involuntarium beatificabile est, eo quod omnis virtus libero designatur arbitrio. Beatus ergo pauper, quasi Christi discipulus, qui pro nobis paupertatem sustinuit: nam ipse dominus quodlibet opus implevit quod ad beatitudinem ducit, se praebens exemplar discentibus.
          <td><b>BASIL</b>; But not every one oppressed with poverty is blessed, but he who has preferred the commandment of Christ to worldly riches. For many are poor in their possessions, yet most covetous in their disposition; these poverty does not save, but their affections condemn. For nothing involuntary deserves a blessing, because all virtue is characterized by the freedom of the will. Blessed then is the poor man as being the disciple of Christ, Who endured poverty for us. For the Lord Himself has fulfilled every work which leads to happiness, leaving Himself an example for us to follow.

          <td><b>EUSEBIUS</b>. But when the celestial kingdom is considered in the many gradations of its blessings, the first step in the scale belongs to those who by divine instinct embrace poverty. Such did He make those who first became His disciples; therefore He says in their person, For yours is the kingdom of heaven, as pointedly addressing Himself to those present, upon whom also He lifted up His eyes.

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; After having commanded them to embrace poverty, He then crowns with honor those things which follow from poverty. It is the lot of those who embrace poverty to be in want of the necessaries of life, and scarcely to be able to get food.

          <td><b>GREG NAZ</b>. But in a deeper sense, as they who partake of bodily food vary their appetites according to the nature of the things to be eaten; so also in the food of the soul, by some indeed that is desired which depends upon the opinion of men, by others, that which is essentially and of its own nature good. Hence, according to Matthew, men are blessed who account righteousness in the place of food and drink; by righteousness I mean not a particular but an universal virtue, which he who hungers after is said to be blessed.

          <td><b>GREG NYSS</b>. For to those who hunger and thirst after righteousness He promises abundance of the things they desire. For none of the pleasures which are sought in this life can satisfy those who pursue them. But the pursuit of virtue alone is followed by that reward, which implants a joy in the soul that never fails.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Consequitur autem inopiam non solum defectus rerum ad delectationes facientium, sed etiam depressus vultus propter moestitiam; unde sequitur beati qui nunc fletis. Beatificat flentes, non eos qui simpliciter ab oculis lacrymas emittunt: commune enim est hoc tam fidelibus quam infidelibus, si quid tristium accidat.

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; But poverty is followed not only by a want of those things which bring delight, but also by a dejected look, because of sorrow. Hence it follows, Blessed are you that weep. He blesses those who weep, not those who merely drop tears from their eyes, (for this is common to the believing and unbelieving, when sorrow befalls them,) but rather He calls those blessed, who shun a careless life, mixed up with sin, and devoted to carnal pleasures, and refuse enjoyments almost weeping from their hatred of all worldly things.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Magnum quid vero secundum Deum tristitia est, et impetrat poenitentiam in salutem; unde Paulus, cum non haberet suos defectus flere, pro alienis lugebat. Talis luctus est alacritatis materia: unde sequitur quia ridebitis. Etenim si nihil prosumus his pro quibus flemus, tamen proficimus nobismetipsis: nam qui sic aliena deflet, multo magis non praeteribit inflebiliter sua delicta; magis autem nec facile labetur in scelus. Non dissolvamur in hac brevi vita, ne suspiremus in infinita: non quaeramus delicias, a quibus manat luctus et dolor nimius; sed tristemur tristitia, quae germinat veniam. Est etiam dominum saepius reperire lugentem, ridentem nequaquam.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But godly sorrow is a great thing, and it works repentance to salvation. Hence St. Paul when he had no failings of his own to weep for, mourned for those of others. Such grief is the source of gladness, as it follows, For you shall laugh. For if we do no good to those for whom we weep, we do good to ourselves. For he who thus weeps for the sins of others, will not let his own go unwept for; but the rather he will not easily fall into sin. Let us not be ever relaxing ourselves in this short life, lest we sigh in that which is eternal. Let us not seek delights from which flow lamentation, and much sorrow, but let us be saddened with sorrow which brings forth pardon. We often find the Lord sorrowing, never laughing.

Sequitur et cum separaverint vos. Separent, et a synagoga expellant: Christus invenit et confirmat. Sequitur et exprobraverint. Exprobrent nomen crucifixi: ipse commortuos sibi conresuscitat, et consedere facit in caelestibus. Sequitur et eiecerint nomen vestrum tamquam malum: ubi nomen Christianorum significat, quod a gentilibus Iudaeisque saepissime quantum ad ipsos memoriae abrasum, et ab hominibus est abiectum, nulla existente causa odii, nisi propter filium hominis; qui scilicet credentes nomen Christi, suum cognomen facere voluerunt.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; He then who on account of the riches of the inheritance of Christ, for the bread of eternal life, for the hope of heavenly joys, desires to suffer weeping, hunger, and poverty, is blessed. But much more blessed is he who does not shrink to maintain these virtues in adversity. Hence it follows, Blessed are you when men shall hate you. For although men hate, with their wicked hearts they can not injure the heart that is beloved by Christ, It follows, And when they shall separate you. Let them separate and expel you from the synagogue. Christ finds you out, and strengthens you. It follows; And shall reproach you. Let them reproach the name of the Crucified, He Himself raises together with Him those that have died with Him, and makes them sit in heavenly places. It follows, And cast out your name as evil. Here he means the name of Christian, which by Jews and Gentiles as far as they were able was frequently erased from the memory, and cast out by men, when there was as no cause for hatred, but the Son of man; for in truth they who believed on the name of Christ, wished to be called after His name. Therefore He teaches that they are to be persecuted by men, but are to be blessed beyond men. As it follows, Rejoice you in that day, and weep for joy, for behold your reward is great in heaven.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Great and little are measured by the dignity of the speaker. Let us inquire then who promised the great reward. If indeed a prophet or an apostle, little had been in his estimation great; but now it is the Lord in whose hands are eternal treasures and riches surpassing man’s conception, who has promised great reward.

          <td><b>BASIL</b>; Again, great has sometimes a positive signification, as the heaven is great, and the earth is great; but sometimes it has relation to something else, as a great ox or great horse, on comparing two things of like nature. I think then that great reward will be laid up for those who suffer reproach for Christ’s sake, not as in comparison with those things in our power, but as being in itself great because given by God.

Beati qui esuritis: habes iustitiam: qui enim esurienti compatitur, compatiendo largitur, largiendo fit iustus, quia iustitia eius manet in aeternum. Beati qui nunc fletis; habes prudentiam, cuius est flere quotidiana, et ea quae aeterna sunt quaerere. Beati eritis cum vos oderint homines: habes fortitudinem; sed eam quae non odium meretur ex crimine, sed persecutionem patiatur ex fide. Sic enim ad passionis pervenitur coronam, si gratiam hominum negligas, divinam sequaris. Ergo temperantia cordis habet munditiam, iustitia misericordiam, pacem prudentia, mansuetudinem fortitudo. Connexae sibi sunt et concatenatae virtutes, ut qui unam habet, plures habere videatur: et sanctis una competit virtus; sed eius quae fuerit uberior, uberius est praemium. Quanta hospitalitas in Abraham, quanta humilitas? Sed quia fide praestitit, fidei prae ceteris meruit principatum. Ergo unicuique plura praemia, quia plurima incentiva virtutum; sed quod in aliquo merito copiosius, hoc etiam in praemio redundantius.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; In that He says, Blessed are the poor, you have temperance; which abstains from sin, tramples upon the world, seeks not vain delights. In Blessed are they that hunger you have righteousness; for he who hungers suffers together with the hungry, and by suffering together with him gives to him, by giving becomes righteous, and his righteousness abides for ever. In Blessed are they that weep now, you have prudence; which is to weep for the things of time, and to seek those which are eternal. In Blessed are you when men hate you, you have fortitude; not that which deserves hatred for crime, but which suffers persecution for faith. For so you wilt attain to the crown of suffering if you slightest the favor of men, and seek that which is from God. Temperance therefore brings with it a pure heart; righteousness, mercy; prudence, peace; fortitude, meekness. The virtues are so joined and linked to one another, that he who has one seems to have many; and the Saints have each one especial virtue, but the more abundant virtue has the richer reward. What hospitality in Abraham, what hat humility, but because he excelled in faith, he gained the preeminence above all others. To every one there are many rewards because many incentives to virtue, but that which is most abundant in a good action, has the most exceeding reward.

Nam ut ille pauper laudabilior est qui prompto largitur affectu, ita criminosior dives est qui de eo referre gratiam Deo debuit quod accepit, nec censum ad communem usum datum sine usu abscondere. Non census igitur, sed affectus in crimine est. Et quamquam nulla poena gravior sit quam successorum profutura compendiis anxio timore servare, tamen quoniam avaritiae desideria congerendi quadam voluptate pascuntur, qui consolationem vitae praesentis habuerunt, remunerationem perpetuam perdiderunt. Possumus tamen hic divitem intelligere populum Iudaeorum, vel haereticos, vel certe Pharisaeos, qui ubertate verborum, et quodam ambitiosae facundiae patrimonio delectati, simplicitatem verae fidei supergressi, thesauros inutiles condiderunt. Sequitur vae vobis qui saturati estis, quia esurietis.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; But although in the abundance of wealth many are the allurements to crime, yet many also are the incitements to virtue. Although virtue requires no support, and the offering of the poor man is more commendable than the liberality of the rich, still it is not those who possess riches, but those who know not how to use them, that are condemned by the authority of the heavenly sentence. For as that poor man is more praiseworthy who gives without grudging, so is the rich man more guilty, who ought to return thanks for what he has received, and not to hide without using it the sum which was given him for the common good. It is not therefore the money, but the heart of the possessor which is in fault. And though there be no heavier punishment than to be preserving with anxious fear what is to serve for the advantage of successors, yet since the covetous desires are fed by a certain pleasure of amassing, they who have had their consolation in the present life, have lost an eternal reward. We may here however understand by the rich man the Jewish people, or the heretics, or at least the Pharisees, who, rejoicing in an abundance of words, and a kind of hereditary pride of eloquence, have overstepped the simplicity of true faith, and gained to themselves useless treasures.

          <td><b>Basilius</b>: Quod autem necessaria sit abstinentiae ratio, palam est ex eo quod apostolus eam inter fructus spiritus enumeravit. Subiectio enim corporis per nihil aliud sic obtinetur, sicut per abstinentiam; qua sicut quodam freno decet compescere iuventutis fervorem. Est igitur abstinentia interemptio criminis, amotio passionum, vitae spiritualis initium, obtundens in se illecebrarum aculeum. Ne autem coincidentia fiat cum inimicis Dei, decet accipi quodlibet cum exigit tempus, ad ostendendum quod mundis omnia munda; procedendo quidem ad necessaria vitae, abstinendo autem omnino ab his quae faciunt ad voluptatem. Attamen nec eamdem horam sibi cunctos sancire possibile, nec modum, nec mensuram. Sit autem communis intentio non expectare repletionem; replere namque ventrem, ipsum quoque corpus inutile facit erga proprias operationes, somnolentum, et ad nocumenta dispositum.
          <td><b>BASIL</b>; Now it is plain that the rule of abstinence is necessary, because the Apostle mentions it among the fruits of the Spirit. For the subjection of the body is by nothing so obtained as by abstinence, whereby, as it were a bridle, it becomes us to keep in check the fervor of youth. Abstinence then is the putting to death of sin, the extirpation of passions, the beginning of the spiritual life, blunting in itself the sting of temptations. But lest there should be any agreement with the enemies of God, we must accept every thing as the occasion requires, to show, that to the pure all things are pure, by coming indeed to the necessaries of life, but abstaining altogether from those which conduce to pleasure. But since it is not possible that all should keep the same hours, or the same manner, or the same proportion, still let there be one purpose, never to wait to be filled, for fullness of stomach makes the body itself also unfit for its proper functions, sleepy, and inclined to what is hurtful.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; In another way. If those are happy who always hunger after the works of righteousness, they on the other hand are counted to be unhappy, who, pleasing themselves in their own desires, suffer no hunger after the true good. It follows, Woe to you who laugh, &amp;c.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Basilius</b>: Cum dominus ridentes nunc arguat, palam est quod numquam erit fideli tempus risus; et praecipue in tanta multitudine eorum qui in peccato moriuntur, pro quibus oportet lugere. Superfluus autem risus est immoderantiae signum, et effrenis animae motus; sed usque ad vultus iucunditatem exprimere passionem animae non dedecet.
          <td><b>BASIL</b>; Whereas the Lord reproves those who laugh now, it is plain that there will never be a house of laughter to the faithful, especially since there is so great a multitude of those who die in sin for whom we must mourn.

Perniciosum enim quid est inanis gloria: et inde sumit ortum iniquitas atque desperatio, et mater malorum avaritia. Quod si viam quaeris divertendi ab hoc, dirigas aspectum semper ad Deum, et esto contentus ea quae apud eum est gloria: nam si in qualibet facultate doctiores eligere oportet in arbitros, quomodo virtutis experimentum pluribus credis, non autem illi qui prae omnibus eam novit, et dare et coronare potest? A quo si gloriam cupis, vita laudem humanam: de nullo enim alio magis consuevimus admirari quam de respuente gloriam. Quod si nos, multo magis dominus omnium.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. What is said here is not opposed to what our Lord says elsewhere, Let your light shine before men; that is, that we should be eager to do good for the glory of God, not our own. For vain-glory is a baneful thing, and from hence springs iniquity, and despair, and avarice, the mother of evil. But if you seek to turn away from this, ever raise your eyes to God, and be content with that glory which is from Him. For if in all things we must choose the more learned for judges, how do you trust to the many the decision of virtue, and not rather to Him, who before all others know it, and can give and reward it, whose glory therefore if you desire, avoid the praise of men. For no one more excites our admiration than he who rejects glory. And if we do this, much more does the God of all. Be mindful then, that the glory of men quickly fails, seeing in the course of time it is past into oblivion. It follows, For so did their fathers to the false prophets.

            <p><b>CHRYS</b> For they who pierce their own souls deserve tears and weeping, not curses. For nothing is more hateful than a cursing heart, or more foul than a tongue which utters curses. O man, spit not forth the poison of asps, nor be turned into a beast. Your mouth was given you not to bite with, but to heal the wounds of others. But he commands us to count our enemies in the ram: of our friends, not only in a general way, but as our particular friends for whom we are accustomed to pray; as it follows, Pray for them which persecute you. But many on the contrary falling down, and striking their faces upon the ground, and stretching forth their hands, pray God not for their sins, but against their enemies, which is nothing else but piercing their own selves. When you pray to Him that He would hear you cursing your enemies, who has forbidden you to pray against your enemies, how is it possible for you to be heard, since you art calling Him to hear you by striking an enemy in the king’s presence, not with the hand indeed, but with your words. What are you doing, O man? you stand to obtain pardon of your sins, and you fill your mouth with bitterness. It is a time of forgiveness, prayer, and mourning, not of rage.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; But the question is fairly raised, how it is that in the prophets are to be found many curses against their enemies.

Tell me, cost you then possess by labor? but still if you work, do you work for this, that you should blame another? For a single loaf and coat cost you call a man covetous? You give nothing, make then no reproaches. Why do you neither take pity yourself, and dissuades those who would? If we spend upon all indifferently, we shall always have compassion: for because Abraham entertains all, he also entertains angels. For if a man is a homicide and a robber, does he not, think you, deserve to have bread? Let us not then be severe censors of others, lest we too be strictly judged.

Anima tua non possidetur a te, et quo pacto tuae reputabuntur opes? Vult autem Deus tua fore quae tibi pro fratribus credita sunt; fient autem tua, si pro aliis dispensaveris; si vero tibi affluenter expenderis, quae sunt tua iam facta sunt aliena. Sed propter nefandam opum cupidinem homines in curiis conrixantur; contra quod Christus ait et qui aufert quae tua sunt, ne repetas.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Every thing we have we receive from God. But when we speak of “mine and shine,” they are only bare words. For if you assert a house to be yours, you have uttered an expression which wants the substance of reality. For both the air, the soil, and the moisture, are the Creator’s. You again are he who has built the house; but although the use is shine, it is doubtful, not only because of death, but also on account of the issues of things. Your soul is not your own possession, and will be reckoned to you in like manner as all your goods. God wishes those things to be yours which are entrusted to you for your brethren, and they will be shine if you have dispensed them for others. But if you have spent richly upon yourself what things are yours, they are now become another’s. But through a wicked desire of wealth men strive together in a state contrary to Christ’s words, And of him that takes away your goods, ask them not again.

Et si quidem dixisset: ut sitis homines, diligite bestias, esset mandatum difficile; si vero homines diligere iussit, ad quod naturalis monitio est, quam difficultatem res continet, quam leones et lupi servant, in quibus naturalis cognatio amicitiam cogit? Ostenditur igitur quod Christus nihil statuit nostram transcendens naturam; sed quod dudum inseruit conscientiae nostrae, docet; ut propria voluntas pro lege sit tibi; ut si vis bene tibi, bene facias alii; si vis ut alius tui misereatur, proximi miserearis.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Now we have a natural law implanted in us, by which we distinguish between what is virtue, and what is vice. Hence it follows, And as you would that men should do to you, do you also to them. He does not say, Whatever you would not that men should do to you, do not you. For since there are two ways which lead to virtue, namely abstaining from evil, and doing good, he names one, signifying by it the other also. And if indeed He had said, That you may be men, love the beasts, the command would be a difficult one. But if they are commanded to love men, which is a natural admonition, wherein lies the difficulty, since even the wolves and lions observe it, whom a natural relation compels to love one another. It is manifest then that Christ has ordained nothing surpassing our nature, but what He had long before implanted in our conscience, so that your own will is the law to you. And if you will have good done to you, you must do good to others; if you will that another should show mercy to you, you must show mercy to your neighbor.

Ne autem putares hyperbolice esse dictum, aestimans solum ad terrorem eis dici, adicit rationem, dicens et si diligitis eos qui vos diligunt, quae vobis est gratia? Plures quidem causae sunt quae dilectiones constituunt; dilectio vero spiritualis universas praecellit; nihil enim terrenum eam parit; non utilitas, non beneficium, non natura, non tempus, sed de caelo descendit. Quid autem miraris si non indiget beneficio ut consistat, quando nec ex casu malorum pervertitur? Pater quidem passus iniurias, rumpit foedus amoris; coniux post iurgia virum relinquit; filius si longaevum videat patrem, gravatur: at Paulus ibat ad lapidantes, benefacturus eis; Moyses lapidatur a Iudaeis, et orat pro eis. Veneremur itaque spirituales amicitias, quia sunt insolubiles. Unde arguens volentes pigrescere, subdit, nam et peccatores diligentes se diligunt; quasi dicat: quia volo vos his amplius aliquid possidere, non moneo solum amicos diligere, sed etiam inimicos. Benefacientibus etiam benefacere commune est omnibus. Ostendit autem se parum plus petere quam sit moris peccatorum, qui benefaciunt amicis; unde sequitur et si benefacitis his qui vobis benefaciunt, quae vobis est gratia? Siquidem et peccatores hoc faciunt.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. The Lord had said that we must love our enemies, but that you might not think this an exaggerated expression, regarding it solely as spoken to alarm them, he adds the reason, saying, For if you love them which love you, what thank have you? There are indeed several causes which produce love; but spiritual love exceeds them all. For nothing earthly engenders it, neither gain, nor kindness, nor nature, nor time, but it descends from heaven. But why wonder that it needs not kindness to excite it, when it is not even overcome of malice? A father indeed suffering wrong bursts the bands of love. A wife after a quarrel leaves her husband A son, if he sees his father come to a great age, is troubled. But Paul went to those who stoned him to do them good. Moses is stoned by the Jews, and prays for them. Let us then reverence spiritual love, for it is indissoluble. Reproving therefore those who were inclined to wax cold, he adds, For sinners even love those which love them. As if he said, Because I wish you to possess more than these, I do not advise you only to love your friends, but also your enemies. It is common to all to do good to those who do good to them. But he shows that he seeks something more than is the custom of sinners, who do good to their friends. Hence it follows, And if you do good to those who do good to you, what thank have you?

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; But he not only condemns as unprofitable the love and kindness of sinners, but also the lending. As it follows, And if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what thank have you? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again.

Sicut enim fornacem succensam aqua proiecta extinguit, sic iram ratio cum lenitate: quod enim est aqua igni, hoc est irae humilitas et mansuetudo.

But it is a mark of the greatest virtue when we embrace with kindness those who wish to do us harm. Hence it follows, And do good. For as water, when cast upon a lighted furnace, extinguishes it, so also reason joined with gentleness.

Animalia temporis progressu nascuntur, adolescunt et pariunt; at fenus statim cum oritur parere incipit. Animalia quae citius pariunt, citius parere cessant: sed avarorum pecunia simul cum omni tempore adaugetur. Animalia ubi pariendi vim ad sobolem suam transtulerunt, ipsa parere cessant; at feneratorum pecuniae et novas pariunt, et veteres renovant. Nullus itaque mortiferam hanc bestiam attendet. Sed magna, inquis, o pauper, necessitas, et utilitas est ut mutuum sumam. Et quaenam haec est utilitas? Rursum veniet tibi paupertas, et eadem cum accessione necessitas. Meditare iam unde restituas. Unde tibi pecuniae intantum multiplicabuntur ut et sufficiant ad usus necessitatem, et ad restitutionem? Verum ais: quomodo igitur me enutriam nisi fenus accipiam? Mille sunt victus parandi solertiae. Manus habes, labora, servi, tandem mendica: omnia tibi tolerabiliora sunt quam pecuniam ad usuram sumere. Ceterum dives ait: quale illud est mutuum cui nulla retributionis spes adiuncta est? Considera vim dicti, et legislatoris admiraberis humanitatem. Cum pauperi dare voles propter dominum, idem et donum est et mutuum: donum quidem, quia non speras receptionem; mutuum vero, propter domini magnificentiam, qui paucis per pauperem acceptis, magna pro ipsis reddet; unde sequitur et erit merces vestra multa. Non vis universorum dominum obnoxium tibi ipsi habere ad persolvendum?

          <td><b>BASIL</b>; Now this mode of avarice is rightly called in the Greek, from producing, because of the fruitfulness of the evil. Animals in course of time grow up and produce, but interest as soon as it is born begins to bring forth. Animals which bring forth most rapidly cease soonest from breeding, but the money of the avaricious goes on increasing with time. Animals when they transfer their bringing forth to their own young, themselves cease to breed, but the money of the covetous both produces an increase, and renews the capital. Touch not then the destructive monster. For what advantage that the poverty of today is escaped, if it falls upon us repeatedly, and is increased? Reflect then how can you restore yourself? Whence shall your money be so multiplied as that it will partly relieve your want, partly refresh your capital,, and besides bring forth interest? But you say, How shall I get my living? I answer, work, serve, last of all, beg; any thing is more tolerable than borrowing upon interest. But you say, what is that lending to which the hope of repayment is not attached? Consider the excellence of the words, and you wilt admire the mercifulness of the author. When you are about to give to a poor man from regard to divine charity, it is both a lending and a gift; a gift indeed, because no return is hoped for; lending, because of the beneficence of God, who restores it in its turn. Hence it follows, And great shall be your reward. Do you not wish the Almighty to be bound to restore to you? Or, should He make some rich citizen your security, do you accept him, but reject God standing as security for the poor?

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; The Lord added, that we must not readily judge others, lest when conscious of guilt yourself, you should be compelled to pass sentence upon another.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Matthaeum</b>: Non iudices praecedentes te, idest qui discipulus es magistrum, peccator innocentem; quos non oportet increpare, sed monere, et caritative corrigere: nec etiam iudicandum est in incertis et qualibuscumque, quae nec similitudinem habent peccati, aut quae non sunt gravia, sive prohibita.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Judge not your superior, that is, you a disciple must not judge your master; nor a sinner the innocent. You must not blame them, but advise and correct with love; neither must we pass judgment in doubtful and indifferent matters, which bear no resemblance to sin, or which are not serious or forbidden.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Sedat ergo hic pessimam passionem nostrarum conscientiarum, contemptus principium: quamvis enim deceat aliquos se circumspicere, et secundum Deum conversari; hoc non faciunt, sed examinant aliena. Et si videant aliquos infirmari, tamquam propriarum passionum obliti, faciunt hoc detractionis materiam.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; He here expresses that worst inclination of our thoughts or hearts, which is the first beginning and origin of a proud disdain. For although it becomes men to look into themselves and walk after God, this they do not, but look into the things of others, and while they forget their own passions, behold the infirmities of some, and make them a subject of reproach.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. You will not easily find any one, whether a father of a family or an inhabitant of the cloister, free from this error. But these are the wiles of the tempter. For he who severely sifts the fault of others, will never obtain acquittal for his own. Hence it follows And you shall not be judged. For as the merciful and meek man dispels the rage of sinners, so the harsh and cruel adds to his own crimes.

          <td><b>GREG NYSS</b>. Be not then rash to judge harshly of your servants, lest you suffer the like. For passing judgment calls down a heavier condemnation; as it follows, Condemn not, and you shall not be condemned. For he does not forbid judgment with pardon.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Now in a short sentence he concisely sums up all that he had enjoined with respect to our conduct towards our enemies, saying, Forgive, and you shall be forgiven, wherein he bids us forgive injuries, and show kindness, and our sins shall be forgiven us, and we shall receive eternal life.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. But he says, shall they give, because through the merits of those to whom they have given even a cup of cold water in the name of a disciple, shall they be thought worthy to receive a heavenly reward. It follows, For with the same measure that you mete withal it shall be measured to you again.

Ad quod dicimus, quod non dixit: in tanta mensura remetietur vobis, sed in eadem. Qui enim benefecit, bene fiet ei: quod est remetiri eadem mensura. Sed supereffluentem mensuram dicit, quia millies benefiet ei: sic et in iudicando: qui enim iudicat et deinde iudicatur, accipit eamdem mensuram; secundum vero quod ad plus diiudicabitur, quia sibi similem iudicavit, secundum hoc supereffluens est mensura.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. But some one will put the subtle question, “If the return is made over abundantly, how is it the same measure?” to which we answer, that He said not, “In just as great a measure shall it be measured to you again, but in the same measure.” “For he who has shown mercy, shall have mercy shown to him, and this is measuring again with the same measure; but our Lord spoke of the measure running over, because to such a one He will show mercy a thousand times. So also in judging; for he that judges and afterwards is judged receives the same measure. But as far as he was judged the more severely that he judged one like to himself, was the measure running over.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Hoc autem solvit apostolus dicens: qui parce seminat, hoc est modice et manu tenaci, parce et metet, hoc est non copiose; et qui seminat in benedictionibus, in benedictionibus et metet, hoc est, copiose. Si quis autem non habet, si non faciat, non delinquit: in eo enim quod habet acceptatur, non in eo quo caret.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; But the Apostle explains this when he says, He who sows sparingly, (that is, scantily, and with a niggardly hand,) shall also reap sparingly, (that is, not abundantly,) and he who sows blessings, shall reap also blessings, that is, bountifully. But if a man has not, and performs not, he is not guilty. For a man is accepted in that which he has, not in that which he has not.

Nonne ambo in foveam cadunt? Et si contingat aliquos hoc attingere ut aequalem virtutem docentium virtuti possideant, sistant in mensura docentium, et illorum sequantur vestigia; unde sequitur non est discipulus supra magistrum; perfectus autem omnis erit, scilicet discipulus, si sit sicut magister eius; unde et Paulus dicit: imitatores mei estote, sicut et ego Christi. Christo ergo non iudicante, cur tu iudicas? Neque enim venit iudicare mundum, sed misereri.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; The Lord added to what had gone before a very necessary parable, as it is said, And he spoke a parable to them, for His disciples were the future teachers of the world, and it therefore became them to know the way of a virtuous life, having their minds illuminated as it were by a divine brightness, that they should not be blind leaders of the blind. And then he adds, Can the blind lead the blind? But if any should chance to attain to an equal degree of virtue with their teachers, let them stand in the measure of their teachers, and follow their footsteps. Hence it follows, The disciple is not above his master. Hence also Paul says, Be you also followers of me, as I am of Christ. Since Christ therefore judged not, why judge you? for He came not to judge the world, but to show mercy.

Non est enim discipulus supra magistrum. Si igitur tu peccas, qui te magistrum et ductorem putas, ubi erit qui a te disciplinatur et ducitur? Perfectus enim erit discipulus, si sit sicut magister eius.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Or else, If you judge another, and in the very same way sin yourself, are not you like to the blind leading the blind? For how can you lead him to good when you also yourself commit sin? For the disciple is not above his master. If therefore you sin, who think yourself a master and guide, where will he be who is taught and led by you? For he will be the perfect disciple who is as his master.

Si etiam magister Christus, qui quasi Deus potuit suas ulcisci iniurias, maluit persecutores patiendo reddere mitiores, eamdem necesse est quod discipuli, qui puri homines sunt, regulam perfectionis sequantur.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Or the sense of this sentence depends upon the former, in which we are enjoined to give alms, and forgive injuries. If, says He, anger has blinded you against the violent, and avarice against the grasping, how can you with your corrupt heart cure his corruption? If even your Master Christ, who as God might revenge His injuries, chose rather by patience to render His persecutors more merciful, it is surely binding on His disciples, who are but men, to follow the same rule of perfection.

Or, He has added the words, Can the blind, lead the blind, in order that they, might not expect to receive from the Levites that measure of which He says, They shall give into your bosom, because they gave tithes to them. And these He calls blind, because they received not the Gospel, that the people might the rather now begin to hope for that reward through the disciples of the Lord, whom wishing to point out as His imitators, He added, The disciple is not above his master.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Inducit autem dominus et aliam parabolam de eodem, subdens quid autem vides festucam, idest modicum criminis, in oculo fratris tui, trabem autem quae in oculo tuo est, idest peccatum tuum maximum, non consideras?
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. But the Lord introduces another parable taken from the same figure, as follows, but why see you the mote (that is, the slight fault) which is in your brother’s eye, but the beam which is in your own eye (that is, your great sin) you regard not?

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Now this has reference to the previous parable, in which He forewarned them that the blind cannot be led by the blind, that is, the sinner corrected by the sinner.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. But these words are applicable to all, and especially to teachers, who while they punish the least sins of those who are put under them, leave their own unpunished. Wherefore the Lord calls them hypocrites, because to this end judge they the sins of others, that they themselves might seem just. Hence it follows, You hypocrite, first cast the beam out of your own eye, &amp;c.

          <td><b>BASIL</b>; In truth, self knowledge seems the most important of all. For not only the eye, looking at outward things, fails to exercise its sight upon itself, but our understanding also, though very quick in apprehending the sin of another, is slow to perceive its own defects.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; On the thorns of this world the fig cannot be found, which as being better in its second fruit, is well fitted to be a similitude of the resurrection. Either because, as you read, The fig trees have put forth their green figs, that is, the unripe and worthless fruit came first in the Synagogue. Or because our life is imperfect in the flesh, perfect in the resurrection, and therefore we ought to cast far from us worldly cares, which eat into the mind and scorch up the soul, that by diligent culture we may obtain the perfect fruits. This therefore has reference to the world and the resurrection, the next to the soul and the body, as it follows, Nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes. Either because no one living in sin obtains fruit to his soul, which like the grape nearest the ground is rotten, on the higher branches becomes ripe. Or because no one can escape the condemnations of the flesh, but he whom Christ has redeemed, Who as a grape hung on the tree.

          <td><b>Beda</b>: Vel spinas et rubum, saeculi curas et punctiones puto esse vitiorum; ficus vero et uvam, dulcedinem novae conversationis et fervorem dilectionis. Non autem de spinis ficus, neque uva de rubo colligitur: quia mens adhuc veteris hominis consuetudine depressa similare potest, sed fructus novi hominis ferre non potest. Sed sciendum, quod sicut ferax palmes sepi involutus recumbit, portansque fructum spina non suum usibus servat humanis; sic dicta vel acta malorum si quando prosunt bonis, non hoc ipsi faciunt mali, sed fit de illis Dei consilio.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Or, I think the thorns and bramble are the cares of the world and the prickings of sin, but the figs and the grapes are the sweetness of a new life and the warmth of love, but the fig is not gathered from the thorns nor the grape from the bramble, because the mind still debased by the habits of the old man may pretend to, but cannot bring forth the fruits of the new man. But we must know, that as the fruitful palm tree is enclosed and supported by a hedge, and the thorn bearing fruit not its own, preserves it for the use of man, so the words and acts of the wicked wherein they serve the good are not done by the wicked themselves, but by the wisdom of God working upon them.

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; But having shown that the good and the bad man may be discerned by their works as a tree by its fruits, he now sets forth the same thing by another figure, saying, A good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth that which is good, and the evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth that which is evil.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; The treasure of the heart is the same as the root of the tree.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. For it is a natural consequence when wickedness abounds within, that wicked words are breathed as far as the mouth; and therefore when you hear of a man uttering abominable things, do not suppose that there lies only so much wickedness in him as is expressed in his words, but believe the fountain to be more copious than the stream.

It might then easily be supposed that Luke has inserted the same discourse of our Lord, and yet has left out some sentences which Matthew has kept, and likewise put in others which Matthew has not; were it not that Matthew says the discourse was spoken by our Lord on the mountain, but Luke on the plain by our Lord standing. It is not however thought likely from this that these two discourses are separated by a long course of time, because both before and after both have related some things like or the same. It may however have happened that our Lord was at first on a higher part of the mountain with His disciples alone, and that then he descended with them from the mount, that is, from the summit of the mountain to the flat place, that is, to some level ground, which was on the side of the mountain, and was able to hold large multitudes, and that there He stood until the crowds were gathered together to Him, and afterwards when He sat down His disciples came nearer, and to them, and the rest of the multitude who were present, He held the same discourse.

For if the actual arrival is frequently said to be through the means of others, much more may the coming be by others. Not then without reason, (the centurion having gained access to our Lord through others,) did Matthew, wishing to spear; briefly, say that this man himself came to Christ, rather than those by whom he sent his message, for the more he believed the nearer he came.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Matthaeum</b>: Qualiter etiam Matthaeus dicit quod ipse dixit: non sum dignus ut intres sub tectum meum; Lucas autem hic dicit, quoniam rogat ut veniat? Sed mihi videtur quod Lucas significat nobis Iudaicas blanditias. Credibile enim est ut cum vellet abire centurio, retraheretur a Iudaeis blandientibus, et dicentibus, quia nos euntes ducemus eum: unde et eorum preces adulationibus plenae sunt; sequitur enim at illi cum venissent ad Iesum, rogabant eum sollicite, dicentes: quia dignus est ut hoc illi praestes: diligit enim gentem nostram, et synagogam ipse aedificavit nobis. Decebat quidem ipsos dicere, quoniam ipse volebat venire et supplicare; nos autem detinuimus, calamitatem videntes, et cadaver quod in domo iacebat, aut promere fidei eius immensitatem; sed nolebant propter invidiam fidem viri detegere; ne magnus aliquis esse videretur cui preces porriguntur. Quod autem Matthaeus significat ipsum Israelitam non esse, Lucas vero dicit quoniam aedificavit synagogam, non est contrarium; potuit enim et Iudaeus non esse, et synagogam construxisse.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>: How again does Matthew tell us that the centurion said, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, while Luke says here, that he beseeches Him that He would come. Now it seems to me that Luke sets before us the flatteries of the Jews. For we may believe that when the centurion wished to depart, the Jews drew him back, enticing him, saying, We will go and bring him. Hence also their prayers are full of flattery, for it follows, But when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying that he was worthy. Although it became them to have said, He himself was willing to come and supplicate You, but we detained him, seeing the affliction, and the body which was lying in the house, and so to have drawn out the greatness of his faith; but they would not for envy reveal the faith of the man, lest He should seem some great one to whom the prayers were addressed. But wherein Matthew represents the centurion to be not an Israelite, while Luke says, he has built us a synagogue, there is no contradiction, for he might not have been a Jew, and yet built a synagogue.

          <td><b>EUSEBIUS</b>. And the elders of the Jews indeed demand favors for a small sum spent in the service of the synagogue, but the Lord not for this, but a higher reason, manifested Himself, wishing in truth to beget a belief in all men by His own power, as it follows, Then Jesus went with them.

Centurio vero militari tumore deposito, reverentiam sumit, et ad fidem facilis, et ad honorificentiam promptus; unde sequitur et cum non longe esset a domo, misit ad eum centurio amicos, dicens: domine, noli vexari. Non enim hominis, sed Dei potestate coniecit dari a Christo hominibus sanitatem. Iudaei quidem dignitatem eius praetenderant; iste vero indignum se asseruit non solum beneficii, sed etiam susceptionis domini: non enim dignus sum ut sub tectum meum intres.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Which certainly He did not do, because He was unable to heal when absent, but that He might set them an example of imitating His humility. He would not go to the son of the nobleman, lest He should seem thereby to have respected his riches; He went immediately here, that He might not seem to have despised the low estate of a centurion’s servant. But the centurion laying aside his military pride puts on humility, being both willing to believe and eager to honor; as it follows, And when he was not far off, he sent to him, saying, Trouble not yourself: for I am not worthy your, &amp;c. For by the power not of man, but of God, he supposed that health was given to man. The Jews indeed alleged his worthiness; but he confessed himself unworthy not only of the benefit, but even of receiving the Lord under his roof; For I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; But Luke well says, that friends were sent by the centurion to meet our Lord, lest by his own coming he might seem both to embarrass our Lord, and to have called for a requital of good offices. Hence it follows, Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come to you, but say in a word and my servant shall be healed.

For the weakness of the flesh or the hostile powers were to be subdued both by the word of the Lord and the ministry of the angels. And to my servant, Do this, &amp;c.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Est autem hic notandum, quod hoc verbum fac imperium designat dictum servo.

Quia ergo in Christo considerabat excellentiam dominii, ob hoc ait dic verbo: nam et ego dico servo meo, et cetera. Christus autem non eum reprehendit, sed eius intentionem roboravit; unde sequitur quo audito Iesus miratus est.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. We must here remark, that this word, Fac, signifies a command given to a servant. So God when He wished to create man, said not to the Only-begotten, “Make man,” but, Let us make man, that by the form of unity in the words he might make manifest the equality of the agents. Because then the centurion considered in Christ the greatness of His dominion, therefore said He, say in a word. For I also say to my servant. But Christ blames him not, but confirmed his wishes, as it follows, When Jesus heard these things, he marveled.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>: But who had wrought this very faith in him, save He who marveled? But supposing another had done it, why should He marvel who fore knew it? Because then the Lord marvels, it signifies that we must marvel. For all such feelings when they are spoken of God, are the tokens not of a wonder-struck mind, but of a teaching master.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; And indeed if you read it thus, “In none in Israel have I found so great faith,” the meaning is simple and easy. But if according to the Greek, “Not even in Israel have I found so great faith,” faith of this kind is preferred even to that of the more elect, and those that see God.

Tales ergo pro his necesse est ut domino supplicent qui adhuc spiritu servitutis premuntur; nos autem, qui de gentibus credimus, non ipsi ad dominum venire possumus, quem in carne videre non valemus; sed ad eum accedere debemus per fidem. Seniores autem Iudaeorum mittere, hoc est summos Ecclesiae viros, qui nos ad dominum praecesserunt, suppliciter obsecrando patronos acquirere, qui nobis testimonium reddentes, quod Ecclesiam aedificare curemus, pro nostris peccatis intercedant. Pulchre autem dicitur quia Iesus non longe erat a domo, quia prope timentes eum salutare ipsius; et qui naturali lege recte utitur, quo bona quae novit operatur, eo illi qui bonus est appropiat.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; But the centurion, whose faith is preferred to Israel, represents the elect from the Gentiles, who as it were attended by their hundred soldiers, are exalted by their perfection of spiritual virtues. For the number hundred, which is transferred from the left to the right, is frequently put to signify the celestial life. These then must pray to the Lord for those who ho are still oppressed with fear, in the spirit of bondage. But we of the Gentiles who believe can not ourselves come to the Lord, whom we are unable to see in the flesh, but ought to approach by faith; we must send the elders of the Jews, that is, we must by our suppliant entreaties gain as patrons the greatest men of the Church, who have gone before us to the Lord, who bearing us witness that we have a care to build up the Church, may intercede for our sins. It is well said that Jesus was not far from the house, for his salvation is nigh to them that fear him, and he who rightly uses the law of nature, in that he does the things which he knows to be good, approaches nigh to Him who is good.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Non vult autem Iesum vexari centurio; quia quem Iudaeorum populus crucifixit, inviolatum ab iniuria manere desiderat populus nationum; et, quod ad mysterium spectat, vidit in pectora adhuc gentilium non esse penetrabilem Christum.

            <b>GREG NYSS</b>. Now the proof of the resurrection we learn not so much from the words as from the works of our Savior, who, beginning His miracles with the less wonderful, reconciled our faith to far greater. First indeed in the grievous sickness of the centurion’s servant, He verged upon the power of resurrection; afterwards with a higher power he led men to the belief in a resurrection, when He raised the widow’s son, who was carried out to be buried; as it is said, Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother.
            <p><b>TITUS BOST</b>. But some one will say of the centurion’s servant, that he was not going to die. That such an one might restrain his rash tongue, the Evangelist explains that the young man whom Christ came upon was already dead, the only son of a widow. For it follows, And she was a widow, and much people of the city was with her.
            <p><b>GREG NYSS</b>. He has told us the sum of misery in a few words. The mother was a widow, and had no further hope of baring children, she had no one upon whom she might look in the place of him that was dead. To him alone she had given suck, he alone made her home cheerful. All that is sweet and precious to a mother, was he alone to her.

          <td><b>Gregorius Nyssenus</b>: Qui dixit adolescentem, florentis significavit temporis horam, primam producentem lanuginem: qui paulo ante muliebris erat maternorum oculorum aspectui, iam aspirans ad tempus sponsalium, virga generis, successionis ramus, baculus senectutis.
          <td><b>GREG. NYSS</b>. When He said, Young man, He signified that he was in the flower of his age, just ripening into manhood, who but a little while before was the sight of his mothers eyes, just entering upon the time of marriage, the scion of her race, the branch of succession, the staff of her old age.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Titus</b>: Incunctanter autem erectus est cui sunt mandata directa: divina enim potestas est irrefragabilis: nulla mora, nulla orationum instantia; unde sequitur et resedit qui erat mortuus, et coepit loqui; et dedit illum matri suae. Indicia sunt haec verae resurrectionis: corpus enim exanime loqui non potest; nec reportasset mulier ad domum defunctum filium inanimatum.
          <td><b>TITUS BOST</b>. But straightway he arose to whom the command was made. For the Divine power is irresistible; there is no delay, no urgency of prayer, as it follows, And he that was dead sat up and began to speak, and he gave him to his mother. These are the signs of a true resurrection, for the lifeless body cannot speak, nor would the mother have carried back to her house her dead and lifeless son.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Pulchre autem Evangelista dominum prius misericordia motum esse super matre, ac sic filium resuscitare testatur, ut in uno nobis exemplum imitandae pietatis ostenderet, in altero fidem mirandae potestatis astrueret; unde sequitur accepit autem omnes timor, et magnificabant Deum, dicentes: quia propheta magnus surrexit in nobis, et quia Deus visitavit plebem suam.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; But well does the Evangelist testify that the Lord is first moved with compassion for the mother, and then raises her son, that in the one case He might set before us for our imitation an example of piety, in the other He might build up our belief in His wonderful power. Hence it follows, And there came a fear upon all, and they glorified God, &amp;c.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Hoc magnum fuit in populo insensibili et ingrato: post modicum enim nec prophetam, nec ad utilitatem populi procedere ipsum existimavit. Neminem autem habitantium Iudaeam hoc miraculum latuit; unde sequitur et exiit hic sermo in universam Iudaeam, et in omnem circa regionem.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; This was a great thing in an insensible and ungrateful people. For in a short time afterward they would neither esteem Him as a prophet, nor allow that He did aught for the public good. But none of those that dwelt in Judea were ignorant of this miracle, as it follows, And this rumor of him went forth throughout all Judea.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Idoneum autem est dicere, quod septem resurrectiones ante dominicam narrantur; quarum prima est filii Sareptanae, secunda filii Sunamitis, tertia quae facta est in reliquiis Elisei, quarta quae facta est in Naim, quinta filiae archisynagogi, sexta Lazari, septima in Christi passione, multa namque corpora sanctorum surrexerunt; octava est Christi, qui expers mortis remansit ulterius, in signum quod communis resurrectio, quae futura est in octava aetate, non tolletur morte, sed indissolubilis permanebit.
          <td><b>MAXIM</b>. But it is worthy of remark, that seven resurrections are related before our Lord’s, of which the first was that of the son of the widow of Sarepta, the second of the Shunamite’s son, the third which was caused by the remains of Elisha, the fourth which took place at Nain, as is here related, the fifth of the ruler of the Synagogue’s daughter, the sixth of Lazarus, the seventh at Christ’s passion, for many bodies of the saints arose. The eighth is that of Christ, who being free from death remained beyond for a sign that the general resurrection which is to come in the eighth age shall not be dissolved by death, but shall abide never to pass away.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Defunctus autem qui extra portam civitatis multis est intuentibus elatus, significat hominem lethali funere criminum soporatum, et animae mortem non cordis adhuc cubili tegentem, sed ad multorum notitiam per locutionis operisve indicium, quasi per civitatis ostia, propalantem. Portam enim civitatis puto aliquem de sensibus esse corporalibus: qui bene filius unicus matris suae fuisse perhibetur, quia una est ex multis personis collecta mater Ecclesia: viduam autem esse Ecclesiam, omnis anima quae se domini morte redemptam meminit, agnoscit.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; But the dead man who was carried without the gate of the city in the sight of many’ signifies a man rendered senseless by the deadening power of mortal sin, and no longer concealing his soul’s death within the folds of his heart, but proclaiming it to the knowledge of the world, through the evidence of words or deeds as through the gate of the city. For the gate of the city, I suppose, is some one of the bodily senses. And he is well said to be the only son of his mother, for there is one mother composed of many individuals, the Church, but every soul that remembers that it is redeemed by the death of the Lord, knows the Church to be a widow.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Hanc enim viduam populorum turba circumseptam plus video esse quam feminam, quae resurrectionem unici adolescentis filii a pompa funeris revocat ad vitam, quarum contemplatione lacrymarum, quae flere prohibetur eum cui resurrectio debebatur.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; For this widow surrounded by a great multitude of people seems to be more than the woman who was thought worthy by her tears to obtain the resurrection of her only son, because the Church recalls the younger people from the funeral procession to life by the contemplation of her tears, who is forbid to weep for him to whom resurrection was promised.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Vel Novati dogma confunditur, qui dum poenitentium mundationem evacuare conatur, matrem Ecclesiam de natorum suorum spirituali extinctione plorantem spe vitae reddendae negat consolari debere.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Or the dogma of Novatus is crushed who ho endeavoring to do away with the purifying of the penitent, denies that the mother Church, weeping for tile spiritual extinction of her sons, ought to be consoled by tile hope of their restoration to life.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Hic autem mortuus in loculo materialibus quatuor ad sepulchrum ferebatur elementis; sed spem resurgendi habebat, quia ferebatur in ligno; quod etsi nobis ante non proderat, tamen posteaquam Christus id tetigit, proficere coepit ad vitam; ut esset iudicio salutem populo per crucis patibulum refundendam. In secreto enim iacemus exanimes, cum vel ignis immodicae cupiditatis exaestuat, vel frigidus humor exundat, et pigra quadam corporis habitudine vigor hebetatur animorum.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; This dead man was borne on the bier by the four material elements to the grave, but there was a hope of his rising again because he was borne on wood, which though before it did not benefit us, yet after Christ had touched it, began to profit to life, that it might be a sign that salvation was to be extended to the people by the wood of the cross. For we lie lifeless on the bier when either the fire of immoderate desire bursts forth, or the cold moisture breaks out, and through the sluggish state of our earthly body the vigor of our minds waxes dull.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Vel loculus in quo mortuus effertur, male secura desperati peccatoris conscientia est: qui vero sepeliendum portant, vel immunda desideria, vel blandimenta sunt sociorum; qui, domino loculum tangente, steterunt: quia superni formidine iudicii tacta conscientia, carnales saepe voluptates et iniuste laudantes coercens ad se revertitur, vocantique ad vitam respondet salvatori.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Or the coffin on which the dead is carried is the ill at ease conscience of a desperate sinner. But they who carry him to be buried are either unclean desires, or the allurements of companions, who stood when our Lord touched the bier, because the conscience, when touched by dread of the judgment from on high, often checking its carnal lusts, and those who unjustly praise, returns to itself, and answers its Savior’s call to life.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Si ergo grave peccatum est, quod poenitentiae tuae lacrymis ipse lavare non possis, fleat pro te mater Ecclesia, assistat et turba; iam resurges a funere, et incipies vitalia loqui, timebunt omnes; unius enim exemplo omnes corriguntur: laudabunt etiam Deum, qui tanta nobis remedia vitandae mortis indulsit.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; If then your sin is so heavy that by your penitential tears you can not yourself wash it out, let the mother Church weep for you, the multitude standing by; soon shall you rise from the dead and begin to spear; the words of life; they all shall fear, (for by the example of one all are corrected;) they shall also praise God who has given us such great remedies for escaping death.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Visitavit autem Deus plebem suam, non solum semel verbum suum incorporando, sed semper in corda mittendo.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; But God has visited His people not only by the one incarnation of His Word, but by ever sending It into our hearts.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Viduam etiam potes intelligere animam virum amittentem, idest divinum sermonem: filius enim est intellectus, qui extra civitatem effertur viventium; loculus eius est corpus eius, quod quidam dixerunt esse sepulchrum: tangens autem eum dominus levat ipsum, iuvenescere faciens eum qui surgens a peccato incipit loqui et alios edocere: non enim prius ei crederetur.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. By the widow also you may understand a soul that has lost her husband in the divine word. Her son is the understanding, which is carried out beyond the city of the living. Its coffin is the body, which some indeed have called the tomb. But the Lord touching him raises him up, causing him to become young, and rising from sin he begins to speak and teach others. For before he would not have been believed.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Tunc autem magis ad eum erigimur cum incumbit necessitas: et ideo Ioannes detrusus in carcerem, quando magis discipuli eius indigebant Iesu, tunc mittit eos ad Christum; sequitur enim et convocavit duos de discipulis suis Ioannes, et misit eos ad Iesum, dicens: tu es qui venturus es, an alium expectamus?
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But we are then most raised up to Him when we are fallen into straits. John therefore, being cast into prison, takes the opportunity, when his disciples were most in need of Jesus, to send them to Christ. For it follows, And John calling two of his disciples sent them to Jesus, saying, Are you he that should come, &amp;c.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Non ait: tu es qui venisti; sed: tu es qui venturus es? Et est sensus: manda mihi, quia interficiendus ab Herode et ad Inferna descensurus sum, utrum te et Inferis debeam nuntiare, qui superis nuntiavi; an hoc non conveniat filio Dei, et alium ad haec sacramenta missurus es?
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; He says not, Are you He that have come, but, Are you he that should come. The sense is, Tell me who am to be slain by Herod, and about to descend into hell, whether I should announce You to the souls below as I have announced You to those above? or is this not befitting the Son of God, and you are going to send another for these sacraments?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Sed omnino reprobanda est talis opinio: nunquam enim reperimus sacram Scripturam disserere, quod infernalibus praenuntiaverit Baptista Ioannes salvatoris adventum. Illud etiam verum est dicere, quod non ignoravit Baptista virtutem mysterii incarnationis unigeniti; unde et hoc cum aliis noverat quod illuminaturus erat in Inferno manentes, cum pro omnibus gustaverit mortem, tam vivis quam mortuis. Sed quoniam sermo sacrae Scripturae hunc quidem praedixit venturum tamquam Deum et dominum; alii vero missi sunt sicut famuli ante Christum: ideo omnium salvator et dominus a prophetis nominabatur, qui venit vel qui venturus est, secundum illud: benedictus qui venit in nomine domini; et in Habacuc: post modicum qui venturus est veniet et non tardabit. Igitur divinus Baptista quasi nomen accipiens a sacra Scriptura, misit quosdam discipulorum suorum quaesituros an ipse sit qui venit vel qui venturus est.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; But we must altogether disallow such an opinion. For no where do we find the Holy Scriptures stating that John the Baptist foretold to those souls in hell the coming of our Savior. It is also true to say, that the Baptist was not ignorant of the wonderful mystery of the incarnation of the Only-Begotten, and so also along with the other things had known this, that our Lord was about to preach the Gospel to those who were in hell, after He had tasted death for all living as well as dead. But since the word of holy Scripture indeed declared that Christ would come as the Lord and Chief, but the others were sent as servants before Him, therefore was the Lord and Savior of all called by the prophets, He who comes, or Who is to come; according to that, Blessed, is he who comes in the name of the Lord, and, A little while, and, he who is to come shall come, and, will not tarry. The blessed Baptist therefore, receiving as it were this name from Holy Scripture, sent certain of his disciples to seek whether it was indeed He who comes, or, Who is to come.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Sed quomodo fieri posset ut de quo dixerat: ecce qui tollit peccatum mundi, adhuc eum Dei filium esse non crederet? Aut enim insolentiae est ei tribuere divina quae nescit, aut de Dei filio dubitasse perfidiae est. Nonnulli autem de ipso Ioanne intelligunt magnum quidem ita prophetam ut Christum agnosceret; sed tamen non tamquam dubium, sed tamquam pium vatem quem venturum crediderat, non credidisse moriturum. Non igitur fide, sed pietate dubitavit, sicut et Petrus dicens: propitius tibi esto, domine, non fiet hoc.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; But how could it come to pass, that Him of whom he said, Behold, him who takes away the sins of the world, he should still not believe to be the Son of God? For either it is presumption to attribute to Christ a divine action ignorantly, or it is unbelief to have doubted concerning the Son of God. But some suppose of John himself that he was indeed so great a prophet as to acknowledge Christ, but still as not a doubting, but pious, prophet disbelieved that He would die, whom he believed was about to come. Not therefore in his faith but in his piety, he doubted; as Peter also, when he said, Be it far from you, Lord; this shall not be to you.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Vel ex dispensatione interrogat; noverat enim ut praecursor passionis Christi mysterium; sed ut discipulis suis constet quanta sit excellentia salvatoris, ex propriis discipulis prudentiores misit, quos praecepit sciscitari, et viva salvatoris voce conicere, si ipse est qui expectabatur; unde subditur cum autem ad eum venissent viri, dixerunt: Ioannes Baptista misit nos ad te, dicens: tu es qui venturus es, an alium expectamus? Sciens autem ut Deus quo animo misisset eos Ioannes, et causam adventus eorum, tunc temporis egit uberiora miracula; unde sequitur in ipsa autem hora curavit multos a languoribus et plagis et spiritibus malis, et caecis multis donavit visum. Non dicit eis expresse: ego sum; sed ducit eos magis ad rei certitudinem, ut congrua ratione sumentes fidem ipsius revertantur ad eum qui misit eos; unde non ad verba, sed ad propositum mittentis responsum exhibuit; nam sequitur et respondens dixit illis: euntes renuntiate Ioanni quae vidistis et audistis; quasi dicat: narrate Ioanni quae quidem audistis per prophetas, consummari vero vidistis a me: ea enim tunc agebat quae praedixerant prophetae eum facturum; de quibus subditur quia caeci vident, claudi ambulant, leprosi mundantur, surdi audiunt, mortui resurgunt.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Or he asks the question by economy. For as the forerunner he knew the mystery of Christ’s passion, but that his disciples might be convinced how great was the excellence of the Savior, he sent the more understanding of them, instructing them to inquire and learn from the very words of the Savior, whether it was He who was expected; as it is added, But when the men were come to him, they said, John the Baptist has sent us to you, saying, Are you He, &amp;c. But He knowing as God with what intention John had sent them, and the cause of their coming, was at the time performing many miracles, as it follows, And in the same hour he healed many of their infirmities, &amp;c. He said not positively to them I am he, but rather leads them to the certainty of the fact, in order that receiving their faith in Him, with their reason agreeing thereto, they might return to him who sent them. Hence He made not answer to the words, but to the intention of him who sent them; as it follows, And Jesus answering said, to them, Go your way, and tell John what things you have seen and, heard: as if He said, Go and tell John the things which you have heard indeed through the Prophets, but have seen accomplished by Me. For He was then performing those things which the Prophets prophesied He would do; that is of which it is added, For the blind see, the lame walk.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Plenum sane testimonium, quo dominum propheta cognosceret: de ipso enim fuerat prophetatum quia dominus dat escam esurientibus, erigit elisos, solvit compeditos, illuminat caecos; et quod qui ista facit, regnabit in aeternum. Ergo non humanae ista, sed divinae virtutis insignia sunt. Huius autem Evangelii exempla vel rara vel nulla inveniuntur: unus Tobias oculos recepit; et haec fuit Angeli, non hominis medicina; Elias mortuum suscitavit; ipse tamen rogavit et flevit, hic iussit; Eliseus leprosum mundari fecit; non tamen ibi valuit praecepti auctoritas, sed mysterii figura.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; An ample testimony surely that the Prophets acknowledged the Lord. For of the Lord Himself it was prophesied, that the Lord gives food to the hungry, raises up them that are bowed down, looses the prisoners, opens the eyes of the blind, and that he who does these things shall reign for ever. Such then are not the tokens of human, but divine power. But these are found seldom or not at all before the Gospel. Tobias alone received sight, and this was the cure of an Angel, not of a man. Elias raised the dead, but he prayed and wept, and then commended. Elisha caused the cleansing of a leper: yet then the cause was not so much in the authority of the command as in the figure of the mystery.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Sunt enim haec verba Isaiae dicentis: Deus ipse veniet, et salvabit nos. Tunc aperientur oculi caecorum, et aures surdorum patebunt; tunc saliet sicut cervus, claudus.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. These are also the words of Elias, saying, The Lord himself shall come and save us. Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped. Then shall the lame man leap as an hart.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Et, quod his non minus est, subditur pauperes evangelizantur, pauperes scilicet spiritu vel opibus, intus illuminantur, ut inter divites et egenos in praedicatione nulla distantia sit. Hoc magistri comprobavit veritatem; quando omnis qui apud eum salvari potest, aequalis est.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; And what is not less than these, the poor have the Gospel preached to them, that is, the poor are enlightened by the Spirit, or hidden treasures, that there might be no difference between the rich and the poor. These things prove the faith of the Master, when all who can be saved by Him are equal.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Sed tamen parva adhuc ista dominicae testificationis exempla: plenitudo fidei crux domini, obitus, sepultura est; unde addidit et beatus est qui non fuerit scandalizatus in me. Crux enim etiam electis scandalum posset afferre; sed nullum hoc maius divinae personae est testimonium; nihil enim est quod magis esse ultra humana videatur, quam totum se obtulisse pro mundo.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; But still these are but slight examples of the testimony to the Lord. The full assurance of faith is the cross of the Lord, His death and burial. Hence He adds, And blessed is he who shall not be offended in me. For the cross may cause offense, even to the elect. but there is no greater testimony than this of a divine person. For there is nothing which seems to be more surpassing the nature of man than that one should offer Himself for the whole world.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Vel per hoc volebat ostendere quod quaecumque versabantur in cordibus eorum, ab oculis ipsius effugere nequiverunt; ipsi enim erant qui scandalizabantur de ipso.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Or else, He wished by this to show that whatever was passing in their hearts, could not be hid from His sight. For they were those who were offended at Him.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Mystice autem in Ioanne supra diximus typum esse legis, quae praenuntia fuit Christi. Mittit ergo Ioannes discipulos suos ad Christum ut supplementum scientiae consequantur, quia plenitudo legis est Christus: et fortasse isti discipuli sunt duo populi, quorum unus ex Iudaeis credidit, alter ex gentibus, qui ideo credidit, quia audivit. Voluerunt ergo et isti videre: quia beati oculi qui vident. Cum autem venerint ad Evangelium, et cognoverint illuminari caecos, ambulare claudos, tunc dicent: oculis nostris perspeximus: videmur enim nobis vidisse quae legimus: aut fortasse in parte quadam corporis nostri, omnes videmur investigasse dominicae seriem passionis: fides enim per paucos ad plures pervenit. Lex ergo Christum venturum annuntiat, Evangelii Scriptura venisse confirmat.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; But we have before said, that mystically John was the type of the Law, which was the forerunner of Christ. John then sends his disciples to Christ, that they might obtain the filling up of their knowledge, for Christ is the fulfilling of the Law. And perhaps those disciples are the two nations, of whom the one of the Jews believed, the other of the Gentiles believed because they heard. They wished then to see, because blessed are the eyes that see. But when they shall have come to the Gospel, and found that the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, then shall they say, “We have seen with out eyes,” for we seem to ourselves to see Him whom we read of. Or perhaps through the instrumentality of a certain part of our Body we all seem to have traced out the course of our Lord’s passion; for faith comes through the few to the many. The Law then announces that Christ will come, the writings of the Gospel prove that He has come.

          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Coniecit dominus, tamquam hominum secreta cognoscens, aliquos dicturos: si usque hodie ignorat Ioannes Iesum, qualiter eum ostendebat nobis, dicens: ecce agnus Dei, ecce qui tollit peccata mundi? Ut igitur sanaret hanc passionem quae eis acciderat, damnum quod ex scandalo procedebat, exclusit; unde dicitur et cum discessissent nuntii Ioannis, coepit dicere de Ioanne ad turbas: quid existis in desertum videre? Arundinem vento agitatam? Quasi dicat: mirati estis de Ioanne Baptista, et pluries perrexistis ad eum, percurrentes tam longa deserti itinera: frustra siquidem, si sic levem ipsum existimatis, ut similis sit arundini declinanti quocumque agitat ventus. Talis enim esse videtur, si quae cognovit, ex levitate se ignorare fatetur.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; The Lord, knowing the secrets of men, foresaw that some would say, If until now John is ignorant of Jesus, how did he show Him to us, saying, Behold the Lamb of God, which takes away the sins of the world? To quench therefore this feeling which had taken possession of them, He prevented the injury which might arise from the offense, as it follows, And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak to the people concerning John, what went you out for to see? A reed shaken in the wind? As if He said, you marveled at John the Baptist, and oftentimes came to see him, passing over long journeys in the desert; surely in vain, if you think him so fickle as to be like a reed bending down whichever way the wind moves it. For such he appears to be, who lightly avows his ignorance of the things which he knows.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Titus</b>: Non autem existis in desertum, ubi nulla iucunditas, civitatibus omissis, nisi de hoc viro curam gerentes.
          <td><b>TITUS BOST</b>. But you went not out into the desert, (where there is no pleasantness,) leaving your cities, except as caring for this man.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Graecus</b>: Hoc autem post recessum discipulorum Ioannis dominus dixit: non enim praesentibus eis proferre volebat Baptistae praeconia, ne blandientis verba esse putarentur.
          <td><b>GREEK EX</b>. Now these things were spoken by our Lord after the departure of John’s disciples, for He would not utter the praises of the Baptist while they were present, lest His words should be counted as those of a flatterer.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Non otiose autem Ioannis hic persona laudatur, qui vitae amore posthabito, iustitiae formam nec mortis terrore mutavit. Deserto enim mundus hic comparari videtur adhuc sterilis, adhuc incultus; in quem negat nobis dominus ita prodeundum ut mente carnis inflatos, vacuosque virtutis internae viros, et fragili se gloriae saecularis sublimitate iactantes, exemplari quodam et imagine nobis putemus imitandos, quos procellis huius mundi obnoxios vita mobilis inquietat, iure arundini comparandos.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Not unmeaningly then is the character of John praised there, who preferred the way of righteousness to the love of life, and swerved not through fear of death. For this world seems to be compared to a desert, into which, as yet barren and uncultivated, the Lord says we must not so enter as to regard men puffed up with a fleshly mind, and devoid of inward virtue, and vaunting themselves in the heights of frail worldly glory, as a kind of example and model for our imitation. And such being exposed to the storms of this world, and tossed to and from by a restless life, are rightly compared to a reed.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Graecus</b>: Est etiam infallibile testimonium vitae Ioannis vestitus cum carcere, in quem detrusus non fuisset, si scivisset favere principibus; unde sequitur sed quid existis videre? Hominem mollibus vestimentis indutum? Ecce qui in veste pretiosa sunt et in deliciis, in domibus regum sunt. Mollibus vestimentis indutus viventes in deliciis significat.
          <td><b>GREEK EX</b>. We have also an infallible testimony to John’s way of life in his manner of clothing, and his imprisonment, into which he never would have been cast had he known how to court princes; as it follows, but what went you out for to see? A man clothed with soft raiment? Behold they who are gorgeously appareled, and live delicately, are in kings’ houses. By being clothed with soft raiment, he signifies men who live luxuriously.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Mollis autem vestis dissolvit rigidam animam; et si rigidum corpus assumat et asperum, facile per huiusmodi mollitiem delicatum reddit et fragile. Facto vero corpore molliori, necesse est et animam participare laesionem; nam ut plurimum operationes ipsius consonant dispositionibus corporis.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But a soft garment relaxes the austerity of the soul; and if worn by a hard and rigorous body, soon, by such effeminacy, makes it frail and delicate. But when the body becomes softer, the soul must also share the injury; for generally its workings correspond wit the conditions of the body.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Qualiter ergo tanta sedulitas religionis ut carnales passiones subiceret, ad tantam ignorantiam deveniret, nisi ex mentis levitate, quam non asperitates, sed illecebrae mundanae delectant? Igitur si velut non colentem deliciosa Ioannem imitamini, date ei robur continentiae competens si vero nihil amplius debetur honestae conversationi, quid, omissa reverentia delicatorum, incolam deserti, vileque tegumen et camelorum vellus miramini?
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; How then could a religious strictness, so great that it subdued to itself all fleshly lusts, sink down to such ignorance, except from a frivolity of mind, which is not fostered by austerities, but by worldly delights. If then you imitate John, as one who cared not for pleasure, award him also the strength of mind, which befits his continence. But if strictness no more tends to this than a life of luxury, why do you, not respecting those who live delicately, admire the inhabitant of the desert, and his wretched garment of camel’s hair.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Matthaeum</b>: Per utrumque autem dictorum designat, quod Ioannes nec naturaliter, nec facile mobilis erat, nec ulla voluptate flecteretur.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. By each of these sayings He shows John to be neither naturally not easily shaken or diverted from any purpose.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Et quamvis plerosque mollioris cura vestis effeminet, tamen alia videtur hic indumenta significare; humana scilicet corpora, quibus anima nostra vestitur. Sunt autem mollia indumenta deliciosi actus et mores; hi vero quibus fluida deliciis membra solvuntur, regni caelestis extorres sunt; quos rectores mundi huius atque tenebrarum ceperunt: hi sunt enim reges qui dominantur suorum operum aemulos.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; And although very many become effeminate by the use of softer garments, yet here other garments seem to be meant, namely, our mortal bodies, by which our souls are clothed. Again, luxurious acts and habits are soft garments, but those whose languid limbs are wasted away in luxuries are shut out of the kingdom of heaven, whom the rulers of this world and of darkness have taken captive. For these are the kings who exercise tyranny over those who are their fellows in their own works.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Sed forte inconveniens est circa hoc excusare Ioannem; fatemini enim eum imitabilem esse; unde subdit sed quid existis videre? Prophetam? Utique dico vobis: et plusquam prophetam. Prophetae namque praedicabant venturum: hic autem non solum venturum praedicavit, sed et praesentem indicavit, dicens: ecce agnus Dei.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; But perhaps it does not concern us to excuse John upon this ground, for you confess that he is worthy of imitation, hence He adds, But what went you out for to see? A prophet? Verily I say to you, more than a prophet. For the prophets foretold that Christ would come, but John not only foretold that He would come, but also declared Him to be present, saying, Behold the Lamb of God.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Maior sane propheta, in quo finis est prophetarum: quia multi cupierunt videre quem iste conspexit, quem iste baptizavit.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Indeed, greater than a prophet (or more than a prophet) was he in whom the prophets terminate; for many desired to see Him whom he saw, whom he baptized.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Cum igitur et a loco et a vestibus et ex concursu hominum morem eius descripserit, introducit prophetae testimonium, dicens hic est, de quo scriptum est, scilicet in Malachia: ecce mitto Angelum meum.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Having then described his character by the place where he dwelt, by his clothing, and from the crowds who went to see him, He introduces the testimony of the prophet, saying, This is he of whom it is written, Behold, I send my angel.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Titus</b>: Angelum appellat hominem, non quia natura esset Angelus, homo enim naturaliter erat; sed quia opus Angeli exercebat, nuntiando Christi adventum.
          <td><b>TITUS BOST</b>. He calls a man an angel, not because he was by nature an angel, for he was by nature a man, but because he exercised the office of an angel, in heralding the advent of Christ.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Graecus</b>: Quod autem subdit ante faciem tuam, propinquitatem designat: apparuit enim hominibus prope Christi adventum; quapropter et plusquam prophetam ipsum esse existimandum est; nam et hi qui in militiis collaterales sunt regibus, digniores et familiariores sunt.
          <td><b>GREEK EX</b>. But by the words which follow, Before your face, he signifies nearness of time, for John appeared to men close to the coming of Christ. Wherefore must he indeed be considered more than a prophet, for those also who in battle fight close to the sides of kings, are their most distinguished and greatest friends.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>
            <b>Ambrosius</b>: Viam autem domino non solum nascendi secundum carnem ordine fideique nuntio, sed etiam praecursu quodam paravit passiones; unde sequitur qui praeparabit viam tuam ante te.
            <p>Si autem et Christus propheta, quomodo maior hic omnibus? Sed inter mulieris, non virginis natos: maior enim iis fuit quibus aequalis poterat esse sorte nascendi; unde sequitur dico enim vobis: maior inter natos mulierum propheta Ioanne Baptista non est.
          <td>
            <b>AMBROSE</b>; But he prepared the way of the Lord not only in the order of birth according to the flesh, and as the messenger of faith, but also as the forerunner of His glorious passion. Hence it follows, Who shall prepare your way before you.
            <p><b>AMBROSE</b>; But if Christ also is a prophet, how is this man greater than all. But it is said, among those born of woman, not of a virgin. For He was greater than those, whose equal he might be in way of birth, as it follows, For I say to you, of those that are born of woman, there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Matthaeum</b>: Sufficit quidem domini vox praebens testimonium praeeminentiae Ioannis inter homines; reperiet autem qui vult et rei veritatem consonam, si mensam eius consideraverit, si vitam, si mentis excellentiam: velut enim qui caelitus descendisset, degebat in terra, fere nullam gerens curam de corpore, intellectualiter erectus in caelum, et soli Deo coniunctus, de nullo mundanorum sollicitus; sermo severus et lenis: nam cum populo Iudaeorum viriliter et ferventer, cum rege audacter, cum propriis discipulis leniter conferebat: nil frustra vel leviter, omnia convenienter agebat.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. The voice of the Lord is indeed sufficient to bear testimony to John’s preeminence among men. But any one will find the real facts of the case confirming the same, by considering his food, his manner of life, the loftiness of his mind. For he dwelt on earth as one who had come down from heaven, casting no care upon his body, his mind raised up to heaven, and united to God alone, taking no thought for worldly things; his conversation grave and gentle, for with the Jewish people he dealt honestly and zealously, with the king boldly, with his own disciples mildly. He did nothing idle or trifling, but all things becomingly.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Isidorus abbas</b> Maior etiam inter natos mulierum Ioannes eo quod ab ipso matris utero prophetavit, et positus in tenebris lumen quod iam venerat non ignoravit.
          <td><b>ISIDORE PELEUS</b>; John was also greatest among those that are born of women because he prophesied from the very womb of his mother, and though in darkness, was not ignorant of the light which had already come.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Denique eo usque cum Dei filio non poterit Ioannis esse ulla collatio ut et infra Angelos aestimetur; unde sequitur qui autem minor est in regno Dei, maior est illo.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Lastly, so impossible is it that there should be any comparison between John and the Son of God, that he is counted even below the angels; as it follows, But he that is least in the kingdom of God, is greater than he.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Haec sententia duobus modis potest intelligi: aut enim regnum Dei appellavit quod nondum accepimus, in quo sunt Angeli, et quilibet in eis minor, maior est quolibet iusto portante corpus, quod aggravat animam; aut si regnum Dei intelligi voluit huius temporis Ecclesiam, seipsum dominus significavit, qui nascendi tempore minor erat Ioanne, maior autem divinitatis auctoritate et potestate dominica: proinde secundum primam expositionem ita distinguitur: qui autem minor est in regno Dei, ac deinde subinfertur maior est illo; secundum posteriorem vero ita: qui autem minor est, ac deinde subinfertur in regno Dei maior est illo.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; These words may be understood in two ways. For either he called that the kingdom of God, which we have not yet received, (in which are the Angels,) and the very least among them is greater than any righteous man, who bears about a body, which weighs down the soul. Or if by the kingdom of God be meant to be understood the Church of this time, the Lord referred to Himself, who in the time of His birth came after John, but was greater in divine authority, and the power of the Lord. Moreover, according to the first explanation, the distinction is as follows, But he who is least in the kingdom of God, and then it is added, is greater than he. According to the latter, But he who is least, and then added, is greater in the kingdom of God than he.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Ut enim copia laudum Ioannis occasionem Iudaeis non daret praeferendi Ioannem Christo, hoc subdidit. Ne autem putes quod comparative se dixerit maiorem Ioanne.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. For He adds this, that the abundant praise of John might not give the Jews a pretext to prefer John to Christ. But do not suppose that he spoke comparatively of His being greater than John.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Alia enim est ista natura, nec humanis generationibus comparanda: non potest enim homini cum Deo ulla esse collatio.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; For He is of another nature, which bears not comparison with human kind. For there can be no comparing of God with men.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Mystice autem, cum Ioannis praerogativam ostendit inter natos mulierum, ponit ex opposito aliquid maius eo, scilicet qui per spiritum sanctum natus est filius Dei: regnum enim donum Dei spiritus est. Quamvis ergo secundum operationem et sanctitatem, minores sumus his qui legis mysterium sunt assecuti, quos Ioannes significat: tamen maiora per Christum attingimus, participes facti divinae naturae.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; But in a mystery, when showing the superiority of John among those that are born of women, he places in opposition something greater, namely, Himself who was born by the holy Spirit the Son of God. For the kingdom of the Lord is the Spirit of God. Although then as respects works and holiness, we may be inferior to those who attained to the mystery of the law, whom John represents, yet through Christ we have greater things, being made partakers of the Divine nature.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; God is justified by baptism, wherein men justify themselves confessing their sins. For he that sins and confesses his sin to God justifies God, submitting himself to Him who overcomes, and hoping for grace from Him; God therefore is justified by baptism, in which there is confession and pardon of sin.

          <td><b>EUSEBIUS</b>. Because also they believed, they justified God, for He appeared just to them in all that He did.

They then rebuked each other in turn with the charge of want of sympathy. That such were the feelings of the Jewish people and their rulers, Christ implied in the following words, spoken in the person of Christ; Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation, and to what are they like? They are like to children sitting in the market-place.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Generatio Iudaeorum comparatur pueris, quia doctores olim prophetas habebant, de quibus dicitur ex ore infantium et lactentium perfecisti laudem.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; The Jewish generation is compared to children, because formerly they had prophets for their teachers, of whom it is said, Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings have you perfected praise.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Cantaverunt autem prophetae spiritualibus modulis publicae salutis oracula resultantes, fleverunt threnis flebilibus Iudaeorum dura corda mulcentes. Hoc canticum non in foro, non in plateis canebatur, sed in Ierusalem: ipsa est enim dominicum forum, in quo praeceptorum caelestium iura conduntur.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; But the prophets sung, repeating in spiritual strains their oracles of the common salvation; they wept, soothing with mournful dirges the hard hearts of the Jews. The songs were not sung in the market-place, nor in the streets, but in Jerusalem. For that is the Lord’s forum, in which the laws of His heavenly precepts are framed.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius Nyssenus</b>: Canticum autem et lamentatio nil aliud est quam excessus, hoc quidem gaudii, illud vero moeroris. Resonat autem quaedam consona melodia ex organo musico, secundum quam dum homo pede et motu consono corporis commovetur, intrinsecam dispositionem manifestat; et ideo dicit lamentavimus, et non plorastis.
          <td><b>GREG. NYSS</b>. But singing and lamentation are nothing else but in the breaking forth, the one indeed of joy, the other of sorrow. Now at the sound of a tune played upon a musical instrument, man by the concordant beating of his feet, and motion of his body, portrays his inward feelings. Hence he says, We have sung, and you have not danced; we have mourned to you and you have not wept.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de quaest. Evang</b>: Haec autem pertinent ad Ioannem et Christum. Quod enim dicit lamentavimus, et non plorastis, ad Ioannem pertinet, cuius abstinentia a cibis et potu luctum poenitentiae significabat; unde exponendo subdit venit enim Ioannes Baptista neque manducans panem, neque bibens vinum; et dicitis: Daemonium habet.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Now these words have reference to John and Christ. For when he says, We have mourned, and you have not wept, it is in allusion to John, whose abstinence from meat and drink signified penitential sorrow; and hence he adds in explanation, For John came neither eating bread, nor drinking wine, and you say he has a devil.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Praesumunt criminari virum qualibet admiratione dignum: Daemonium habere dicunt mortificantem legem peccati, quae latet in membris.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; They take upon themselves to slander a man worthy of all admiration. They say that he who mortifies the law of sin which is in his members has a devil.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de quaest. Evang</b>: Quod autem dixerat cantavimus tibiis, et non saltastis, ad ipsum dominum pertinet, qui utendo cum ceteris cibo et potu, laetitiam regni significabat; unde sequitur venit filius hominis manducans et bibens; et dicitis: ecce homo devorator et bibens vinum.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But his words, We have piped to you, and you have not danced, refer to the Lord Himself, who by using meats and drinks as others did, represented the joy of His kingdom. Hence it follows, The Son of man came eating and drinking &amp;c.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Titus</b>: Noluit enim Christus abstinere ab huiusmodi cibis, ne occasionem daret haereticis, qui dicunt creaturas esse malas, et vituperant carnes et vinum.
          <td><b>TITUS BOST</b>. For Christ would not abstain from this food, lest He should give a handle to heretics, who say that the creatures of God are bad, and blame flesh and wine.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Ubi autem potuerunt ostendere dominum voratorem? Invenitur enim Christus ubique reprimere immoderantiam, et ad modestiam ducere. Conversabatur autem cum publicanis et peccatoribus; unde contra eum dicebant amicus publicanorum et peccatorum; cum tamen nullatenus ipse posset in peccatum incidere, sed e contra fiebat eis causa salutis: non enim coinquinatur sol radians super totam terram, et frequenter superveniens immundis corporibus; nec sol iustitiae laedetur conversando cum pravis. Nemo autem conetur comparare propriam mensuram dignitatibus Christi: sed quilibet propriam fragilitatem considerans vitet consortia talium: prava namque colloquia mores corrumpunt bonos. Sequitur et iustificata est sapientia ab omnibus filiis suis.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; But where could they point out the Lord as gluttonness? For Christ is found every where repressing excess, and leading men to temperance. But He associated with publicans and sinners. Hence they said against Him, He is a friend of Publicans and sinners, though He could in no wise fall into sin, but on the contrary was to them the cause of salvation. For the sun is not polluted though sending its rays over all the earth, and frequently falling upon unclean bodies. Neither will the Sun of righteousness be hurt by associating with the bad. But let no one attempt to place his own condition on a level with Christ’s greatness, but let each considering his own infirmity avoid having dealing with such men, for “evil communications corrupt good manners.” It follows, And wisdom is justified of all her children.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Sapientia Dei filius est per naturam, non per profectum: quae iustificatur per Baptisma, in eo quod non per contumaciam refutatur, sed per iustitiam Dei munus agnoscitur. In eo ergo iustificatio Dei est, si non ad indignos et obnoxios, sed ad innocentes, per ablutionem sanctos et iustos, videatur sua munera transtulisse.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; The Son of God is wisdom, by nature, not by growth, which is justified by baptism, when it is not rejected through obstinacy, but through righteousness is acknowledged the gift of God. Herein then is the justification of God, if he seems to transfer His gifts not to the unworthy and guilty, but to those who are through baptism holy and just.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Filios autem sapientiae dicit sapientes: consuevit enim Scriptura malos magis ex peccato quam ex nomine indicare, bonos autem filios appellare informantis eos virtutis.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But by the children of wisdom, He means the wise. For Scripture is accustomed to indicate the bad rather by their sin than their name, but to call the good the children of the virtue which characterizes them.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Bene autem dicit ab omnibus: quia circa omnes iustitia reservatur, ut susceptio fiat fidelium et eiectio perfidorum.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; He well says, of all, for justice is reserved for all, that the faithful may be taken up, the unbelievers cast out.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de quaest. Evang</b>: Vel quod dicit iustificata est sapientia ab omnibus filiis suis, ostendit filios sapientiae intelligere, nec in abstinendo, nec in manducando esse iustitiam, sed in aequanimitate tolerandi inopiam: non enim usus, sed concupiscentia reprehendenda est, dummodo congruas in generibus alimentorum his cum quibus tibi vivendum est.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or, when he says, wisdom is justified of all her children, he show that the children of wisdom understand that righteousness consists neither in abstaining from nor eating food, but in patiently enduring want. For not the use of such things, but the coveting after them, must be blamed; only let a man adapt himself to the kind of food of those with whom he lives.

          <td><b>GREG. NYSS</b>. This account is full of precious instruction. For there are very many who justify themselves, being puffed up with the dreamings of an idle fancy, who before the time of Judgment comes, separate themselves as lambs from the herds, not willing even to join in eating with the many, and hardly with those who go not to extremes, but keep the middle path in life. St. Luke, the physician of souls rather than of bodies, represents therefore our Lord and Savior most mercifully visiting others, as it follows, And he went into the Pharisees’ house, and sat down to meat. Not that He should share any of his faults, but might impart somewhat of His own righteousness.

She once uttered proud things with her mouth, but kissing the feet of the Lord, she impressed her lips on the footsteps of her Redeemer. She once used ointment for the perfume of her body; what she had unworthily applied to herself, she now laudably offered to God. As it follows, And she anointed with ointment. As many enjoyments as she had in herself, so many offerings did she devise out of herself. She converts the number of her faults into the same number of virtues, that as much of her might wholly serve God in her penitence, as had despised God in her sin.

Ecce Pharisaeus veraciter apud se superbus, et fallaciter iustus, aegrum reprehendit de aegritudine, et medicum de subventione: quae profecto mulier, si ad Pharisaei pedes venisset, calcibus repulsa discederet.

Oportet autem ut sollicite discernamus quia districtionem debemus vitiis, compassionem naturae. Si enim feriendus est peccator, nutriendus est proximus; cum vero iam per poenitentiam percutit ipse quod fecit, iam noster proximus peccator non est, quia hic in se punit quod iustitia divina reprehendit. Inter duos ergo aegros medicus aderat: sed unus in febre sensum tenebat, alter sensum perdiderat mentis: illa quippe flebat quod fecerat, Pharisaeus autem de falsa iustitia elatus, vim suae valetudinis exaggerabat.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. But the Pharisee beholding these things despises them, and finds fault, not only with the woman who was a sinner, but with the Lord who received her, as it follows, Now when the Pharisee who had bidden him saw it, he spoke within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is which touches him. We see the Pharisee really proud in himself, and hypocritically righteous, blaming the sick woman for her sickness, the physician for his aid. The woman surely if she had come to the feet of the Pharisee would have departed with the heel lifted up against her. For he would have thought that he was polluted by another’s sin, not having sufficient of his own real righteousness to fill him. So also some gifted with the priests’ office, if perchance they have done any just thing outwardly or slightly, forthwith despise those who are put under them, and look with disdain on sinners who are of the people. But when we behold sinners, we must first bewail ourselves for their calamity, since we perhaps have had and are certainly liable to a similar fall. But it is necessary that we should carefully distinguish, for we are bound to make distinction in vices, but to have compassion on nature. For if we must punish the sinner, we must cherish a brother. But when by penance he has himself punished his own deed, our brother is no more a sinner, for he punished in himself what Divine justice condemned. The Physician was between two sick persons, but the one preserved her faculties in the fever, the other lost his mental perception. For she wept at what she had done; but the Pharisee, elated with a false sense of righteousness, overrated the vigor of his own health.

And here we must remark, that while the Pharisee is convicted upon his own grounds, the madman carries the rope by which he will be bound; as it follows, But he said to him, you have rightly judged. The good deeds of the sinful woman are enumerated to him, and the evils of the pretended righteous; as it follows, And he turned to the woman, and said to Simon, See you this woman? I entered into your house, you gave me no water for my feet, but she has washed my feet with her tears.

          <td><b>TITUS BOST</b>. As if He said, To provide water is easy, to pour forth tears is not easy. You have not provided even what was at hand, she has poured forth what was not at hand; for washing my feet with her tears, she washed away her own stains. She wiped them with her hair, that so she might draw to herself the sacred moisture, and by that by which she once enticed youth to sin, might now attract to herself holiness.

Nam qui vehementer se ingesserunt malis, rursus et bonis vehementer insistent, conscii ad quot debita se obligaverunt.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But as after the breaking of a violent storm there comes a calm,, so when tears have burst forth, there is peace, and gloomy thoughts vanish; and as by water and the Spirit, so by tears and confession we are again made clean. Hence it follows, Wherefore I say to you, Her sins which are many are forgiven, for she loves much. For those who have violently plunged into evil, will in time also eagerly follow after good, being conscious to what debts they have made themselves responsible.

          <td><b>TITUS BOST</b>. But it more frequently happens that he who has sinned much is purified by confession, but he who has sinned little, refuses from pride to come to be healed thereby. Hence it follows, But to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Matthaeum</b>: Opus est ergo nobis ferventi anima, quia nihil impedit hominem fieri magnum.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. We have need then of a fervent spirit, for nothing hinders a man from becoming great.

But the heavenly Physician regards not those sick, whom He sees to be made still worse by His remedy, but her whom He had healed He encourages by making mention of her own piety; as it follows, But he said to the woman, Your faith has made you whole; for in truth she doubted not that she would receive what she sought for.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. But after having forgiven her sins, He stops not at the forgiveness of sins, but adds good works, as it follows, Go in peace, i.e. in righteousness, for righteousness is the reconciliation of man to God, as sin is the enmity between God and man; as if He said, Do all things which lead you to the peace of God.

          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Hoc autem loco plerique pati videntur scrupulum quaestionis, utrum videantur Evangelistae discordasse de fide.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Now in this place many seem to be perplexed with the question, whether the Evangelists do not appear to have differed concerning the faith.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Graecus</b>: Quia enim quatuor Evangelistae dicunt Christum unctum fuisse unguento a muliere, tres puto fuisse mulieres ex personarum qualitate, ex modo agendi, ex differentia temporum. Ioannes quidem narrat de Maria sorore Lazari, quoniam sex diebus ante Pascha unxit pedes Iesu in propria domo. At Matthaeus, postquam dominus dixerat: scitis quia post biduum fiet Pascha, subdit, quod in Bethania in domo Simonis leprosi mulier fudit unguentum super domini caput; non autem unxit pedes, ut Maria; Marcus etiam Matthaeo similiter. Lucas autem non circa tempus Paschae, sed in medio Evangelii hoc refert. Chrysostomus autem binas asserit has mulieres fuisse: unam quidem quae continetur in Ioanne, alteram vero cuius mentio fit a tribus.
          <td><b>GREEK EX</b>. For since the four Evangelists relate that Christ was anointed with ointment by a woman, I think that there were three women, differing according to the quality of each, their mode of action, and the difference of times. John, for example, relates that Mary, the sister of Lazarus, six days before the Passover, anointed the feet of Jesus in her own house; but Matthew, after that the Lord had said, You know that after two days will be the Passover, adds, that in Bethany, at the house of Simon the leper, a woman poured ointment upon the head of our Lord, but did not anoint His feet as Mary. Mark also says the same as Matthew; but Luke gives the account not near the time of the Passover, but in the middle of the Gospel. Chrysostom explains it that there were two different women, one indeed who is described in John, another who is mentioned by the three.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Hanc ergo mulierem inducit Matthaeus supra caput Christi effundentem unguentum; et ideo noluit dicere peccatricem: nam peccatrix, secundum Lucam, supra Christi pedes effudit unguentum. Potest ergo non eadem esse, ne sibi contrarium Evangelistae dixisse videantur. Potest etiam quaestio meriti et temporis diversitate dissolvi, ut adhuc illa peccatrix sit, iam ista perfectior.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Matthew has introduced this woman as pouring ointment upon the head of Christ, and was therefore unwilling to call her a sinner, for the sinner, according to Luke, poured ointment upon the feet of Christ. She cannot then be the same, lest the Evangelists should seem to be at variance with one another. The difficulty may be also solved by the difference of merit and of time, so that the former woman may have been yet a sinner, the latter now more perfect.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Cons. Evang</b>: Eamdem enim Mariam bis hoc fecisse, arbitror intelligendum; semel scilicet quod Lucas narravit, cum primo accedens cum humilitate et lacrymis meruit remissionem peccatorum. Unde Ioannes, cum de Lazaro resuscitando coepisset loqui, antequam veniret in Bethaniam, dicit: Maria autem erat quae unxit dominum unguento, et tersit pedes eius capillis suis, cuius frater Lazarus infirmabatur. Iam itaque hoc Maria fecerat. Quod autem in Bethania rursum fecit, aliud est, quod ad Lucae narrationem non pertinet, sed pariter narratur ab aliis tribus.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. For I think we must understand that the same Mary did this twice, once indeed as Luke has related, when at first coming with humility and weeping, she was thought worthy to receive forgiveness of sins. Hence John, when he began to speak of the resurrection of Lazarus, before he came to Bethany, says, But it was Mary who anointed our Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick. Mary therefore had already done this; but what she again did in Bethany is another occurrence, which belongs not to the relation of Luke, but is equally told by the other three.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius</b>: Mystico autem intellectu, Pharisaeus de falsa iustitia praesumens, Iudaicum populum, peccatrix mulier, sed ad vestigia domini veniens et plorans, conversam gentilitatem designat.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. Now in a mystical sense the Pharisee, presuming upon his pretended righteousness, is the Jewish people; the woman who was a sinner, but who came and wept at our Lord’s feet, represents the conversion of the Gentiles.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius in Lucam</b>: Vel princeps huius saeculi quidam leprosus est, domus autem Simonis leprosi terra est; ergo dominus ex illis superioribus locis descendit in terram; neque enim sanari potuisset haec mulier, quae speciem habet animae vel Ecclesiae, nisi Christus venisset in terram. Merito autem speciem accipit peccatricis, quia Christus quoque formam peccatoris accepit. Itaque si constituas animam fideliter appropinquantem Deo, non peccatis turpibus et obscoenis, sed pie servientem Dei verbo, habentem immaculatae fiduciam castitatis; ad ipsum Christi caput ascendit: caput autem Christi Deus est. Sed qui caput non tenet Christi, ille pedes teneat. Peccator ad pedes, iustus ad caput. Habet tamen etiam ea quae peccavit unguentum.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Or, the leper, is the prince of this world; the house of Simon the leper, is the earth. The Lord therefore descended from the higher parts to this earth; for this woman could not have been healed, who bears the figure of a soul or the Church, had not Christ come upon earth. But rightly does she receive the figure of a sinner, for Christ also took the form of a sinner. If then you make your soul approach in faith to God, it not with foul and shameful sins, but piously obeying the word of God, and in the confidence of unspotted purity, ascends to the very head of Christ. But the head of Christ is God. But let him who holds not the head of Christ, hold the feet, the sinner at the feet, the just at the head; nevertheless she also who sinned, has ointment.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius</b>: Quid aliud unguento nisi bonus odor opinionis exprimitur? Si igitur recta opera agimus, quibus opinione boni odoris Ecclesiam respergamus, quid in corpore domini nisi unguentum fundimus? Sed secus pedes mulier stetit: contra pedes enim domini stetimus, cum in peccatis positi, eius itineribus renitebamur; sed si ad veram poenitentiam post peccata convertimur, iam retro secus pedes stamus, quia eius vestigia sequimur quem impugnabamus.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. What else is expressed by the ointment, but the sweet savor of a good report? If then we do good works by which we may sprinkle the Church with the sweet odor of a good report, what else do we but pour ointment upon the body of our Lord. But the woman stood by His feet, for we stood over against the feet of the Lord, when yet in our sins we resisted His ways. But if we are converted from our sins to true repentance, we now again stand by His feet, for we follow His footsteps whom we before opposed.

Et fortasse ideo non lavit pedes suos Christus, ut eos lacrymis nos lavemus. Bonae lacrymae, quae non solum nostrum possunt lavare delictum, sed etiam verbi caelestis rigare vestigium, ut gressus eius nobis exuberent. Bonae lacrymae, in quibus non solum redemptio peccatorum, sed etiam iustorum refectio est.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Bring you also repentance after sin. Wherever you hear the name of Christ, speed thither; into whatever house you know that Jesus has entered, thither hasten; when you find wisdom, when you find justice sitting in any inner chamber, run to its feet, that is, seek even the lowest part of wisdom; confess your sins with tears. Perhaps Christ washed not His own feet, that we might wash them with our tears. Blessed tears, which can not only wash away our own sin, but also water the footsteps of the heavenly Word, that His goings may abound in us. Blessed tears, in which there is not only the redemption of sinners, but the refreshing of the righteous.

          <td><b>GREG</b>. For we water the feet of our Lord with tears if we are moved with compassion to any even the lowest members of our Lord. We wipe our Lord’s feet with our hair, when we show pity to His saints (with whom we suffer in love) by the sacrifice of those things with which we abound.

Unguento pedes ungimus, cum ipsam humilitatis eius potentiam sacri eloquii bona opinione praedicamus. Sed hoc etiam Pharisaeus vidit, et invidit; quia cum Iudaicus populus gentilitatem Deum praedicare conspicit, sua apud se malitia tabescit. Sic autem Pharisaeus retunditur ut per eum perfidus ille populus ostendatur: quia videlicet infidelis ille populus nec ea quae extra se erant, unquam pro domino tribuit; conversa autem gentilitas pro eo non solum rerum substantiam, sed etiam sanguinem fudit; unde Pharisaeo dicit aquam pedibus meis non dedisti; haec autem lacrymis rigavit pedes meos. Aqua quippe extra nos est, lacrymarum humor intra nos est. Infidelis etiam ille populus Deo osculum non dedit, quia ex caritate eum amare noluit cui ex timore servivit; osculum quippe dilectionis est signum: vocata autem gentilitas redemptoris sui vestigia osculari non cessat, quia in eius continuo amore suspirat.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. The woman kisses the feet which she has wiped. This also we fully do when we ardently love those whom we maintain by our bounty. By the feet also may be understood tile mystery itself of the Incarnation. We then kiss the feet of the Redeemer when we love with our whole heart the mystery of the Incarnation. We anoint the feet with ointment, when we proclaim the power of His humanity with the good tidings of holy eloquence. But this also the Pharisee sees and grudges, for when the Jewish people perceives that the Gentiles preach God, it consumes away by its own malice. But the Pharisee is thus repulsed, that as it were through Him that false people might be made manifest, for in truth that unbelieving people never offered to the Lord even those things which were without them; but the Gentiles being converted, poured forth not only their substance but their blood. Hence He says to the Pharisee, You gave me no water for my feet, but she has washed my feet with her tears; for water is without us, the moisture of tears is within us. That unfaithful people also gave no kiss to the Lord, for it was unwilling to embrace Him from love whom it obeyed from fear, (for the kiss is the sign of love,) but the Gentiles being called cease not to kiss the feet of their Redeemer, for they ever breathe in His love.

          <td><b>GREG</b>. But it is said to the Pharisee, My head with oil you did not anoint, for the very power even of Divinity on which the Jewish people professed to believe, he neglects to celebrate with due praise. But she has anointed my feet with ointment. For while the Gentile people believed the mystery of His incarnation, it proclaimed also His lowest powers with the highest praise.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Beatus qui potest et oleo ungere pedes Christi; sed beatior qui ungit unguento: multorum enim florum in unum collecta spargit; et fortasse istud unguentum non posset alius nisi Ecclesia sola deferre, quae diversi spiraminis innumerabiles habet flores: et ideo nemo potest tantum diligere quantum illa quae in pluribus diligit. In domo autem Pharisaei, idest in domo legis et prophetae, non Pharisaeus, sed Ecclesia iustificatur: Pharisaeus enim non credidit, ista credebat; lex mysterium non habet, quo occulta mundantur; et ideo quod in lege minus est, consummatur in Evangelio. Duo autem debitores, duo populi sunt feneratori illi thesauri caelestis obnoxii. Non materialem autem feneratori huic debemus pecuniam, sed meritorum examinata, aera virtutum; quarum merita gravitatis pondere, iustitiae specie, sono confessionis expenduntur. Non mediocris autem est iste denarius, in quo regis imago formatur. Vae mihi, si non habuero quod accepi: aut quia difficile quisquam est qui feneratori huic debitum integrum possit exsolvere, vae mihi, si non petiero concedi mihi debitum. Sed quis est populus iste qui amplius debet, nisi nos, quibus amplius creditum est? Illis credita sunt eloquia Dei; nobis creditur virginis partus Emmanuel, idest nobiscum Deus, domini crux, mors, resurrectio. Itaque non est dubium quod plus debet qui plus accipit. Secundum homines plus fortasse offendit qui plus debuerit; sed per misericordiam domini causa mutatur, ut amplius diligat qui amplius debuit, si tamen gratiam consequatur. Et ideo, quoniam nihil est quod digne Deo referre possimus, vae mihi et si non dilexero. Reddamus ergo amorem pro debito; amplius enim diligit cui donatur amplius
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Blessed is he even who can anoint with oil the feet of Christ, but more blessed is he who anoints with ointment, for the essence of many flowers blended into one, scatters the sweets of various odors. And perhaps no other than the Church alone can bring that ointment which has innumerable flowers of different perfumes, and therefore no one can love so much as she who loves in many individuals. But in the Pharisee’s house, that is, in the house of the Law and the Prophets, not the Pharisee, but the Church is justified. For the Pharisee believed not, the Church believed. The Law has no mystery by which secret faults are cleansed, and therefore that which is wanting in the Law is made up in the Gospel. But the two debtors are the two nations who are responsible for payment to the usurer of the heavenly treasury. But we do not owe to this usurer material money, but the balance of our good deeds, the coin of our virtues, the merits of which are estimated by the weight of sorrow, the stamp of righteousness, the sound of confession. But that denarius is of no slight value on which the image of the king is found. Woe to me if I shall not have what I received. Or because there is hardly any one who can pay the whole debt to the usurer, woe to me if I shall not seek the debt to be forgiven me. But what nation is it that owes most, if not we to whom most is lent? To them were entrusted the oracles of God, to us is entrusted the Virgin’s offspring, Immanuel, i. e. God with us, the cross of our Lord, His death, His resurrection. It cannot then be doubted that he owes most who receives most. Among men he perhaps offends most who is most in debt. By the mercy of the Lord the case is reversed, so that he loves most who owes most, if so be that he obtains grace. And therefore since there is nothing which we can worthily return to the Lord, woe be to me also if I shall not have loved. Let us then offer our love for the debt, for he loves most to whom most is given.

          <td><b>Beda</b>: More autem aquilae provocantis ad volandum pullos suos, dominus pedetentim discipulos suos ad sublimia erigit. Siquidem primo docet in synagogis et miracula facit; ex hinc duodecim, quos apostolos nominat, eligit; postmodum omnes praedicans secum ducit; unde sequitur et duodecim cum illo.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; But like the eagle, enticing its young ones to fly, our Lord, step by step, raises up His disciples to heavenly things. He first of all teaches in the synagogues, and performs miracles. He next chooses twelve whom He names Apostles; He afterwards takes them alone with Him, as He preached throughout the cities and villages, as it follows, And the twelve were with him.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Non docentes, aut praedicantes, sed instruendi ab eo. Ne autem femineus sexus prohiberi videretur sequi Christum, subditur et mulieres aliquae, quae erant curatae a spiritibus malis et infirmitatibus; Maria quae vocatur Magdalena, de qua septem Daemonia exierant.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Not teaching or preaching, but to be instructed by Him. But lest it should seem that the women were hindered from following Christ, it is added, And certain women which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Maria Magdalena ipsa est, cuius tacito nomine proxima lectio poenitentiam narrat. Nam pulchre Evangelista ubi eam cum domino iter facere commemorat, noto hanc vocabulo manifestat; ubi vero peccatricem, sed poenitentem describit, mulierem generaliter dicit, ne nomen tantae famae, prisci erroris nota fuscaret, de qua Daemonia septem exiisse referuntur.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Mary Magdalene is the same of whose repentance, without mention of her name, we have just read. For the Evangelist, when he relates her going with our Lord, rightly distinguishes her by her known name, but when describing the sinner but penitent, He speaks of her generally as a woman; lest the mark of her former guilt should blacken a name of so great report. Out of whom seven devils are reported to have gone, that it might be shown that she was full of all vices.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius in Evang</b>: Quid enim per septem Daemonia nisi universa vitia intelliguntur? Quia enim septem diebus omne tempus comprehenditur, recte septenario numero universitas figuratur. Septem ergo Daemonia Maria habuit, quae universis vitiis plena fuit. Sequitur et Ioanna uxor Chusae procuratoris Herodis, et Susanna, et aliae multae, quae ministrabant ei de facultatibus suis.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. For what is understood by the seven devils, but all vices? For since all time is comprehended by seven days, rightly by the number seven is universality represented: Mary therefore had seven devils, for she was full of every kind of vice. It follows, And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod’s steward, and Susanna, and many others who ministered to him of their substance.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Hieronymus Comm. super Matth</b>: Consuetudinis Iudaicae fuit, nec ducebatur in culpam more gentis antiquo, ut mulieres de substantia sua victum atque vestitum praeceptoribus darent. Hoc quia scandalum facere poterat in nationibus, Paulus se abiecisse commemorat. Ministrabant autem domino de substantia sua, ut meteret earum carnalia, cuius ipsae metebant spiritualia: non quod indigeret cibis dominus creaturarum; sed ut typum ostenderet magistrorum, quod victu atque vestitu de discipulis deberent esse contenti.
          <td><b>JEROME</b>; It was a Jewish custom, nor was it thought blamable, according to the ancient manners of that nation, that women should afford of their substance food and clothing to their teachers. This custom, as it might cause offense to the Gentiles, St. Paul relates he had cast off. But these ministered to the Lord of their substance, that He might reap their carnal things, from whom they had reaped spiritual things. Not that the Lord needed the food of His creatures, but that He might set an example to masters, that they ought to be content with food and clothing from their disciples.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Interpretatur autem Maria amarum mare propter poenitentiae rugitum, Magdalena turris, vel melius turrensis, a turre, de qua dicitur: factus est spes mea turris fortitudinis a facie inimici. Ioanna dominus gratia eius, vel dominus misericors interpretatur, videlicet quia eius est omne quod vivimus. Si autem Maria mundata a sorde vitiorum Ecclesiam de gentibus insinuat, cur non Ioanna eamdem designat Ecclesiam quondam idolorum cultui subditam? Nam quilibet malignus spiritus dum pro regno Diaboli facit, quasi Herodis procurator existit. Interpretatur Susanna lilium, aut gratia eius, propter odoriferum caelestis vitae candorem, aureumque internae dilectionis ardorem.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; But Mary is by interpretation, “bitter sea,” because of the loud wailing of her penitence; Magdalene, “a tower, or rather belonging to a tower,” from the tower of which it is said, you art become my hope, my strong tower from the face of my enemy. Joanna is by interpretation “the Lord her grace,” or “the merciful Lord,” for from Him comes every thing that we dive upon. But if Mary, cleansed from the corruption of her sins, points to the Church of the Gentiles, why does not Joanna represent the same Church formerly subject to the worship of idols? For every evil spirit whilst he acts for the devil’s kingdom, is as it were Herod’s steward. Susanna is interpreted, “a lily,” or its grace, because of the fragrance and whiteness of the heavenly life, and the golden heat of inward love.

And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture. 7. And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it. 8. And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit a hundred-fold. And when he had said these things, he cried, He that has ears to hear, let him hear. 9. And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be? 10. And he said, to you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand. 11. Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God. 12. Those by the way side are they that hear; then comes the devil, and takes away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved. 13. They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away. 14. And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection. 15. But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.</span>

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. That which David had foretold in the person of Christ, I will open my mouth in parables, the Lord here fulfills; as it is said, And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him out of every city, he spoke by a parable. But the Lord speaks by a parable, first indeed that He may make His hearers more attentive. For men were accustomed to exercise their minds on dark sayings, and to despise what was plain; and next, that the unworthy might not receive what was spokes mystically.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Origenes</b>: Et ideo signanter dicitur cum turba plurima conveniret: non enim sunt multi, sed pauci qui per arctam viam incedunt, et qui inveniunt viam quae ducit ad vitam: unde Matthaeus dicit quod extra domum docebat per parabolas, sed intra domum parabolam discipulis exposuit.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; And therefore it is significantly said, When much people were gathered together, and were come to him out of every city. For not many but few there are who walk the strait road, and find the way which leads to life. Hence Matthew says, that He taught without the house by parables, but within the house explained the parable to His disciples.

          <td><b>EUSEBIUS</b>; Now Christ most fitly puts forth His first parable to the multitude not only of those who then stood by, but of those also who were to come after them, inducing them to listen to His words, saying, A sower went out to sow his seed.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>, Now His going, Who is every where, was not local, but through the vale of the flesh He approached us. But Christ fitly denominates His advent, His going forth. For we were aliens from God, and cast out as criminals, and rebels to the king, but he who wishes to reconcile man, going out to them, speaks to them without, until having become meet for the royal presence, He brings them within; so also did Christ.

          <td><b>Eusebius</b>: Exierunt autem nonnulli a patria caelesti, et ad homines descenderunt, non tamen ut sererent, neque enim satores erant, sed administratorii spiritus in ministerium missi. Moyses etiam et prophetae post eum non inseruerunt hominibus mysteria regni caelorum; sed retrahendo insipientes ab errore nequitiae et idolorum cultu, quasi colebant animas hominum, et in novalia redigebant. Solus autem omnium sator verbum Dei exivit, evangelizaturus nova semina, scilicet mysteria regni caelorum.
          <td><b>EUSEBIUS</b>; Some went out from the heavenly country and descended among men, not however to sow, for they were not sowers, but ministering Spirits sent forth to minister. Moses also and the prophets after him did not plant in men the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but by keeping back the foolish from the error of iniquity, and the worship of idols, they tilled as it were the souls of men, and brought them into cultivation. But the only Sower of all, the Word of God, went out to sow the new seed of the Gospel, that is, the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Non cessat autem Dei filius semper in nostris animabus seminare; nam non solum cum docet, sed etiam cum creat, in nostris animabus seminat semina bona.

          <td><b>TITUS BOST</b>. But He went out to sow His seed, He receives not the word as borrowed, for He is by nature the Word of the living God. The seed is not then of Paul, or of John, but they have it because they have received it. Christ has His own seed, drawing forth His teaching from His own nature. Hence also the Jews said, How knows this man letters, having never learned?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Eusebius</b>: Docet igitur duos esse gradus eorum qui recipiunt semina: primum quidem eorum qui digni facti sunt vocatione caelesti, sed labuntur a gratia propter negligentiam et torporem; secundum vero multiplicantium semen in bonis fructibus. Ponit autem secundum Matthaeum tres differentias in quolibet gradu. Nam qui corrumpunt semen, non similem habent perditionis modum; et qui ab eo fructificant, non aequam recipiunt copiam. Sane actiones perdentium ostendit semen. Quidam enim cum non peccaverint, suis animabus insita sibi semina salubria perdiderunt, subtracta ab intentione et memoria eorum per spiritus malignos et Daemones, qui volant per aerem, vel viros fallaces et callidos, quae volatilia nuncupavit; unde subdit et dum seminat, aliud cecidit secus viam.
          <td><b>EUSEBIUS</b>; He teaches therefore that there are two classes of those who received the seed; the first, of those who have been made worthy of the heavenly calling, but fall from grace through carelessness and sloth; but the second, of those who multiply the seed bearing good fruit. But according to Matthew he makes three divisions in each class. For those who corrupt the seed have not all the same manner of destruction, and those who bear fruit from it do not receive an equal abundance. He wisely sets forth the cases of those who lose the seed. For some though they have not sinned, have lost the good seed implanted in their hearts, through its having been withdrawn from their thoughts and memory by evil spirits, and devils who fly through the air; or deceitful and cunning men, whom He calls the birds of the air. Hence it follows, And as he sowed, some fell by the way side.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Non dixit quod seminans proiecit aliud secus viam, sed quod semen cecidit. Qui enim seminat, docet rectum sermonem; sed sermo diversimode cadit in audientes, ut quidam eorum via dicantur. Et conculcatum est, et volucres caeli comederunt illud.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. He said not that the sower threw some on the way side, but that it fell by the way side. For he who sows taught the right word, but the word falls in different ways upon the hearers, so that some of them are called the way side: and it was trodden down, and the birds of the air devoured it.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Arida enim est et inculta quodammodo omnis via, eo quod a cunctis conculcatur, ac nihil ex seminibus humatur in ea. Sic igitur habentes cor indocile non penetrat divina monitio, ut possit laudem germinare virtutum; sed tales sunt via frequentata immundis spiritibus. Sunt iterum aliqui leviter gerentes fidem in se quasi in verborum simplicitate; horum fides caret radice; de quibus subditur et aliud cecidit supra petram, et natum aruit, quia non habebat humorem.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; For every way side is in some measure dry and uncultivated, because it is trodden down by all men, and no seed gains moisture on it. So the divine warning reaches not the unteachable heart, that it should bring forth the praise of virtue. These then are the ways frequented by unclean spirits. There are again some who bear faith about them, as if it consisted in the nakedness of words; their faith is without root, of whom it is added, And some fell upon a rock, and as soon as it sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Petram dicit durum et indomitum cor. Hoc est autem humor ad radicem seminis, quod iuxta aliam parabolam oleum ad lampades virginum nutriendas, idest amor et perseverantia virtutis.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; The rock, he says, is the hard and unsubdued heart. Now the moisture at the root of the seed is the same as what is called in another parable, the oil to trim the lamps of the virgins, that is, love and steadfastness in virtue.

          <td><b>Eusebius</b>: Sunt etiam aliqui qui per avaritiam et appetitum voluptatum et mundanas sollicitudines, quas quidem spinas nuncupat, immissum sibi semen suffocari fecerunt; de quibus subditur et aliud cecidit inter spinas; et simul exortae spinae suffocaverunt illud.
          <td><b>EUSEBIUS</b>; There are also some who through covetousness, the desire of pleasure and worldly cares, which indeed Christ calls thorns, suffer the seed which has been sown in them to be choked.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Matthaeum</b>: Sicut enim spinae non permittunt oriri semen, sed ex condensatione suffocant immissum; sic sollicitudines vitae praesentis semen spirituale fructificare non sinunt. Increpandus autem esset agricola qui super sensibiles spinas, et petram, et viam seminaret. Non enim possibile est petram terram fieri, nec viam non esse viam, nec spinas non esse spinas; in rationalibus autem secus est; possibile est enim petram converti in terram pinguem, et viam non conculcari, et spinas dissipari.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. For as the thorns do not let the seed grow up, but when it has been sown choke it by thickening round it, so the cares of this present life permit not the seed to bear fruit. But in things of sense the husbandman must be reproved who would sow amid thorns on a rock and the way side, for it is impossible that the rocks should become earth, the way not be a way, the thorns not be thorns. But in rational things it is otherwise. For it is possible that the rock should be converted into a fruitful soil, the way not be trodden down, the thorns dispersed.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Sunt autem terra pinguis et ferax, animae honestae et bonae, quae in profundo suscipiunt verbi semina, et retinent, et fovent; et quantum ad hoc subditur et aliud cecidit in terram bonam, et ortum fecit fructum centuplum. Cum enim in mentem mundam ab omnibus perturbationibus verbum divinum infunditur, tunc immittit radices in profundum, et germinat tamquam spica, et convenienter perficitur.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Now the rich and fruitful ground is the honest and good hearts which receive deeply the seeds of the word, and retain them and cherish them. And whatever is added to this, And some fell upon good ground and springing up, brought forth fruit a hundred-fold. For when the divine word is poured into a soul free from all anxieties, then it strikes root deep, and sends forth as it were the ear, and in its due season comes to perfection.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Fructum enim centuplum, fructum perfectum dicit: nam denarius numerus pro perfectione semper accipitur, quia in decem praeceptis legis custodia continetur: denarius autem numerus per semetipsum multiplicatus in centenarium surgit; unde per centenarium magna perfectio significatur.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; For by fruit a hundred-fold, he means perfect fruit. For the number ten is always taken to imply perfection, because in ten precepts is contained the keeping, or the observance of the law. But the number ten multiplied by itself amounts to a hundred; hence by a hundred very great perfection is signified.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Quae autem sit sententia parabolae, accipiamus per eum qui eam composuit; unde sequitur haec dicens clamabat: qui habet aures audiendi, audiat.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; But what the meaning of the parable is, let us hear from him who made it, as it follows, And when he had said these things, he cried, He that has ears to hear, let him hear.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Basilius</b>: Audire pertinet ad intellectum: unde per hoc dominus excitat ad exaudiendum attente mentionem eorum quae dicuntur.

          <td><b>Beda</b>: Quoties enim haec admonitio vel in Evangelio, vel in Apocalypsi Ioannis interponitur, mysticum esse quod dicitur, quaerendumque a nobis intentius ostenditur; unde discipuli ignorantes, salvatorem interrogant; sequitur enim interrogabant autem eum discipuli eius quae esset haec parabola. Nemo tamen putet finita mox parabola discipulos hoc interrogasse; sed, ut Marcus ait: cum esset singularis, interrogaverunt eum.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; For as often as the admonition occurs either in the Gospel or the Revelation of St. John, it signifies that there is a mystical meaning in what is said, and we must inquire more closely into it. Hence the disciples who were ignorant ask our Savior, for it follows, And his disciples asked him, &amp;c. But let no one suppose that as soon as the parable was finished His disciples asked Him, but, as Mark says, When he was alone they asked him.

Non est autem ad litteram factum quod dicitur exiit qui seminat, sicut ea narrat historia, possibile tamen fuit fieri.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; Now a parable is a narration of an action as done, yet not done according to the letter, though it might have been, representing certain things by means of others which are given in the parable. An enigma is a continued story of things which are spoken of as done, and yet have not been done, nor are possible to be done, but contains a concealed meaning, as that which is mentioned in the Book of Judges, that the trees went forth to anoint a king over them. But it was not literally a fact as is said, A sower went out to sow, like those facts related in history, yet it might have been so.

          <td><b>GREG. NAZ</b>. When you hear this you must not entertain the notion of different natures, as certain heretics do, who think that some men indeed are of a perishing nature, others of a saving nature, but that some are so constituted that their will leads them to better or worse.

Huius ergo gratia hoc eis Christus abscondit, ne maius eis praeiudicium generetur, si postquam noverint Christi mysteria, contempserint. Qui enim intelligit et postea spernit, gravius punietur.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. But to those who are unworthy of such mysteries, they are obscurely spoken. Hence it follows, But to the rest in parables, that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand. For they think they see, but see not, and hear indeed, but do not understand. For this reason Christ hides this from them, lest they should beget a greater prejudice against them, if after they had known the mysteries of Christ, they despised them. For he who understands and afterwards despises, shall be more severely punished.

          <td><b>EUSEBIUS</b>. Now He says, that there are three reasons why men destroy the seed implanted in their hearts. For some destroy the seed that is hid in them by lightly giving heed to those that wish to deceive, of whom He adds, Those by the way side are they that hear: their comes the devil, and takes away the word out of their hearts..

          <td><b>EUSEBIUS</b>. But some there are who having not received the word in any depth of heart, are soon overcome when adversity assails them, of whom it is added, They on the rock are they which when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.

          <td><b>GREG</b>. Many men propose to begin a good work, but as soon as they have become annoyed by adversity or temptation, they abandon what they had begun. The rocky ground then had no moisture to carry on to constancy fruit which it had put forth.

Duo autem sunt quae divitiis iungit, sollicitudines et voluptates: quia per curam mentem opprimunt, et per affluentiam resolvunt. Suffocant autem semen, quia importunis cogitationibus guttur mentis strangulant; et dum bonum desiderium intrare ad cor non sinunt, quasi aditum vitalis flatus vetant.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. It is wonderful that the Lord has represented riches as thorns, for these prick, while those delight, and yet they are thorns, for they lacerate the mind by the prickings of their thoughts, and whenever they entice to see they draw blood, as if inflicting a wound. But there are two things which He joins to riches, cares and pleasures, for they oppress the mind by anxiety and unnerve it by luxuries, but they choke the seed, for they strangle the throat of the heart with vexatious thoughts, and while they let not a good desire enter the heart, they close up as it were the passage of the vital breath.

Consequenter ponit bonam terram contrario modo se habentem ad viam, et petram, et spinas, cum subdit quod autem in terram bonam, hi sunt qui in corde bono et optimo verbum retinent, et fructum afferunt in patientia. Nam qui secus viam positi sunt, non retinent verbum, sed rapit eis semen Diabolus: qui vero sunt in petra, non sustinent in patientia tentationis insultum propter imbecillitatem; qui vero sunt in spinis, non fructificant, sed suffocantur.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. And to sum up many things in a few words. Some indeed as careless hearers, some as weak, but others as the very slaves of pleasure and worldly things, hold aloof from what is good. The order of the way side, the rock, and the thorns is well, for we have first need of recollection and caution, next of fortitude, and then of contempt of things present. He therefore places the good ground in opposition to the way, the rock, and the thorns. But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, &amp;c. For they who are on the way side keep not the word, but the devil takes away their seed. But they who are on the rock sustain not patiently the assaults of temptation through weakness. But they who are among thorns bear no fruit, but are choked.

          <td><b>GREG</b>. The good ground then beans fruit through patience, for nothing we do is good unless we endure patiently our closest evils. They therefore bear fruit through patience, who when they bear strifes humbly, are after the scourge received with joy to a heavenly rest.

Hence he adds, For nothing is secret that shall not be made manifest, neither any thing hid that shall not be known, and come abroad.

It becomes not him then who lights the light of reason in his soul to hide it under a bed where men sleep, nor under any vessel, for he who does this provides not for those who enter the house for whom the candle is prepared, but they must set it upon a candlestick, that is, the whole Church.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; The moral teacher who gives himself an example to others, when about to enjoin upon others, that he who has not left father and mother, is not worthy of the Son of God, first submits Himself to this precept, not that He denies the claims of filial piety, (for it is His own sentence, He that knows not his father and mother shall die the death,) but because He knows that He is more bound to obey His Father’s mysteries than the feelings of His mother. Nor however are His parents harshly rejected, but the bonds of the mind are shown to be more sacred than those of the body. Therefore in this place He does not disown His mother, (as some heretics say, eagerly catching at His speech,) since she is also acknowledged from the cross; but the law of heavenly ordinances is preferred to earthly affection.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Matthaeum</b>: Non autem hoc dixit increpando matrem, sed eam plurimum adiuvando. Nam si erga ceteros sollicitus erat, ut generaret eis de se debitam opinionem, multo magis erga matrem: non autem elevasset eam ad illa fastigia, si semper expectaret honorari ab eo tamquam a filio, non autem eum dominum reputaret.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Now He does not say this by way of reproof to His mother, but to greatly assist her, for if He was anxious for others to beget in them a just opinion of Himself, much more was He for His mother. And He had not raised her to such a height if she were always to expect to be honored by Him as a son, and never to consider Him as her Lord.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Quidam vero hoc sic intelligunt, quod Christo docente quidam invidentes, subsannantes eum super doctrina eius, dixerunt mater tua, et fratres tui stant foris volentes te videre: tamquam propter hoc ignobilem eum demonstrarent: et ideo qui mentem eorum cognovit, sic eis respondit, quoniam non nocet vilis consanguinitas; sed si ignobilis quis existat, audiat autem verbum Dei, ipsum consanguineum reputat. Quia tamen audire solum neminem salvat, sed magis condemnat, subiungit et faciunt: decet enim audire, et facere. Verbum autem Dei dicit suam doctrinam: quaecumque enim ipse dicebat, patris erant.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. But some take this to mean that certain men, hating Christ’s teaching, and mocking at Him for His doctrine, said, Your mother and your brethren stand without wishing to see you; as if thereby to show His meanness of birth. And He therefore knowing their hearts gave them this answer, that meanness of birth harms not, but if a man, though of low birth, hear the word of God, He reckons him as His kinsman. Because however hearing only saves no one, but rather condemns, He adds, and does it; for it becomes us both to hear and to do. But by the word of God He means His own teaching. for all the words which He Himself spoke were from His Father.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Mystice autem non debuit foris stare qui Christum quaerebat; unde et ille ait: accedite ad eum, et illuminamini. Si enim foris stant, nec ipsi agnoscuntur parentes; et propter nostrum fortasse non agnoscuntur exemplum, quemadmodum nos non agnoscimur si foris stemus. Illud quoque intelligere non abhorret, quia per figuram parentum demonstrat Iudaeos, ex quibus est Christus secundum carnem, Ecclesiamque synagogae credidit praeferendam.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; In a mystical sense he ought not to stand without who was seeking Christ. Hence also that saying, Come to him, and be enlightened. For if they stand without, not even parents themselves are acknowledged; and perhaps for our example they are not. How are we acknowledged by Him if we stand without? That meaning also is not unreasonable, because by the figure of parents He points to the Jews of whom Christ was born, and thought the Church to be preferred to the synagogue.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Intus enim eo docente venientes intrare nequeunt, cuius spiritualiter intelligere dicta negligunt. Praeoccupans autem turba intravit in domum; quia differente Iudaea, gentilitas confluxit ad Christum. Foris autem stantes volunt Christum videre, qui spiritualem in lege sensum non quaerentes, sese ad custodiam litterae foris fixerunt; et quasi Christum potius ad docenda carnalia cogunt exire, quam se ad discenda spiritualia consentiunt intrare.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; For they cannot enter within when He is teaching whose words they refuse to understand spiritually. But the multitude went before and entered into the house, because when the Jews rejected Christ the Gentiles flocked to Him. But those who stand without, wishing to see Christ, are they, who not seeking a spiritual sense in the law, have placed themselves without to guard the letter of it, and as it were rather compel Christ to go out, to teach them earthly things, than consent to enter in themselves to learn spiritual things.

Et ascenderunt.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; When the disciples saw that all men received help from Christ, it seemed fitting that they themselves also should in turn rejoice in the benefits of Christ. For no one regards that which happens in the person of another equally with that to himself. The Lord therefore exposed the disciples to the sea and the winds, as it follows, Now it came to pass on a certain, day that he went into a ship with his disciples; and he said to them, Let us go over to the other side of the lake: and they launched forth.

        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Si autem vigilante domino accidisset tempestas, vel non timuissent discipuli, vel non exhorruissent, vel non credidissent eum posse tale aliquid facere. Quapropter dormit, praestans tempus timori; sequitur enim navigantibus autem illis, obdormivit, et descendit procella venti in stagnum.
          <td>Now if the storm had arisen when our Lord was awake, the disciples either had not feared, or not believed that He could do such a thing. For this cause He sleeps, giving them an occasion for fear; for it follows, But as they sailed he fell asleep; and there came down a storm of wind on the lake.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Supra habes quia pernoctabat in oratione; quomodo hic in tempestate dormit? Sed exprimitur securitas potestatis; quomodo omnibus timentibus solus intrepidus quiescebat, sed quiescebat corporis somno cum intenderet divinitatis mysterio; nihil enim sine verbo fit.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; We are told above, moreover, that He passed the night in prayer. How then does He here fall asleep in a storm? The security of power is expressed, that while all were afraid, He alone lay fearless; but He lay asleep in the body, while in the mind he was in the mystery of divinity. For nothing happens without the Word.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Cum magna autem dispensatione videtur esse peractum ne mox postquam tempestas invadere coepit naviculam, quaererent ab eo suffragium, sed postquam malum invaluit, ut manifestior fiat divinae maiestatis potestas; unde dicitur et compellebantur, et periclitabantur: quod quidem dominus permisit exercitationis gratia, ut cum confessi fuerint periculum, cognoscant miraculi magnitudinem. Unde postquam magnitudo periculi in intolerabilem metum eos urgebat, tamquam aliam spem non habentes salutis nisi solum ipsum dominum virtutum, eum excitaverunt. Sequitur accedentes autem suscitaverunt eum, dicentes: praeceptor, perimus.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; But it seems to have been especially and wonderfully ordained that they should not seek His assistance when first the storm began to affect the boat, but after the danger had increased, in order that the power of the Divine Majesty might be made more manifest. Hence it is said, And they were filled with water, and were in jeopardy. This indeed our Lord allowed for the sake of trial, that having confessed their danger they should acknowledge the greatness of the miracle. Hence when their great danger had driven them into intolerable fear, having no other hope of safety but the Lord of power Himself, they awoke Him. It follows, And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, we perish.

Quamquam etiam hoc fieri potuerit ut, pluribus eum excitantibus, omnia haec, aliud autem ab alio diceretur.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Matthew says, Master, save us, we perish. Mark, Master, care you not that we perish? There is the same expression in all of men awakening our Lord, and anxious for their safety. Nor is it worth while to inquire which of these was most likely to have been said to Christ. For whether they said one of these three, or some other words which no Evangelist has mentioned, but of the same import, what matter is it? Though at the same time this may have been the case, that by the many who awoke Him, all these things were said, one by one, and another by another.

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; But it could not be that they should perish while the Almighty was with them. Christ then arose, Who has power over all things, and immediately quells the storm and the violence of the wind, and the tempest ceased, and there was a calm. Herein He shows Himself to be God, to Whom it is said, You rule the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof arise, you still them.

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; But together with the raging of the waters, He quiets also the tumult of their souls, as it follows, And he said to them, Where is your faith? By which word He showed, that it is not so much the assault of temptation which causes fear, as faint-heartedness. For as gold is proved in the fire, so is faith in temptation.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Cons. Evang</b>: Hoc autem ab aliis Evangelistis aliis verbis dictum est. Matthaeus enim dicit eum dixisse: quid timidi estis modicae fidei? Marcus autem dicit: quid timidi estis? Necdum habetis fidem? Idest illam perfectam velut granum sinapis. Hoc ergo et ille ait: modicae fidei; Lucas autem: ubi est fides vestra? Et totum quidem dici potuit: quid timidi estis? Ubi est fides vestra? Modicae fidei? Unde aliud hic, aliud ille commemorat.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Now this is related by the other Evangelists in different words. For Matthew says, that Jesus said, Why are you fearful, O you of little faith? but Mark as follows, Why are you so fearful? How is it that you have no faith i. e. that perfect faith like the grain of mustard seed. Mark then also says, O you of little faith; but Luke, Where is your faith? And indeed all these may have been said, Why are you fearful? Where is your faith? O you of little faith. Hence one Evangelist relates one, another another.

          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Pacata igitur tempestate ad imperium Christi, discipuli stupefacti miraculo, susurrabant ad invicem; unde sequitur qui timentes, mirati sunt, ad invicem dicentes: quis, putas, hic est, quia et ventis imperat et mari, et obediunt? Non autem discipuli, ut ignorantes eum, hoc dixerunt ad invicem; noverant enim eum Deum esse, et filium Dei Iesum: admirantur autem innatae potestatis abundantiam, et divinitatis gloriam; quamvis similis nobis esset et visibilis secundum carnem; unde dicunt quis est hic? Idest qualis et quantus, et in quanta virtute et maiestate? Imperiosum enim est opus, dominativum praeceptum, non servilis petitio.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; When the tempest was quelled at the command of Christ, the disciples in astonishment whispered one to the other, as it follows, And they being afraid wondered, &amp;c. Now the disciples said not this as ignorant of Him, for they knew that He was God, and Jesus the Son of God. But they marvel at the exceeding vastness of His natural power, and the glory of His divinity, although He was like to us, and visible in the flesh. Hence they say, Who is this? that is, of what manner of man? how great, and with what great power and majesty? for it is a mighty work, a lordly command, no abject petition.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Or, it was not His disciples, but the sailors and others in the ship who ho wondered. But allegorically, the sea or lake is the dark and bitter tide of the world, the ship is the wood of the cross, by help of which the faithful, having passed the waves of this world, reach the shore of a heavenly country.

Fluctibus autem non domini patientia turbatur, sed discipulorum imbecillitas concutitur et trepidat: qui suscitarunt dominum ne eo dormiente pereant: quia cuius mortem viderant, resurrectionem optant: quae si differetur, ipsi in perpetuum perirent. Unde surgens increpat ventum: quia celeri resurrectione per mortem destruit superbiam Diaboli, qui habebat imperium mortis. Tempestatem autem aquae facit cessare, quia rabiem Iudaeorum morti eius insultantium resurgens labefacit.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; His disciples also, when summoned, enter in with Him. Hence He says, If any one will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. While His disciples are sailing, that is, the faithful passing through this world, and meditating in their minds the rest of the world to come, and by the breath of the Holy Spirit, or also their own exertions, eagerly leaving behind them the unbelieving pride of the world, suddenly our Lord fell asleep, that is, the time of our Lord’s passion was come, and the storm descended. For when our Lord entered the sleep of death upon the cross, the waves of persecution rose, stirred up by the breath of the devil, but while the patience of the Lord is not disturbed by the waves, the faint hearts of the disciples are shaken and tremble. They awoke our Lord lest they should perish while He slept, because having seen His death they wish for His resurrection, for if that were delayed they would perish for ever. He rises therefore and rebukes the wind, since by His sudden rising again He put down the pride of the devil who had the power of death. But He makes the tempest of nature to cease, since by His resurrection He baffled the rage of the Jews, who plotted His death.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Et advertas, sine tentatione neminem posse ex hoc vitae curriculo demigrare, quia exercitium fidei tentatio est. Subiecti igitur sumus nequitiae spiritualis procellis; sed quasi pervigiles nautae gubernatorem excitemus, qui non serviat, sed imperet ventis; qui etsi iam non dormiat sui corporis somno, caveamus tamen ne nostri corporis somno nobis dormiat, et quiescat. Bene autem arguuntur qui praesente Christo timebant, cum utique ibi aderat qui perire non posset.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; You must remember that no one can pass from the course of this life without temptations, for temptation is the trial of faith. We are therefore subject to the storms of spiritual wickedness, but as watchful sailors we must awake the Pilot, who does not obey but commands the winds, who although He now no longer sleeps in the sleep of His own body, yet let us beware, lest through the sleep of our bodies He is to us asleep and at rest. But they are rightly reproved who feared, when Christ was present; since he surely who clings to Him can in no wise perish.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Cui simile est quod post mortem discipulis apparens exprobravit incredulitatem eorum: et sic tumidis gurgitibus sedatis, patefecit cunctis potentiam suae divinitatis.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; In like manner, when He appeared after His death to His disciples, He upbraided them with their unbelief, and thus having calmed the swelling waves, He made plain to all the power of His divinity.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Salvator navigando una cum discipulis ad portum pervenit; unde dicitur et navigaverunt ad regionem Gerazenorum, quae est contra Galilaeam.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; The Savior, as He sailed with His disciples, came to a port, as it is said, And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Titus</b>: Veraciora exemplaria nec Gerazenorum habent, nec Gadarorum, sed Gergezinorum; est enim Gadara civitas in Iudaea, stagnum autem vel mare nullatenus invenitur in ea; sed Geraza civitas Arabiae est, nec stagnum, nec mare iuxta habens. Est autem Gergeza, a qua Gergezaei, urbs antiqua iuxta Tiberiacum stagnum, circa quam est rupes stagno vicina, in quod ostenditur deiectos fuisse porcos a Daemonibus. Quia tamen Geraza et Gedara confinium habent cum terra Gergezinorum, verisimile est inde ad horum terram porcos fuisse adductos.
          <td><b>TITUS BOST</b>. Many accurate copies have neither “Gerazenes” nor “Gadarenes,” but “Gergezenes.” For Gadara is a city in Judea, but neither lake nor sea is found at it, and Geraza is a city of Arabia, having neither lake nor sea near. But Gergeza, from which the Gergezenes are called, is an ancient city near the lake of Tiberias, above which is a rock hanging over the lake, into which they say the swine were dashed down by the devils. But since Gadara and Geraza border upon the land of the Gergezenes, it is probable that the swine were led from thence to their parts.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Geraza enim urbs est insignis Arabiae trans Iordanem iuncta monti Galaad, quam tenuit tribus Manasse, non longe a stagno Tiberiadis, in quo porci praecipitati sunt.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; For Geraza is a famous city of Arabia, on the other side of the Jordan, close to the mountain of Galaad, which was possessed by the tribe of Manasseh, and not far from the lake of Tiberias, into which the swine were cast headlong.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Matthaeum</b>: Cum autem dominus descendisset a mari, occurrit ei aliud terribilius miraculum: nam daemoniacus, tamquam servus videns dominum, servitutem confitetur; unde sequitur et cum egressus esset ad terram, occurrit illi vir quidam qui Daemonium habebat iam temporibus multis.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But as soon as our Lord had departed from the sea, He meets with another more awful wonder. For the demoniac, like an evil slave, when he sees Him confirms his bondage, as it follows, And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, &amp;c.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Cons. Evang</b>: Quod Matthaeus duos dicit fuisse daemoniacos, Marcus autem et Lucas unum commemorant, intelligas unum eorum fuisse personae alicuius clarioris et famosioris, quem regio illa maxime dolebat, et pro cuius salute plurimum satagebat. Hoc volentes significare duo Evangelistae, solum commemorandum iudicaverunt de quo facti huius fama latius praeclariusque fragraverat.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Whereas Matthew says, that there were two possessed, but Mark and Luke mention only one; you must understand one of them to be a more distinguished and famous person, for whom that neighborhood was chiefly distressed, and in whose restoration they were greatly interested. Wishing to signify this, the two Evangelists thought right to mention him alone, concerning whom the report of this miracle had been most extensively noised abroad.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Matthaeum</b>: Vel Lucas elegit ex illis duobus eum qui saevior erat: unde flebilius narrat eius infortunium, cum subdit et vestimentis non induebatur, neque in domo manebat, sed in monumentis. Visitant autem Daemones mortuorum sepulchra, volentes imbuere homines periculosa doctrina, quod scilicet mortuorum animae Daemones fiunt.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Or, Luke selected from the two the one who was most savage. Hence he gives the most melancholy account of his calamity, adding, And he wore no clothes, neither abode in any house, but in the tombs. But the evil spirits visit the tombs of the dead, to instill into men that dangerous notion, that the souls of the dead become evil spirits.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Quod autem nudus petebat defunctorum sepulchra, daemoniacae ferocitatis erat indicium. Permittit autem quosdam dispensative Deus subesse Daemonibus, ut nos perpendamus per eos quales sunt Daemones erga nos, ut renuamus eis subici velle; et sic uno patiente aedificantur quamplures.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Now his going naked among the tombs of the dead was a mark of demoniacal wildness. But God permits some in His providence to become subject to evil spirits, that we may ascertain through them of what hat kind the evil spirits are towards us, in order that we may refuse to be made subject to them, and so by the suffering of one many may be edified.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Quia vero hominem eum populi fatebantur, accesserunt Daemones divinitatem praedicantes ipsius, quam etiam mare sua tranquillitate clamaverat; unde sequitur is ut vidit Iesum, procidit ante illum, et exclamavit voce magna, et dixit.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But because the people acknowledged Him to be man, the devils came publishing His divinity, which even the sea had proclaimed by its calmness. Hence it follows, When he saw Jesus he fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, &amp;c.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Attendas hic timorem annexum audaciae et desperationi multae; signum enim diabolicae desperationis est in audendo dicere quid mihi et tibi est, Iesu fili Dei altissimi? Timoris vero cum precatur obsecro te, ne me torqueas. Sed si nosti eum esse filium Dei altissimi, fateris eum Deum caeli et terrae, et eorum quae continentur in eis. Qualiter igitur non tua, immo sua usurpas, et dicis quid mihi et tibi? Quis autem principum terrenorum omnino sustinebit a barbaris lacessiri suo subiectos imperio? Unde sequitur praecipiebat enim spiritui immundo ut exiret ab homine; et necessitatem praecepti ostendit subdens multis enim temporibus arripiebat illum; et vinciebatur catenis et compedibus custoditus; et ruptis vinculis agebatur a Daemonio in deserta.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Mark here the combination of fear with boldness and great desperation, for it is a sign of devilish despair to spear; out boldly, What have I to do with you, Jesus, you Son of God most high? but of fear when they pray, I beseech you not to cast me out. But if you know Him to be the Son of God most high, you confess Him to be the God of heaven and earth, and of all things that are contained in them. How then cost you make use not of your own but His words, saying, What have I to do with you? But what earthly prince will altogether endure to have his subjects tormented by barbarians? Hence it follows, For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of him. And He shows the necessity of the command, adding, For oftentimes it had caught him, &amp;c.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Unde, quia nemo audebat daemoniacum tenere, ipse Christus ad eum vadit, alloquens ipsum. Sequitur interrogavit autem illum Iesus, dicens: quod tibi nomen est? Non velut inscius nomen inquirit, sed ut confessa peste quam tolerabat, virtus curantis gratior emicaret.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Therefore since no one could hold the possessed, Christ goes to him and addresses him. It follows, And Jesus asked him, saying, What is your name?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Sed et nostri temporis sacerdotes qui per exorcismi gratiam Daemones eicere norunt, solent dicere, patientes non aliter valere curari, nisi omne quod ab immundis spiritibus vigilantes dormientesve pertulerint, confitendo patenter exponant; et maxime quando corporis humani concubitum petere se ac patrare confingunt; unde et hic confessio subditur: at ille dixit: legio; quia intraverant Daemonia multa in eum.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; He inquires not his name as ignorant of it, but that when the demoniac had confessed the plague which he endured, the power of the Healer might shine forth more welcome to him. But the priests also of our time, who through the grace of exorcism are able to cast out devils, are wont to say that the sufferers can no otherwise be cured than by openly telling in confession every thing which either waking or sleeping they have endured from the unclean spirits, and above all when they imagine that the devils seek and obtain the possession of the human body. So also here the confession is added, And he said, Legion, because many devils were entered into him.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius Nyssenus</b>: Imitantes quidam Daemones supernas militias et legiones angelicas, dicunt se legionem, sicut et eorum princeps dicit se positurum thronum super astra, ut fiat altissimo similis.
          <td><b>GREG NYSS</b>. Certain evil spirits imitating the heavenly hosts and the legions of angels say that they are legions. As also their prince says that he will exalt his throne above the stars that he may be like to the Most High.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Postquam autem dominus supervenerat Daemonibus creaturam Dei perturbantibus, putabant eum propter excessum eorum quae fiebant non expectare tempus supplicii: et quia culpam diffiteri non poterant, instant ne cito sustineant poenam; unde sequitur et rogaverunt illum ne imperaret illis ut in abyssum irent.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But when the Lord had overcome the evil spirits which disturbed His creatures, they thought that because of the enormity of those things which had been done, He would not wait the time of their punishment, and therefore since they could not deny their guilt, they entreat that they may not quickly undergo the penalty. As it follows, And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Quod quidem postulant Daemones volentes adhuc cum hominibus conversari.

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; And hence it is plain that the rebel hosts against the Divine Majesty were thrust down to hell by the unspeakable power of the Savior.

          <td><b>Maximus</b>: Statuit autem Deus unicuique peccatorum consonam poenam; Gehennam ignis propter carnis incendium, stridorem dentium propter risum lascivum, intolerabilem sitim propter voluptatem et crapulam, pervigilem vermem propter obliquum et malignum cor, caliginem perpetuam propter ignorantiam et fallaciam, Lymbum abyssi propter superbiam: unde Daemonibus tamquam superbis abyssus delegatur. Sequitur erat autem ibi grex multorum porcorum pascentium in monte.
          <td><b>MAXIM</b>. Now the Lord ordains for each class of sinners an appropriate punishment. The fire of Hell unquenchable for fleshly burnings, gnashing of teeth for wanton mirth, intolerable thirst for pleasure and revelry, the worm that dies not for a crooked and malignant heart, everlasting darkness for ignorance and deceit, the bottomless pit for pride. Hence the deep is assigned to the devils as to the proud, it follows, And there was there an herd of swine, &amp;c.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Cons. Evang</b>: Quod Marcus dixit circa montem fuisse gregem porcorum, Lucas autem in monte, non repugnat: grex enim porcorum tam magnus fuit, ut aliquid eius esset in monte, aliquid circa montem: erant enim duo millia porcorum, sicut Marcus expressit.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. The words of Mark that there was a herd of swine nigh to the mountains, and of Luke, on the mountains, do not differ from one another. For the herd of swine was so large, that they might be part on the mountain, part near it. For there were two thousand swine, as Mark has stated.

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; The multitude of unclean spirits seek therefore to be sent into the herd of unclean swine, like to themselves, for it follows, And they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them.

          <td><b>ATHAN</b>. But if they have no power over swine, the evil spirits have much less against men who are made after the image of God. We ought then to fear God alone, but despise them.

          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Dominus autem concessit eis potestatem, ut hoc inter cetera fiat nobis causa salutis, et roboris spes. Sequitur et permisit illos.

Et ideo concessit eis Christus petentibus, ut ex eventu appareat quam sint crudeles. Erat etiam necessarium ostendere filium Dei providentiam rerum habere non minus quam pater, ut aequalitatis decor in utroque appareat.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; But the Lord granted them permission, that this might be among other things to us an occasion of benefit, and the confidence of our safety. It follows, And he suffered them. We must therefore consider that the evil spirits are hostile to those which are subject to them, and this will be evident from their sending down the swine violently into the waters and choking them; as it follows, Then went the devils out of the man and entered into the swine, and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked. And this Christ permitted to them which sought it, that it might appear from the event how cruel they are. It was also necessary to show that the Son of God has no less power to foresee than the Father, that equal glory might be manifested in each.

          <td><b>TITUS BOST</b>. But the shepherds take flight, lest they should perish with the swine. Hence it follows, When they that fed them saw what was done they fled, and went and told it in the city and in the country, and excited the like alarm among the citizens. But the severity of their loss led them to the Savior; for it follows, Then they went out to see what was done, and came to Jesus; and here remark, that while God punishes men in their substance, He confers a blessing upon their souls. But when they had set out, they see him in his right mind who had been long vexed. It follows, And they found the man out of whom the devils had departed sitting at the feet of Jesus clothed, (whereas before he was naked,) and in his right mind. For he departed not from those feet, where he obtained safety; and so acknowledging the miracle, they were astonished at the cure of the malady, and marveled at the event; for it follows, And they were afraid. But this thing they discover partly by sight, partly hearing it in words. It follows, They also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed, of the devils was healed. But they ought to have besought the Lord not to depart from them, but to be the guardian of their country, that no evil spirits might come near them; but through fear they lost their own salvation, asking the Savior to depart. It follows, Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes rounds about besought him to depart from them, for they were taken with great fear.

By the expression that there was in him a legion of devils, the nations are signified who served many devils.

Neque enim in his qui fluido aestu voluptatis huc atque illuc feruntur, illius spiritus potest esse vitale commercium. Videmus igitur quia homo ipse suae est auctor aerumnae: nam nisi quis porci more vixisset, numquam accepisset in eum Diabolus potestatem; aut si accepisset, non ut perderet, sed ut probaret: et fortasse Diabolus, quia post domini adventum bonos iam depraedari non poterat, non omnium hominum, sed levium quaerit interitum; ut latro non armatis, sed insidiatur inermibus. Viderunt hoc magistri gregum, et fugerunt: neque enim vel philosophiae professores vel principes synagogae pereuntibus populis possunt ferre medicinam: solus est Christus qui aufert peccata populorum.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; They are carried violently down, for they are reclaimed not by the contemplation of any good deed, but thrust as from a higher place to a lower, along the downward path of iniquity, they perish amidst tile waves of this world, shut out from the approach of air. For they who are carried to and fro by the rapid tide of pleasure cannot receive the communication of the Spirit; we see then that man himself is the author of his own misery. For unless a man lived like the swine, the devil would never have received power over him, or received it, not to destroy but to prove him. And perhaps the devil, who after the coming of our Lord can no longer steal away the good, seeks not the destruction of all men, but only the wanton, as the robber lies ill wait not for armed men, but the unarmed. When those who kept the herd saw this they fled. For neither the teachers of philosophy not the chief of the synagogue can bring a cure to perishing mankind. It is Christ alone who takes away the sins of the people.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Vel quod porcorum pastores fugientes ista nuntiaverunt, significat quosdam primates impiorum, quamquam Christianam legem fugientes, potentiam tamen eius pergentes stupendo et mirando praedicare. Quod autem Gerazeni cognoscentes quod factum est, rogant Iesum ut ab eis discederet, magno timore perculsi, significat magnitudinem vetusta suavitate delectatam, honorare quidem, sed nolle pati Christianam legem, dum dicunt quod eam implere non possunt; admirantes tamen fidelem populum a pristina perdita conversatione sanatum.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or, by the herdsmen of the swine flying and telling these things, He represents certain rulers of the wicked, who though they evade the law of Christianity, yet proclaim it among the nations by their astonishment and wonder. But by the Gerasenes, when they knew what was done, asking Jesus to depart from them, for they were struck with great fear, he represents the multitude delighting in their old pleasures, honoring indeed, but unwilling to endure the Christian law, saying that they cannot fulfill it, while they still marvel at the faithful released from their former abandoned mode of life.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Vel in Gerazenorum civitate species synagogae videtur existere: qui rogabant ut discederet, quia timore magno tenebantur; infirma enim mens non capit Dei verbum, nec potest pondus sustinere sapientiae. Et ideo diutius molestus non fuit, sed ascendit ab inferioribus ad superiora, a synagoga scilicet ad Ecclesiam: et regressus est per stagnum: nemo enim de Ecclesia ad synagogam sine periculo transit salutis; sed ille qui de synagoga ad Ecclesiam transire desiderat, crucem suam tollat, ut discrimen evadat.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Or there seems to have been a kind of synagogue in the city of the Gerasenes who besought our Lord to depart, because they were seized with great fear. For the weak mind receives not the word of God, nor can it endure the burden of wisdom. And therefore He no longer troubled them, but ascends from the lower parts to the higher, from the Synagogue to the Church, and returned across the lake. For no one passes from the Church to the Synagogue without endangering his salvation. But whoever desires to pass from the Synagogue to the Church, let him take up his cross, that he may avoid the danger.

          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Quod autem ille sanatus cupit iam esse cum Christo, et dicitur ei redi in domum tuam, et narra quanta tibi fecit Deus: sic intelligitur, ut sic quisquis intelligat post remissionem peccatorum redeundum sibi in conscientiam bonam sicut in domum, et serviendum Evangelio propter aliorum salutem, ut deinde cum Christo requiescat: ne cum praepropere vult esse cum Christo, negligat ministerium praedicationis fraternae redemptioni accommodatum.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But that he, now that he is healed, desires to be with Christ, and it is said to him, Return to your house, and tell what great things God has done for you, implies that each should understand, that after the remission of his sins he should return to a good conscience as to his home, and obey the Gospel for the salvation of others, in order that there he may rest with Christ, lest by too. early wishing to he with Christ he neglect the ministry of preaching necessary for this redemption of his brethren.

Our Lord therefore distinguishes the touching by His answer, as it follows, And Jesus said, Somebody has touched me: as He said also, He that has ears to hear, let him hear, although all had bodily hearing of this kind; but it is not truly hearing if a man hear carelessly, nor truly touching if he touch unfaithfully.

He is here, however, manifested to us to be the true God, both by His miraculous deed, and by His word. For it is beyond us, and perhaps beyond angels also, to be able to communicate virtue as from our own nature. This belongs to the Supreme Nature alone. For nothing created possesses the power of healing, or even of doing any other like miracles, except it be divinely given. But it was not from desire of glory that He suffered not to remain concealed the exhibition of His divine power, Who had so often charged silence about His miracles, but because He looked to their advantage who are called through faith to grace.

Hence he is rightly called Jairus, that is, “enlightening” or “enlightened,” as he who receives the words of life to give to us, thereby both enlightens others, and is himself also enlightened by the Holy Spirit. But the ruler of the synagogue fell at the feet of Jesus, because the lawgiver with the whole race of the patriarchs knew that Christ, appearing in the flesh, would be far preferred to them. For if the head of Christ is God, His feet must agreeably to this be taken for the Incarnation, by which He touched the earth of our mortality. The ruler asked Him to enter into his house, because he was desirous to behold His coming. His only daughter is the Synagogue, which alone was framed with a legal institution; which at twelve years of age, that is, when the time of puberty was approaching, lay dying; for having been brought up nobly by the prophets, as soon as it came to years of discretion, when it ought to bring forth spiritual fruits to God, being suddenly subdued through its weakness and error, it forgot to enter the way of spiritual life, and unless Christ had come to its help, would have fallen away into destruction.

From modesty then she touched the hem of His garment; in faith she came, in piety believed, in wisdom knew herself to be healed; so the holy people of the Gentiles which believed God, blushed at its sins so as to desert them, offered its faith in believing, showed its devotion in asking put on wisdom in itself feeling its own cure, assumed boldness to confess that it had forestalled what was not its own.

For the Gentile people is not released by man’s aid, but the gathering of nations is the gift of God, which even by its little faith turns to itself the everlasting mercy. For if we think what our faith is, and understand how great the Son of God is, we see that in comparison of Him we touch only the hem, we cannot reach the upper parts of the garment. If then we also wish to be cured, let us touch by faith the hem of Christ. But he who has touched Him is not hidden. Happy the man who has touched the extreme part of the Word.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Matthaeum</b>: Opportune dominus expectabat puellae mortem, ut propalaretur resurrectionis miraculum: propter quod et tardius incedit, et loquitur cum muliere diutius, ut archisynagogi filia expiraret, et huius eventus nuntii advenirent; unde dicitur adhuc illo loquente, venit quidam ad principem synagogae dicens ei: quia mortua est filia tua, noli vexare illum.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Our Lord conveniently waited until the death of the girl, that the miracle of her resurrection might be made public. For which reason also He goes slower, and speaks longer with the woman, that the daughter of the ruler of the synagogue may expire, and messengers come to tell Him As it is said, While he yet spoke, there comes one from the ruler of the synagogue’s house, saying to him, Your daughter is dead.

          <td><b>Augustinus de Cons. Evang</b>: Sed cum Matthaeus archisynagogum non morituram filiam suam narret domino nuntiasse, sed omnino defunctam; Lucas autem et Marcus nondum mortuam, usque adeo ut dicant venisse postea qui mortuam nuntiarent; considerandum est ne repugnare videatur. Et intelligendum est, brevitatis hoc causa Matthaeum potius dicere voluisse, rogatum esse dominum ut faceret quod eum fecisse manifestum est, ut scilicet mortuam suscitaret. Attendit enim non verba patris de filia sua, sed, quod est potissimum, voluntatem. Sane si alii duo vel quisquam eorum patrem commemorasset dixisse quod venientes de domo dixerunt, ut iam non vexaretur Iesus, quia puella mortua fuisset; repugnarent eius cogitationi verba quae posuit Matthaeus: nunc vero illud nuntiantibus et prohibentibus ne magister veniret, non legitur quod ipse consenserit; unde dominus non diffidentem reprehendit, sed credentem robustius confirmavit; unde sequitur Iesus autem audito hoc verbo respondit patri puellae: noli timere, sed crede tantum, et salva erit.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But since Matthew states the ruler of the synagogue to have told our Lord that his daughter was not on the point of death but quite dead, and Luke and Mark say, that she was not yet dead, nay, even go so far as to say that there came some afterwards, who told her death; we must examine, lest they should seem to be at variance. And we must understand that for the sake of brevity, Matthew chose rather to say, that our Lord was asked to do what it is obvious He did, namely, to raise the dead. For our Lord needs not the words of the father concerning his daughter, but what is more important, his wishes. Certainly, if the other two or any one of them had mentioned that the father had said what those who came from the house said, that Jesus need not be troubled because the maid was dead, His words which Matthew has related would seem to be at variance with his thoughts. But now to those who brought that message, and said that the Master need not come, it is not said that the father assented. The Lord therefore did not blame him as distrustful, but the more strongly confirms his belief. As it follows, But when Jesus heard it, he answered the father of the girl, Believe only, &amp;c.

          <td><b>Athanasius</b> Fidem dominus exigit ab invocantibus eum, non quia indiget adminiculo aliorum: ipse namque et dominus, et largitor est fidei: sed ne videretur ex acceptione personarum sua dona conferre, ostendit quod credentibus favet, ne sine fide accipiant beneficia, et ea per infidelitatem aboleant: vult enim benefaciens durare gratiam, et sanans inconcussum permanere remedium.
          <td><b>ATHAN</b>. Our Lord requires faith from those who invoke Him, not because He needs the assistance of others, (for He is both the Lord and Giver of faith,) but not to seem to bestow His gifts according to His acceptance of persons, He shows that He favors those who believe, lest they should receive benefits without faith, and lose them by unbelief. For when He bestows a favor, He wishes it to last, and when He heals, the cure to remain undisturbed.

Solos autem hos intromisit tamquam discipulorum vertices, et potentes miraculum occultare: non enim volebat ipsum ante tempus pluribus revelari, forte propter invidiam Iudaeorum. Sic et cum quis nobis invidet, non debemus iustitias nostras ei revelare, ne ei maioris invidiae occasio tribuatur.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. When He was about to raise the dead He put all out, as teaching us to be free from vain-glory, and to do nothing for show, for when any one ought to perform miracles, he must not be in the midst of a great many, but alone and apart from the other. As it follows, And when be came into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save Peter, and James, and John. Now these only He permitted to enter as the Heads of His disciples, and able to conceal the miracle. For He did not wish to be revealed to many before His time, perhaps on account of the envy of the Jews. So also when any one envies us, we ought not to make known to him our righteousness, lest we give him an occasion of greater envy.

Ad hoc etiam illud nota, quod deflentes exclusit a domo, et indignos ostendit huius visione; sequitur enim flebant enim omnes, et plangebant illam. Quod si tunc exclusit, multo magis nunc; tunc enim nondum patuerat in somnum mortem fuisse conversam. Nullus ergo de cetero se contemnat, iniuriam inferens Christi victoriae, qui superavit mortem, et eam in somnum convertit; ad cuius ostensionem subditur at ille dixit: noli flere; non est enim mortua puella, sed dormit: ostendens singula sibi fore in promptu, et quod eam vivificaret, quasi suscitaret a somno. Nihilominus tamen deridebant eum; sequitur enim et deridebant eum scientes quia mortua esset. Quos non obiurgavit, nec derisionem repressit, ut etiam derisio fiat mortis indicium; nam, quia ut plurimum post acta miracula homines perseverant increduli, verbis propriis eos praevenit.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But He took not with Him His other disciples, so provoking them to a strange desire, because also they were not yet fully prepared, but He took Peter, and with him the sons of Zebedee, that the others also might imitate them. He took also the parents as witnesses, lest any should say the evidence of the resurrection was false. Luke adds to this also, that He shut out from the house those that were weeping, and showed that they were unworthy of a sight of this kind. For it follows, And they all wept, and bewailed her. But if He then shut them out, much more now. For then it had not yet been revealed that death was turned into sleep. Let no one then hereafter despise himself, bringing an insult to the victory of Christ, whereby He has overcome death, and turned it into sleep. In proof of which it is added, But he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleeps, &amp;c. showing that all things were at His command, and that He would bring her to life as if He were awakening her from sleep. They yet nevertheless laughed Him to scorn. For it follows, And they laughed him to scorn. He did not reprove them nor put an end to their laughter, that laughter also might be a sign of death. For since generally, after a miracle has been performed men continue unfaithful, He takes them by their own words. But that He might by sight dispose to the belief of the resurrection, He takes the hand of the maid. As it follows, But he took her by the hand, and called, saying, Maid, arise. And when He had taken her by the hand, He awoke her. As it follows, And her spirit returned, and she arose straightway. For He poured not into her another soul, but restored the same which she had breathed forth. Nor does he only awake the maid, but orders her to take food. For it follows, And he commanded to give her meat. That it might not seem like a vision what was done. Nor did He Himself give to her, but He commanded others to do it. As also He said in the case of Lazarus, Loose him. And afterwards He made him partake of meat with Him.

But I think that herein the mercy of the Lord is shown, since the widowed mother of an only son suffered no delay. There is also the token of wisdom, that in the widow’s son we should see the Church quick in believing; in the ruler of the synagogue’s daughter, the Jews about indeed to believe, but out of a great many only a few. Lastly, when our Lord says, She is not dead, but sleeps, they laughed Him to scorn. For whoever believes not, laughs. Let them therefore mourn their dead who think they are dead. Where there is a belief of the resurrection, the notion is not of death but of rest.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Now the Lord taking hold of the hand of the maid, cured her. Blessed is he whom wisdom takes by the hand, that she may bring him into her secret places, and command to be given him to eat. For the bread of heaven is the word of God. Hence comes also that wisdom which has filled its altars with the food of the body and blood of God. Come, she says, eat my bread, and drink the wine which I have mixed for you.

          <td><b>Beda</b>: Surrexit autem puella continuo, quia Christo manum confortante, homo a morte animae resipiscit. Sunt enim nonnulli qui latente tantum cogitatione peccati sibi mortem consciscunt; sed tales se vivificare significans dominus, suscitavit filiam archisynagogi. Alii vero ipsum malum quo delectantur agendo, mortuum suum quasi extra portas efferunt; et hos se suscitare demonstrans, suscitavit filium viduae extra portas civitatis. Quidam vero etiam peccati consuetudine se quasi sepeliendo corrumpunt; et ad hos etiam erigendos adest gratia salvatoris; ad quod intimandum resuscitavit Lazarum quatuor dies in monumento habentem. Quanto autem gravior est mors animae, tanto acrior poenitentis fervor insistat. Unde iacentem in conclavi mortuam levi voce resuscitat; delatum foras iuvenem pluribus dictis corroborat; ad quatriduanum vero suscitandum fremuit spiritu, lacrymas fudit, et voce magna clamavit. Sed et hic notandum, quod publica noxia publico egent remedio; levia peccata secreta queunt poenitentia deleri. Puella in domo iacens paucis arbitris resurgit; iuvenis extra domum turba multa comitante suscitatur; Lazarus de monumento vocatus multis populis innotuit.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Now the maid arose straightway, because when Christ strengthens the hand, man revives from the death of the soul. For there are some, who only by the secret thought of sin are conscious of bringing death to themselves. The Lord signifying that such He brings to life again, raised the daughter of the ruler of the synagogue. But others, by committing the very evil in which they delight, carry their dead as it were without the gates, and to show that He raises these, He raised the widow’s son without the gates. But some also, by habits of sin, bury themselves, as it were, and become corrupt; and to raise these also the grace of the Savior is not wanting; to intimate which He raised from the dead Lazarus, who had been four days in the grave. But the deeper the death of the soul, so much the more intense should be the fervor of penitence. Hence He raises with a gentle voice the maid who lay dead in the room, the youth who was carried out He strengthens with many words, but to raise him who had been dead four days, He groaned in His spirit, He poured forth tears, and cried with a loud voice. But here also we must observe, that a public calamity needs a public remedy. Slight offenses seek to be blotted out by secret penitence. The maid lying in the house rises again with few witnesses; the youth without the house is raised in the presence of a great crowd who accompanied him. Lazarus summoned from the tomb was known to many nations.

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; It was fitting that those who were appointed the ministers of holy teaching should be able to work miracles, and by these very acts themselves be believed to be the ministers of God. Hence it is said, Then called he his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devils. Herein He brings down the haughty pride of the devil, who once said, There is none who shall open his mouth against me.

At dominus noster Iesus Christus, tamquam naturaliter Deus existens, impertitur huiusmodi gratiam quibus vult, non invocans in eos alienam virtutem, sed infundens ex promptuariis propriis.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Mark here the divine power of the Son, which belongs not to a fleshly nature. For it was in the power of the saints to perform miracles not by nature, but by participation of the Holy Spirit; but it was altogether out of their power to grant this authority to others. For how could created natures possess dominion over the gifts of the Spirit? But our Lord Jesus Christ, as by nature God, imparts graces of this kind to whomsoever He will, not invoking upon them a power which is not His own, but infusing it into them from Himself.

But after that they had been sufficiently strengthened by His guidance, and had received competent proofs of His power, He sends them out, as it follows, And he sent them to teach the kingdom of God. And here we must remark, that they are not commissioned to speak of sensible things as Moses and the Prophets; for they promised a land and earthly goods, but these a kingdom, and whatsoever is contained in it.

          <td><b>Gregorius Nazianzenus</b>: Mittens autem discipulos ad praedicandum, dominus multa eis iniunxit, quorum summa est, sic eos virtuosos esse, sic constantes atque modestos, et, ut breviter loquar, caelestes, ut non minus propter eorum modum vivendi quam propter verbum evangelica doctrina propagaretur. Et ideo cum aeris et baculi carentia et amictus singularitate mittebantur; et ideo subdit et ait ad illos: nihil tuleritis in via: neque virgam neque peram, neque panem, neque pecuniam, neque duas tunicas habeatis.
          <td><b>GREG NAZ</b>. Now in sending His disciples to preach, our Lord enjoined many things on them, the chief of which are, that they should be so virtuous, so constant, so temperate, and, to speak briefly, so heavenly, that no less through their manner of living than their words, the teaching of the Gospel might be spread abroad. And therefore were they sent with lack of money, and staves, and a single garment; He accordingly adds, And he said to them, Take nothing in the way, neither staves.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Matthaeum</b>: Plurima quidem per hoc constituebat: primo quidem insuspectos reddens discipulos; secundo sequestrans eos a qualibet cura, ut totum studium adhiberent verbo; tertio docens eos propriam virtutem. Sed forsan dicet aliquis cetera quidem habere rationem; sed non habere peram in via, nec duas tunicas, nec baculum, cuius rei causa praecipit? Volens scilicet excitare eos in qualibet diligentia: et, ut ita loquar, ex hominibus Angelos faciebat eos, dirimens a qualibet cura vitae, ut una sola cura detineantur doctrinae.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Many things indeed He ordained hereby; first indeed it rendered the disciples unsuspected; secondly, it held them aloof from all care, so that they might give their whole study to the word; thirdly, it taught them their own proper virtue. But perhaps some one will say that the other things indeed are reasonable, but for what reason did He command them to have no scrip on their way, nor two coats, nor staff? In truth, because He wished to rouse them to all diligence, taking them away from all the cares of this life, that they might be occupied by the one single care of teaching.

            <b>Eusebius</b>: Volens igitur eos carere cupidine rerum in sollicitudine vitae, protestatus est haec: sumebat enim experimentum fidei et animositatis eorum, qui habito in mandatis extremae vitam ducere paupertatis, non effugiunt quae iubentur; decebat enim eos quidem commercium facere, et recipientes salubres virtutes recompensare obedientia mandatorum: et cum milites eos faceret regni Dei, accingit eos ad pugnam in hostes, monens colere paupertatem; nullus enim militans Deo implicat se vitae saecularis negotiis.
            <p>Qualis ergo esse debeat qui evangelizat regnum Dei, praeceptis evangelicis designatur; hoc est, ut subsidii saecularis adminicula non requirat, fideique totus inhaerens, putet, quo minus requirat, magis posse suppetere.

            <b>EUSEBIUS</b>. Wishing then that they should be free from the desire of wealth and the anxieties of life, He gave this injunction. He took it as a proof of their faith and courage, that when it was commanded them to lead a life of extreme poverty, they would not escape from what was ordered. For it was fitting that they should make a kind of bargain, receiving these saving virtues to recompense them for obedience to commands. And when He was making them soldiers of God, He girds them for battle against their enemies, by telling them to embrace poverty. For no soldier of God entangles himself in the affairs of a secular life.
            <p><b>AMBROSE</b>; Of what kind then he ought to be who preaches the Gospel of the kingdom of God is marked out by these Gospel precepts; that is, he must not require the supports of secular aid; and clinging wholly to faith, he must believe that the less he requires those things, the more they will be supplied to him.

Evang</b>: Vel dominus haec possidere discipulos ac ferre noluit, non quod necessaria non sint sustentationi huius vitae; sed quia sic eos mittebat ut eis haec deberi monstraret ab illis quibus Evangelium credentibus annuntiarent; ut sic securi non possiderent, neque portarent huic vitae necessaria, nec magna, nec minima. Ideo posuit secundum Marcum: nisi virgam, ostendens a fidelibus suis omnia deberi ministris suis nulla superflua requirentibus. Hanc autem potestatem virgae nomine significavit, cum diceret ne quid tollerent in via nisi virgam tantum.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or, the Lord did not wish the disciples to possess and carry with them these things, not that they were not necessary to the support of this life, but because He sent them thus to show that these things were due to them from those believers to whom they announced the Gospel, that so they might neither possess security, nor carry about with them the necessaries of this life, either great or little. He has therefore, according to Mark, excluded all except a staff, showing that the faithful owe every thing to their ministers who require no superfluities. But this permission of the staff He has mentioned by name, when He says, They should take nothing in the way, but a staff only.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Possunt etiam qui volunt, hoc ad eum deducere tractatum, ut spiritualem tantummodo locus iste formare videatur affectum, qui velut indumentum quoddam videatur corporis exuisse, non solum potestate reiecta contemptisque divitiis, sed etiam carnis ipsius illecebris abdicatis.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; To those also who wish it, this place admits of being explained, so as to seem only to represent a spiritual temper of mind, which appears to have castoff as it were a certain covering of the body; not only rejecting power and despising wealth, but renouncing also the delights of the flesh itself.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Quidam etiam apostolos non portare peram, neque baculum aut duas tunicas sic intelligunt, quod non thesaurizent: hoc enim pera innuit congregans multa: neque sint iracundi et tribulati spiritus, quod significat baculus; neque sint ficti et duplici corde, quod significat tunica duplex.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Some also understand by the Apostles not carrying scrip, nor staff, nor two coats, that they must not lay up treasures, (which a scrip implies, collecting many things,) nor be angry and of a quarrelsome spirit, (which the staff signifies,) nor be false and of a double heart, (which is meant by the two coats.)

Et ideo subdit et in quamcumque domum intraveritis, ibi manete, et inde ne exeatis; quasi dicat: sufficiat vobis discipulorum fructus, qui recipientes a vobis spiritualia, vos procurabunt. Iussit autem eos in una domo manere, ut nec hospitem gravent, eum scilicet dimittendo, nec ipsi gulositatis et levitatis suspicionem incurrant.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; But it may be said, How then shall necessary things be prepared for them. He therefore adds, And into whatsoever house you enter, there abide, and thence depart. As if He said, Let the food of disciples suffice you, who receiving from you spiritual things, will minister to you temporal. But He ordered them to abide in one house, so as neither to incommode the host, (that is, so as to send him away,) nor themselves to incur the suspicion of gluttony and wantonness.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; He pronounces it to be foreign to the character of a preacher of the heavenly kingdom to run from house to house and change the rights of inviolable hospitality; but as the grace of hospitality is supposed to be offered, so also if they are not received the dust must be shaken oil; and they are commanded to depart from the city; as it follows, And whosoever will not receive you when you go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony, &amp;c.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; The dust is shaken off from the Apostles’ feet as a testimony of their labors, that they entered into a city, and the apostolical preaching had reached to the inhabitants thereof. Or the dust is shaken off when they receive nothing (not even of the necessaries of life) from those who despised the Gospel.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Or it is a great return of hospitality which is here taught, i.e. that we should not only wish peace to our hosts, but also if any faults of earthly infirmity obscure them, they should be removed by receiving the footsteps of apostolical preaching.

          <td><b>Augustinus de Cons. Evang</b>: Lucas autem hunc eumdem narrandi ordinem quem Marcus tenens, non cogit credi rerum gestarum eumdem ordinem fuisse. In his etiam verbis Marco attestatur, ad hoc dumtaxat quod alii dixerint, non Herodes, Ioannem a mortuis surrexisse. Sed quia haesitantem commemoravit Herodem, intelligendum est: aut post istam haesitationem confirmasse in animo suo quod ab aliis dicebatur, cum ait pueris suis, sicut Matthaeus narrat: hic est Ioannes Baptista, ipse surrexit a mortuis; aut ita pronuntianda sunt haec verba Matthaei ut haesitantem adhuc indicent.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Now Luke, though he keeps the same order in his narrative with Mark, does not oblige us to believe that the course of events was the same. In these words too, Mark testifies only to the fact that others (not Herod) said that John had risen from the dead, but since Luke has mentioned Herod’s perplexity, we must suppose either that after that perplexity, he confirmed in his own mind what was said by others, since he says to his servants, (as Matthew relates,) This is John the Baptist, he is risen from the dead, or these words of Matthew must have been altered so as to signify that he was still doubting.

Quod enim ait non sunt nobis plusquam quinque panes et duo pisces, ad Andreae retulit responsionem; quod vero adiunxit nisi forte nos eamus, et emamus in omnem hanc turbam escas, videtur ad responsionem Philippi pertinere, nisi quod de ducentis denariis tacuit: quamquam et in ipsius Andreae sententia hoc posset intelligi; cum enim dixisset: est puer unus hic qui habet quinque panes hordeaceos et duos pisces, adiunxit: sed haec quid sunt inter tantos? Hoc est dicere nisi forte nos eamus, et emamus in omnem hanc turbam escas. Ex qua varietate verborum, rerum autem sententiarumque concordia, satis apparet salubriter nos doceri, nihil quaerendum in verbis nisi loquentium voluntatem; cui demonstrandae invigilare debent omnes veridici narratores, cum de homine, vel de Angelo, vel de Deo aliquid narrant.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. In these words indeed Luke has strung together in one sentence the answer of Philip, saying, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, but that every one may have a little, and the answer of Andrew, There is a lad here who has five loaves and two small fishes, as John relates. For when Luke says, We have no more but five loaves and two fishes, he refers to the answer of Andrew. But that which he added, Except we go and buy food for all the people, seems to belong to Philip’s answer, save that he is silent about the two hundred pennyworth, although this may be implied also in the expression of Andrew himself. For when he had said, There is a lad here who has five loaves and two fishes, he added, But what are these among so many? that is to say, unless we go and buy meat for all this people. From which diversity of words, but harmony of things and opinions, it is sufficiently evident that we have this wholesome lesson given us, that we must seek for nothing in words but the meaning of the speaker; and to explain this clearly, ought to be the care of all truth telling authors whenever they relate any thing concerning man, or angel, or God.

          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Ut autem adhuc ad magis ardua feratur miraculum, ostenditur non parva fuisse multitudo virorum, cum sequitur erant autem viri fere quinque millia, exceptis scilicet mulieribus atque pueris, ut alius Evangelista refert.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; But that the difficulty of the miracle may be still more enhanced, the number of men is stated to have been by no means small. As it follows, And there were about five thousand men, besides women and children, as another Evangelist relates.

          <td><b>Augustinus de Cons. Evang</b>: Quod Lucas hic dicit, quinquagenos iussos esse discumbere, Marcus vero quinquagenos et centenos, ideo non movet, quia unus partem dixit, alter totum. Verum si alius de quinquagenis tantum commemoraret, alius de centenis, valde videretur esse contrarium, nec satis dignosceretur utrumque dictum esse. Unum autem ab altero, alterum ab altero esse commemoratum, et tamen attentius consideratum inveniri debuisse quis non fateatur? Hoc ideo dixi, quia existunt saepe aliqua eiusmodi quae parum intendentibus temere iudicantibus contraria videantur, et non sint.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. That Luke says here, that the men were ordered to sit down by fifties, but Mark, by fifties and hundreds, does not matter, seeing that one spoke of a part, the other of the whole. But if one had mentioned only the fifties, and the other only the hundreds, they would seem to be greatly opposed to one another; nor would it be sufficiently distinct which of the two was said. But who will not admit, that one was mentioned by one Evangelist, the other by another, and that if more attentively considered it must be found so. But I have said thus much, because often certain things of this kind exist, which to those who take little heed and judge hastily appear contrary to one another, and yet are not so.

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; This also He did purposely for our sakes, that we may learn that at the commencement of a feast when we are going to break bread, we ought to offer thanks for it to God, and to draw forth the heavenly blessing upon it. As it follows, And he blessed, and broke.

He makes also the fishes to increase, to signify that He has dominion over the seas, as weld as the dry land. But well did He perform a special miracle for the weak, at the same time that He gives also a general blessing in feeding all the strong as well as the weak. And they did all eat, and were filled.

Quia vero quinque sunt exteriores hominis sensus, quinque millia viri dominum secuti, designant eos qui in saeculari adhuc habitu positi, exterioribus, quae possident, bene uti noverunt; qui quinque panibus aluntur, quia tales necesse est legalibus adhuc praeceptis instrui: nam qui mundo ad integrum renuntiant, evangelica refectione sublimes sunt.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; The Apostles had only got but the five loaves of the Mosaic law, and the two fishes of each covenant, which were covered in the secret place of obscure mysteries, as in the waters of the deep. But because men have five external senses, the five thousand men who followed the Lord signify those who still live in worldly ways, knowing well how to use the external things they possess. For they who entirely renounce the world are raised aloft in the enjoyment of His Gospel feast. But the different divisions of the guests, indicate the different congregations of Churches throughout the world, which together compose the one Catholic.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; But here the bread which Jesus broke is mystically indeed the word of God, and discourse concerning Christ, which when it is divided is increased. For from these few words, He ministered abundant nourishment to the people. He gave us words like loaves, which while they are tasted by our mouth are doubled.

          <td><b>Beda</b>: Turbis autem esurientibus salvator non nova creat cibaria; sed acceptis his quae habuerunt discipuli benedicit: quia veniens in carne, non alia quam praedicta sunt praedicat; sed prophetiae dicta mysteriis gratiae gravida demonstrat. Respicit in caelum, ut illuc dirigendam mentis aciem, ibi lucem scientiae doceat esse quaerendam. Frangit, et ante turbas ponenda distribuit discipulis: quia legis et prophetiae sacramenta eis, ut per mundum praedicent, patefecit.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Now our Savior does not create new food for the hungry multitudes, but He took those things which the disciples had and blessed them, since coming in the flesh He preaches nothing else than what had been foretold, but demonstrates the words of prophecy to be pregnant with the mysteries of grace; He looks towards heaven, that thither He may teach us to direct the eye of the mind, there to seek the light of knowledge; He breaks and distributes to the disciples to be placed before the multitude, because He revealed to them the Sacraments of the Law and the Prophets that they might preach them to the world.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Non otiose autem quae turbae supersunt, a discipulis colliguntur: quia ea quae divina sunt, apud electos facilius possis quam apud populos reperire. Beatus ille qui potest colligere quae etiam doctis supersunt. Qua ratione autem cophinos Christus duodecim implevit, nisi ut illud populi Iudaici solveret, quia manus eius in cophino servierunt? Hic est populus, qui ante lutum in cophinis colligebat, sed iam per crucem Christi vitae caelestis operatur alimoniam. Nec paucorum hoc munus, sed omnium est: nam per duodecim cophinos, tamquam tribuum singularum, fidei firmamentum redundat.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Not without meaning are the fragments which remained over and above what the multitudes had eaten, collected by the disciples, since those things which are divine you may more easily find among the elect than among the people. Blessed is he who can collect those which remain over and above even to the learned. But for what reason did Christ fill twelve baskets, except that He might solve that word concerning the Jewish people, His hands served in the basket? that is, the people who before collected mud for the pots, now through the cross of Christ gather up the nourishment of the heavenly life. Nor is this the office of few, but all. For by the twelve baskets, as if of each of the tribes, the foundation of the faith is spread abroad.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Vel per cophinos duodecim apostoli figurantur, et omnes sequentes doctores; foris quidem hominibus despecti, sed intus salutaris cibi reliquiis cumulati.

Formam enim in hoc seipsum constituebat, docens discipulos artem facilem doctrinalium dogmatum: reor enim oportere populorum antistites etiam meritis praeesse subditis suis, in rebus necessariis iugiter conversantes, et illa tractantes quibus Deus placatur.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Our Lord having retired from the multitude, and being in a place apart, was engaged in prayer. As it is said, And it came to pass, as he was alone praying. For He ordained Himself as an example of this, instructing His disciples by an easy’ method of teaching. For I suppose the rulers of the people ought to be superior also in good deeds, to those that are under them, ever holding converse with them in all necessary things, and treating of those things in which God delights.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Aderant autem discipuli domino; sed ipse patrem solus oravit: quia possunt sancti domino fidei amorisque societate coniungi. Ubique solus obsecrat, quia Dei consilium humana vota non capiunt, nec quisquam potest interiorum particeps esse cum Christo.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Now the disciples were with the Lord, but He alone prayed to the Father, since the saints may be joined to the Lord in the bond of faith and love, but the Son alone is able to penetrate the incomprehensible secrets of the Father’s will. Every where then He prays alone, for human wishes comprehend not the counsel of God, nor can any one be a partaker with Christ of the deep things of God.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Poterat autem orationis negotium turbare discipulos: videbant enim humanitus orare quem olim viderant auctoritate divina peragentem miracula. Ut igitur huiusmodi propelleret turbationem, eos interrogat, non quia nesciret ab exterioribus sibi collata praeconia, sed ut eos a plurium opinione auferret, et rectam fidem eis insereret; unde sequitur et interrogavit illos dicens: quem me dicunt esse turbae?
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Now His engaging in prayer might perplex His disciples. For they saw Him praying like a man, Whom before they had seen performing miracles with divine power. In order then to banish all perplexity of this kind, He asks them this question, not because He did not know the reports which they had gathered from without, but that He might rid them of the opinion of the many, and instill into them the true faith. Hence it follows, And he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Pulchre dominus fidem discipulorum exploraturus, prius turbarum sententiam interrogat, ne illorum confessio, non veritatis agnitione probata, sed vulgi videatur opinione formata; nec comperta credere, sed instar Herodis de auditis haesitare putentur.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Rightly does our Lord, when about to inquire into the faith of the disciples, first inquire into the opinion of the multitudes, lest their confession should appear not to be determined by their knowledge, but to be formed by the opinion of the generality, and they should be considered not to believe from experience, but like Herod to be perplexed by different reports which they heard.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Cons. Evang</b>: Potest autem illud movere quod Lucas dominum interrogasse discipulos suos, quem illum dicerent homines, tunc dixit cum esset solus orans, et adessent etiam ipsi: porro autem Marcus in via dicit illos hoc ab eodem interrogatos. Sed hoc eum movet, quia nunquam oravit in via.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Now it may raise a question, that Luke says that our Lord asked His disciples, Whom do men say that I am? at the same time that He was alone praying, and they also were with Him; whereas Mark says, that they were asked this question by our Lord on the way; but this is difficult only to him who never prayed on the way.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Non est autem otiosa turbae opinio quam discipuli respondent, cum subditur at illi responderunt, et dixerunt: alii Ioannem Baptistam, quem decollatum sciebant; alii autem Eliam, quem venturum putabant; alii autem, quia propheta unus de prioribus surrexit. Sed hoc quaerere alterius prudentiae est: nam si Paulo apostolo satis est nihil scire nisi Christum Iesum, et hunc crucifixum, quid amplius mihi desiderandum est scire quam Christum?
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; But it is no trifling opinion of the multitude which the disciples mention, when it is added, But they answering said, John the Baptist, (whom they knew to be beheaded;) but some say, Elias, (whom they thought would come,) but others say that one of the old Prophets is risen again. But to make this inquiry belongs to a different kind of wisdom from ours, for if it were enough for the Apostle Paul to know nothing but Christ Jesus, and Him crucified, what more can I desire to know than Christ?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Vide autem in interrogationibus elegantiam. Dirigit enim prius eos ad extrinsecas laudes, ut eis evulsis veram opinionem generet. Unde cum dixissent discipuli plebis opinionem, eorum sententiam interrogat, cum subditur dicit autem illis: vos autem quem me esse dicitis? O quam praecipuum illud vos. Excipit eos ab aliis, ut eorum vitent opiniones; quasi dicat: vos, qui censura mea vocati estis ad apostolatum, testes miraculorum meorum, quem me esse dicitis? Praevenit autem Petrus ceteros, fitque os totius collegii, eructatque divini amoris eloquia, profertque fidei confessionem, cum dicitur respondens autem Petrus dixit: Christum Dei. Non ait simpliciter eum esse Christum Dei, sed magis cum articulo Christum illum Dei: unde in Graeco habetur ton christon. Nam plures divinitus uncti, diversimode vocati sunt Christi. Quidam enim uncti fuerunt in reges, quidam in prophetas; nos autem per Christum sancto peruncti spiritu, nomen obtinuimus Christi; sed unus solus est qui est Christus Dei et patris, quasi ipso solo proprium habente patrem, qui in caelis est: et sic Lucas concordat quidem in sententiis cum Matthaeo, qui narravit Petrum dixisse: tu es Christus filius Dei vivi; sed utens breviloquio, ait eum dixisse Christum Dei.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; But mark the subtle skill of the question. For he directs them first to the praises of strangers, that having overthrown these, He might beget in them the right opinion. So when the disciples had given the opinion of the people, He asks them their own opinion; as it is added, And He said to them, Whom say you that I am? How marked is you! He excludes them from the other, that they may avoid their opinions; as if He said, you who by my decree are called to the Apostleship, the witnesses of my miracles, whom do you say that I am? But Peter anticipated the rest, and becomes the mouthpiece of the whole company, and launching forth into the eloquence of divine love, utters the confession of faith, as it is added, Peter answering said, The Christ of God. He says not merely that He was Christ of God, but now He uses the article. Hence it is in the Greek. For many divinely accounted persons are in diverse ways called Christs, for some were anointed kings, some prophets. But we through Christ have been anointed by the holy Spirit, have obtained the name of Christ. But there is only one who is the Christ of God and the Father, He alone as it were having His own Father who is in heaven. And so Luke agrees indeed in the same opinion as Matthew, who relates Peter to have said, You are Christ, the Son of the living God, but speaking briefly Luke says that Peter answered, the Christ of God.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: In uno enim hoc nomine et divinitatis et incarnationis expressio, et fides est passionis. Complexus est itaque omnia qui et naturam et nomen expressit, in quo summa virtutum est.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; In this one name there is the expression both of His divinity and incarnation, and the belief of His passion. He has therefore comprehended every thing, having expressed both the nature and tile name wherein is all virtue.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Sed notandum, quod unum confessus est esse Christum prudentissimus Petrus contra praesumentes Emmanuelem in duos christos dividere. Neque enim sciscitatus est eos, dicens quem dicunt homines esse divinum verbum, sed filium hominis? Quem Petrus confessus est esse filium Dei. In hoc ergo admirandus est, et dignus factus tam praecipuis honoribus, quia quem admiratus est in forma nostra, hunc credidit esse Christum patris, scilicet hominem factum verbum, quod processit de patris substantia.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; But we must observe, that Peter most wisely confessed Christ to be one, against those who presumed to divide Immanuel into two Christs. For Christ did not inquire of them, saying, Whom do men say the divine Word is? but the Son of man, whom Peter confessed to be the Son of God. Herein then is Peter to be admired, and thought worthy of such chief honor, seeing that Him whom he marveled at in our form, he believed to be the Christ of the Father, that is to say, that the Word which proceeded of the Father’s Substance was become man.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Dominus autem Iesus Christus praedicari se primo noluit, ne ullus strepitus nasceretur; unde sequitur at ille increpans eos, praecepit ne cui dicerent. Multis ex causis iubet tacere discipulos: ut fallat principem mundi, ut declinet iactantiam, doceat humilitatem. Ergo Christus noluit gloriari; et tu, qui ignobilis natus es, gloriaris? Simul ne rudes et imperfecti adhuc discipuli maximae praedicationis molibus opprimantur. Prohibentur ergo evangelizare eum Dei filium, ut evangelizarent postea crucifixum.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; But our Lord Jesus Christ was as at first unwilling to be preached, lest an uproar should arise; as it follows, And he straitly charged them, and commanded them to tell no man any thing. For many reasons He commands His disciples to be silent; to deceive the prince of this world, to reject boasting, to teach humility. Christ then would not boast, and cost you boast who are of ignoble birth? Likewise He did it to prevent rude and as yet imperfect disciples from being oppressed with the wonder of this awful announcement. They are then forbid to preach Him as the Son of God, that they might afterwards preach Him crucified.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Matthaeum</b>: Opportune etiam dominus tunc vetuit nulli dicere quod ipse esset Christus, quatenus sublatis de medio scandalis, et crucis consummato patibulo, habitualiter imprimeretur audientium menti conveniens de eo opinio; nam radicatum semel, et postmodum evulsum, vix unquam denuo insitum retinebitur; quod autem semel insitum perseverat immobile, de facili concrescit. Nam si Petrus ex solo auditu scandalizatus est, quid quamplures paterentur, cum audissent filium Dei esse, viderent autem crucifixum et consputum?
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Timely also was our Lord’s command that no one should tell that He was Christ, in order that when offenses should be taken away and the sufferings of the cross completed, a proper opinion of Him might be firmly rooted in the minds of the hearers. For that which has once taken root and afterwards been torn up, when fresh planted will scarcely ever be preserved. But that which when once planted continues undisturbed, grows up securely. For if Peter was offended merely by what he heard, what would be the feelings of those many who, after they had heard that He was the Son of God, saw Him crucified, and spit upon?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Oportebat ergo discipulos eum ubique terrarum praedicare (hoc enim erat opus electorum ab eo ad apostolatus officium): sed, ut sacra Scriptura testatur, tempus est unicuique rei. Decebat enim ut crux et resurrectio impleretur, et sic sequeretur apostolorum praedicatio; unde sequitur dicens, quia oportet filium hominis multa pati, et reprobari a senioribus, et principibus sacerdotum et Scribis, et occidi, et tertia die resurgere.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; It was the duty then of the disciples to preach Him throughout the world. For this was the work of those who were chosen by Him to the office of the Apostleship. But as holy Scripture bears witness, There is a time for every thing. For it was fitting that the cross and resurrection should be accomplished, an d then should follow the preaching of the Apostles; as it is spoken, saying, The Son of man must needs suffer many things.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Fortasse, quia sciebat dominus difficile passionis et resurrectionis mysterium etiam discipulos credituros, ipse voluit esse suae passionis et resurrectionis assertor.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Perhaps because the Lord knew that the disciples would believe even the difficult mystery of the Passion and Resurrection, He wished to be Himself the proclaimer of His own Passion and Resurrection.

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Great and noble leaders provoke the mighty in arms to deeds of velour, not only by promising them the honors of victory, but by declaring that suffering is in itself glorious. Such we see is the teaching of the Lord Jesus Christ. For He had foretold to His disciples, that He must needs suffer the accusations of the Jews, be slain, and rise again on the third day. Lest then they should think that Christ indeed was to suffer persecution for the life of the world, but that they might lead a soft life, He shows them that they must needs pass through similar struggles, if they desired to obtain His glory.

Now the Savior of His great mercy and loving kindness will have no one serve Him unwillingly and from constraint, but those only who come of their own accord, and are grateful for being allowed to serve Him.

          <td><b>BASIL</b>; Now a desire of suffering death for Christ and a mortification of one’s members which are upon the earth, end a manful resolution to undergo any danger for Christ, and an indifference towards the present life, this it is to take up one’s cross. Hence it is added, And let him take up his cross daily.

          <td><b>Graecus</b>: Recte autem coniungit haec duo: abneget semetipsum, et tollat crucem suam. Sicut enim qui paratus est ascendere crucem, sumit in mente sua mortis intentionem, sicque vadit ut non aestimans amplius hanc vitam participare; ita qui sequi vult dominum, primo debet abnegare seipsum, et sic tollere crucem, ut eius voluntas sit prompta ad omnem miseriam sustinendam.
          <td><b>GREEK EX</b>. He rightly joins these two, Let him deny himself, and let him take up his cross, for as he who is prepared to ascend the cross conceives in his mind the intention of death, and so goes on thinking to have no more part in this life, so he who is willing to follow our Lord, ought first to deny himself, and so take up his cross, that his will may be ready to endure every calamity.

Sumit autem exordium perfectio ab exteriorum alienatione, puta possessionum, vel inanis gloriae, vel praecise affectionis inutilium rerum.
          <td><b>BASIL</b>; Herein then stands a man’s perfection, that he should have his affections hardened, even towards life itself, and have ever about him the answer of death, that he should by no means trust in himself. But perfection takes its beginning from the relinquishment of things foreign to it; suppose these to be possessions or vain-glory, or affection for things that profit not.

          <td><b>Origenes</b>: Huius autem causam assignat subdens qui enim voluerit animam suam salvam facere, perdet illam; idest, qui vult secundum vitam praesentem vivere, et propriam animam in sensibilibus conservare, hic eam perdet, non ducens eam ad terminos beatitudinis. E contrario autem subdit nam qui perdiderit animam suam propter me, salvam faciet illam; idest, qui negligit sensibilia intuitu veritatis, exponens se morti, hic tamquam animam perdens pro Christo, eam potius salvabit. Itaque si animam salvari beatum est, relatum ad eam quae est in Deo salutem, debet esse et quaedam bona perditio animae quae fit intuitu Christi. Videtur etiam mihi persimile ei quod est abnegare seipsum, secundum praedicta, decere perdere quemlibet propriam animam peccatricem, ut sumat eam quae per virtutem salvatur.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; He assigns the cause of this when He adds, For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; that is, whosoever will according to the present life keep his own soul fixed on things of sense, the same shall lose it, never reaching to the bounds of happiness. But on the other hand He adds, but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake, shall save it. That is, whosoever forsakes the things of sense looking upon truth, and exposes himself to death, as it were losing his life for Christ, shall the rather save it. If then it is a blessed thing to save our life, (with regard to that safety which is in God,) there must be also a certain good surrender of life which is made by looking upon Christ. It seems also to me from resemblance to that denying of one’s self which has been before spoken of, that it becomes us to lose a certain sinful life of ours, to take up that which is saved by virtue.

Quasi dicat: cum aliquis aspiciens praesentem dulcedinem aut utilitatem, renuit quidem pati, eligit autem splendide vivere, si sit opulentus, quod inde sibi commodum erit cum perdiderit animam? Transit enim huius mundi figura, et amoena velut umbra discedunt: non enim proderunt thesauri impietatis; eripit autem a morte iustitia.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; But that incomparable exercise of the passion of Christ, which surpasses the delights and precious things of the world, is alluded to when he adds, What is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world and lose himself, or be a cast away? As if he says, When a man, through his looking after the present delights, gains pleasure, and refuses indeed to suffer, but chooses to live splendidly in his riches, what advantage will he get then, when he has lost his soul? For the fashion of this world passes away, and pleasant things depart as a shadow. For the treasures of ungodliness shall not profit, but righteousness snatches a man from death.

          <td><b>Gregorius in Evang</b>: Quia ergo sancta Ecclesia habet aliud tempus persecutionis atque aliud pacis, dominus utraque tempora designavit in praeceptis; nam persecutionis tempore ponenda est anima; quod significavit dicens qui perdiderit animam; pacis autem tempore ea quae amplius dominari possunt, frangenda sunt desideria terrena; quod significavit dicens quid proficit homini? Plerumque autem labentia cuncta despicimus; sed tamen adhuc humanae verecundiae usu praepedimur, ut rectitudinem quam servamus in mente, nondum exprimere valeamus in voce. Sed huic quidem vulneri congruum dominus subiungit medicamentum, dicens nam qui me erubuerit et meos sermones, hunc filius hominis erubescet.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. Since then the holy Church has one time of persecution, another time of peace, our Lord has noticed both times in His command to us. For at the time of persecution we must lay down our soul, that is our life, which He signified, saying, Whosoever shall lose his life. But in time of peace, those things which have the greatest power to subdue us, our earthly desires, must be vanquished; which He signified, saying, What does it profit a man, &amp;c. Now we commonly despise all fleeting things, but still we are so checked by that feeling of shame so common to man, that we are yet unable to express in words the uprightness which we preserve in our hearts. But to this wound the Lord indeed subjoins a suitable application, saying, For whoever shall be ashamed of me and my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed.

Pessimum igitur et damnosum notari inimicitia et operis inertia, quando tantus iudex descenderit, agminibus circumstantibus Angelorum. Hinc autem percipias quod, carne sumpta et sanguine, filius non minus est Deus, quod se pollicetur in maiestate Dei patris venturum, et quod ei tamquam iudici omnium ministrabunt Angeli qui factus est homo similis nobis.

For it follows, When he shall come in his own glory, and his Father’s, and of the holy angels. Awful then and fatal will it be, to he branded as an enemy, and slothful in business, when so great a Judge shall descend with the armies of Angels standing round Him. But from this you may perceive, that though He has taken to Himself our flesh and blood, the Son is no less God, seeing that He promises to come in the glory of God the Father, and that Angels shall minister to Him as the Judge of all, Who was made man like to us.

Ergo bonus magister, ne quis desperatione frangatur aut taedio, continuo se videndum fidelibus pollicetur, dicens dico autem vobis: vere sunt aliqui hic stantes qui non gustabunt mortem, donec videant regnum Dei.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Now our Lord while He ever raises us to look to the future reward of virtue, and teaches us how good it is to despise worldly things, so also He supports the weakness of the human mind by a present recompense. For it is a hard thing to take up the cross, and expose your life to danger and your body to death; to give up what you are, when you wish to be what you are not; and even the loftiest virtue seldom exchanges things present for future. The good Master then, lest any man should be broken down by despair or weariness, straightway promises that He will be seen by the faithful, in these words, But I say to you, There are some standing here who shall not taste of death till they see the kingdom of God.

At least let us suppose that the death of the body is tasted by touch, the life of the soul preserved by possession; for here not the death of the body, but of the soul, is denied.

Sed cur non omnes, sed aliqui vocati sunt ad hanc visionem? Unus quidem erat qui solus indignus erat divinitatis visione, scilicet Iudas, secundum illud: tollatur impius, ne videat gloriam Dei. Si solus ergo esset omissus, tamquam invidus ad maiorem esset malitiam provocatus. Proinde proditori tollit proditionis occasionem, cum dimisit inferius reliquam apostolorum congeriem. Assumpsit autem tres, ut in duobus vel tribus stet omne verbum. Petrum quidem assumpsit, volens testimonium quod testatus fuerat, ei ostendere per patris testimonium confirmari, et quasi praesidem futurum totius Ecclesiae. Sed Iacobum assumpsit tamquam moriturum pro Christo ante omnes discipulos. Ioannem vero tamquam theologiae purissimum organum, ut visa gloria filii, quae non subiacet tempori, resonet illud: in principio erat verbum.
          <td><b>DAMASCENE</b>; Matthew and Mark indeed say that the transfiguration took place on the sixth day after the promise made to the disciples, but Luke on the eighth. But there is no disagreement in these testimonies, but they who make the number six, taking off a day at each end, that is, the first and the last, the day on which He makes the promise, and that on which He fulfilled it, have reckoned only the intervening ones, but He who makes the number eight, has counted in each of the two days above mentioned. But why were not all called, but only some, to behold the sight? T here was only one indeed who was unworthy to see the divinity, namely Judas, according to the word of Isaiah, Let the wicked be taken away, that he should not behold the glory of God. If then he alone had been sent away, he might have, as it were from envy, been provoked to greater wickedness. Henceforward He takes away from the traitor every pretext for his treachery, seeing that He left below the rest of the company of the Apostles. But He took with Him three, that in the mouths of two or three witnesses every word should be established. He took Peter, indeed, because He wished to show him that the witness he had borne to Him was confirmed by the witness of the Father, and that he was as it were to preside over the whole Church. He took with Him James, who was to be the first of all the disciples to die for Christ; but He took John as the clearest singer of the sacred doctrine, that having seen the glory of the Son, which submits not to time, he might sound forth, In the beginning was the Word.

          <td><b>DAMASCENE</b>; Now the devil, seeing His face shining in prayer, recollected Moses, whose face was glorified. But Moses indeed was arrayed with a glory, which came from without; our Lord, with that which proceeded from the inherent brightness of Divine glory. For since in the hypostatical union there is one and the same glory of the Word and the flesh, He is transfigured not as receiving what He was not, but manifesting to His disciples what He was. Hence, according to Matthew, it is said, that He was transfigured before them, and that His face shone as the sun; for what the sun is in things of sense, God is in spiritual things. And as the sun, which is the fountain of light, cannot be easily seen, but its light is perceived from that which reaches the earth; so the countenance of Christ shines more intensely, like the sun, but His raiment is white as snow; as it follows, And his raiment was white and glistening; that is, lighted up by its participation of the divine light. And a little afterwards, But while these things were so, that it might be shown there was but one Lord of the new and old covenant, and the mouths of heretics might be shut, and men might believe in the resurrection, and He also, who was transfigured, be believed to be the Lord of the living and the dead, Moses and Elias, as servants, stand by their Lord in His glory; hence it follows, And behold there talked with him two men. For it became men, seeing the glory and confidence of their fellow servants, to admire indeed the merciful condescension of the Lord, but to emulate those who had labored before them, and looking to the pleasantness of future blessings, to be the more strengthened for conflicts.

Volebat etiam discipulos eos imitari in regimine populi, ut fierent mites sicut Moyses, et zelantes sicut Elias.

And to make it plain that He was not an enemy of God, and transgressor of the law, He showed these two standing by Him; (for else, Moses the lawgiver, and Elias who was zealous for the glory of God, had not stood by Him,) but also to give testimony to the virtues of the men. For each had ofttimes exposed Himself to death in keeping the divine commands. He wishes also His disciples to imitate them in the government of the people, that they might be indeed meek like Moses, and zealous like Elias. He introduces them also to set forth the glory of His cross, to console Peter and the others who feared His Passion.

          <td><b>Beda</b>: Nam sicut post septimam sabbati, qua in sepulchro quieverat, a mortuis resurrexit, et nos post sex saeculi aetates, et septimam quietis animarum, quae interim in alia vita geritur, quasi octava aetate resurgemus.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; For as He rose from the dead after the seventh day of the Sabbath, during which He lay in the tomb, we also after the six ages of this world, and the seventh of the rest of souls, which meanwhile is passed in another life, shall rise again as it were in the eighth age.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Sed Matthaeus et Marcus post dies sex assumptos hos esse commemorarunt: de quo possemus dicere, quod post sex millia annorum, mille enim anni in conspectu Dei tamquam dies una. Sed plures quam sex millia computantur anni; et maluimus sex dies per symbolum intelligere, quod sex diebus mundi opera sunt creata, ut per tempus opera, et per opera mundum intelligamus. Et ideo mundi temporibus impletis, resurrectio futura monstratur, aut quia is qui supra mundum ascenderit, et huius saeculi momenta transcenderit, velut in sublimi locatus, futurae resurrectionis fructus expectabit in aeternum.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; But Matthew and Mark have related that He took them with Him after six days, of which we may say after 6000 years, (for a thousand years in the Lord’s sight are as one day;) but more than 6000 years are reckoned. We had rather then take the six days symbolically, that in six days the works of the world were completed, that by the time we may understand the works, by the works the world. And so the times of the world being finished, the resurrection to come is declared; or because, He who has ascended above the world, and has passed beyond the moments of this life, is waiting, seated as it were on a high place, for the everlasting fruit of the resurrection.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Unde in montem oraturus et transfigurandus ascendit, ut ostendat eos qui fructum resurrectionis expectant, et regem in decore suo videre desiderant, mente in excelsis habitare, et continuis precibus debere incumbere.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Hence He ascends the mountain to pray and be transfigured, to show that those who expect the fruit of the resurrection, and desire to see the King in His glory, ought to have the dwelling place of their hearts on high, and be ever on their knees in prayer.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Putarem in tribus qui ducuntur ad montem, mystice genus humanum comprehensum, quia ex tribus filiis Noe genus omne defluxit humanum, nisi electos cernerem. Tres igitur eliguntur qui ascendunt in montem; quia nemo potest resurrectionis videre gloriam, nisi qui mysterium Trinitatis incorrupta fidei sinceritate servaverit.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; I should think that in the three who are taken up into the mountain, was contained in a mystery the human race, because from the three sons of Noah sprung the whole race of man; I did not perceive that they were chosen out. Three then are chosen to ascend the mountain, because none can see the glory of the resurrection, but they who have preserved the mystery of the Trinity with inviolable purity of faith.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Transfiguratus autem salvator gloriam futurae vel suae vel nostrae resurrectionis ostendit; qui qualis tunc apostolis apparuit, post iudicium cunctis apparebit electis. Vestitus autem talis domini sanctorum illius chorus accipitur: qui videlicet domino in terris consistente despectus videbatur; sed illo montem petente, novo candore refulget: quia nunc filii Dei sumus, et nondum apparuit quid erimus; scimus autem quoniam, cum apparuerit, similes ei erimus.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Now the transfigured Savior shows the glory of His own coming, or our resurrection; who as He then appeared to His Apostles shall in like manner appear to all the elect. But the raiment of the Lord is taken for the band of His Saints, which in truth when our Lord was upon earth seemed to be despised, but when He sought the mount, shines with a new whiteness; for now are we the sons of God; and it does not yet appear what we shall be. But we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Vel aliter. Pro tua possibilitate tibi verbum aut minuitur aut crescit; ac nisi altioris prudentiae cacumen ascendas, non tibi apparet quanta sit gloria in Dei verbo. Vestimenta autem verbi sunt sermones Scripturarum, et quaedam intellectus indumenta divini. Et sicut vestitus albus refulsit, ita in oculis tuae mentis divinarum lectionum sensus albescit. Inde apparet Moyses et Elias, hoc est lex et propheta in verbo; neque enim lex potest esse sine verbo, nec propheta nisi qui de Dei filio prophetavit.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Or else, according to your capacity is the word either lessened or increased to you, and unless you ascend the summit of a higher wisdom, you behold not what glory there is in the word of God. Now the garments of the Word, are the discourses of the Scriptures, and certain clothings of the Divine mind; and as His raiment shone white, so in the eyes of your understanding, the sense of the divine words becomes clear. Hence after Moses, Elias; that is, the Law and the Prophets in the Word. For neither can the Law exist without the Word, nor the Prophet, unless he prophesied of the Son of God.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. While Christ is engaged in prayer, Peter is heavy with sleep, for he was weak, and did what was natural to man; as it is said, But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep. But when they awake, they behold His glory, and the two men with Him; as it follows, And when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.

          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Premit enim incomprehensibilis splendor divinitatis, nostri corporis sensus: nam si solis radium e regione oculorum contuentium corporea nequit acies continere, quomodo Dei gloriam humanorum ferret corruptela membrorum? Et fortasse ideo gravati somno erant, ut resurrectionis viderent speciem post quietem. Itaque vigilantes viderunt maiestatem eius: nemo enim nisi vigilans gloriam videt Christi. Delectatus est Petrus: et quem saeculi huius illecebrosa non caperent, gloria resurrectionis illexit; unde sequitur et factum est cum discederent ab illo, ait Petrus ad Iesum: praeceptor, bonum est nos hic esse.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; For the incomprehensible brightness of the Divine nature oppresses our bodily senses. For if the sight of the body is unable to contain the sun’s ray when opposite to the eyes which behold it, how can the corruption of our fleshly members endure the glory of God? And perhaps they were oppressed with sleep, that after their rest they might behold the sight of the resurrection. Therefore when they were awake they saw His glory. For no one, except he is watching, sees the glory of Christ. Peter was delighted, and as the allurements of this world enticed him not, was carried away by the glory of the resurrection. Hence it follows, And it came to pass as they departed, &amp;c.

          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Aestimabat forsan divus Petrus imminere tempus regni Dei; et ideo approbat montis incolatum.

Non quaeras ante tempus felicia, ut Adam deificationem. Erit quando hunc aspectum indesinenter percipias, et cohabitabis illi qui lux est et vita.
          <td>DAMAS. It were not good for you, Peter, that Christ should abide there, for if He had remained, the promise made to you would never receive its accomplishment. For neither would you have obtained the keys of the kingdom, nor the tyranny of death been abolished. Seek not bliss before its time, as Adam did to be made a God. The time shall come when you shall enjoy the sight without ceasing, and dwell together with Him who is light and life.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; But Peter distinguished not only by earnest feeling, but also by devout deeds, wishing like a zealous workman to build three tabernacles, offers the service of their united labor; for it follows, let us make three tabernacles, one for you, &amp;c.

Your words have been brought to pass by your disciples, by your sheep, in building a tabernacle, not only for Christ, but also for His servants. But Peter said not this deliberately, but through the inspiration of the Spirit revealing things to come, as it follows, not knowing what he said.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Nesciebat etiam quid diceret: neque enim aderat tempus finis saeculi, nec participandae a sanctis promissae spei: et cum iam sumeret exordium dispensatio, quo pacto Christum oportebat desistere a mundi dilectione, volentem pati pro eo?

          <td><b>TITUS BOST</b>. Peter also was ignorant what he said, seeing that it was not proper to make three tabernacles for the three. For the servants are not received with their Lord, the creature is not placed beside the Creator.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Neque capit humana conditio in hoc corruptibili corpore facere tabernaculum Deo, sive in animo, sive in corpore, sive in quolibet alio loco. Et quamvis nesciret quid diceret, tamen pollicebatur officium; cui non inconsulta petulantia, sed praematura devotio fructus pietatis accumulat: nam quod ignorabat, conditionis fuit; quod promittebat, devotionis.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Nor does the condition of man in this corruptible body allow of making a tabernacle to God, whether in the soul or in the body, or in any other place; and although he knew not what he said, yet a service was offered which not by any deliberate forwardness, but its premature devotion, receives in abundance the fruits of piety. For his ignorance was part of his condition, his offer of devotion.

Aderat quoque Moyses, qui nubem intravit, et Elias, qui in monte ignem deduxit. Igitur Evangelista confusionem mentis eius ex qua hoc proferebat, ostendens, dixit nesciens quid diceret.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Or else Peter heard that it was necessary Christ must die, and on the third day rise again, but he saw around him a very remote and solitary place; he supposed therefore that the place had some great protection. For this reason he said, It is good for us to be here. Moses a too was present, who entered into the cloud. Elias, who on the mount brought down fire from heaven. The Evangelist then, to indicate the confusion of mind in which he utters this, added, Not knowing what he said.

          <td><b>Augustinus de Cons. Evang</b>: Quod autem hic Lucas dixit de Moyse et Elia et factum est dum discederent ab illo, ait Petrus ad Iesum: praeceptor, bonum est nos hic esse, non debet putari contrarium ei quod Matthaeus et Marcus ita coniunxerunt, Petrum haec suggessisse, quasi adhuc Moyses et Elias cum domino loquerentur; non enim expresserunt tunc, sed tacuerunt potius quod iste addidit, illis descendentibus, hoc Petrum domino suggessisse.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Now in what Luke here says of Moses and Elias, And it came to pass as they departed from him, Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here, he must not be thought contrary to Matthew and Mark, who have so connected Peter’s suggestion of this, as if Moses and Elias were still speaking with our Lord. For they did not expressly state that Peter said it then, but rather were silent about what Luke added, that as they departed, Peter suggested this to our Lord.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Petro autem dicente faciamus tria tabernacula, dominus tabernaculum non manufactum fabricat, et in eum ingreditur cum prophetis; unde subditur haec autem illo loquente, facta est nubes, et obumbravit eos: ut ostenderet quod non minor est patre: sicut enim in veteri testamento in nube habitare dominus dicebatur, sic et nunc nubes suscepit dominum, non caliginosa, sed lucida.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. But while Peter spoke, our Lord builds a tabernacle not made with hands, and enters into it with the Prophets. Hence it is added, While he thus spoke there came a cloud and overshadowed them, to show that He was not inferior to the Father. For as in the Old Testament it was said, the Lord dwelt in the cloud, so now also a cloud received our Lord, not a dark cloud, but bright and shining.

          <td><b>Basilius</b>: Nam obscuritas legis transierat: sicut enim fumus ab igne, sic nubes a luce causata est. Verum, quia nebula signum tranquillitatis est, quies futurae mansionis ostenditur per nubis operimentum.
          <td><b>BASIL</b>; For the obscurity of the Law had passed away; for as smoke is caused by the fire, so the cloud by light; but because a cloud is the sign of calmness, the rest of the future state is signified by the covering of a cloud.

          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; Now His disciples being unable to bear this, fell down, humbled under the mighty hand of God, greatly tom afraid since they knew what was said to Moses, No man shall see my face, and live. Hence it follows, And they feared as they entered into the cloud.

          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Cognosce autem nubem istam non coacti aeris caligine piceam, et quae caelum tenebrarum horrore subtexat, sed lucidam nubem, quae nos non pluvialibus aquis immadidet, sed qua mentes hominum in voce Dei omnipotentis emissa fidei ros rigavit; sequitur enim et vox facta est de nube, dicens: hic est filius meus dilectus. Non Elias filius, non Moyses filius; sed hic est filius, quem solum videtis.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Now observe, that the cloud was not black from the darkness of condensed air, and such as to overcast the sky with a horrible gloom, but a shining cloud, from which we were not moistened with rain, but as the voice of Almighty God came forth the dew of faith was shed upon the hearts of men. For it follows, And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear you him. Elias was not His Son. Moses was not. But this is the Son whom you see alone.

Quasi dicat: non unus ex filiis, sed qui vere et naturaliter est filius; ad cuius exemplar alii sunt adoptivi. Illi ergo iussit obedire, cum subdit ipsum audite; et magis quam Moysen et Eliam, quia Christus est finis legis et prophetarum; unde signanter Evangelista subdit et dum fieret vox, inventus est Iesus solus.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; How then should men suppose Him who is really the Son to be made or created, when God the Father thundered c. from above, This is my beloved Son! as if He said, Not one of My sons, but He who is truly and by nature My Son, according to whose example the others are adopted. He ordered them then to obey Him, when He added, Hear you him. And to obey Him more than Moses and Elias, for Christ is the end of the Law and the Prophets. Hence the Evangelist adds significantly, And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Ne scilicet putaret aliquis hoc dictum hic est filius meus dilectus, de Moyse vel Elia fuisse prolatum.

          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Recesserunt ergo illi ubi coeperat dominus designari. Tres etiam in principio videntur, unus in fine: perfecta enim fine unum sunt. Ergo et illi quasi recipiuntur in Christi corpus, quia et nos unum erimus in Christo Iesu; aut fortasse quia lex et prophetae ex verbo.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; They then departed, when our Lord’s manifestation had begun. There are three seen at the beginning, one at the end; for faith being made perfect, they are one. Therefore are they also received into the body of Christ, because we also shall be one in Christ Jesus; or perhaps, because the Law and the Prophets came out from the Word.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Quae autem ex verbo coeperunt, in verbo desinunt: per hoc enim innuit quod usque ad tempus aliquod lex et prophetae apparerent, sicut hic Moyses et Elias; postmodum autem solus Iesus, illis recedentibus: nam nunc Evangelium manet transactis legalibus.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Now those things which began from the Word, end in the Word. For by this he implies that up to a certain time the Law and the Prophets appear, as here Moses and Elias; but afterwards, at their departure, Jesus is alone. For now abides the Gospel, legal things having passed away.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; And mark, that as when our Lord was baptized in Jordan, so also when He was glorified on the Mount, the mystery of the whole Trinity is declared, for His glory which we confess at baptism, we shall see at the resurrection. Nor in vain does the Holy Spirit appear here in the cloud, there in the form of a dove, seeing that he who now preserves with a simple heart the faith which he receives, shall then in the light of open vision look upon those things which he believed.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Origenes</b>: Non vult autem Iesus dici quae ipsius spectant ad gloriam ante suam passionem; unde sequitur et ipsi tacuerunt, et nemini dixerunt in illis diebus quicquam ex his quae viderant: offensi enim fuissent, et praecipue vulgus, si vidisset crucifigi eum qui sic fuerat glorificatus.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; Now Jesus wishes not those things which relate to His glory to be spoken of before His passion. Hence it follows, And they kept it close. For men would have been offended, especially the multitude, if they saw Him crucified Who had been so glorified.

          <td><b>DAMAS</b>. This also our Lord commands, since He knew His disciples to be imperfect, seeing that they had not yet received the full measure of the Spirit, lest the hearts of others who had not seen should be prostrated by sorrow, and lest the traitor should be stirred up to a frantic hatred.

On the Mount our Lord prays, is transfigured, reveals the secrets of His glory to His disciples; as He descends to the lower parts, He is received by a large concourse. As it is said, And it came to pass, that on the next day, when he was come down from the hill, much people met him. Above He makes known the voice of the Father, below He expels the evil spirits.

Hoc enim sufficit ad salutem, sicut propheta dicebat: respice in me, et miserere mei. Et dicit in filium meum, ut rationabilem demonstret inverecundiam, quod solus in multitudine clamat. Addit quia unicus est mihi; quasi dicat: nullus alius expectatur futurus remedium senectutis. Consequenter explicat passionem, ut audientem moveat ad pietatem, dicens et ecce spiritus apprehendit eum, et subito clamat, et elidit, et dissipat eum cum spuma, et vix discedit dilanians eum. Deinde videtur criminari discipulos; sed magis respondit, quod iuste verecundiam deposuerit, dicens et rogavi discipulos tuos ut eicerent illum, et non potuerunt; quasi dicat: non putes quod leviter ad te pervenerim: stupenda est dignitas tua, nec statim te molestavi: ad discipulos tuos accessi primo; nunc quia non curaverunt, cogor proficisci ad te; unde et dominus non ipsum, sed genus incredulum increpat; sequitur enim respondens autem Iesus dixit: o generatio infidelis et perversa, usquequo ero apud vos, et patiar vos?
          <td><b>TITUS BOST</b>. It seems indeed to me that this was a wise man. For he said not to the Savior, “Do this or that,” but, Look on my son, for this suffices for His salvation; as the prophet said, Look on me, and have mercy on me; and he says, on my son, to show that his was a reasonable forwardness in crying out aloud among the multitude. He adds, for he is my only child. As if to say, There is none other I can expect to be the consolation of my old age. He next enters into the sufferings, that he may move his Hearer to compassion, saying, And, lo, the spirit takes him. He then seems to accuse the disciples, but his answer is rather a justification of his casting aside his fear, saying, And I besought your disciples to cast him out: and they could not. As if he said, Think not that I have come lightly to You. Marvelous is Your greatness! I did not intrude upon Your presence at once, but went first to Your disciples. Because they failed to work the cure, I am now compelled to approach You. Our Lord therefore does not blame him, but the faithless generation; for it follows, And Jesus answering said, Of faithless and perverse generation.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Matthaeum</b>: Sed hunc hominem multum infirmari in fide, Evangeliorum Scriptura ostendit ex pluribus; ex eo scilicet quod dixit: adiuva incredulitatem meam, et: si potes, et ex eo quod Christus dixit: credenti omnia possibilia sunt.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But that this man was much weakened in faith, the writings of the Gospel show us in several places. In that place where he says, Help you my unbelief; and, If you can. And in that where Christ said, All things are possible to him that believes, &amp;c.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Unde melius puto incredulum reputatum daemoniaci patrem, quod et sacros apostolos obiurgavit, dicens eos non posse imperare Daemonibus; potius autem erat honorando Deum ab eo petere gratiam; annuit enim veneratus. Qui autem dicit debilitari erga virtutem quae est in spiritus malignos, eos qui a Christo adepti sunt potestatem eiciendi eos, gratiam magis calumniatur quam fulgentes ea, in quibus Christus operatur. Unde offenditur Christus accusatis sanctis quibus est commissum verbum praedicationum sacrarum; propter quod dominus increpat eum et concordes ei, dicens o generatio infidelis et perversa; quasi dicat: causa tuae infidelitatis, gratia effectum sortita non est.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Hence it seems to me more correct to account the father of the demoniac unbelieving, because he also casts reproach upon the holy Apostles, saying that they could not subdue the evil spirits. But it were better to have sought favor from God by honoring Him, for He has respect to them that fear Him. But he who says that those are weak with respect to their power over evil spirits, who have obtained that power from Christ, calumniates rather the grace than those who are adorned with that grace in whom Christ works. Christ is therefore offended with the accusation of the saints, to whom was entrusted the word of holy preaching. Wherefore the Lord rebukes him and those like-minded with him, saying, O faithless and perverse generation. As if He said, Because of your unbelief the grace has not received its accomplishment.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Non autem dirigit sermonem ad eum tantum, sed ad omnes Iudaeos, ne faciat eum haesitare: oportebat enim scandalizari quamplures.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Now He does not direct His words to him alone but to all the Jews, lest He should cause him to doubt. For it must have been that many were offended.

          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Quod autem dicit perversa, demonstrat quod non a principio, neque naturaliter inerat eis malitia; sed natura quidem erant recti semen Abrahae existentes, sed per malitiam erant perversi.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. By the word perverse, He shows that this wickedness in them was not originally or by nature, for by nature indeed they were upright, being the seed of Abraham, but became perverted through malice.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Quasi nescientes procedere rectis incessibus. Cum eis autem qui sic sunt dispositi, Christus commorari dedignatur; unde dicitur usquequo ero apud vos, et patiar vos? Ferens quasi moleste eorum conversationem propter pravitatem ipsorum.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; As if not knowing how to continue in the right beginnings. Now Christ disdains to dwell with those who are thus disposed. Hence He says, How long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Feeling troubled with their company, because of their evil deeds.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Per hoc etiam ostendit desideratum sibi esse suum recessum, et quod non erat grave crucis patibulum, sed magis ipsorum conversatio.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Hereby also He shows that His departure was desired by Him, not because the suffering of the cross was grievous, but rather their conversation.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Not that weariness has overcome His patience, but after the manner of a physician, when he sees a sick man acting contrary to his commands, he says, How long shall I come to your house when I order one thing, you do another. But to prove that He was not angry with the man, but with the sin, He immediately added, Bring your son hither.

          <td><b>Titus</b>: Poterat quidem solo iussu eum liberare; sed propalat suam passionem subiciens infirmum praesentium visioni.

          <td><b>TITUS BOST</b>. He might indeed have healed him by His simple command, but He makes his sufferings public, bringing, the weak in faith to the sight of things present. Then the devil, when he perceived our Lord, rends and dashes the child down; as it follows, And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tore him; that so first the sufferings should be made manifest, then the remedy be applied.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Non tamen hoc dominus ad ostentationem facit, sed causa patris; ut cum viderit Daemonium conturbari propter solam vocationem, sic saltem inducatur ad fidem futuri miraculi; de quo sequitur et increpavit Iesus spiritum immundum, et sanavit puerum, et reddidit illum patri eius.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. The Lord however does this not for display, but for the father’s sake, that upon seeing the devil disturbed at the mere summons, he might thus at least be led to the belief of the future miracles; of which it follows, And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Antea autem non erat patris, sed Daemonis occupantis. Subdit autem Evangelista stupere plebem in magnaliis Dei, dicens stupebant autem omnes in magnitudine Dei, quod dicit propter donum Christi, qui sacris quoque apostolis contulit potestatem agendi divina miracula, et imperandi Daemonibus.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Now before not his father but the devil possessed him, but now the Evangelist adds that the people were astonished at the greatness of God, saying, And all were amazed at the mighty power of God, which he says, because of the gift of Christ, who conferred on the holy Apostles also the power of working divine miracles, and having the mastery over evil spirits.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Mystice autem pro qualitate meritorum quotidie aliis ascendit dominus, dum perfectos, quorum conversatio in caelis est, sublimius extollendo glorificat, et de aeternis instruit, et docet quae a turbis audiri non valent; aliis autem descendit, dum terrenos et insipientes confortat, docet et castigat. Hunc autem daemoniacum Matthaeus lunaticum, Marcus surdum et mutum describit: significat enim illos qui ut luna mutantur, per diversa vitia crescentes et decrescentes; qui muti sunt non confitendo fidem, et surdi, nec ipsum fidei audiendo sermonem. Dum puer autem ad dominum accedit, eliditur: quia conversi ad dominum plerumque a Daemonio gravius pulsantur, ut vel odium virtutis incutiat, vel expulsionis suae vindicet iniuriam: sicut Ecclesiae primordiis tot gravissima intulit certamina, quot suo regno doluit subito illata dispendia. Non puerum autem qui vim patiebatur, sed Daemonem qui inferebat increpat: quia qui peccantem emendare desiderat, vitium arguendo et odiendo depellere, sed hominem debet amando refovere, donec sanatum spiritualibus Ecclesiae possit reddere patribus.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Now in a mystical manner in proportion to their deserts does our Lord daily ascend to some men, seeing that the perfect and those whose conversation is in heaven, He glorifies by exalting higher, instructing them in things eternal, and teaching them things which can not be heard by the multitude, but to others he descends, in that He strengthens the earthly and foolish men, teaching and chastening them. Now this demoniac Matthew calls a lunatic; Mark, deaf and dumb. Matthew signifies those who change as the moon, increasing and decreasing through different vices, Mark those, who are dumb in not confessing the faith, deaf in not hearings the very word of faith. While the boy is coming to our Lord, he is dashed to the ground; because men when turned to the Lord are often grievously afflicted by the devil, that he may instill a hatred of virtue, or revenge the injury of his expulsion. As in the beginning of the Church he waged as many fierce conflicts as he had to bewail losses suddenly brought upon His kingdom. But our Lord rebukes not the boy who suffered violence, but the evil spirit who inflicted it; for he who desires to correct the sinner, ought by reproof and abhorrence to drive away the vice, but to revive the man by gentleness, until he can restore him to the spiritual father of the Church.

Et si omnes quidem mirarentur in his quae faciebat, ipse tamen haec quae sequuntur, non omnibus, sed discipulis retulit; unde dicitur omnibusque mirantibus in omnibus quae faciebat, dixit ad discipulos suos: ponite vos in cordibus vestris sermones istos. Ostenderat in monte discipulos gloriam suam, et post hoc liberaverat quemdam a spiritu nequam; sed oportebat eum sustinere passionem pro nobis. Poterant autem discipuli conturbari dicentes: numquid decepti sumus dum Deum esse eum arbitraremur? Ut ergo scirent quid circa ipsum futurum erat, velut quoddam depositum iubet eos in mente habere passionis mysterium, dicens ponite vos in cordibus vestris. Quod dicit vos, distinguit eos ab aliis: neque enim oportebat vulgares scire quoniam passurus esset; sed erant potius certificandi quoniam mortuus resurgeret, destruens mortem, ne scandalizarentur.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Every thing that Jesus did claimed admiration from all men for a peculiar and divine light reflected upon each; of His works, according to the Psalms, honor and majesty will you lay upon him. Although all indeed man marveled at those things which He did, He however addresses what follows, not to all, but to His disciples; as it is said, But while they wondered every one, &amp;c. He had shown His glory on the mount to His disciples, and after this delivered a man from an evil spirit, but it was necessary for Him to undergo His passion for our salvation. Now His disciples might have been perplexed, saying, “Have we then been deceived in that we thought him to be God?” That they might know then what was to happen to Him, He bids them lay up in their minds as a certain deposit the mystery of His passion, saying, Let these sayings sink down in your hearts. By the word your, He distinguishes them from others. For the multitude were not to know that He was about to suffer, but were rather to be assured that the dead would rise again, destroying death, lest they should be offended.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Titus</b>: Cunctis igitur admirantibus signa, ipse praenuntiat passionem: non enim signa salvant, sed crux beneficia praestat; unde subditur filius enim hominis futurum est ut tradatur in manus hominum.
          <td><b>TITUS BOST</b>. While all thus were wondering at the miracles, He foretell His passion. For miracles do not save, but the cross conveys the benefit. Hence he adds, For the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men.

          <td><b>Origenes in Matthaeum</b>: Non autem exprimit manifeste a quo tradendus sit: aliquis enim dicit eum tradendum a Iuda, aliquis a populo. Paulus autem dicit quod Deus pater pro nobis omnibus tradidit eum; sed Iudas tamquam pro pecunia tradens eum hostiliter prodidit; sed pater beneficii causa.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; But it is not clearly expressed by whom He is to be delivered, for one says, that He is to be delivered up by Judas, another by the devil; but Paul says, that God the Father delivered Him up for us all; but Judas, as he delivered Him up for money, did it traitorously, the Father for His mercies’ sake.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Now our Lord in condescension to their infirmities and governing them with a kind of economy, did not permit them to understand what was said of the cross; as it follows, But they understood not.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; This ignorance of the disciples proceeds not so much from slowness of understanding as from affection, for since they were yet carnal and ignorant of the mystery of the cross, they could not believe that He whom they thought to be really God would suffer death. And because they were often accustomed to hear Him speak by figure, they thought that He meant figuratively something else, by what He said of His betrayal.

And if indeed by carnal allurements he can gain possession of a man’s heart, He sharpens his love of pleasure; but if a man has escaped these snares, he excites in him a desire of glory, and this passion for vain-glory had seized some one of His apostles. Hence it is said, Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be the greatest. For to have such thoughts, belongs to him who desires to be superior to the rest; but I think it improbable that all the disciples gave way to this weakness; and therefore suppose that the Evangelist, not to seem to lay the charge to any individual, expresses himself indefinitely, seeing, that there arose a reasoning among them.

          <td><b>Beda</b>: Vel quia viderant Petrum, Iacobum et Ioannem seorsum ductos in montem, et Petro claves regni caelorum promissas fuisse, irati sunt, vel ipsos tres ceteris, vel Petrum omnibus esse praelatum: vel quia tributi solutione Petrum ipsi domino parificatum viderant, ipsum prae ceteris arbitrabantur praeferendum. Sed diligens lector hanc intra eos quaestionem etiam ante didrachma redditum inveniet fuisse versatam. Denique Matthaeus hoc in Capharnaum memorat esse gestum. Dicit autem Marcus: et venerunt Capharnaum. Qui cum in domo essent, interrogabat eos: quid in via tractabatis? At illi tacebant: siquidem inter se in via disputaverant quis illorum esset maior.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Or, because they saw Peter, James, and John, taken apart to the mount, and the keys of the kingdom of heaven promised to Peter, they were angry that these three, or Peter, should have precedence over all; or because in the payment of the tribute they saw Peter made equal to the Lord, they supposed he was to be placed before the rest. But the attentive reader will find that the question was raised among them before the payment of the penny. For in truth Matthew relates that this took place at Capernaum; but Mark says, And he came to Capernaum, and being; the house, he asked them, What was it that you disputed among yourselves in the way? But they held their peace, for by the way they had disputed among themselves who should be the greatest.

Discat qui nudum hominem putat esse Iesum, se errasse; quamvis enim verbum caro factum sit, mansit tamen Deus: nam solius Dei est posse rimari corda et renes. Quod autem puerum assumpsit, et ponebat penes se, agebatur causa apostolorum utilitatis et nostrae. Depascitur enim inanis gloriae morbus ut plurimum eos, qui praeeminent in hominibus aliis. Puer autem sinceram gerit mentem, immaculatum cor, et manet in simplicitate cogitationum: non ambit honores, nec novit cuiusvis praerogativae modum, nec refugit videri minus se habere, non multam gerit severitatem in mente et corde. Tales autem dominus amplexatur, et diligit, et prope se dignatur habere, quasi qui elegerunt quae sua sunt sapere. Ait enim: discite a me, quia mitis sum et humilis corde; unde sequitur et ait: quicumque susceperit puerum istum in nomine meo, me recipit; quasi dicat: quando una et eadem est merces honorantibus sanctos, sive forsan minimus sit, sive praeclarus honore et gloria, quia in eo Christus suscipitur; quomodo non vanum est petere invicem fungi praerogativa?
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; But our Lord, Who knew how to save, seeing in the hearts of the disciples the thought that had risen up thereupon as it were a certain root of bitterness, plucks it up by the roots before it received growth. For when passions first begin in us, they are easily subdued; but having gained strength, they are with difficulty eradicated. Hence it follows, And Jesus perceiving the thought of their heart &amp;c. Let him who thinks Jesus to be mere man, know that he has erred, for the Word, although made flesh, remained God. For it is God alone Who is able to search into the heart and reins. But in taking a child, and placing it beside Him, He did it for the Apostles’ sake and ours. For the disease of vain-glory feeds generally on those who have the preeminence among other men. But a child has a pure mind and unspotted heart, and abides in simplicity of thought; he courts not honors, nor knows the limits each one’s power, nor shuns seeming to be inferior to others, bearing no moroseness in his mind or heart. Such the Lord embraces and loves, and thinks them worthy to be near Him, as those who had chosen to taste of the things which are His; for He says, Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly of heart. Hence it follows, And he says to them, Whosoever shall receive a child in my name, receives me. As if He were to say, Seeing that there is one and the same reward to those that honor the saints, whether perchance such an one be the least, or one distinguished for honors and glory, for in him is Christ received, how vain is it to see to have the preeminence;

Sed quia et se in puero suscipi docet, et ipse puer natus est nobis, ne putaretur hoc esse solum quod videbatur, subiunxit et quicumque me recipit, recipit illum qui misit me: talem se utique ac tantum credi volens, qualis et quantus est pater.

Hence when He said, Whoever shall receive that child, he adds, in my name; that in truth they may pursue with diligence and reason for Christ’s name that form of virtue which the child observes, with only nature for its guide. But because He also teaches that He is received in the child, and He Himself was born to us a child; lest it should be thought that this was all which was seen, He subjoined, And whoever shall receive me, receives him that sent me; wishing verily to be believed, that as was the Father, such and so great was He.

Because then our Lord had said, He who is least among you all, the same shall be great, John feared, lest perhaps they had done wrong in hindering a certain man by their own power. For a prohibition does not show the probitor to be inferior, but to be one who thinks himself somewhat superior. Hence it is added, And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in your name, and we forbade him. Not indeed from envy, but to distinguish the working of miracles, for he had not received the power of working miracles with them, nor had the Lord sent him as He did them; nor did he follow Jesus in all things.

But what if there should be both those which be numbered together with the Apostles, and those who are crowned with the grace of Christ; there are many diversities in Christ’s gifts. But because the Savior had given the Apostles power to cast out evil spirits, they thought no one else but themselves alone was permitted to have this privilege granted to him, and therefore they come to inquire if it were lawful for others also to do this.

For both Joseph and Nicodemus, through fear Your secret disciples, when the time came, did not refuse their offices. But still since you said elsewhere, He that is not with me is against me, and he that gathers not with me scatters, explain to us lest the two seem contrary to one another.

But we ought to perceive that there is no difference of opinion, but that the decision is this, that not only the official works but works of virtue are required in a priest, and that the name of Christ is so great, that even to the unholy it serves to give defense, but not grace. Let no one then claim to himself the grace of cleansing a man, because in him the power of the eternal Name has worked. For not by your merits, but by his own hatred, the devil is conquered.

In order then that they might not be offended, when they saw Him suffer, bearing in mind that they must also endure patiently when men persecute them, He ordained beforehand as a land of prelude this refusal of the Samaritans. It was good for them also in another way. For they were to be the teachers of the world, going through towns and villages, to preach the doctrine of the Gospel, meeting sometimes with men who would not receive the sacred doctrine, allowing not that Jesus sojourned on earth with them. He therefore taught them, that in announcing the divine doctrine, they ought to be filled with patience and meekness, without bitterness, and wrath, and fierce enmity against those who had done any wrong to them. But as yet they were not so, nay, being stirred up with fervid zeal, they wished to bring down fire from heaven upon them.

Itaque posteaquam eos docuit quid esset diligere proximum tamquam seipsum, infuso etiam spiritu sancto non defuerunt tales vindictae, quamvis multo rarius quam in veteri testamento: quia, sicut sequitur, filius hominis non venit animas perdere, sed salvare; quasi dicat: et vos ergo, qui eius spiritu signati estis, etiam acta eius imitamini, nunc pie consulentes, sed in futuro iuste iudicantes.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; The Lord blames them, not for following the example of the holy Prophet, but for their ignorance in taking vengeance while they were yet inexperienced, perceiving that they did not desire correction from love, but vengeance from hatred. After that He had taught them what it was to love their neighbor as themselves, and the Holy Ghost also had been infused into them, there were not lacking these punishments, though far less frequent than in the Old Testament, because the Son of man came not to destroy men’s lives, but to save them. As if He said, And do you therefore who are sealed with His Spirit, imitate also His actions, now determining charitably, hereafter judging justly.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; For we must not always punish the offender, since mercy sometimes does more good, leading you to patience, the sinner to repentance. Lastly, those Samaritans believed the sooner, who were in this place saved from fire.

Primo quidem plurima continetur in accessu inertia; consequenter ostenditur quod plenus impudentia nimia: neque enim simpliciter Christum sequi petebat, sicut alii plures de populo; sed magis insiliebat ad apostolicas dignitates, cum Paulus dicat: non assumat quisquam sibi honorem, sed a Deo vocatus.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Although the Almighty Lord is bountiful, He does not grant to every one absolutely and indiscriminately heavenly and divine gifts, but to those only who are worthy to receive them, who free themselves and their souls from the stains of wickedness. And this we are taught by the force of the angelic words, And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man said to him, Lord, I will follow you. First indeed there is much tardiness implied in the manner of his coming. It is next shown that he is filled with too great presumption. For he sought not to follow Christ simply as several others of the people, but rather caught at the honor of the Apostleship. Whereas Paul says, No one takes the honor to himself but he that is called of God.

          <td><b>ATHAN</b>. He dared also to match himself with the incomprehensible power of the Savior, saying, I will follow you wherever you go; for to follow the Savior simply to hear His teaching is possible to human nature, as it directs itself towards men, but it is not possible to go with Him wherever He is; for He is incomprehensible, and is not confined by place.

Sequitur et ait Iesus: vulpes foveas habent et volucres caeli nidos; filius autem hominis non habet ubi caput suum reclinet.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; In another respect also our Lord deservedly gives him a refusal, for He taught that to follow the Lord, a man must take up his cross, and renounce the affection of this present life.

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Now under a mystical signification He applies the name of foxes and birds of the air to the wicked and crafty powers of evil spirits.

Ita sunt haeretici, qui domum sibi parare non norunt, sed circumscriptionibus suis alios decipere conantur. Hoc animal neque mansuescit unquam; unde apostolus ait: haereticum hominem post unam correctionem devita. Volucres vero caeli frequenter ad nequitiae spiritualis similitudinem derivantur; et veluti nidos quosdam struunt in pectoribus improborum: et ideo dominante versutia in affectibus singulorum, nulla potest divinitatis esse possessio; ubi autem mentem probaverit innoxiam, supra ipsum quodammodo vim suae maiestatis reclinat, quia profusiore quadam gratia honorum pectoribus inseritur. Sic igitur non videtur convenire rationi ut simplicem fidelemque ipsum arbitremur qui domini dignatione respuitur, cum indefessi famulatus obsequium spopondisset. Sed dominus non obsequiorum speciem, sed puritatem quaerit affectus; nec obsequium eius admittitur cuius non probatur officium: circumspectum etenim fidei debet esse hospitium: ne dum infidelibus nostrae domus interna reseramus, in alienam perfidiam improvida credulitate labamur. Itaque ut advertas Deum non cultus aspernantem esse, sed fraudis; qui repudiavit fraudulentum, elegit innocentem; sequitur enim ait autem ad alterum: sequere me. Sed hoc dicit ei cuius patrem iam sciebat mortuum; unde sequitur ille autem dixit: domine, permitte mihi primum ire et sepelire patrem meum.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Or, He compares foxes to heretics, because they are indeed a wily animal, and, ever intent upon fraud, commit their robberies by stealth. They let nothing be safe, nothing be at rest, nothing secure, for they hunt their prey into the very abodes of men. The fox again, an animal full of craft, makes no hole for itself, yet likes to lie always concealed in a hole. So the heretics, who know not how to construct a house for themselves, circumscribe and deceive others. This animal is never tamed, nor is it of use to man. Hence the Apostle, A heretic after the first and second admonition reject. But the birds of the air, which are frequently brought in to represent spiritual wickedness, build as it were their nests in the breasts of the wicked, and as long as deceit reigns over the affections, the divine principle has no opportunity to take possession. But when a man has proved his heart to be innocent, upon him Christ leans in some measure the weight of His greatness, for by a more abundant shedding of grace He is planted in the breasts of good men. So then it does not seem reasonable that we should think him faithful and simple, who is rejected by the judgment of the Lord, notwithstanding that he promised the service of unwearied attendance; but our Lord cares not for this kind of service, but only purity of affection, nor is his attendance accepted whose sense of duty is not proved. For the hospitality of faith should be given with circumspection, lest while opening the interior of our house to the unbelieving, through our imprudent credulity we fall a snare to the treachery of others. Therefore that you may be aware that God despises not attendance upon him but deceit, He who rejected the deceitful man chose the innocent. For it follows, And he said to another, Follow me. But He says this to him, whose father He knew to be dead. Hence it follows, But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.

          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Sed dominus quos miseretur advocat; unde sequitur dixitque Iesus: sine ut mortui sepeliant mortuos suos; tu autem vade, et annuntia regnum Dei. Cum religiosum humani corporis sepeliendi acceperimus officium, quomodo paterni quoque funeris sepultura prohibetur, nisi ut intelligas humana posthabenda divinis? Bonum studium, sed maius impedimentum; nam qui partitur studium, derivat affectum; qui dividit curam, differt profectum; ergo prius sunt obeunda quae maxima: nam et apostoli ne occuparentur studio dispensandi, ministros pauperibus ordinaverunt.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; But the Lord calls those upon whom He has compassion. Hence it follows, And Jesus said, Let the dead bury their dead. Since we have received as a religious duty the burial of the human body, how is it thus that the burial even of a father’s dead body is forbidden, unless you are to understand that human things are to be postponed to divine? It is a good employment, but the hindrance is greater, for he who divides his pursuits, draws down his affections; he who divides his care, delays his advances. We must first set abort the things which are most important. For the Apostles also, that they might not be occupied in the office of distributing alms, ordained ministers for the poor.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Matthaeum</b>: Quid autem magis necessarium paternis exequiis; quid facilius, cum non esset multum temporis dandum? Per hoc docemur quod minime tempus frustra ducere decet, etsi mille cogentia sint; immo praeferre spiritualia cunctis admodum necessariis. Diabolus enim insistit attentius, volens aliquem aditum invenire; et si modicam sumat negligentiam, magnam operatur pusillanimitatem.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But what more necessary than the burial of his father, what more easy, seeing that there would not be much time given to it? We are then hereby taught that it becomes us not to spend even the slightest portion of our time in vain, although we have a thousand things to compel us, nay to prefer spiritual things to even our greatest necessities. For the devil watchfully presses close upon us, wishing to find any opening, and if he causes a slight negligence, he ends in producing a great weakness.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Non ergo paterni funeris sepultura prohibetur: sed necessitudini generis divinae religionis pietas antefertur. Illud consortibus relinquitur, hoc mandatur relictis. Quomodo autem mortui sepelire mortuos possunt, nisi geminam hic intelligas mortem, unam naturae, alteram culpae? Est etiam mors tertia, in qua peccato morimur, Deo vivimus.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; The performance of a father’s burial is not then prohibited, but the observance of religious duty is preferred to the ties of relationship. The one is left to those in like condition, the other is commanded to those who are left. But how can the dead bury the dead? unless you here understand a twofold death, one a natural death, the other the death of sin. There is also a third death, by which we die to sin, live to God.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Matthaeum</b>: Cum ergo dixisset mortuos suos, ostendit hunc non esse mortuum eius; puto enim de numero infidelium fuisse defunctum.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. By thus saying, their dead, he shows that this man’s father was not his dead, for I suppose that the deceased was of the number of the unbelieving.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Aut quia sepulchrum patens est guttur impiorum, memoria eorum abolenda praescribitur quorum simul cum corpore meritum occidit; nec revocatur ab officio patris filius, sed fidelis a perfido communione secernitur; non interdictum est muneris, sed religionis mysterium, communionem nobis cum gentibus mortuis non futuram.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Or because the throat of the ungodly is an open sepulcher, their memory is ordered to be forgotten whose services die together with their bodies. Nor is the son recalled from his duty to his father, but the faithful is separated from the communion of the unbelieving; there is no prohibition of duty, but a mystery of religion, that is, that we should have no fellowship with the dead Gentiles.

          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Vel aliter. Erat enim pater senectute gravatus. Putat autem honestum aliquid agere, dum proponeret observare ei debitam pietatem, secundum illud: honora patrem tuum et matrem tuam. Unde ubi vocatus est ad evangelicum ministerium, dicente domino sequere me, quaerebat inducias quae sufficere possent ad decrepiti patris sustentationem dicens permitte mihi primum ire, et sepelire patrem meum: non quod defunctum patrem sepelire rogaret; neque enim Christus hoc agere volentem impedivisset; sed dixit sepelire, idest sustentare in senectute usque ad mortem. Sed dominus ad eum dixit sine mortuos sepelire mortuos suos: erant enim et alii curatores linea parentelae astricti, sed, ut aestimo, mortui, eo quod nondum Christo crediderant. Hinc percipe quod praeferenda sit pietas qua Deo tenemur, amori parentum; quibus reverentiam exhibemus, quia per eos geniti sumus; sed omnium Deus, cum non essemus, ad esse nos conduxit; parentes autem facti sunt ministri introitus ad esse.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Or else, his father was borne down with years, and he thought he was doing an honorable act in proposing to pay the kind offices which were due to him, according to Exodus, Honor your father and your mother. Hence when calling him to the ministry of the Gospel, our Lord said, Follow me, he sought for a time of respite, which should suffice for the support of his decrepit father, saying, Permit me first to go and bury my father, not that he asked to bury his deceased father, for Christ would not have hindered the wish to do this, but he said, Bury, that is, support in old age even till death. But the Lord said to him, Let the dead bury their dead. For there were other attendants also bound by the same tie of relationship, but as I consider dead, because they had not yet believed Christ. Learn from this, that our duty to God is to be preferred to our love for our parents, to whom we show reverence, because through them have we been born. But the God of all, when as yet we were not, brought us into being, our parents were made the ministers of our introduction.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. Our Lord spoke this to the man to whom He had said, Follow me. But another disciple put himself forward, to whom no one had spoken any thing, saying, I will follow you, O Lord; but let me first go and bid them farewell who are at home, lest perchance they look for me as they are wont.

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Now this promise is worthy of our admiration and full of all praise, but to bid farewell to those who are at home, to get leave from them, shows that he was still somehow divided from the Lord, in that he had not yet resolved to make this venture with his whole heart. For to wish to consult relations who would not agree to his proposal because one somewhat wavering. Wherefore our Lord condemns this, saying, No man, having put his hand to the plough and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God. He puts his hand to the plough who is ambitious to follow, yet looks back again who seeks an excuse for delay in returning home, and consulting with his friends.

          <td><b>Beda</b>: Bene septuaginta duo mittuntur, quia totidem mundi gentibus Evangelium praedicandum erat: ut quomodo duodecim primo, propter duodecim tribus Israel; ita et hi propter exteras gentes destinarentur imbuendas.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Rightly are seventy-two sent, for to so many nations of the world was the Gospel to be preached, that as at first twelve were appointed because of the twelve tribes of Israel, so, these also were ordained as teachers for the instruction of the foreign nations.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de quaest. Evang</b>: Sicut etiam viginti quatuor horis totus orbis peragitur atque lustratur, ita mysterium illustrandi orbis per Evangelium Trinitatis in septuaginta duobus discipulis intimatur: ter enim viginti quatuor septuaginta duo faciunt.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. As also in twenty-four hours the whole world moves round and receives light, so the mystery of enlightening the world by the Gospel of the Trinity, is hinted at in the seventy-two disciples. For three times twenty-four makes seventy-two.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Sicut autem duodecim apostolos formam episcoporum praemonstrare nemo est qui dubitet; sic et hos septuaginta duos figuram presbyterorum, idest secundi ordinis sacerdotum, gessisse sciendum est; tametsi primis Ecclesiae temporibus, ut apostolica Scriptura testis est, utrique presbyteri, utrique vocabantur et episcopi; quorum unum sapientiae maturitatem, aliud industriam curae pastoralis significat.
          <td>Now as no one doubts that the twelve Apostles foreshadowed the order of Bishops, so also we must know that these seventy-two represented the presbytery, (that is, the second order of priests.) Nevertheless, in the earliest times of the Church, as the Apostolical writings bear witness, both were called presbyters, troth also c ailed bishops, the former of these signifying “ripeness of wisdom,” the latter, “diligence in the pastoral care.”
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Huius etiam forma in verbis Moysi figurabatur, qui iubente Deo septuaginta elegit, quibus Deus spiritum infundebat. In numeris etiam scriptum est de filiis Israel, quod venerunt in Helim, quod interpretatur ascensus; et erant ibi duodecim fontes aquarum, et septuaginta palmae. Convolantes enim ad augmentum spirituale reperiemus duodecim fontes, scilicet sacros apostolos, a quibus haurimus salutis scientiam sicut a fontibus salvatoris; et septuaginta palmas, hos scilicet qui nunc destinati sunt a Christo. Est enim palma arbor bonae medullae, bene radicata et fertilis, et semper nascens in aquis, alta simul, et frondes porrigens sursum. Sequitur et misit illos binos.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; An outline of this ordinance also was set forth in the words of Moses, who at the command of God chose out seventy, upon whom God poured out His Spirit. In the book of Numbers also it was written of the children of Israel, that they came to Elim, which is by interpretation “ascent,” and there were there twelve fountains of water, and seventy palm trees. For when we fly to spiritual refreshment, we shall find twelve fountains, namely, the holy Apostles, from whom we imbibe the knowledge of salvation as from the well-springs of the Savior; and seventy palms, that is, those who were now appointed by Christ. For the palm is a tree of sound core, striking deep root and fruitful, always growing by the water side, yet at the same time putting forth its leaves upwards. It follows, And he sent them two and two.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius in Evang</b>: Binos in praedicatione discipulos mittit, quia duo sunt praecepta caritatis, Dei scilicet amor, et proximi; et minus quam inter duos caritas haberi non potest: quatenus in hoc nobis tacitus innuat, quia qui caritatem erga alterum non habet, praedicationis officium suscipere nullatenus debet.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. He sends the disciples to preach two and two, because there are two command; of charity, the love of God, and love of our neighbor; (and charity cannot exist without at least two;) thereby silently suggesting to us, that he who has not love to another, ought not to undertake the office of preaching.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Origenes</b>: Sicut etiam ex duodecim bini et bini numerati fuerunt, ut in eorum catalogo Matthaeus ostendit: quod enim bini famularentur Dei verbo antiquum esse videtur: eduxit enim Deus Israel de Aegypto per manus Moysi et Aaron: Iosue quoque et Caleb concordantes pacaverunt provocatum a duodecim exploratoribus populum; unde dicitur: frater a fratre adiutus ut civitas vallata.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; Likewise also the twelve were reckoned by two and two, as Matthew shows in his enumeration of them. For that two should be joined in service, seems from the word of God to be an ancient custom. For God led Israel out of Egypt by the hands of Moses and Aaron. Joshua and Caleb also, united together, appeased the people who had been provoked by the twelve spies. Hence it is said, A brother assisted by a brother is as a fortified city.

          <td><b>Gregorius in Evang</b>: Bene autem subditur ante faciem suam in omnem civitatem et locum quo erat ipse venturus: praedicatores enim suos dominus sequitur: quia praedicatio praevenit, et tunc ad mentis nostrae habitaculum dominus venit quando verba exhortationis praecurrunt, atque per hoc veritas in mente suscipitur. Hinc praedicatoribus Isaias dicit: parate viam domini, rectas facite semitas Dei nostri.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. It is rightly added, before his face into every city and place, whither he himself would come. For the Lord follows His preachers, since the preaching comes first, and then the Lord enters into the tabernacle of our heart; seeing, that through the words of exhortation going before, truth is received into the mind. Hence Esaias says to the preachers, Prepare you the way of the Lord, make straight a highway for our God.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Designaverat autem dominus discipulos propter multitudinem doctoribus indigentem: sicut enim agri spicati multos messores desiderant, sic qui credituri erant innumerabiles existentes, multis doctoribus indigebant; unde sequitur messis quidem multa.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. The Lord had appointed the disciples for the sake of the multitude, who were in want of teachers. For as our corn fields require many reapers, so the innumerable company of those who are to believe need many teachers, as it follows, The harvest truly is great.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Sed qualiter messem vocat, cum res ad praesens exordium sumant? Nondum iacto aratro aut sulcis productis, de messibus tractat. Poterant enim discipuli vacillare et secum meditari, et dicere: qualiter nos numerus brevis emendare poterimus totum mundum, idiotae sophistas, munitos nudi, dominantes subiecti? Ne igitur consideratione talium turbarentur, vocat Evangelium messem; quasi dicat: parata sunt omnia, mitto vos ad paratam collectionem fructuum; eodem die et serere potestis et metere. Sicut ergo colonus exiens ad messes laetatur, sic etiam vos multo amplius et alacrius necessarium est exire in mundum: nam hoc negotium messis est, agros nobis exhibens praeparatos.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But how does He give the name of harvest to a work only just now at its beginning? the plough not yet put down, nor the furrows turned, He yet speaks of harvests, for His disciples might waver and say, how can we so small a number convert the whole world how can foolish men reform the wise, naked men those that are armed, subjects their rulers? Lest they should be disturbed then by such thoughts, He calls the Gospel a harvest; as if He says, All things are ready, I send you to a gathering of fruits already prepared. You can sow and reap the same day. As then the husbandmen goes out to harvest rejoicing, much more also and with greater cheerfulness must you go out into the world. For this is the true harvest, which shows the fields all prepared for you.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius</b>: Sed non sine gravi moerore loqui possumus quod subditur operarii vero pauci: quia etsi sunt qui bona audiant, desunt qui dicant. Ecce mundus sacerdotibus plenus; sed tamen in messe Dei rarus valde reperitur operator: quia officium quidem sacerdotale suscipimus, sed opus officii non implemus.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. But not without deep sorrow can we add, but the laborers are few. For although there are who would hear good things they are wanting who should spread them. Behold the world is full of priests, but seldom is there found a laborer in God’s harvest, because we undertake indeed the priestly office, but we perform not its works.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Sicut autem messis multa est omnis turba credentium, ita operarii pauci sunt apostoli et imitatores eorum, qui mittuntur ad messem.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Now as the great harvest is this whole multitude of believers, so the few laborers are the Apostles, and their followers who are sent to this harvest.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Sicut autem agri spatiosi messores multos exigunt, sic et multitudo crediturorum in Christum; unde subdit rogate autem dominum messis ut mittat operarios in messem suam. Illud autem attende, quod cum dixisset rogate dominum messis ut mittat operarios in messem suam, ipse postmodum hoc peregit. Ipse igitur est dominus messis, ac per eum et cum eo Deus pater omnibus dominatur.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; As the large fields require many reapers, so also do the multitude of believers in Christ. Hence He adds, Pray you therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth laborers into his harvest. Now mark that when He said, Pray you therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth laborers into the harvest, He afterwards Himself performed it. He then is the Lord of the harvest, and by Him, and together with Him, God the Father rules over all.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Matthaeum</b>: Multiplicavit autem postmodum eos, non addens ad numerum, sed concedens virtutem. Insinuat autem quam magnum donum est operarios mitti in messem divinam, per hoc quod dicit, dominum messis super hoc esse rogandum.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But he afterwards increased them greatly, not by adding to their number, but awarding to them power. He implies that it is a great gift to send laborers into the divine harvest, by His saving that the Lord of the harvest must be prayed to upon this account.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius in Evang</b>: Per hoc etiam inducendi sunt subditi ut pro suis pastoribus rogent, ut digna eis operari valeant, nec ab exhortatione torpeat lingua; saepe enim pro sua nequitia praedicantium restringitur lingua: saepe vero ex subiectorum culpa agitur ut eis qui praesunt, praedicationis sermo subtrahatur.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. Hereby also the people must be induced to pray for their pastors, that they may be able to work what is good for them, and that their tongue grow not lifeless in exhortation. For often for their own wickedness their tongue is tied. But often for the fault of the people it comes to pass that the word of preaching is withdrawn from their rulers.

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Luke next relates, that the seventy disciples obtained for themselves from Christ apostolical learning, lowliness, innocency, justice, and to prefer no worldly things to holy preachings, but to aspire to such fortitude of mind as to be afraid of no terrors, not even death itself.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Now these animals are at variance among themselves, so that the one is devoured by the other, the lambs by the wolves; but the good Shepherd has no fear of wolves for His flock. And therefore the disciples are appointed not to make prey, but to impart grace.

Si quem priores hominem viderint, vocem eius quadam naturae vi feruntur eripere; si autem homo prius eos viderit, exagitari memorantur. Sic haeretici insidiantur ovilibus Christi, fremunt circa caulas nocturno tempore: semper enim perfidis nox est, qui lucem Christi nebulis pravae interpretationis obducunt; stabula tamen Christi intrare non audent; et ideo non sanantur, sicut curatus est ille in stabulo qui incidit in latrones. Explorant pastoris absentiam, quia praesentibus pastoribus oves Christi incusare non possunt; quadam etiam mentis intentione duri ac rigidi nequaquam solent a suo errore deflectere; quos Scripturae verus interpres Christus illudit; ut in vanum suos effundant impetus, et nocere non possint: qui si quem versuta disputationis suae circumscriptione praeveniunt, faciunt obmutescere; mutus est enim qui verbum Dei non eadem qua est gloria confitetur.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Or the heretics are compared to wolves. For wolves are beasts who lay in wait near the sheep folds, and prowl about the shepherds’ cottages. They dare not enter the abodes of men, they pry out sleeping dogs, absent or slothful shepherds; they seize the sheep by the throat, that they may quickly strangle them; ravenous beasts, with bodies so stiff that they cannot easily turn themselves, but are carried along by their own impetus, and so are often deceived. If they are the first to see a man, it is said, they by a certain natural impulse, tear out his voice; but if a man first sees them, they quake with fear. In like manner the heretics lurk about Christ’s sheep folds, howl near the cottages at night time. For night is the time for the treacherous who obscure the light of Christ with the mists of false interpretation. The inns of Christ, however, they dare not enter, and therefore are not healed, as he was as in an inn who fell among thieves. They look out for the shepherds’ absence, for they can not attack the sheep when the shepherds are by. Owing also to the inflexibility of a hard and obstinate mind, they seldom if ever turn from their error, while Christ the true interpreter of Scripture mocks them, so that they went forth their violence in vain, and are not able to hurt; and if they overtake any one by the subtle trickery of their disputations, they make him dumb. For he is dumb who confesses not the word of God with the glory which belongs to it. Beware then lest the heretic deprive you of your voice, and lest you detect him not first. For he is creeping on while his treachery is disguised. But if you have discovered his unholy desires, you can not fear the loss of a holy voice. They attack the throat, they wound the vitals while they seek the soul. If also you hear any one called a priest, and you know his robberies, outwardly he is a sheep, inwardly a wolf, who is longing to gratify his rage with the insatiable cruelty of human murder.

Contra quae omnia considerandum nobis est, quia sicut agni inter lupos mittimur, ut sensum servantes innocentiae, morsum malitiae non habeamus: qui enim locum praedicationis suscipit, mala inferre non debet, sed tolerare; quem et si quando zelus rectitudinis exigit ut erga subiectos saeviat, intus paterna pietate diligat quos foris quasi insequendo castigat: quod tunc rector bene exhibet, cum terrenae cupiditatis oneribus nequaquam mentis colla supponit; unde subditur nolite portare sacculum neque peram.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. For many when they receive the right of rule, are vehement in persecuting their subjects, and manifesting the terrors of their power. And since they have no bowels of mercy, their desire is to seem to be masters, forgetting altogether that they are fathers, changing an occasion for humility, into an exaltation of power. We must on the other hand consider, that as lambs are sent among wolves because they preserve the feeling of innocence, so we should make no malicious attacks. For he who undertakes the office of preacher ought not to bring evils upon others, but to endure them; who although at times an upright zeal demands that he should deal harshly with his subjects, should still inwardly in his heart love with a fatherly feeling those whom outwardly he visits with censure. And that ruler gives a good example of this, who never submits the neck of his soul to the yoke of earthly desire. Hence it is added, Carry neither purse nor scrip.

For the preacher (of the Gospel) ought to have such trust in God, that although he has provided not for the expenses of this present life, he should still be most certainly convinced that these will not fail him; lest while his mind is engaged in His temporal things, he should be less careful for the spiritual things of others.

And He also forbade all care about what is external to the body, by saying, Take neither purse nor scrip. Nor did He allow men to take with them any of those things which were not attached to the body. Hence He adds, Nor shoes. He not only forbade them to take purse and scrip, but He did not allow them to receive any distraction in their work, such as interruption by greetings on their way. Hence He adds, Salute no one by the way. Which had long ago been said by Elisha. As if He said, Proceed straight on to your work without exchanging blessings with others.

          <td><b>GREG</b>. If any one would have these words taken also allegorically, the money shut up in a purse is the hidden wisdom. He then who has the word of wisdom, and neglects to employ it for his neighbor, is like one who keeps his money tied up in his purse. But by the scrip is meant the troubles of the world, by the shoes (made of the skins of dead animals) are signified the examples of dead works. He then who undertakes the office of preacher ought not to bear the burden of business, lest while this presses down his neck he should not rise to the preaching of heavenly things; nor ought he to behold the example of foolish works, lest he think to shield his own works as by dead skins, that is, lest because he observes that others have done these things, he imagine that he also is at liberty to do the same.

But if any one is perplexed why in Egypt we are ordered to eat the lamb with shoes on, but the Apostles are appointed to preach the Gospel without shoes: he must consider, that one in Egypt ought still to beware of the serpent’s bite, for there were many poisonous creatures in Egypt. And he who celebrates the Passover in figure may be exposed to the wound, but the minister of truth fears no poison.

          <td><b>GREG</b>. Now every one who salutes on the way does so from the accident of the journey, not for the sake of wishing health. He then who not from love of a heavenly country, but from seeking reward, preaches salvation to his hearers, does as it were salute on the journey, since accidentally, not from any fixed intention, he desires the salvation of his hearers.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. And hence he who presides in the Church gives it, saying, Peace to all. Now holy men ask for peace, not only that which dwells among men in mutual intercourse, but that which belongs to ourselves.

Si quis autem non sit dignus, non estis delusi, nec verborum vestrorum gratia periit; immo reciprocatur ad vos; et hoc est quod subditur sin autem, ad vos revertetur.
          <td><b>TITUS BOST</b>. But it is said, Peace be to this house, that is, to them that dwell in the house. As if he says, I speak to all, both the greater and the less, yet should not your salutation be addressed to them that are unworthy of it. Hence it is added, And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it. As if he says, You indeed shall utter the word, but the blessing of peace shall be applied wherever I shall deem men worthy of it. But if any one is not worthy, you are not mocked, the grace of your word has not perished, but is returned to you. And this is what is added, But if not, it shall return to you again.

          <td><b>GREG</b>. For the peace which is offered by the mouth of the preacher shall either rest on the house, if there be any one in it predestined to life, who follows the heavenly word which he hears; or if no one be willing indeed to hear, the preacher himself shall not be without fruit, for the peace returns to him, while the Lord gives him the recompense of reward for the labor of his work. But if our peace is received, it is meet that we should obtain earthly supplies from those to whom we offer the rewards of a heavenly country. Hence it follows: And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give. Mark, that He who forbade them to carry purse and scrip, allows them to be an expense to others, and to receive sustenance from preaching.

          <td><b>Gregorius in Evang</b>: Sunt enim iam de mercede operarii ipsa alimenta sustentationis; ut hic merces de labore praedicationis inchoetur quae illic de veritatis visione perficitur.

Merces itaque quae in praesenti recipitur, hoc in nobis debet agere ut ad sequentem mercedem robustius tendatur. Verus ergo quisque praedicator non ideo praedicare debet ut in hoc tempore mercedem accipiat; sed ideo mercedem recipere ut praedicare valeat. Quisque namque ideo praedicat ut hic laudis vel muneris mercedem recipiat, aeterna mercede se privat.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. For now the very food which supports him is part of the wages of the laborer, as in this life the hire commences with the labor of preaching, which in the next is completed with the sight of truth. And here we must consider that two rewards are due to one work of ours, one on the Journey, which supports us in labor, the other in our country, which recompenses us at the resurrection. Therefore the reward which we receive now ought so to work in us, that we the more vigorously strive to gain the succeeding reward. Every true preacher then ought not so to preach, that he may receive a reward at the present time, but so to receive a reward that he may have strength to preach. For whoever so preaches that here he may receive the reward of praise, or riches, deprives himself of an eternal reward.

For if you first heal and then teach, the word will prosper, and men believe that the kingdom of God is come nigh. For they would not be cured unless by the working of some divine power.

          <td><b>Beda</b>: Corozaim, Bethsaida et Capharnaum, Tiberias quoque, quam Ioannes nominat, civitates sunt Galilaeae, sitae in littore laci Genezareth, qui ab Evangelistis mare Galilaeae, vel Tiberiadis appellatur. Plangit ergo dominus has civitates, quae post tanta miracula atque virtutes non poenituerunt, peioresque sunt gentilibus naturale tantum ius dissipantibus: quia post descriptae legis contemptum, filium quoque Dei et gloriam eius spernere non timuerunt; unde sequitur quia si in Tyro et Sidone factae fuissent virtutes quae in vobis factae sunt, olim in Cilicio et cinere sedentes poeniterent. In Cilicio, quod de pilis caprarum contexitur, asperam peccati pungentis memoriam significat; in cinere autem mortis considerationem, per quam in pulverem redigimur, demonstrat. Porro in sessione humilitatem propriae conscientiae significat. Impletum autem videmus hodie dictum salvatoris: quia Corozaim et Bethsaida praesente domino credere noluerunt: Tyrus autem et Sidon et quondam David ac Salomon amici fuere, et post evangelizantibus Christi credidere discipulis.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Chorazin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum, Tiberias also which John mentions, are cities of Galilee situated on the shore of the lake of Gennesaret, which is called by the Evangelists the sea of Galilee or Tiberias. Our Lord thus mourns over these cities which after such great miracles and wonders repented not, and are worse than the Gentiles who break through the law of nature only, seeing that after despising the written law, they feared not to despise also the Son of God and His glory. Hence it follows, For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which have been done in you, they had a great while ago repented sitting in sackcloth and ashes, &amp;c. By sackcloth, which is woven together from the hairs of goats, he signifies a sharp remembrance of previous sin. But by ashes, he hints at the consideration of death, by which we are reduced to dust. Again, by the sitting down, he implies the lowliness of our conscience. Now we have seen in this day the word of the Savior fulfilled, since Chorazin and Bethsaida, though our Lord was as present among them, believed not, and Tyre and Sidon were friendly both to David and Solomon, and afterwards believed in the disciples of Christ who preached the Gospel there.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">

Non solum autem per deplorationem inducit eos ad bonum, sed etiam per terrorem; unde sequitur verumtamen Tyro et Sidoni remissius erit quam vobis in iudicio. Hoc et nos audire debemus: non enim solum illis, sed etiam nobis peius iudicium statuit, nisi receperimus intrantes ad nos hospites, quorum pulverem praecepit excutere. Cum autem plurima signa fecisset dominus in Capharnaum, et eum ipsa incolam habuisset, videbatur super alias civitates exaltata; sed propter incredulitatem cecidit in ruinam; unde sequitur et tu, Capharnaum, usque in caelum exaltata, usque ad Infernum demergeris; ut scilicet iudicium sit proportionabile honori.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Our Lord mourns over these cities for our example, because shedding tears and bitter lamentations over those who are insensible to grief, is no slight antidote, tending both to the correction of the insensible, and to the remedy and consolation of those who mourn over them. Again, He draws them over to what is good, not only by lamenting over them, but also by alarming them. Hence it follows, But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon, &amp;c. This we ought also to listen to. For not upon them alone, but upon us also, He has passed sentence, if we receive not the guests who come to us, since He commanded them to shake off the very dust from their feet. And in another place: Now when our Lord had done many mighty works in Capernaum, and had Himself dwelt there, it seemed to be exalted above the other cities, but through unbelief fell to destruction. Hence it follows, And you, Capernaum, which are exalted to heaven, shall be thrust down to hell; that, in fact, the judgment might be in proportion to the honor.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Duplex autem in hac sententia sensus est. Vel ideo ad Infernum demergeris, quia contra praedicationem meam superbissime restitisti, ut scilicet intelligatur in caelum exaltata per superbiam: vel ideo quia es exaltata usque ad caelum meo hospitio, et meis signis, maioribus plecteris suppliciis, quia his quoque credere noluisti. Et ne quis putaret hanc increpationem vel tantummodo civitatibus vel personis convenire quae dominum in carne videntes spernebant, et non omnibus qui hodie quoque Evangelii verba despiciunt; consequenter adiunxit, dicens qui vos audit, me audit.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; This sentence admits of two meanings: Either for this reason shall you be thrust down into hell, because you proudly resisted My preaching; that in truth she might be understood to have raised herself up to heaven by her pride. Or, because you are exalted to heaven by My dwelling in you, and by My miracles, halt you be beaten with more stripes, since even these you refused to believe. And that no one should suppose that this interpretation applied only either to the cities or the persons who, seeing our Lord in the flesh despised Him, and not to all also who now despise the words of the Gospel, Ho proceeds to add these words, He that hears you, hears me.

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Whereby He teaches, that whatever is said by the holy Apostles must be received, since he who hears them hears Christ, and an inevitable punishment therefore hangs over heretics who neglect the words of the Apostles; for it follows, and he who despises you despises me.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; That is, that every one indeed on hearing or despising the preaching of the Gospel might learn that he is not despising or hearing the mere individual preacher, but our Lord and Savior, nay the Father Himself; for it follows, And he that despises me, despises him that sent me.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; It may also be understood as follows, He who despises you, despises me, that is, he who shows not mercy to one of the least of My brethren, neither shows it to Me.

Videbantur quidem gaudere magis quod facti sunt miraculorum auctores, quam quod facti erant praedicationis ministri. Erat autem melius eos gaudere in illis quos ceperunt, sicut vocatis per ipsum dicit Paulus: gaudium meum et corona mea.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; It was said above that our Lord sent forth His disciples sealed with the grace of the Holy Spirit, and that being made ministers of preaching, they received power over the unclean spirits. But now when they returned, they confess the power of Him who honored them, as it is said, And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject to us, &amp;c. They seemed indeed to rejoice rather that they were made workers of miracles, than that they had become ministers of preaching. But they had better have rejoiced in those whom they had taken, as St. Paul says to them that were called by him, My joy and my crown.

          <td><b>GREG</b>. Now our Lord, in a remarkable manner, in order to put down high thoughts in the hearts of His disciples, Himself related the account of the fall which the teacher of pride suffered; that they might learn by the example of the author of pride, what they would have to dread from the sin of pride. Hence it follows, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.

          <td><b>BASIL</b>; He is called Satan, because he is an enemy to God, (for this the Hebrew word signifies,) but he is called the Devil, because he assists us in doing evil, and is an accuser. His nature is incorporeal, his abode in the air.

          <td><b>Beda</b>: Non autem dicit: modo video, sed: prius videbam, quando corruit. Quod autem ait sicut fulgur, vel praecipitem de supernis ad ima lapsum significat; vel quia deiectus adhuc transfigurat se in Angelum lucis.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; He says not, ‘I see now,’ but referring to past time, I saw, when he fell. But by the words as lightning, He signifies either a fall headlong from the high places to the lowest, or that now cast down, he transforms himself into an angel of light.

          <td><b>TITUS BOST</b>. Now He says that He saw it, as being Judge, for He knew the sufferings of the spirits Or He says, as lightning, because by nature Satan shone as lightning, but became darkness through his affections, since what God made good he changed in himself to evil.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Basilius</b>: Supernae enim virtutes non sunt naturaliter sanctae, sed secundum analogiam divini amoris mensuram sanctificationis sortiuntur. Et sicut ferrum positum in igne non desinit esse ferrum, vehementi tamen flammae unione tam effectu quam aspectu in ignem pertransit; sic et almae virtutes ex participatione eius quod est naturaliter sanctum, insitam habent sanctificationem: neque enim cecidisset Satanas, si natura fuisset insusceptibilis mali.
          <td><b>BASIL</b>; For the heavenly Powers are not naturally holy, but according to the analogy of divine love they receive their measure of sanctification. And as iron placed in the fire does not cease to be iron, though by the violent application of the flame both in effect and appearance, it passes into fire; so also the Powers on high, from their participation in that which is naturally holy, have a holiness implanted in them. For Satan had not fallen, if by nature he had been unsusceptible of evil.

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Or else, I saw Satan as lightning fall from heaven, that is, from the highest power to the lowest impotence. For before the coming of our Savior, he had subdued the world to him, and was worshipped by all men. But when the only-begotten Word of God came down from heaven, he fell as lightning, seeing that he is trodden under foot by those who worship Christ. As it follows, And, behold, I give those you power to tread upon serpents, &amp;c.

          <td><b>TITUS BOST</b>. Serpents indeed at one time under a figure were made to bite the Jews, and kill them because of their unbelief. But there came One who should destroy those serpents; even the Brazen Serpent, the Crucified, so that if any one should look on Him believing, he might be healed from his wounds and saved.

        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Hoc est omne genus immundorum spirituum de obsessis corporibus eiciendi; et quantum ad ipsos subdit et nihil vobis nocebit: quamvis et ad litteram possit accipi: Paulus enim a vipera invasus nihil mali patitur, et Ioannes hausto veneno non laeditur. Hoc autem inter serpentes qui dente et scorpiones qui cauda nocent, distare arbitror, quod serpentes aperte saevientes, scorpiones clanculo insidiantes, vel homines vel Daemones significent. Vel serpentes qui inchoandis virtutibus venena pravae persuasionis obiciunt: scorpiones qui consummatas virtutes ad finem vitiare intendunt.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; That is, I give you the power of casting out every kind of unclean spirit, from the bodies possessed. And as far as regards themselves, He adds, And nothing shall hurt you. Although it might also be taken literally. For Paul when attacked by a viper suffered no injury. John having drunk poison is not harmed by it. But I think there is this difference between serpents who bite with the teeth, and scorpions who sting with the tail, that the serpents signify men or spirits raging openly, scorpions signify them plotting in secret. Or serpents are those which cast the poison of evil persuasion upon virtues just beginning, scorpions which go about to corrupt at last virtues which have been brought to perfection.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Vel serpentes sunt qui visibiliter nocent, veluti fornicationis et homicidii Daemon: qui vero invisibiliter nocent, scorpiones vocantur, sicut in vitiis spiritualibus.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Or serpents are those which visibly hurt, as the evil spirit of adultery and murder. But those are called scorpions which invisibly injure, as in the sins of the spirit.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius Nyssenus</b>: Voluptas etiam serpens dicitur in Scriptura, cuius natura est quod si caput eius muri stricturam attigerit, totum sequens corpus ad se trahit: sic natura necessarium concessit homini domicilium; sed per hanc necessitatem aggrediens voluptas animum ad immoderatum quemdam ornatum pervertit; ad hoc subsequentem avaritiam trahit, quam impudicitia sequitur, idest ultimum membrum, et cauda bestialitatis. Sed quemadmodum non est per caudam serpentem retrahi, sic non est incipiendum ab ultimis ad evellendum voluptates, nisi quis priorem aditum obturet malitiae.
          <td><b>GREG NYSS</b>. For pleasure is called in Scripture a serpent, which by nature is such that if its head has reached a wall so as to press upon it, it drags its whole body after it. So nature has given man the habitation which was necessary for him. But by means of this necessity, pleasure assaults the heart, and perverts it to the indulgence of immoderate ornament; in addition to this it brings in its train covetousness, which is followed by lust, that is, the last member or tail of the beast. But as it is not possible to draw back the serpent by its tail, so to remove pleasure we must not begin with the last, unless one has closed the first entrance to evil.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Athanasius</b> Deludunt autem nunc per Christi virtutem pueri voluptatem, quae quondam seducebat grandaevos; et virgines perseverant conculcantes serpentinae voluptatis fallacias. Sed et quidam ipsum aculeum scorpionis, idest Diaboli, conculcantes, scilicet mortem, non timuerunt interitum; verbi gratia, martyres facti; plerique vero postpositis terrenis, libero gressu conversantur in caelis, principem aeris non timentes.
          <td><b>ATHAN</b>. But now through the power of Christ boys make a mock at pleasure, which formerly led away the aged, and virgins steadfastly trample upon the desires of serpentine pleasure. Some also tread upon the very sting of the scorpion, that is, of the devil, namely death, and fearing not destruction become witnesses of the word. But many giving up earthly things walk with a free step in heaven, dreading not the prince of the air.

          <td><b>Titus</b>: Sed quia laetitia qua eos laetos videbat, inanem gloriam sapiebat: gaudebant enim quod quasi sublimes effecti, terribiles hominibus et Daemonibus erant: ideo dominus subiungit verumtamen in hoc nolite gaudere, quia spiritus subiciuntur vobis.
          <td><b>TITUS BOST</b>. But because the joy with which He saw them rejoice savored of vain-glory, for they rejoiced that they were as it were exalted, and were a terror to men and evil spirits, our Lord therefore adds, Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject to you, &amp;c.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: De subiectione spirituum, cum caro sint, gaudere prohibentur: quia spiritus eicere, sicut et virtutes alias facere, interdum non est eius meriti qui operatur; sed invocatio nominis Christi hoc agit ad condemnationem eorum qui invocant, vel ad utilitatem eorum qui vident et audiunt.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; They are forbidden to rejoice in the subjection of the spirits to God, since they were flesh; for to cast out spirits and to exercise other powers is sometimes not on account of his merit who works, but is wrought through the invocation of Christ’s name to the condemnation of those who mock it, or to the advantage of those who see and hear
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Sed cur, domine, non sinis laetari in honoribus a te collatis, cum scriptum sit: in nomine tuo exultabunt tota die? Sed dominus eos ad maius gaudium erigit; unde subdit gaudete autem quia nomina vestra scripta sunt in caelis.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Why, O Lord, cost not you permit men to rejoice in the honors which are conferred by You, since it is written, In your name shall they rejoice all the day? But the Lord raises them up by greater joys. Hence He adds, But rejoice that your names are written in heaven.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Quasi dicat: non oportet vos de Daemonum humiliatione, sed de vestra sublimatione gaudere. Salubriter autem intelligendum est, quod sive caelestia, sive terrestria quis opera gesserit, per hoc quasi litteris annotatus apud Dei memoriam sit aeternaliter affixus.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; As if he said, It becomes you to rejoice not in the putting down of the evil spirits, but in your own exaltation. But it would be well for us to understand, that whether a man has done heavenly or earthly works, he is thereby, as if marked down by letter, for ever fixed in the memory of God.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. For the names of the saints are written in the book of life not in ink, but in the memory and grace of God. And the devil indeed fell from above; but men being below have their names inscribed above in heaven.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Basilius</b>: Quidam autem sunt qui scribuntur quidem non in vita, sed, secundum Ieremiam, in terra; ut secundum hoc intelligatur duplex quaedam descriptio, horum quidem ad vitam, illorum ad perditionem. Quod autem dicitur: deleantur de libro viventium, intelligitur de his qui digni putabantur in libro Dei conscribi; et secundum hoc fieri dicitur Scripturae mutatio, quando a virtute delabimur in peccatum, vel e contra.
          <td><b>BASIL</b>; There are some who are written indeed not in life, but according to Jeremiah in the earth, that in this way there might be a kind of double enrollment, of the one indeed to life, but of the other to destruction. But since it is said, Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, this is spoken of those who were thought worthy to be written in the book of God. And in this way a name is said to be put down in writing or blotted out, when we turn aside from virtue to sin, or the contrary.

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Now here, say they whose hearts are perverted, the Son gives thanks to the Father as being inferior But what should prevent the Son of the same substance with the Father from praising His own Father, who saves the world by Him? But if you think that because of His giving thanks He shows Himself to be inferior, observe, that He calls Him His Father, and the Lord of heaven and earth.

Nec mireris si patrem filius glorificat: tota enim hypostasis unigeniti, genitoris est gloria: nam quae facta sunt, et caelum et Angeli, gloria sunt creatoris: verum quia haec nimis infime sita sunt respectu dignitatis ipsius, solus filius, cum Deus perfecte sit similis genitori, perfecte glorificat patrem.

For all other things have been produced by Christ from nothing, but He alone was incomprehensibly begotten of His Father, Who therefore of the Only-begotten alone, as a true Son, is by nature the Father. Hence He alone says to His Father, I give thanks to you, O Father, Lord, &amp;c. that is, I glorify you. Marvel not that the Son glorifies the Father. For the whole substance of the Only-begotten is the glory of the Father. For both those things which were created, and the Angels, are the glory of the Creator. But since these are placed too low in respect of His dignity, the Son alone, since He is perfect God like His Father, perfectly glorifies His Father.

For His divine nature has human nature joined to it, yet you would not, because of His clothing Himself with a body, be ignorant that He was God. But what do they answer to this, who wish to make out a substance of evil, but form to themselves another God, other than the true Father of Christ? And they say that he is unbegotten, the creator of evil and prince of iniquity, as well as the maker of the world’s fabric.

Sed ex hoc magis dementia eorum carpitur. Si enim priusquam recepisset vacabat creatura a verbo, qualiter salvabitur illud: omnia in eo consistunt? Ceterum si simul postquam facta est creatura, tota fuit tradita ei, non erat opus tradere; per ipsum namque facta sunt omnia. Non ergo, ut ipsi putant, significatur hic creaturae dominium; immo significativum est hoc verbum factae dispensationis in carne: postquam enim homo peccavit, perturbata sunt omnia; unde verbum caro factum est, ut omnia restauraret. Data sunt ergo ei omnia, non quia potestate careret, sed ut salvator emendet universa; ut sicut per verbum omnia in principio introducta sunt in esse, ita cum verbum caro factum est, in ipso omnia restaurentur.
          <td><b>ATHAN</b>. The followers of Arius, not rightly understanding this, rave against our Lord, saying, If all things were given to him, that is, the dominion of the creatures, there was as a time when He had them not, and so was not of the substance of the Father. For if He had been, there would be no need for Him to receive. But hereby is their madness the rather detected. For if before He had received them, the creature was independent of the Word, how will that verse stand, In him all things consist? But if as soon as the creatures were made, they were all given to Him, where was the need to give, for by him were all things made? The dominion of the creation is not then, as they think, here meant, but the words signify the dispensation made in the flesh. For after that man sinned, all things were confounded; the Word then was made flesh, that He might restore all things. All things therefore were given Him, not because He was wanting in power, but that as Savior He should repair all things; that as by the Word all things at the beginning were brought into being, so when the Word was made flesh, He should restore all things in Himself.

Non valet enim creaturae intentio comprehendere modum divinae substantiae, quae omnem superat intellectum, et decor eius quamlibet considerationem transcendit; sed a seipsa quid sit natura divina cognoscitur. Itaque pater per id quod est, novit filium; et filius per id quod est, novit patrem, non interveniente aliqua differentia quantum ad divinitatis naturam: quod enim sit Deus, credimus; quid autem naturaliter sit incomprehensibile est. Si vero creatus est filius, quomodo solus sciret patrem, aut quomodo a solo patre sciretur? Scire namque naturam divinam impossibile est cuilibet creaturae; scire autem quodcumque eorum quae creata sunt quid sit, non transcendit quemlibet intellectum, quamvis superet nostrum sensum.

            <b>AMBROSE</b>; Or, when you read all things, you acknowledge the Almighty, not the Son lower than the Father; when you read delivered, you confess the Son, to whom by the nature of one substance all things rightly belong, not conferred as a gift by grace.

Hence He adds, And no one knows who the Son is but the Father, &amp;c. For the mind of the creatures is not able to comprehend the manner of the Divine substance, which passes all understanding, and His glory transcends our highest contemplations. By Itself only is known what the Divine nature is. Therefore the Father, by that which He is, knows the Son the Son, by that which He is, knows the Father, no difference intervening as regards the Divine nature. And in another place. For that God is, we believe, but what he is by nature, is incomprehensible. But if the Son was created, how could He alone know the Father, or how could He be known only by the Father. For to know the Divine nature is impossible to any creature, but to know each created thing what it is, does not surpass every understanding, though it is far beyond our senses.

          <td><b>ATHAN</b>. But though our Lord says this, it is plain that the Arians object to Him, saying that the Father is not seen by the Son.

Multi enim Iudaeorum viderunt Christum divina operantem, corporali scilicet intuitu; nec tamen omnibus beatificatio convenit: non enim crediderunt, sed neque viderunt gloriam Dei oculis mentis.

For instance, if any one should say, He has seen good times, that is, he has rejoiced in good times, according to the Psalm, You shall see the good of Jerusalem. For many Jews have seen Christ performing, divine works, that is to say, with their bodily sight, yet all were not fitted to rereceive the blessing, for they believed not; but these saw not His glory with their mental sight. Blessed then are our eyes, since we see by faith the Word who is made man for us, shedding upon us the glory of His Godhead, that He may make us like to Him by sanctification and righteousness.

And since he tempted Him subtly, he receives no other answer than the command given by Moses; for it follows, He said to him, What is written in the law? how read you?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Erat enim ex his qui sibi legisperiti videntur, qui verba legis tenent, vim legis ignorant: et ex ipso legis capitulo docet esse legis ignaros, probans quod in principio statim lex patrem et filium praedicaverit et incarnationis dominicae annuntiaverit sacramentum: sequitur enim ille respondens dixit: diliges dominum Deum tuum ex toto corde tuo et ex tota anima tua et ex omnibus viribus tuis et ex tota mente tua.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; For he was one of those who think themselves skilled in the law, and who keep the letter of the law, while they know nothing of its spirit. From a part of the law itself our Lord proves them to be ignorant of the law, showing that at the very first the law preached the Father and the Son, and announced the sacraments of the Lord’s Incarnation; for it follows, And he answering said, you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and, with all your mind.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Basilius</b>: Quod dicitur tota mente tua, in cetera non recipit sectionem: nam quantamcumque dilectionem in infimis expenderis, hoc tibi necessario a toto deficiet. Sicut enim in vase aliquo pleno liquore, quantum emanat foras, tantum necesse est plenitudini derogari; sic et in anima, inquantum emanaverit ab ipsius dilectione ad illicita, intantum minui necessarium est amorem ad Deum.
          <td><b>BASIL</b>; By saying, with all your mind, he does not admit of any division of love to other things, for whatever love you cast on lower things necessarily takes away from the whole. For as a vessel full of liquid, whatever flows therefrom must so much diminish its fullness; so also the soul, whatever love it has wasted upon things unlawful, has so much lessened its love to God.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius Nyssenus</b>: In tria autem quaedam animae vis discernitur. Haec enim est augmentativa solum et nutritiva, quae etiam in plantis reperitur; alia est quae sensualiter disponitur, quae salvatur in natura irrationalium animalium; perfecta autem vis animae est rationalis, quae in natura humana conspicitur. Dicendo ergo cor, substantiam corporalem significavit, scilicet nutritivam; dicendo vero animam, mediocrem, idest sensitivam; dicendo vero mentem, altiorem naturam, idest intellectivam et considerativam potentiam.
          <td><b>GREG NYSS</b>. Now the soul is divided into three faculties; one merely of growth and vegetation, such as is found in plants; another which relates to the senses, which is preserved in the nature of irrational animals; but the perfect faculty of the soul is that of reason, which is seen in human nature. By saying then the heart, He signified the bodily substance, that is, the vegetative; by the soul the middle, or the sensitive; but by saying the mind, the higher nature, that is, the intellectual or reflective faculty.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Hic igitur intelligendum est, quod oportet nos omnem virtutem animae amori divino subicere, et hoc viriliter, et non remisse; unde additur et ex omnibus viribus tuis.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. We must hereby understand that it becomes us to submit every power of the soul to the divine love, and that resolutely, not slackly. Hence it is added, And with all your strength.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Maximus</b>: Cum hac igitur intentione trinam ad Deum dilectionem lex pertractat, ut avellat nos a trina mundi habitudine, qua respicitur ad possessiones, ad gloriam, et ad voluptates; in quibus etiam tentatus est Christus.
          <td><b>MAXIM</b>. To this end then the law commanded a threefold love to God, that it might pluck us away from the threefold fashion of the world, as touching possessions, glory, and pleasure, wherein also Christ was tempted.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Basilius</b>: Si quis autem quaerit quo pacto divina dilectio poterit obtineri, dicemus, quoniam indocibilis est divina dilectio: nam nec lucis gaudere praesentia, nec vitam amplecti ab alio didicimus, vel amare parentes aut alumnos; et multo magis divinae dilectionis doctrinam. Sed seminalis quaedam ratio nobis insita est intrinsecus, habens causas ut homo Deo adhaereat; quam rationem accipiens doctrina divinorum praeceptorum colere diligenter, cauteque fovere, et ad perfectionem divinae gratiae perducere consuevit: naturaliter enim bonum amamus, amamus etiam proprium et cognatum, necnon et benefactoribus sponte affectionem totam profundimus. Si igitur bonus est Deus, omnia vero bonum desiderant, quod voluntarie perficitur, naturaliter nobis inest; quem etsi per bonitatem minime novissemus, ex hoc tamen quod ab ipso processimus, tenemur ipsum ultra modum amare, tamquam scilicet nobis cognatum. Maior etiam est et benefactor omnibus qui naturaliter diliguntur. Est igitur primum et praecipuum mandatum divinae dilectionis; secundum autem primi completivum, et ab eo completum, quo monemur diligere proximum: unde sequitur et proximum tuum sicut teipsum. Sortimur autem a Deo potentiam ad huius executionem mandati. Quis autem non novit quoniam mansuetum et communicativum animal est homo, non autem solitarium et silvestre? Nihil enim tam proprium est nostrae naturae, sicut ad invicem communicare, et mutuo indigere, et cognatum diligere. Quorum ergo praeveniens dominus nobis tradidit semina, horum consequenter fructus requirit.
          <td><b>BASIL</b>; But if any one ask how the love of God is to be obtained, we are sure that the love of God cannot be taught. For neither did we learn to rejoice in the presence of light, or to embrace life, or to love our parents and children; much less were we taught the love of God, but a certain seminal principle was implanted in us, which has within itself the cause, that man clings to God; which principle the teaching of the divine commands is wont to cultivate diligently, to foster watchfully, and to carry on to the perfection of divine grace. For naturally we love good; we love also what is our own, and akin to us; we likewise of our own accord pour forth all our affections on our benefactors. If then God is good, but all things desire that good, which is wrought voluntarily, He is by nature inherent in us, and although from His goodness we are far from knowing Him, yet from the very fact that we proceeded forth from Him, we are bound to love Him with exceeding, love, as in truth akin to us; He is likewise also a greater benefactor than all whom by nature we love here. And again. The love of God then is the first and chief command, but the second, as filling up the first and filled up by it, bids us to love our neighbor. Hence it follows, And your neighbor as yourself. But we have an instinct given us by God to perform this command, as who does not know that man is a kind and social animal? For nothing belongs so much to our nature as to communicate with one another, and mutually to need and love our relations. Of those things then of which in the first place He gave us the seed, He afterwards requires the fruits.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Tu tamen attende qualiter fere cum eodem excessu postulat utrumque praeceptum; de Deo enim ait toto corde tuo; de proximo sicut teipsum: quod si diligenter observaretur, nec servus esset nec liber, nec victor nec victus, nec dives nec pauper, nec notus unquam esset Diabolus: potius enim paleae ignis sustinerent immissionem, quam fervorem caritatis Diabolus; adeo cuncta superat dilectionis constantia.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Yet observe how, almost to the same extent of obedience he requires the performance of each command. For of God he says, with all your heart. Of our neighbor, as yourself: Which if it were diligently kept, there would be neither slave nor free man, neither conqueror nor conquered, (or rasher, neither prince nor subject,) rich nor poor, nor would the devil be even known, for the chaff would rather stand the touch of fire than the devil the fervor of love; so surpassing all things is the constancy of love.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius Moralium</b>: Cum autem dicatur diliges proximum tuum sicut teipsum, quomodo alteri miserando pius est qui adhuc iniuste vivendo sit impius sibimetipsi?
          <td><b>GREG</b>. But since it is said, You shall love your neighbor as yourself, how is he merciful in taking compassion upon another, who still, by unrighteous living, is unmerciful to himself?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Cum autem legisperitus respondisset quae continebantur in lege, Christus, cui nota sunt omnia, scindit fallaciae eius retia; sequitur enim dixitque illi: recte respondisti; hoc fac, et vives.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; When the lawyer had answered the things contained in the law, Christ, to whom all things were known, cuts to pieces his crafty nets. For it follows, And he said to him, you have answered right: this do, and you shall live.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Origenes</b>: Ex his indubitanter colligitur, quod vita quae praedicatur secundum mundi creatorem Deum et antiquas Scripturas ab eo traditas, vita perpetua est; attestatur enim dominus sumenti ex Deuteronomio quidem illud diliges dominum Deum tuum; ex Levitico vero illud diliges proximum tuum sicut teipsum. Haec autem dicta sunt contra sequaces Valentini, Basilidis et Marcionis. Quid enim aliud voluit nos facere ad quaerendum vitam aeternam, nisi quae continent lex et prophetae?
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; From these words it is undoubtingly gathered, that the life which is preached according to God the Creator of the world, and the Scriptures given by Him, is life everlasting. For the Lord Himself bears testimony to the passage from Deuteronomy, You shall love the Lord your God; and from Leviticus, You shall love your neighbor as yourself: But these things were spoken against the flowers of Valentinus, Basil, and Marcion. For what else did he wish us to do in seeking eternal life, but what is contained in the Law and the Prophets?

Circumveniunt enim eum quodammodo alternatim vitia, a fallacia qua tentando quaesiverat, ad arrogantiam lapsum. In hoc autem quod quaerit quis est meus proximus? Vacuus a dilectione proximi ostenditur, cum non aestimet aliquem sibi proximum esse: et per consequens a dilectione divina, quoniam cum fratrem non diligat quem videt, non potest Deum diligere quem non videt.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; The lawyer, when praised by our Savior for having answered right, breaks forth into pride, thinking that he had no neighbor, as though there was no one to be compared to him in righteousness. Hence it is said, But he willing to justify himself said to Jesus, And who is my neighbor? For somehow first one sin and then another takes him captive. From the cunning with which he sought to tempt Christ, he falls into pride. But here when asking, who is my neighbor, he proves himself to be devoid of love for his neighbor, since he did not consider any one to be his neighbor, and consequently of the love of God; for he who loves not his brother whom he sees, cannot love God whom he does not see.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Now our Savior defines a neighbor not in respect of actions or honor, but of nature; as if He says, Think not that because you are righteous you have no neighbor, for all who partake of the same nature are your neighbors. Be you also their neighbor, not in place, but in affection and solicitude for them. And in addition to this, he brings forward the Samaritan as an example.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. For that man is taken for Adam himself, representing the race of man; Jerusalem, the city of peace, that heavenly country, from the bliss of which he fell. Jericho is interpreted to be the moon, and signifies our mortality, because it rises, increases, wanes, and sets.

          <td><b>PSEUDO-AUG</b>. Or by Jerusalem, which is by interpretation “the sight of peace,” we mean Paradise, for before man sinned he was in sight of peace, that is, in paradise; whatever he saw was peace, and going thence he descended (as if brought low and made wretched by sin) into Jericho, that is, the world, in which all things that are born die as the moon.

          <td><b>BASIL</b>; This interpretation corresponds to the places, if any one will examine them. For Jericho lies in the low parts of Palestine, Jerusalem is seated on an eminence, occupying the crest of a mountain. The man then came from the high parts to the low, to fall into the hands of the robbers who infested the desert. As it follows, And he fell among thieves.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. First, we must needs pity the ill fortune of the man who fell unarmed and helpless among robbers, and who was so rash and unwise as to choose the road in which he could not escape the attack of robbers. For the unarmed can never escape the armed, the heedless the villain, the unwary the malicious. Since malice is ever armed with guile, fenced round with cruelty, fortified with deceit, and ready for fierce attack.

          <td><b>PSEUDO-AUG</b>. For the half dead has his vital function (that is, free will) wounded, in that he is not able to return to the eternal life which he has lost.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or by the Priest and the Levite, two times are represented, namely, of the Law and the Prophets. By the Priest the Law is signified, by which the priesthood and sacrifices were appointed; by the Levites the prophecies of the Prophets, in whose times the law of mankind could not heal, because by the Law came the knowledge not the doing away of sin.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. But He says, passed by, because the Law came and stood till its time foreordained, then, not being able to cure, departed. Mark also that the Law was not given with this previous intention that it should cure man, for man could not from the beginning receive the mystery of Christ. And therefore it is said, And by chance there came a certain priest, which expression we use with respect to those things which happen without forethought.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or it is said, passed by, because the man who came down from Jerusalem to Jericho is believed to have been an Israelite, and the priest who came down, certainly his neighbor by birth, passed him by lying on the ground.

In whom our Lord Jesus Christ would have Himself typified. For Samaritan is interpreted to be keeper and it is said of him, He shall-not slumber nor sleep who keeps Israel; since being raised from the dead he dies no more. Lastly, when it was said to him, You are a Samaritan, and have a devil, He said He had not a devil, for He knew Himself to be the caster out of devils, He did not deny that He was the keeper of the weak.

          <td><b>GREEK EX</b>. Now Christ here fully calls Himself a Samaritan. For in addressing the lawyer who was glorying in the Law, He wished to express that neither Priest nor Levite, nor all they who were conversant with the Law, fulfilled the requirements of the Law, but He came to accomplish the ordinances of the Law.

Ut ergo esset non hoc quod nos, sed prope nos, non est ille peccator ut tu; sed factus est mortalis quod tu; suscipiendo poenam, et non suscipiendo culpam, et culpam delevit et poenam.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. For what so distant, what so far removed, as God from man, the immortal from the mortal, the just from sinners, not in distance of place, but of likeness. Since then He had in Him two good things, righteousness and immortality, and we two evils, that is unrighteousness, and mortality, if He had taken upon Him both our evils He would have been our equal, and with us have had need of a deliverer. That He might be then not what we are, but near us, He was made not a sinner, as you are, but mortal like to you. By taking upon Himself punishment, not taking upon Himself guilt, He destroyed both the punishment and the guilt.

By wine let the corrupt parts be washed, by oil let the healing parts be assuaged; we must then mix gentleness with severity, and we must so combine the two, that those who are put under us be neither exasperated by our excessive harshness, nor be relaxed by too much kindness.

Much more also did the Apostles spend, but those teachers also in their time have spent more who have interpreted both the Old and New Testament, for which they shall receive their reward.

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; After what has gone before, our Lord fitly questions the lawyer; Which of these three think you was neighbor to him who fell among thieves? But he said, He that shows mercy on him. For neither Priest nor Levite became neighbor to the sufferer, but he only who had compassion on him. For vain is the dignity of the Priesthood, and the knowledge of the Law, unless they are confirmed by good works. Hence it follows, And Jesus said to him, Go and do you likewise.

Unde manifestum est, hoc praecepto quo iubemur diligere proximum, etiam sanctos Angelos contineri, a quibus tanta nobis misericordiae impenduntur officia, ex quo et ipse dominus proximum nostrum se dici voluit, significans se opitulatum esse semivivo iacenti in via.

From which it follows, that even he who must in his turn show us this duty, is out neighbor. For the name of neighbor has relation to something else, nor can any one be a neighbor, save to a neighbor; but that no one is excluded to whom the office of mercy is to be denied, is plain to all; as our Lord says, Do good to them that hate you. Hence it is clear, that in this command by which we are bid to love our neighbor, the holy angels are included, by whom such great offices of mercy are bestowed upon us. Therefore our Lord Himself wished also to be called our neighbor, representing Himself to have assisted the half dead man who lay in the way.

Martha igitur dominus pascere disponens et praeparans circa ministerium occupabatur; Maria vero soror eius pasci magis elegit a domino; sequitur enim et huic erat soror nomine Maria, quae etiam sedens secus pedes domini, audiebat verbum illius.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But the Lord, who came to his own, and his own received him not, was received as a guest, for it follows, And a certain woman named Martha received him into her house, &amp;c. as strangers are accustomed to be received. But still a servant received her Lord, the sick her Savior, the creature her Creator. But if any should say, “O blessed are they who have been thought worthy to receive Christ into their houses,” grieve not you, for He says, For inasmuch as you have done it to the least of my brethren, you have done it to me. But taking the form of a servant, He wished therein to be fed by servants, by reason of His condescension, not His condition. He had a body in which He was hungry and thirsty, but when He was hungry in the desert, Angels ministered to Him. In wishing therefore to be led, He came Himself to the feeder. Martha then, setting about and preparing to feed our Lord, was occupied in serving, but Mary her sister chose rather to be fed by the Lord, for it follows, And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus’ feet, and heard his word.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. It is not said of Mary simply that she sat near Jesus, but at His feet, to show her diligence, steadfastness, and zeal, in hearing, and the great reverence which she had for our Lord.

Primo quidem aedificabuntur in doctrinis eorum quos suscipiunt, deinde et recipient caritatis mercedem; unde et hic sequitur Martha autem satagebat circa frequens ministerium.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; By His own example then He teaches His disciples how they ought to behave in the houses of those who receive them, namely, when they come to a house, they should not remain idle, but rather fill the minds of those who receive them with sacred and divine teaching. But let those who make ready the house, go to meet their guests gladly and earnestly, for two reasons. First, indeed, they will be edified by the teaching of those whom they receive; nest also they will receive the reward of charity. And hence it follows here, But Martha was cumbered about much serving, &amp;c.

          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Bene Martha circa corporalem domini necessitatem vel voluntatem ministrabat, quasi mortali; sed qui erat in carne mortali, in principio erat verbum; ecce quod Maria audiebat; verbum caro factum est, ecce cui Martha ministrabat: laborabat ista, vacabat illa; verumtamen Martha laborans multum in illa occupatione et negotio ministrandi interpellavit dominum, et de sorore conquesta est; sequitur enim et ait: domine, non est tibi curae quod soror mea reliquit me solam ministrare? Erat enim Maria intenta dulcedini verbi domini; a Martha convivium domino parabatur, in cuius convivio Maria iam iucundabatur. Cum ergo suaviter audiret verbum dulcissimum, et corde intentissimo pasceretur, interpellato domino a sorore sua, quomodo putamus eam timuisse ne diceret ei dominus: surge, et adiuva sororem tuam? Mira enim suavitate tenebatur; quae profecto maior est mentis quam ventris. Sed causam suam tamquam otiosa iudici maluit committere, nec in respondendo voluit laborare: si enim pararet respondendi sermonem, remitteret audiendi intentionem. Respondit ergo dominus, qui in verbo non laborabat, quia verbum erat; sequitur enim et respondens dixit illi dominus: Martha, Martha, sollicita es, et turbaris erga plurima. Repetitio nominis indicium est dilectionis, aut forte movendae intentionis, ut audiat attentius. Bis vocata audit turbaris erga plurima; idest, circa multa es occupata: vult enim homo occurrere quando ministrat, et aliquando non potest: quaeritur quod deest, paratur quod adest: distenditur animus; nam si Martha sufficeret, adiutorium sororis non posceret: multa sunt, diversa sunt, quia carnalia sunt, temporalia sunt. Praeponitur autem unum multis; non enim a multis unum, sed multa ab uno; unde sequitur porro unum est necessarium. Circa unum se voluit occupari, secundum illud: mihi adhaerere Deo bonum est. Unum sunt pater et filius et spiritus sanctus: ad hoc unum non nos perducit, nisi multi habeamus cor unum.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Martha was as well engaged in ministering to the bodily wants or wishes of our Lord, as of one who was mortal, but He who was clothed in mortal flesh, in the beginning was the Word. Behold then what Mary heard, The Word was made flesh. Behold then Him to whom Martha ministered. The one was laboring, the other at rest. But yet Martha, when much troubled in her occupation and business of serving, interrupted our Lord, and complained of her sister. For it follows, And said, Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? For Mary was absorbed in the sweetness of our Lord’s words; Martha was as preparing a feast for our Lord, in whose feast Mary was now rejoicing. While then she was listening with delight to those sweet words, and was feeding on them with the deepest affection, our Lord was interrupted by her sister. What must we suppose was her alarm, lest the Lord should say to her, “Rise, and help your sister?” Our Lord therefore, who was not at a loss, for He had shown He was the Lord, answered as follows, And Jesus answered and said to her, Martha, Martha. The repetition of the name is a mark of love, or perhaps of drawing the attention, that she should listen more earnestly. When twice called, she hears, You are troubled about many things. that is, you art busied about many things. For man wishes to meet with something when he is serving, and can not; and thus between seeking what is wanting and preparing what is at hand, the mind is distracted. For if Martha had been sufficient of herself, she would not have required the aid of her sister. There are many, there are diverse things, which are carnal, temporal, but one is preferred to many. For one is not from many, but many from one. Hence it follows, But one thing is needful. Mary wished to be occupied about one, according to that, It is good for me to cling close to the Lord. The Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit, are one. To this one he does not bring us, unless we being many have one heart.

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Or else, when certain brethren have received God, they will not be anxious about much service, nor ask for those things which are not in their hands, and are beyond their needs. For every where and in every thing that which is superfluous is burdensome. For it begets weariness in those who are wishing to bestow it, while the guests feel that they are the cause of trouble.

          <td><b>Basilius</b>: Absurdum etiam est cibos ad sustentationem corporis sumere, ac per eos iterum officere corpori, et impedire ipsum erga mandatorum divinorum officium. Si ergo adveniat aliquis pauperum, sumat formam et exemplar modestiae ciborum; nec causa vivere volentium in deliciis mensam propriam praeparemus: uniformis enim est Christiani vita, ad unam intendens intentionem, scilicet ad gloriam Dei; multiformis vero et varia vita eorum qui de foris sunt, pro libito variata. Tu vero cur dum copia ciborum et causa delectationis fratri praeparas mensam, criminaris eum voluptatis, et diffundis in eum gulositatis opprobria, arguens delicias eius in eo quod praeparas? Non commendavit dominus Martham occupatam circa frequens ministerium.
          <td><b>BASIL</b>; It is foolish also to take food for the support of the body, and thereby in return to hurt the body, and to hinder it in the performance of the divine command. If then a poor man come, let him receive a model and example of moderation in food, and let us not prepare our own tables for their sakes, who wish to live luxuriously. For the life of the Christian is uniform, ever tending to one object, namely, the glory of God. But the life of those who are without is manifold and vacillating, changed about at will. And how in truth can you, when you set your table before your brother with profusion of meats, and for the pleasure of feasting sake, accuse him of luxury, and revile him as a glutton, censuring his indulgence in that which you yourself afford him? Our Lord did not commend Martha when busied about much serving.

          <td><b>Augustinus de Verb. Dom</b>: Quid ergo? Putamus reprehensum esse ministerium Marthae, quam cura hospitalitatis occupaverat, quae tanto hospite laetabatur? Hoc si verum est, dimittant homines quod ministrant egentibus: vacent verbo, occupentur circa scientiam salutarem; nihil sit cura eis quis peregrinus in vico sit, quis egeat pane; vacent opera misericordiae, uni instetur scientiae.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. What then? Must we think that blame was cast upon the service of Martha, who was engaged in the cares of hospitality, and rejoiced in having so great a guest? If this be true, let men give up ministering to the needy; in a word, let them be at leisure, intent only upon getting wholesome knowledge, taking no care what stranger is in the village in want of bread; let works of mercy be unheeded, knowledge only be cultivated.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Non ergo dominus hospitalitatem prohibet, sed plurimorum turbationem, scilicet abstractionem et tumultum. Et vide consilium domini; quod prius dominus nihil dixerat Marthae; sed postquam quam illa sororem ab auditu studebat avellere, tunc dominus occasione habita increpavit eam: usque enim adeo honoratur hospitalitas, donec ad necessaria nos attrahit; cum vero incipit ab utilioribus impedire, manifestum est quod honorabilior est divinorum auditus.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Our Lord does not then forbid hospitality, but the troubling about many things, that is to say, hurry and anxiety. And mark the wisdom of our Lord, in that at first He said nothing to Martha, but when she sought to tear away her sister from hearing, then the Lord took occasion to reprove her. For hospitality is ever honored as long as it keeps us to necessary things. But when it begins to hinder us from attending to what is of more importance, then it is plain that the hearing of the divine word is the more honorable.

          <td><b>Augustinus de Verb. Dom</b>: Non ergo dominus opus reprehendit, sed munus distinxit; sequitur enim Maria optimam partem elegit, quae non auferetur ab ea. Non tu malam, sed illa meliorem. Unde meliorem? Quia ab ea non auferetur, a te auferetur aliquando onus necessitatis: non enim cum veneris ad illam patriam, invenies peregrinum quem suscipias hospitio. Sed bono tuo auferetur, ut quod melius est detur: auferetur a te labor, ut requies detur. Tu navigas, illa in portu est: aeterna enim est dulcedo veritatis; in hac tamen vita augetur, in illa perficietur, numquam auferetur.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Our Lord then does not blame the actions, but distinguishes between the duties. For it follows, Mary has chosen that good part, &amp;c. Not yours a bad one, but hers a better. Why a better? because it shall not be taken away from her. From you the necessary burden of business shall one time be taken away. For when you come into that country, you will find no stranger to receive with hospitality. But for your good it shall be taken away, that what is better may be given you. Trouble shall be taken away, that rest may be given. You are yet at sea; she is in port. For the sweetness of truth is eternal, yet in this life it is increased, and in the next it will be made perfect, never to be taken away.

          <td><b>Augustinus de quaest. Evang</b>: Mystice autem quod Martha excepit illum in domum suam, significat Ecclesiam, quae nunc excepit dominum in cor suum. Maria soror eius, quae sedebat ad pedes domini, et audiebat verbum eius, significat eamdem Ecclesiam, sed in futuro saeculo, ubi cessans ab opere ministerioque indigentiae, sola sapientia perfruitur. Quod autem conqueritur quod soror eius eam non adiuvet, occasio datur sententiae domini, qua ostendit istam Ecclesiam sollicitam esse et turbari erga plurima, cum sit unum necessarium, ad quod per ministerii huius merita pervenitur. Mariam vero dicit optimam partem elegisse, quia per hanc ad illam tenditur, et non aufertur.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Now mystically, by Martha’s receiving our Lord into her house is represented the Church which now receives the Lord into her heart. Mary her sister, who sat at Jesus’ feet and heard His word, signifies the same Church, but in a future life, where ceasing from labor, and the ministering to her wants, she shall delight in Wisdom alone. But by her complaining that her sister did not help her, occasion is given for that sentence of our Lord, in which he shows that Church to be anxious and troubled about much service, when there is but one thing needful, which is yet attained through the merits of her service; but He says that Mary has chosen the good part, for through the one the other is reached, which shall not be taken away.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius Moralium</b>: Vel per Mariam, quae verba domini residens audiebat, contemplativa vita exprimitur; per Martham exterioribus obsequiis occupatam, activa vita significatur. Sed Marthae cura non reprehenditur, Mariae vero laudatur: quia magna sunt activae vitae merita, sed contemplativae potiora. Unde nec auferri unquam Mariae pars dicitur: quia activae vitae opera corpore transeunt, contemplativae autem gaudia melius ex fine convalescunt
          <td><b>GREG</b>. Or by Mary who sat and heard our Lord’s words, is signified the contemplative life; by Martha engaged in more outward services, the active life. Now Martha’s care is not blamed, but Mary is praised, for great are the rewards of an active life, but those of a contemplative are far better. Hence Mary’s part it is said will never be taken away from her, for the works of an active life pass away with the body, but the joys of the contemplative life the rather begin to increase from the end.

Say Father as a son, but claim no especial favor to t yourself. Of Christ alone is He the especial Father, of us the common Father. For Christ alone He begot, but us he created.

For He who commanded you to call Him Father, gave you not leave to utter lies. But the highest of e all good things is to glorify God’s name in our lives. Hence He adds, Hallowed be thy name. For who is there so debased, as when He sees the pure life of those who believe, does not glorify the name invoked in such a life.

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Or they who say this seem to wish to have the Savior of all again illuminating the world. But He has commanded us to desire in prayer that truly awful time, in order that men might know that it behoves them to live not in sloth and backwardness, lest that time bring upon them the fiery punishment, but rather honestly and according to His will, that that time may weave crowns for them.

Est enim sanitas animae executio debita voluntatis divinae.
          <td><b>GREG NYSS</b>. For sin since He says that the life of man after the resurrection will be like to that of Angels, it follows, that our life in this world should be so ordered with respect to that which we hope for hereafter, that living in the flesh we may not live according to the flesh. But hereby the true Physician of the souls destroys the nature of the disease, that those who have been seized with sickness, whereby they have departed from the Divine will, may forthwith be released from the disease by being joined to the Divine will. For the health of the soul is the due fulfillment of the will of God.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Enchir</b>: Apud Evangelistam igitur Matthaeum septem petitiones continere videtur dominica oratio; Evangelista vero Lucas in oratione dominica petitiones non septem, sed quinque complexus est, nec ab illo utique discrepavit. Sed quomodo illa septem sint intelligenda, ipse sub brevitate commonuit. Nomen quippe Dei sanctificatur in spiritu; Dei autem regnum in resurrectione futurum est. Ostendens ergo Lucas tertiam petitionem duarum superiorum esse quodammodo repetitionem, magis eam praetermittendo voluit intelligi. Deinde tres alias adiunxit; et primo de pane quotidiano, dicens panem nostrum quotidianum da nobis hodie.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. It seems according to the Evangelist Matthew, that the Lord’s prayer contains seven petitions, but Luke has comprehended it in five. Nor in truth does the one disagree from the other, but the latter has suggested by his brevity how those seven are to be understood. For the name of God is hallowed in the spirit, but the kingdom of God is about to come at the resurrection of the body. Luke then, showing that the third petition is in a manner a repetition of the two former, wished to make it so understood by omitting it. He then added three others. And first, of daily bread, saying, Give us day by day our daily bread.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Verb. Dom</b>: In Graeco dicitur epiusion, hoc est supersubstantialem. Non iste est panis qui vadit in corpus, sed ille panis vitae aeternae, qui animae nostrae substantiam fulcit. Latinus autem hunc quotidianum panem dicit, quem Graeci dicunt advenientem. Si quotidianus ille est panis, cur post annum illum sumas, quemadmodum Graeci in oriente facere consueverunt? Accipe quotidie quod quotidie tibi prosit: sic vive quod quotidie merearis accipere. Mors domini significatur, et remissio peccatorum. Qui vulnus habet, medicinam quaerit; vulnus est, quia sub peccato sumus; medicina est caeleste et venerabile sacramentum. Si quotidie accipis, quotidie tibi est hodie; Christus tibi quotidie resurgit: hodie est enim quando Christus resurgit.
          <td><b>PSEUDO-AUG</b>. In the Greek the word is that is, something added to the substance. It is not that bread which goes into the body, but that bread of everlasting life, which supports the substance of our soul. But the Latins call this “daily” bread, which the Greeks call “coming to.” If it is daily bread, why is it eaten a year old, as is the custom with the Greeks in the east? Take daily what profits you for the day; so live that you may daily be thought worthy to receive. The death of our Lord is signified thereby, and the remission of sins, and cost you not daily partake of that bread of life? He who has a wound seeks to be cured; the wound is that we are under sin, the cure is the heavenly and dreadful Sacrament. If you receive daily, daily does “Today” come to you. Christ is to you Today; Christ rises to thee daily.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Titus</b>: Vel panis animarum divina est virtus afferens futuram vitam perennem, sicut panis ex terra prodiens vitam temporalem conservat. Cum autem quotidianum dixisset, divinum qui advenit et futurus est, significat; quem nobis hodie praestari requirimus, poscentes quoddam eius principium atque gustum, quando spiritus in nobis inhabitans virtutem operatur, quae superat omnem virtutem humanam; puta castitatem, humilitatem, et cetera.
          <td><b>TITUS BOST</b>. Or the bread of souls is the Divine power, bringing the everlasting life which is to come, as the bread which comes out of the earth preserves the temporal life. But by saying “daily,” He signifies the Divine bread which comes and is to come, which we seek to be given to us daily, requiring a certain earnest and taste of it, seeing that the Spirit which dwells in us has wrought a virtue surpassing all human virtues, as chastity, humility, and the rest.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Putant autem forsan aliqui indecens esse, sanctos a Deo quaerere corporalia; et ob hanc causam applicant quod dicitur, ad spiritualem considerationem. Ego autem concedam quod oportet sanctos praecipue satagere ad obtinenda spiritualia dona; illud tamen decet inspicere quod irreprehensibiliter petunt, domino praecipiente, panem communem: ex eo enim quod panem iussit quaerere, idest quotidianum alimentum, videtur quod nihil concedat eos habere, sed magis honestam colere paupertatem: non enim est habentium panem petere, sed oppressorum penuria.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Now perhaps some think it unfit for saints to seek from God bodily goods, and for this reason assign to these words a spiritual sense. But granting that the chief concern of the saints should be to obtain spiritual gifts, still it becomes them to see that they seek without blame, according to our Lord’s command, their common bread. For from the fact that He bids them ask for bread, that is daily food, it seems that He implies that they should possess nothing, but rather practice an honorable poverty. For it is not the part of those who have bread to seek it, but rather of those who are oppressed with want.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Basilius</b>: Quasi dicat: panem quotidianum, qui nostrae substantiae competit ad vitam diurnam, non tibi ipsi commendes; sed ad Deum causa eius refugias, exponens ei necessitatem naturae.
          <td><b>BASIL</b>; As if He said, For your daily bread, namely, that which serves for our daily wants, trust not to yourself, but fly to God for it, making known to Him the necessities of your nature.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Matthaeum</b>: Postulanda ergo sunt divinitus necessaria vitae, non ciborum diversitates et vina odorifera, et cetera quae delectant guttur, onerant autem ventrem, et mentem perturbant; sed panis, qui potest substantiam corporis sustentare; et illum qui nobis hodie tantummodo sufficit, ut de crastino non cogitemus. Unam autem solam petitionem sensibilem quaerimus, ut praesentibus non affigamur.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. We must then require of God the necessities of life; not varieties of meats, and spiced wines, and the other things which please the palate, while they load your stomach and disturb your mind, but bread which is able to support the bodily substance, that is to say, which is sufficient only for the day, that we may take no thought of the morrow. But we make only one petition about things of sense, that the present life may not trouble us.

          <td><b>GREG NYSS</b>. Having taught us to take confidence through good works, He next teaches us to implore the remission of our offenses, for it follows, And forgive us our sins.

Huic autem defectui subvenitur per Dei bonitatem indulgentem humanae fragilitati peccatorum punitionem. Hoc autem iuste fit a iusto Deo, quando nos quasi debitoribus relaxamus, his scilicet qui nobis nocuerunt, et debita non exhibuerunt; unde subditur siquidem et ipsi dimittimus omni debenti nobis.
          <td><b>TITUS BOST</b>. This also was necessarily added, for no one is found without sin, that we should not be hindered from the holy participation on account of man’s guilt. For whereas we are bound to render to Christ all manner of holiness, who makes His Spirit to dwell in us, we are to be blamed if we keep not our temples clean for Him. But this defect is supplied by the goodness of God, remitting to human frailty the severe punishment of sin. And this act is done justly by the just God, when we forgive as it were our debtors, those, namely, who have injured us, and have not restored what was due. Hence it follows, For we also forgive every one that is indebted to us.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Vult enim, ut ita loquar, patientiae quam homines colunt, imitatorem fieri Deum, ut qualem ipsi exhibuerunt conservis bonitatem, talem pari lance recipere petant a Deo, qui iuste recompensat, et novit omnium misereri.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; For He wishes, if I may so speak, to make God the imitator of the patience which men practice, that the kindness which they have shown to their fellow servants, they should in like manner seek to receive in equal balance from God, who recompenses to each man justly, and knows how to have mercy upon all men.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Haec igitur animadvertendo grates agendae sunt debitoribus nostris: fiunt enim nobis, si sapimus, causa indulgentiae maximae; et pauca exhibentes, plurima reperiemus: nam et nos multa debemus et magna debita domino; quorum si minimam partem a nobis vellet exigere, iam perissemus.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Considering then these things, we ought to show mercy to our debtors. For they are to us if we are wise the cause of our greatest pardon; and though we perform only a few things, we shall find many. For we owe many and great debts to the Lord, of which if the least part should be exacted from us, we should soon perish.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Verb. Dom</b>: Debitum autem quid est nisi peccatum? Ergo si non accepisses alieni fenoris pecuniam, non deberes; et ideo peccatum tibi imputatur. Habuisti enim pecuniam, cum qua dives nascereris, ad imaginem et similitudinem factus Dei; sed perdidisti quod habebas; sicut dum arrogantiam desideras vindicare, perdidisti humilitatis pecuniam; accepisti a Diabolo debitum, quod non erat necessarium: cautionem tuam tenebat inimicus; sed eam dominus crucifixit, et suo cruore delevit. Potens est autem dominus, qui abstulit peccatum, et debita nostra donavit, custodire nos adversus Diaboli insidias, qui culpam generare consuevit; unde sequitur et ne nos inducas in tentationem, quam scilicet ferre non possumus. Sed quasi athleta talem vult tentationem, quam ferre possit humana conditio.
          <td><b>PSEUDO-AUG</b>. But what is the debt except sin? If you had not received, you would not owe money to another. And therefore sin is imputed to you. For you had money with which you were born rich, and made after the likeness and image of God, but you have lost what you then had. As when you put on pride you lose the gold of humility, you have receipted the devil’s debt which was not necessary; the enemy held the bond, but the Lord crucified it, and canceled it with His blood. But the Lord is able, who has taken away our sins and forgiven our debts, to guard us against the snares of the devil, who is wont to produce sin in us. Hence it follows, And lead us not into temptation, such as we are not able to bear, but like the wrestler we wish only such temptation as the condition of man can sustain.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Titus</b>: A Diabolo enim non tentari est impossibile; sed ne a Deo relinquamur ad tentationes, hoc deprecamur. Quod autem ex permissione divina contingit, illud Deus quandoque facere dicitur in Scriptura; et secundum hoc, nisi prohibeat tentationis invalescentiam, quae supra nos est, tunc nos in tentationem inducit.
          <td><b>TITUS BOST</b>. For it is impossible not to be tempted by the devil, but we make this prayer that we may not be abandoned to our temptations. Now that which happens by Divine permission, God is sometimes in Scripture said to do. And in this way by hindering not the increase of temptation which is above our strength, he leads us into temptation.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Maximus</b>: Vel mandat dominus ut petamus ne nos inducas in tentationem; idest, non permittas voluptuosarum et spontanearum tentationum nos experientiam pati. Iacobus autem docet, pro veritate certantes non remitti tentationibus involuntariis et causativis laborum, dicens: omne gaudium existimate, fratres mei, cum in tentationes varias incideritis.
          <td><b>MAX</b>. Or, the Lord commands us to pray, Lead us not into temptation, that is, let us not have experience of lustful and self-induced temptations. But James teaches those who contend only for the truth, not to be unnerved by involuntary and troublesome temptations, saying, lily brethren, count it all joy when you fall into divers temptations.

          <td><b>Basilius</b>: Non tamen decet nos orando petere afflictiones corporales; universaliter enim praecepit orare, non subire tentationem; sed postquam aliquis subiit, expedit a domino petere virtutem perferendi, ut consummetur in nobis illud: qui sustinet usque ad finem, salvus erit.
          <td><b>BASIL</b>; It does not however become us to seek by our prayers bodily afflictions. For Christ has universally commanded men every where to pray that they enter not into temptation. But when one has already entered, it is fitting to ask from the Lord the power of enduring, that we may have fulfilled in us those words, He that endures to the end shall be saved.

          <td><b>Augustinus in Enchir</b>: At vero quod Matthaeus in ultimo posuit: sed libera nos a malo, iste non posuit, ut intelligamus ad illud superius, quod de tentatione dictum est, pertinere: ideo quippe ait: sed libera, non ait: et libera; tamquam unam petitionem demonstrans: noli hoc, sed hoc. Sed sciat unusquisque in eo se liberari a malo quod non infertur in tentationem.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But what Matthew has placed at the end, But deliver us from evil, Luke has not mentioned, that we might understand it belongs to the former, which was spoken of temptation. He therefore says, But deliver us, not, “And deliver us,” clearly proving this to be but one petition, “Do not this, but this.” But let every one know that he is therein delivered from evil, when he is not brought into temptation.

For it may be that one has had a friend asking for what he cannot supply him with, and then finds that he has not what he is compelled to give. A friend then comes to you on his journey, that is, in this present life, in which all are traveling on as strangers, and no one remains possessor, but to every man is told, Pass on, O stranger, give place to him that is coming. Or perhaps some friend or yours comes from a bad road, (that is, an evil life,) wearied and not finding the truth, by hearing and receiving which he may become happy. He comes to you as to a Christian, and says, “Give me a reason,” asking perhaps what you from the simplicity of your faith are ignorant of, and not having wherewith to satisfy his hunger, are compelled to seek it in the Lord’s books. For perhaps what he asked is contained in the book, but obscure. You are not permitted to ask Paul himself, or Peter, or any prophet, for all that family is now resting with their Lord, and the ignorance of the world is very great, that is, it is midnight, and your friend who is urgent from hunger presses this, not contented with a simple faith; must he then be abandoned? Go therefore to the Lord Himself with whom the family is sleeping, Knock, and pray; of whom it is added, And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not. He delays to give, wishing that you should the more earnestly desire what is delayed, lest by being given at once it should grow common.

          <td><b>BASIL</b>; For perhaps He delays purposely, to redouble your earnestness and coming to him, and that you may know what the gift of God is, and may anxiously guard what is given.

Well does he call those who by the arms of righteousness have claimed to themselves freedom from passion, showing that the good which by practice we have acquired, had been from the beginning laid up in our nature. For when any one renouncing the flesh, by living in the exercise of a virtuous life, has overcome passion, then he becomes as a child, and is insensible to the passions.

Amicus ad quem venitur media nocte, ut accommodet tres panes, utique ad similitudinem ponitur secundum quam quis rogat Deum in media tribulatione constitutus, ut ei tribuat intelligentiam Trinitatis, qua praesentis vitae consoletur labores. Ipsa enim angustia media nox est, qua cogitur vehementer instare. In tribus autem panibus etiam illud significatur, unius substantiae esse Trinitatem. Amicus autem veniens de via intelligitur hominis appetitus, qui debet rationi servire: serviebat autem consuetudini temporali: quam viam vocat propter omnia transeuntia. Converso autem homine ad Deum, etiam ille appetitus a consuetudine revocatur. Sed si non consoletur interius gaudium de doctrina spirituali, qua creatoris Trinitas praedicatur, magnae angustiae sunt in homine quem premit aerumna mortalis, cum ab his quae foris delectant praecipitur abstinentia, et intus non est refectio de laetitia doctrinae spiritualis: et tamen orando efficitur ut accipiat desiderans intellectum a domino, etiamsi homo desit per quem sapientia praedicetur; sequitur enim et ille si perseveraverit pulsans, dico vobis: et si non dabit illi surgens eo quod amicus eius sit, propter improbitatem tamen eius surget, et dabit illi quotquot habet necessarios. Comparatio est a minori: si enim amicus homo surgit de lecto et dat, non amicitia sed taedio compulsus, quanto magis Deus dat, qui sine taedio largissime donat quod petitur?
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or else, the friend to whom the visit is made at midnight, for the loan of the three loaves, is evidently meant for an allegory, just as a person set in the midst of trouble might ask God that He would give him to understand the Trinity, by which he may console the troubles of this present life. For his distress is the midnight in which he is compelled to be so urgent in his request for the three. Now by the three loaves it is signified, that the Trinity is of one substance. But the friend coming from his journey is understood the desire of man, which ought to obey reason, but was as obedient to the custom of the world, which he calls the way, from all things passing along it. Now when man is converted to God, that desire also is reclaimed from custom. But if not consoled by that inward joy arising from the spiritual doctrine which declares the Trinity of the Creator, he is in great straits who is pressed down by earthly sorrows, seeing that from all outward delights he is commanded to abstain, anti within there is no refreshment from the delight of spiritual doctrine. And yet it is effected by prayer, that he who desires should receive understanding from God, even though there be no one by whom wisdom should be preached. For it follows, And if that man, shall continue, &amp;c. The argument is drawn from the less to the greater. For, if a friend rises from his bed, and gives not from the force of friendship, but from weariness, how much more does God give who without weariness gives most abundantly whatever we ask?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Verb. Dom</b>: Cum autem perveneris ad tres panes, hoc est ad cibum et intelligentiam Trinitatis, habes et unde vivas, et unde pascas. Ne timeas, ne finias: non enim panis ille finietur, sed indigentiam tuam finiet; disce et doce, vive et pasce.

Or, the midnight is the depth of temptations, in which he who has fallen, seeks from God three loaves, the relief of the wants of his body, soul, and spirit; through whom we run into no danger in our temptations. But the friend who comes from his journey is God Himself, who tries by temptations him who has nothing to set before him who is weakened in temptation. But when He says, And the door is shut, we must understand that we ought to be prepared before temptations. But after that we have fallen into them, the gate of preparation is shut, and being found unprepared, unless God keep us, we are ill danger.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. Having laid aside the metaphor, our Lord added an exhortation, and expressly urged us to ask, seek, and knock, until we receive what we are seeking. Hence he says, And I say to you, Ask, and: it shall be given you.

Plura namque sunt quae sensum nostrum impediunt. Sicut ergo aurum perditum quaerimus, sic Deum sollicite perquiramus. Ostendit etiam quod quamvis non aperiat illico ianuam, tamen immorandum est; unde subdit pulsate, et aperietur vobis: quia si quaerens immoraberis, utique recipies; ob hoc reclusum est ostium ut faciat te pulsare: ideo non mox annuit ut exposcas.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Now by asking, He means prayer, but by seeking, zeal and anxiety, as He adds, Seek, and you shall find. For those things which are sought require great care. And this is particularly the case with God. For there are many things which block up our senses. As then we search for lost gold, so let us anxiously seek after God. He shows also, that though He does not forthwith open the gates, we must yet wait. Hence he adds, Knock, and it shall be opened to you; for if you continue seeking, you shall surely receive. For this reason, and as the door shut makes you knock, therefore he did not at once consent that you might entreat.

Vel petere quidem est orare: quaerere vero, per bona opera agere orationi condigna; pulsare autem est orationi immorari, nec desistere.
          <td><b>GREEK EX</b>. Or by the word knock perhaps he means seeking effectually, for one knocks with the hand, but the hand is the sign of a good work. Or these three may be distinguished in another way. For it is the beginning of virtue to ask to know the way of truth. But the second step is to seek how we must go by that way. The third step is when a man has reached the virtue to knock at the door, that he may enter upon the wide field of knowledge. All these things a man acquires by prayer. Or to ask indeed is to pray, but to seek is by good works to do things becoming our prayers. And to knock is to continue in prayer without ceasing.

Sed dicet aliquis: immo cum aliqui rogant pro divina notitia obtinenda et recuperatione virtutum, non obtinent. Cui dicendum, quod non propter se bona petiverunt accipere, sed ut commendentur per ea.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; But some one may seek to know, how it comes that they who pray are not heard? To which we must answer, that whoso sets about seeking in the right way, omitting none of those things which avail to the obtaining of our requests, shall really receive what he has prayed to be given him. But if a man turns away from the object of a right petition, and asks not as it becomes him, he does not ask. And therefore it is, that when he does not receive, as is here promised, there is no falsehood. For so also when a master says, “Whoever will come to me, he shall receive the gift of instruction;” we understand it to imply a person going in real earnest to a master, that he may zealously and diligently devote himself to his teaching. Hence too James says, you ask and receive not, because you ask amiss, namely, for the sake of vain pleasures. But some one will say, Nay, when men ask to obtain divine knowledge, and to recover their virtue they do not obtain? To which we must answer, that they sought not to receive the good things for themselves, but that thereby they might reap praise.

Decet ergo offerre quidem quicquid interest sua; clamare autem ad Deum, ut adiuvet eum. Est autem divinum subsidium implorandum non remisse, nec mente huc illucque vagante: eo quod talis non solum non impetrabit quod petit, sed magis dominum irritabit: nam si aliquis coram principe stans, fixum habet et intrinsecum et extrinsecum oculum, ne forsitan puniatur: quanto magis coram Deo attentum ac tremebundum oportet assistere? Si vero debilitatus a peccato fixe nequis orare, quantumcumque potes te ipsum cohibeas, ut stando coram Deo ad eum dirigas intellectum; et Deus ignoscit, eo quod non ex negligentia, sed ex fragilitate non potes, ut oportet, assistere coram Deo. Si sic ergo teipsum compellis, ne discedas donec accipias. Ideo ergo quandoque petis et non accipis, quia perperam postulasti, vel infideliter, vel leviter, vel non conferentia tibi, vel destitisti. Saepius autem quidam obviant dicentes: quare oramus? An ignorat Deus quibus opus est nobis? Novit quippe, et omnia spiritualia uberius dat nobis et antequam postulemus; sed opera virtutis et regnum caelorum oportet prius optare, optantem vero quaerere, ingerentem per fidem et patientiam quicquid interest sua, in nullo delicto redargutum a propria conscientia.
          <td><b>BASIL</b>; If also any one from indolence surrenders himself to his desires, and betrays himself into the hands of his enemies, God neither assists him nor hears him, because by sin he has alienated himself from God. It becomes then a man to offer whatever belongs to him, but to cry to God to assist him. Now we must ask for the Divine assistance not slackly, nor with a mind wavering to and fro, because such a one will not only not obtain what it seeks, but will the rather provoke God to anger. For if a man standing before a prince has his eye fixed within and without, lest perchance he should be punished, how much more before God ought he to stand watchful and trembling? But if when awakened by sin you are unable to pray steadfastly to the utmost of your power, check yourself, that when you stand before God you may direct your mind to Him. And God pardons you, because not from indifference, but infirmity, you cannot appear in His presence as you ought. If then you thus command yourself, do not depart until you receive. For whenever you ask and receive not, it is because your request was improperly made, either without faith, or lightly, or for things which are not good for you, or because you left off praying. But some frequently make the objection, “Why pray we? Is God then ignorant of what we have need?” He knows undoubtedly, and gives us richly all temporal things even before we ask. But we must first desire good works, and the kingdom of heaven; and then having desired, ask in faith and patience, bringing into our prayers whatever is good for us, convicted of no offense by our own conscience.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; The argument then persuading to frequent prayer, is the hope of obtaining what we pray for. The ground of persuasion was first in the command, afterwards it is contained in that example which He sets forth, adding, If a son shall ask bread of any of you, will he give him a stone? &amp;c.

          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: In quo instruit nos salvator quiddam necessarium: frequenter enim inconsulto, voluptatum impetu, irruimus ad perniciosa desideria. Cum igitur aliquid talium a Deo petimus, nequaquam impetrabimus: ad quod ostendendum utitur patenti exemplo ex his quae penes nos sunt: cum enim filius tuus petit panem, gratanter propinas, quia cibum petit opportunum; quando vero sensus penuria lapidem poscit ut comedat, non affers ei, sed potius prohibes eum a nocivo desiderio: ut sit sensus: quis autem ex vobis patrem petit panem, quem scilicet pater dat, numquid lapidem dabit illi? Scilicet si petierit. Eadem quoque ratio est in serpente et pisce, de quo subdit aut piscem; numquid pro pisce serpentem dabit illi? Et similiter in ovo et scorpione, de quo subdit aut si petierit ovum, numquid porriget illi scorpionem?
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; In these words our Savior gives us a very necessary piece of instruction. For oftentimes we rashly, from the impulse of pleasure, give way to hurtful desires. When we ask any such thing from God, we shall not obtain it. To show this, He brings an obvious example from those things which are before our eyes, in our daily experience. For when your son asks of you bread, you give it him gladly, because he seeks a wholesome food. But when from want of understanding he asks for a stone to eat, you give it him not, but rather hinders him from satisfying his hurtful desire. So that the sense may be, But which of you asking his father for bread, (which the father gives,) will he give him a stone? (that is, if he asked it.) There is the same argument also in the serpent and the fish; of which he adds, Or if he asks a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent? And in like manner in the egg and scorpion, of which he adds, Or if he ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Origenes</b>: Tu tamen attende, si panis quidem est animae cibus in cognitione, sine quo non contingit salvari: puta perspicax ratio vitae debitae: piscis autem est amor disciplinae; puta mundi constitutionem agnoscere, elementorum effectum, et quaecumque consequenter disserit sapientia. Itaque nec vice panis Deus propinat lapidem, quem volebat Diabolus a Christo manducari; nec vice piscis serpentem, quem comedunt Aethiopes, indigni pisces comedere; nec similiter dat vice nutritivi et utilis, non comestibilia et nociva: quod refertur ad scorpionem et ovum.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; Consider then this, if the bread be not indeed the food of the soul in knowledge, without which it can not be saved, as, for example, the well planned rule of a just life. But the fish is the love of instruction, as to know the constitution of the world, and the effects of the elements, and whatever else besides wisdom treats of. Therefore God does not in the place of bread offer a stone, which the devil wished Christ to eat, nor in the place of a fish does He give a serpent, which the Ethiopians eat who are unworthy to eat fishes. Nor generally in the place of what is nourishing does he give what is not eatable and injurious, which relates to the scorpion and egg.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de quaest. Evang</b>: Vel potius intelligitur caritas propter maiorem appetitum et tam necessarium, ut sine illa cetera nihil sint, sicut sine pane mensa est inops: cui contraria est cordis duritia, quam lapidi comparavit. Piscis autem intelligitur fides invisibilium vel propter aquam Baptismi, vel quia de invisibilibus locis capitur. Quod etiam fides huius mundi fluctibus circumiactata non frangitur, recte pisci comparatur; cui contrarium posuit serpentem propter venena fallaciae, quae etiam primo homini male suadendo praeseminavit. In ovo intelligitur spes; ovum enim nondum est fetus perfectus, sed fovendo speratur; cui contrarium posuit scorpionem, cuius aculeus venenatus retro timendus est, sicut contrarium spei est retrospicere, cum spes futurorum in illa quae ante sunt se extendat.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or by the bread is meant charity, because we have a greater desire of it, and it is so necessary, that without it all other things are nothing, as the table without bread is mean. Opposed to which is hardness of heart, which he compared to a stone. But by the fish is signified the belief in invisible things, either from the waters of baptism, or because it is taken out of invisible places which the eye cannot reach. Because also faith, though tossed about by the waves of this world, is not destroyed, it is rightly compared to a fish, in opposition to which he has placed the serpent on account of the poison of deceit, which by evil persuasion had its first seed in the first man. Or, by the egg is understood hope. For the egg is the young not yet formed, but hoped for through cherishing, opposed to which he has placed the scorpion, whose poisoned sting is to be dreaded behind; as the contrary to hope is to look back, since the hope of the future reaches forward to those things which are before.

Apostoli etiam, qui merito electionis bonitatem humani generis excesserant, supernae bonitatis respectu, mali esse dicuntur: quia nihil per semetipsum bonum, nisi deitas sola. Quod vero subditur quanto magis pater vester de caelo dabit spiritum bonum petentibus se? Pro quo Matthaeus posuit: dabit bona petentibus se, ostendit spiritum sanctum plenitudinem donorum Dei: quia omnes utilitates quae ex donorum Dei gratia suscipiuntur, ex isto fonte emanant.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Or, he calls the lovers of the world evil, who give those things which they judge good according to their sense, which are also good in their nature, and are useful to aid imperfect life. Hence he adds, Know how to give good gifts to your children. The Apostles even, who by the merit of their election had exceeded the goodness of mankind in general, are said to be evil in comparison with Divine goodness, since nothing is of itself good but God alone. But that which is added, How much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him, for which Matthew has written, will give good things to them that ask him, shows that the Holy Spirit is the fullness of God’s gifts, since all the advantages which are received from the grace of God’s gifts flow from that source.

          <td><b>GLOSS</b>. The Lord had promised that the Holy Spirit should be given to those that asked for it; the blessed effects whereof He indeed clearly shows in the following miracle. Hence it follows, And Jesus was casting out a devil, and it was dumb.

Si quis tamen ex aliqua passione superveniente auditum amiserit, hunc nihil prohibet loqui. Qui autem domino oblatus fuit, et mutus erat lingua et surdus auditu.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Now he is called as commonly meaning one who does not speak. It is also used for one who does not hear, but more properly who neither hears nor speaks. But he who has not heard from his birth necessarily cannot speak. For we speak those things which we are taught to speak by hearing. If however one has lost his hearing from a disease that has come upon him, there is nothing to hinder him from speaking. But He who was brought before the Lord was both dumb in speech, and deaf in hearing.

Idcirco venit Christus ut eiciat Daemonium, et audiamus verbum veritatis; unum enim sanavit, ut universalem praegustationem faciat humanae salutis; unde sequitur et cum eiecisset Daemonium, locutus est mutus.
          <td><b>TITUS BOST</b>. Now He calls the devil deaf or dumb, as being the cause of this calamity, that the Divine word should not be heard. For the devil, by taking away the quickness of human feeling, blunts the hearing of our soul. Christ therefore comes that He might cast out the devil, and that we might hear the word of truth. For He healed one that He might create a universal foretaste of man’s salvation. Hence it follows, And when he: he had cast out the devil, tile dumb spoke.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Remigius</b>: Daemoniacus autem iste apud Matthaeum non solum mutus, sed et caecus fuisse narratur. Tria igitur signa simul in uno homine perpetrata sunt. Caecus videt, mutus loquitur, possessus a Daemone liberatur quod quotidie completur in conversione credentium, ut, expulso primum Daemone, fidei lumen aspiciant; deinde ad laudes Dei tacentia prius ora laxentur.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; But that demoniac is related by Matthew to have been not only dumb, but blind. Three miracles then were performed at the same time on one man. The blind see, the dumb speaks, and he that was possessed by a devil is set free. The like is daily accomplished in the conversion of believers, so that the devil being first cast out, they see the light, and then those mouths which were before silent are loosened to speak the praises of God.

Beelzebub Deus erat Accaron: nam Beel quidem ipse Baal, zebub autem musca vocatur. Dicit autem Beelzebub, quasi vir muscarum; ex cuius spurcissimo ritu principem Daemoniorum cognominabant.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; But since the multitudes who were thought ignorant always marveled at our Lord’s actions, the Scribes and Pharisees took pains to deny them, or to pervert them by an artful interpretation, as though they were not the work of a Divine power, but of an unclean spirit. Hence it follows, But some of them said, He casts out devils through Beelzebub the prince of the devils. Beelzebub was the God Accaron. For Beel is indeed Baal himself. But Zebub means a fly. Now he is called Beelzebub as the man of flies, from whose most foul practices the chief of the devils was so named.

Quaerere enim prodigia de caelo innuit, quod huiusmodi cogitationibus tunc temporis afficiebantur erga Christum.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; But others by similar darts of envy sought from Him a sign from heaven. As it follows, And others tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven. As if they said, “Although you have cast out a devil from the man, this is no proof however of Divine power. For we have not yet seen any thing like to the miracles of former times. Moses led the people through the midst of the sea, and Joshua his successor stayed the sun in Gibeon. But you have shown us none of these things.” For to seek signs from heaven showed that the speaker was at that time influenced by some feeling of this kind towards Christ.

Si ergo, inquit, ego per Daemonem Daemonia eicio, dissensio inter eos est, et perit virtus eorum; unde subdit si autem et Satanas in seipsum divisus est, quomodo stabit regnum eius, quia dicitis me in Beelzebub eicere Daemonia? Non enim Satanas sibiipsi repugnat, nec suis satellitibus nocet, sed potius statuit regnum suum. Restat ergo quod divina virtute conteram Satanam.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He did not answer them from the Scriptures, since they gave no heed to them, explaining them away falsely; but he answers them from things of every day occurrence. For a house and a city if it be divided is quickly scattered to nothing; and likewise a kingdom, than which nothing is stronger. For the harmony of the inhabitants maintains houses and kingdoms. If then, says He, I cast out devils by means of a devil, there is dissension among them, and their power perishes. Hence He adds, But if Satan be divided against himself, how shall he stand? For Satan resists not himself, nor hurts his soldiers, but rather strengthens his kingdom. It is then by Divine power alone that I crush Satan under my feet.

Quomodo enim potest regnum Iudaeorum esse perpetuum, quando a legis populo Iesus negatur, qui ex lege debetur? Ita ex parte se fides Iudaicae plebis impugnat, impugnando dividitur, dividendo dissolvitur; et ideo regnum Ecclesiae manebit aeternum, quia individua fides corpus est unum.

Those then who possess no hope in Christ, but think that He casts out devils through the chief of the devils, their kingdom, He says, is not everlasting. This also has reference to the Jewish people. For how can the kingdom of the Jews be everlasting, when by the people of the law Jesus is denied, who is promised by the law? Thus in part does the faith of the Jewish people impugn itself; the glory of the wicked is divided, by division is destroyed. And therefore the kingdom of the Church shall remain for ever, because its faith is undivided in one body.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; The kingdom also of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, is not divided, because it is sealed with an eternal stability.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Or else, By the sons of the Jews He means the exorcists of that nation, who cast out devils by the invocation of God. As if He says, If the casting out of devils by your sons is ascribed to God, not to devils, why in My case has not the same work the same cause? Therefore shall they be your judges, not in authority to exercise judgment, but in act, since they assign to God the casting out of devils, you to Beelzebub, the chief of the devils.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. That Luke speaks of the finger of God, where Matthew has said, the Spirit, does not take away from their agreement in sense, but it rather teaches us a lesson, that we may know what meaning to give to the finger of God, whenever we read it in the Scriptures.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. Now the Holy Spirit is called the finger of God, because of the distribution of gifts which are given through Him, to every one his own gift, whether he be of men or angels. For in none of our members is division more apparent than in our fingers.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Vel spiritus sanctus dicitur digitus Dei: filius enim manus et brachium patris dictus est: operatur enim pater cuncta per eum.

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Or the Holy Spirit is called the finger of God for this reason. The Son was said to be the hand and arm of the Father, for the Father works all things by Him. As then the finger is not separate from the hard, but by nature a part of it; so the Holy Spirit is consubstantially united to the Son, and through Him the Son does all things.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Nor would you think in the compacting together of our limbs any division of power to be made, for there can be no division in an undivided thing. And therefore the appellation of finger must be referred to the form of unity, not to the distinction of power.

But at this time our Lord does not hesitate because of His humanity to speak of Himself as inferior to the Holy Spirit, saying, that He cast out devils by Him, as though the human nature was not sufficient for the casting out of devils without the power of the Holy Spirit.

Quod enim hoc exemplum ad Iudaeos spectet, Matthaeus expressit dicens: sic erit et generationi huic pessimae. Quamdiu enim erant in Aegypto viventes ritu Aegyptiorum, inhabitabat in eis spiritus malignus, qui expulsus est ab eis, quando mactaverunt agnum in figura Christi, et liniti sunt eius sanguine, et sic evitaverunt destructorem.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; After what had gone before, our Lord proceeds to show how it was that the Jewish people had sum; to these opinions concerning Christ, saying, When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, &amp;c. For that this example relates to the Jews, Matthew has explained when he says, Even so shall it be also to this wicked generation. For all the time that they were living in Egypt in the practice of the Egyptians, there dwelt in them an evil spirit, which was drawn out of them when they sacrificed the lamb as a type of Christ, and were sprinkled with its blood, and so escaped the destroyer.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Itaque in uno homine totius populi Iudaici comparatio est, a quo per legem spiritus immundus exierat. Sed quia in gentibus, quorum corda prius arida erant, sed postmodum per Baptisma rore spiritus humescebant, propter fidem Christi requiem Diabolus invenire non potuit (immundis enim spiritibus Christus incendium est): ideo regressus est ad plebem Iudaeorum; unde sequitur et non inveniens, dicit: revertar in domum meam unde exivi.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; The comparison then is between one man and the whole Jewish people, from whom through the Law the unclean spirit had been cast out. But because in the Gentiles, whose hearts were first barren, but afterwards arcs in baptism moistened with the dew of the Spirit, the devil could find no rest because of their faith in Christ, (for to the unclean spirits Christ is a flaming fire,) he then returned to the Jewish people. Hence it follows, And finding none, he said, I will return to my house whence I came.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Origenes</b>: Idest ad eos qui sunt ex Israel: quos vidit nihil divinum in se continentes, sed desertos et vacantes habitationi eius; unde sequitur et cum venerit, invenit eam scopis mundatam.

Itaque, ut nobis multiplicatur septiformis spiritus gratia; ita illis immundorum spirituum omnis cumulatur iniuria: universitas enim hoc numero aliquoties comprehenditur.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; For Israel being adorned with a mere outward and superficial beauty, remains inwardly the more polluted in her heart. For she never quenched or allayed her fires in the water of the sacred fountain, and rightly did the unclean spirit return to her, bringing with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself. Hence it follows, And he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there. Seeing that in truth she has sacrilegiously profaned the seven weeks of the Law, (i.e. from Easter to Pentecost,) and the mystery of the eighth day. Therefore as upon us is multiplied the seven-fold gifts of the Spirit, so upon them falls the whole accumulated attack of the unclean spirits. For the number seven is frequently taken to mean the whole.

For then the Jews raged against the Prophets, now they lift up their hands against the Lord of the Prophets; and therefore suffered worse things from Vespasian and Titus than in Egypt and Babylon. Hence it follows, And the last state of that man is worse than the former. Then too they had with them the Providence of God, and the grace of the Holy Spirit; but now they are deprived even of this protection, so that there is now a greater lack of virtue, and their sorrows are more intense, and the tyranny of the evil spirits more terrible.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; This may also be taken to refer to certain heretics or schismatics, or even to a bad Catholic, from whom at the time of his baptism the evil spirit had gone out. And he wanders about in dry places, that is, his crafty device is to try the hearts of the faithful, which have been purged of all unstable and transient knowledge if he can plant in them any where the footsteps of his iniquity. But he says, I will return to my house whence I came out. And here we must beware lest the sin which we supposed extinguished in us, by our neglect overcome us unawares. But he finds his house swept and garnished, that is, purified by the grace of baptism from the stain of sin, yet replenished with no diligence in good works. By the seven evil spirits which he takes to himself, he signifies all the vices. And they are called more wicked, because he will have not only those vices which are opposed to the seven spiritual virtues, but also by his hypocrisy he will pretend to have the virtues themselves.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Let us receive the words which follow, as said not only to them, but also to ourselves, And the last state of that man shall be worse than the first; for if enlightened and released from our former sins we again return to tile same course of wickedness, a heavier punishment will await our latter sins.

          <td><b>Beda</b>: Posset etiam simpliciter intelligi, dominum haec ad distinctionem suorum et Satanae operum adiunxisse, quod scilicet ipse semper polluta mundare, Satanas vero mundata gravioribus sordibus contaminare festinet.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; It may also be simply understood, that our Lord added these words to show the distinction between the works of Satan and His own, that in truth He is ever hastening to cleanse what has been defiled, Satan to defile with still greater pollution what has been cleansed.

Non autem tantummodo eam quae verbum Dei corporaliter generare meruerat, sed et omnes qui idem verbum spiritualiter auditu fidei concipere, et boni operis custodia vel in suo, vel in proximorum corde parere et quasi alere studuerint, asserit esse beatos; sequitur enim at ille dixit: quinimmo beati qui audiunt verbum Dei, et custodiunt illud.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; While the Scribes and Pharisees were tempting our Lord, and uttering blasphemies against Him, a certain woman with great boldness confessed His incarnation, as it follows, And it came to pass, as he spoke these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said to him, Blessed is the womb that bore you, &amp;c. by which she refutes both the calumnies of the rulers present, and the unbelief of future heretics. For as then by blaspheming the works of the Holy Spirit, the Jews denied the true Son of God, so in after times the heretics, by denying that the Ever virgin Mary, by the cooperating power of the Holy Spirit, ministered of the substance of her flesh to the birth of the only-begotten Son, have said, that we ought not to confess Him who was the Son of man to be truly of the same substance with the Father. But if the flesh of the Word of God, who was born according to the flesh, is declared alien to the flesh of His Virgin Mother, what cause is there why the womb which bore Him and the paps which gave Him suck are pronounced blessed? By what reasoning do they suppose Him to be nourished by her milk, from whose seed they deny Him to be conceived? Whereas according to the physicians, from one and the same fountain both streams are proved to flow. But the woman pronounces blessed not only her who was thought worthy to give birth from her body to the Word of God, but those also who have desired by the hearing of faith spiritually to conceive the same Word, and by diligence in good works, either in their own or the hearts of their neighbors, to bring it forth and nourish it; for it follows, But he said, Yes rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. In this answer He sought not to disown His mother, but to show that His birth would have profited her nothing, had she not been really fruitful in works and faith. But if it Met profited Mary nothing that Christ derived His birth from her, without the inward virtue of her heart, much less will it avail us to have a virtuous father, brother, or son, while we ourselves are strangers to virtue.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; That you may know that the people of the Synagogue are treated with dishonor, while the blessedness of the Church is increased.

          <td><b>BASIL</b>; A sign is a thing brought openly to view, containing in itself the manifestation of something hidden, as the sign of Jonas represents the descent to hell, the ascension of Christ, and His resurrection from the dead.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Now as the sign of Jonas is a type of our Lord’s passion, so also is it a testimony of the grievous sins which the Jews have committed. We may remark at once both the mighty voice of warning, and the declaration of mercy. For by the example of the Ninevites both a punishment is denounced, and a remedy promised. Hence even the Jews ought not to despair of pardon, if they will but practice repentance.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Now Jonas after he came forth from the whale’s belly converts the men of Nineveh by his preaching, but when Christ; rose again, the Jewish nation believed not. So there was a sentence already passed upon them, of which there follows a second example, as it is said, The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and condemn them.

But you when you stand by and hear Wisdom herself teaching you invisible and heavenly things, and confirming her words with signs and wonders, are strangers to the word, and senselessly disregard the miracles.”

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Herein also while condemning the Jewish people, He strongly expresses the mystery of the Church, which in the queen of the South, through the desire of obtaining wisdom is gathered together from the uttermost parts of the whole earth, to hear the words of the Peacemaking Solomon; a queen plainly whose kingdom is undivided rising up from different and distant nations into one body.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">

          <td><b>GREG NYSS</b>. Now as she was queen of the Ethiopians’ and in a far distant country, so in the beginning the Church of the Gentiles was in darkness, and far off from the knowledge of God. But when Christ the Prince of peace shone forth, the Jews being still in darkness, thither came the Gentiles, and offered to Christ the frankincense of piety, the gold of divine knowledge, and precious stones, that is, obedience to His commands.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Vel quia Auster laudatur in Scriptura, sicut calidus et vivificans. Anima igitur regnans in Austro, idest in spirituali conversatione, venit audire sapientiam Salomonis regis pacifici domini Dei nostri; idest, in contemplationem erigitur, ad quam nullus perveniet, nisi regnet in bona vita. Ponit autem consequenter exemplum de Ninivitis, dicens viri Ninivitae surgent in iudicio cum generatione hac, et condemnabunt illam.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Or because the South is praised in Scripture as warm and life-giving, therefore the soul reigning in the south, that is, in all spiritual conversation, comes to hear the wisdom of Solomon, the Prince of peace, the Lord our God, (i.e. is raised up to contemplate Him,) to whom no one shall come except he reign in a good life. But He brings next an example from the Ninevites, saying, The men of Nineveh shall rise up in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus super Matthaeum</b> Condemnationis iudicium ex similibus vel dissimilibus fit: ex similibus quidem sicut in parabola de decem virginibus; ex dissimilibus autem, sicut cum Ninivitae condemnant eos qui erant tempore Christi, ut sic fiat condemnatio clarior: nam illi quidem barbari, hi vero Iudaei; hi refecti propheticis documentis, illi numquam acceperant auditum divinum: illuc ivit servus, huc dominus; ille eversionem praedicabat, iste regnum caelorum annuntiat. Notum est ergo cuilibet quod Iudaeos decebat potius credere; accidit autem contrarium; unde subdit quia poenitentiam egerunt in praedicatione Ionae; et ecce plusquam Ionas hic.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. The judgment of condemnation comes from men like or unlike to those who are condemned. From like, for instance, as in the parable of the ten virgins, but from unlike, when the Ninevites condemn those who lived at the time of Christ, that so their condemnation might be the more remarkable. For the Ninevites indeed were barbarians, but these Jews. The one enjoying the prophetic teaching, the other having never received the divine word. To the former came a servant, to the latter the Master, of whom the one foretold destruction, the other preached the kingdom of heaven. To all men then was it known that the Jews ought rather to have believed, but the contrary happened; therefore he adds, For they repented at the preaching of Jonas, and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Secundum mysterium autem, ex duobus constat Ecclesia: ut aut peccare nesciat, quod scilicet pertinet ad Austri reginam; aut peccare desinat, quod scilicet pertinet ad Ninivitas poenitentiam agentes. Poenitentia enim delictum abolet, sapientia cavet.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Now in a mystery, the Church consists of two things, either ignorance of sin, which has reference mainly to the queen of the South, or ceasing to sin, which relates indeed to the repentant Ninevites. For repentance blots out the offense, wisdom guards against it.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Cons. Evang</b>: Hoc autem Lucas narrat eo loco quidem quo Matthaeus, sed aliquanto dispari ordine. Quis autem non videat superfluo quaeri quo illa ordine dominus dixerit; cum et hoc discere debeamus per Evangelistarum excellentissimam auctoritatem, non esse mendacium, si quisque non hoc ordine cuiusquam sermonem digesserit quo ille a quo processit, cum ipsius ordinis nihil intersit ad rem, sive ita sit, sive ita?
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Luke indeed relates this in the same place as Matthew, but in a somewhat different order. But who does not see that it is an idle question, in what order our Lord said those things, seeing that we ought to learn by the most precious authority of the Evangelist, that there is no falsehood. But not every man will repeat another’s words in the same order in which they proceeded from his mouth, seeing that the order itself makes no difference with respect to the fact, whether it be so or not.

He Himself indeed lights the candle, who filled the vessel of our nature with the fire of His divinity; and this candle surely He wished neither to hide from believers, nor to place under a bushel, that is, enclose it in the measure of the law, or confine it within the limits of the single nation of the Jews. But He placed it upon a candlestick, that is, the Church, for He has imprinted on our foreheads the faith of His incarnation, that they who with a true faith wish to enter the Church, might be able to see clearly the light of the truth. Lastly, He bids them remember to cleanse and purify not only their v works, but their thoughts, and the intentions of the heart. For it follows, The light of the body its the eye.

Or else, because the Jews, seeing the miracles, accused them out of the malice of their heart, therefore our Lord tells them, that, receiving the light, that is, their understanding, from God, they were so darkened with envy, as not to recognize His miracles and mercies. But to this end received we our understanding from God, that we should place it upon a candlestick, that others also who are entering in may see the light. The wise man indeed has already entered, but the learner is still walking. As if He said to the Pharisees, You ought to use your understanding to know the miracles and declare them to others, seeing that what you see are the works not of Beelzebub, but the Son of God.

If then your eye be single, your whole body will be full of light, for if we intend rightly in singleness of heart, we accomplish a good work, even though it seem not to be good. And if your eye be evil, your whole body will be full of darkness, because when with a crooked intention even a right thing is done, although it appears to glitter in men’s sight, yet before the bar of the internal judge it is covered with darkness. Hence too it is rightly added, Take heed therefore that the light which is in you be not darkness. For if what we think we do well we cloud by a bad intention, how many are the evils themselves which even when we do them we know to be evil?

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; The Pharisee, while our Lord still continued on speaking, invites Him to his own house. As it is said And while he was speaking, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Consulte Lucas non ait: et cum haec loqueretur; sed cum loqueretur, ut ostendat eum non statim finitis quae proposuerat verbis, sed aliquot interpositis, apud Pharisaeum prandere rogatum.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Luke expressly says, And he spoke these things, to show that He had not quite finished what He had purposed to say, but was somewhat interrupted by the Pharisee asking Him to dine.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Cons. Evang</b>: Ut enim hoc Lucas narraret, digressus est a Matthaeo circa illum locum ubi ambo commemoraverant quod dictum est a domino de signo Ionae, et de regina Austri, et de Ninivitis, et de spiritu immundo: post quem sermonem dicit Matthaeus: adhuc eo loquente ad turbas, ecce mater eius et fratres stabant foris, quaerentes ei loqui. Lucas autem in eo sermone domini, commemoratis etiam quibusdam quae Matthaeus dixisse dominum praetermisit, ab ordine quem cum Matthaeo tenuerat, digreditur.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. For in order to relate this, Luke has made a variation from Matthew, at that place where both had mentioned what out Lord said concerning the sign of Jonah, and the queen of the south, and the unclean spirit; after which discourse Matthew says, While he yet talked to the people, behold his mother and his brethren stood without desiring to speak to him, but Luke having also in that discourse of our Lord related some of our Lord’s sayings which Matthew omitted, now departs from the order which he had hitherto kept with Matthew.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Itaque postquam nuntiatis sibi foris matre et fratribus ait: qui enim fecerit voluntatem domini, hic frater meus, et soror mea, et mater est, datur intelligi, rogatu Pharisaei intrasse convivium.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Accordingly, after that it was told Him that His mother and brethren stood without, and He said, For he that does the will of God, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother, we are given to understand that He by the request of the Pharisee went to the dinner.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Sed ipse Christus, qui eorum Pharisaeorum nequitiam noverat, dispensative condescendit, satagens commonere eos, ad similitudinem optimorum medicorum, qui gravius infirmantibus afferunt remedia suae industriae; unde sequitur et ingressus recubuit. Dedit autem occasionem verbis Christi indocilis Pharisaeus scandalizatus, quia cum opinaretur eum iustum et prophetam, non conformabatur irrationabili eorum consuetudini; unde subditur Pharisaeus autem coepit intra se reputans dicere, quare non baptizatus esset ante prandium.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; For Christ, knowing the wickedness of those Pharisees, Himself purposely condescends to be occupied in admonishing them, after the manner of the best physicians, who bring remedies of their own making to those who are dangerously ill. Hence it follows, And he went in and sat down to meat. But what gave occasion for the words of Christ was, that the ignorant Pharisees were offended, that while men thought Him to be a great man and a prophet, He conformed not to their unreasonable customs. Therefore it is added, But the Pharisee began to think and say within himself, Why had he not first washed before dinner?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Verb. Dom</b>: Omni enim die Pharisaei antequam pranderent, abluebant se aqua; quasi quotidiana lavatio possit cordis esse mundatio. Apud seipsum autem Pharisaeus cogitavit, voce non sonuit: ille tamen audivit qui interiora cernebat; unde sequitur et ait dominus ad illum: nunc vos, Pharisaei, quod de foris est calicis et catini mundatis; quod autem intus est vestrum, plenum est rapina et iniquitate.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. For every day before dinner the Pharisees washed themselves with water, as if a daily washing could be a cleansing of the heart. But the Pharisee thought within himself, yet did not give utterance to a word; nevertheless, He heard who perceived the secrets of the heart. Hence it follows, And the Lord said to him, Now do you Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Poterat autem dominus et aliis uti verbis, commonens Pharisaeum insanum; captat tamen tempus, et ex his quae erant prae manibus contexit documentum. Hora namque mensae et pabuli, sumit pro exemplo calicem et catinum, ostendens quod mundos et lotos decet esse sincere ministrantes Deo non solum a spurcitia corporali, immo ab ea quae latet intrinsecus penes mentem: sicut aliquod vasorum quibus servitur in mensa, bonum est et extrinsecis et intrinsecis carere contagiis.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Now our Lord might also have used other words to admonish the foolish Pharisee, but he seizes the opportunity and framed his reproof from the things that were ready before him. At the hour, namely, of meals He takes for His example the cup and the platter, pointing out that it became the sincere servants of God to be washed and clean, not only from bodily impurity, but also from that which lies concealed within the power of the soul, just as any of the vessels which are used for the table ought to be free from all inward defilement.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Vide autem corpora nostra terrenorum et fragilium expressione significari, quae brevi lapsu praecipitata franguntur, et facile ea quae mens volvit interne, per sensus et gesta corporis prodit, sicut illa quae calix interius continet, foris lucent: unde et in posterioribus non dubium est vocabulo calicis passionem corporis declarari. Cernis igitur quod nos non exteriora huius calicis et catini, sed interiora contaminant; quia dixit quod intus est vestrum, plenum est rapina et iniquitate.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Now mark that our bodies are signified by the mention of earthly and fragile things, which when let fall a short distance are broken to pieces, and those things which the mind meditates within, it easily expresses through the senses and actions of the body, just as those things which the cup contains within make a glitter without. Hence also hereafter, by the word cup doubtless the passion of the body is spoken of. You perceive then, that not the outside of the cup and platter defiles us, but the inner parts. For he said, But your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Sed quomodo non pepercit homini a quo fuerat invitatus? Magis quidem obiurgando pepercit, ut correcto in iudicio parceret. Deinde ostendit nobis quia et Baptisma quod semel adhibetur, per fidem mundat; fides autem intus est, non foris. Fidem autem contemnebant Pharisaei, et quod foris erat lavabant, intus inquinatissimi manebant; quod dominus improbat dicens stulti, nonne qui fecit quod de foris est, etiam id quod intus est fecit?
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But how was it that He spared not the man by whom He was as invited? Yes rather, He spared him by reproof, that when corrected He might spare him in the judgment. Further, He shows us that baptism also which is once given cleanses by faith; but faith is something within, not without. The Pharisees despised faith, and used washings which were without; while within they remained full of pollution. The Lord condemns this, saying, You fools, did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Quasi dicat: qui utramque hominis naturam fecit, utramque mundari desiderat. Hoc est contra Manichaeos qui animam tantum a Deo, carnem vero putant a Diabolo creatam. Hoc etiam est contra illos qui corporalia peccata, fornicationem scilicet, furtum, et cetera talia peccata, quasi gravissima detestantur; spiritualia vero, quae non minus damnat apostolus, ut levia contemnunt.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; As if He says, He who made both natures of man, will have each to be cleansed. This is against the Manicheans, who think the soul only was created by God, but the flesh by the devil. It is also against those who abominate the sins of the flesh, such as fornication, theft, and the like; while those of the Spirit, which are no less condemned by the Apostle, they disregard as trifling.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Dominus autem, quasi bonus praeceptor, docuit quomodo nostri corporis mundare contagium debeamus, dicens verumtamen quod superest date eleemosynam; et ecce omnia munda sunt vobis. Vides quanta remedia. Mundat nos misericordia, mundat nos Dei sermo: iuxta quod scriptum est: iam vos mundi estis propter sermonem quem locutus sum vobis.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Now our Lord as a good Master taught us how we ought to purify our bodies from defilement, saying, But rather give alms of such things as you have over: and behold, all things are clean to you. You see what the remedies are; almsgiving cleanses us, the word of God cleanses us according to that which is written, Now you are clean through the word which I have spoken to you.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de eleemosyna</b> Misericors monet misericordiam fieri: et quia servare quaerit quos magno redemit pretio, post gratiam Baptismi sordidatos, docet denuo posse purgari.
          <td><b>CYPRIAN</b>; The Merciful bids us to show mercy; and because He seeks to save those whom He has redeemed at a great price, He teaches that they who have been defiled after the grace of baptism may again be made clean.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Dicit autem date eleemosynam, non iniustitiam; est enim eleemosyna quae caret iniustitia qualibet: haec omnia facit munda, et ieiunio est praestantior; quod quamvis sit laboriosius, illa tamen est lucrosior. Illustrat animam, impinguat, bonam efficit et decoram. Qui cogitat misereri roganti, citius a peccatis desistet. Sicut enim medicus qui crebro vulneratis medetur, frangitur de facili in aerumnis aliorum; sic et nos si vacaverimus egenorum auxiliis, de facili contemnemus praesentia, et in caelum levabimur. Non parvum est igitur eleemosynae cataplasma, cum valeat omnibus apponi vulneribus.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Now He says, give alms, not injury. For almsgiving is that which is free from all injury. It makes all things clean, and is more excellent than fasting; which though it be the more painful, the other is the more profitable. It enlightens the soul, enriches it, and makes it good and beautiful. He who resolves to have compassion on the needy, will sooner cease from sin. For as the physician who is in the habit of healing the diseased is easily grieved by the misfortunes of others; so we, if we have devoted ourselves to the relief of others, shall easily despise things present, and be raised up to heaven. The unction of almsgiving then is no slight good, since it is capable of being applied to every wound.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Dicit autem quod superest, scilicet necessario victui et vestimento. Neque enim ita facienda iubetur eleemosyna ut teipsum consumas inopia; sed ut tui cura corporis expleta, inopem quantum vales sustentes. Vel ita intelligendum: quod superest, idest quod tam multo scelere praeoccupatis solum remedium restat, date eleemosynam: qui sermo ad omnia quae utili miseratione fiunt, valet: non enim solum qui dat esurienti cibum et cetera huiusmodi, verum etiam qui dat veniam peccanti, atque orat pro eo; et qui corripit, et aliqua emendatoria poena plectit, eleemosynam dat.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; He speaks of “what is over and above” our necessary food and clothing. For you are not commended to give alms so as to consume yourself by want, but that after satisfying your wants, you should supply the poor to the utmost of your power. Or it must be taken in this way. Do that which remains within your power, that is, which is the only remedy remaining to those who have been hitherto engaged in so much wickedness; give alms. Which word applies to every thing which is done with profitable compassion. For not he alone gives alms who gives food to the hungry and things of that kind, but he also who gives pardon to the sinner, and prays for him, and reproves him, visiting him with some correcting punishment.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Vel dicit quod superest: nam facultates praesident cupido cordi.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Or He means, “That which is uppermost.” For wealth rules the covetous man’s heart.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Totus itaque pulcherrimus ab hinc dirigitur locus, ut quoniam nos ad studium simplicitatis invitat, superflua Iudaeorum et terrena condemnet. Et tamen ipsis peccatorum abolitio promittitur, si misericordiam consequantur.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; The whole then of this beautiful discourse is directed to this end, that while it invites us to the study of simplicity, it should condemn the luxury and worldliness of the Jews. And yet even they are promised the abolition of their sins if they will follow mercy.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Verb. Dom</b>: Si autem mundari non possunt nisi credentes in eum qui fide mundat cor, quid est quod dicit date eleemosynam, et ecce omnia munda sunt vobis? Attendamus: forte et ipse exponit. Illi enim de omnibus suis fructibus decimam partem detrahebant, et eleemosynas dabant; quod non facile aliquis facit Christianus. Irriserunt ergo illum eis hoc dicentem, quasi hominibus qui eleemosynas non facerent. Hoc Deus sciens subiungit sed vae vobis Pharisaeis, qui decimatis mentham et rutam et omne olus, et praeteritis iudicium et caritatem Dei. Non ergo est hoc facere eleemosynam; facere enim eleemosynam, est facere misericordiam. Si intelligis, a te incipe: quomodo enim es misericors alteri, si crudelis es tibi? Audi Scripturam dicentem: miserere animae tuae, placens Deo. Redi ad conscientiam tuam quicumque male aut infideliter vivis; et ibi invenis mendicantem animam tuam, vel forte egestate obmutescentem. In iudicio et caritate fac eleemosynam cum anima tua. Quid est iudicium? Displice tibi. Quid est caritas? Dilige Deum, dilige proximum. Hanc eleemosynam si praetermittis, quantumvis ames, nihil facis quando tecum non facis.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But if they cannot be cleansed except they believe on Him who cleanses the heart by faith, what is this which He says, Give alms, and behold all things are clean to you? Let us give heed, and perhaps He Himself explains it to us. For the Jews withdrew a tenth part from all their produce, and gave it in alms, which rarely a Christian does. Therefore they mocked Him, for saying this to them as to men who did not give alms. God knowing this adds, But woe to you Pharisees! for you tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God. This then is not giving alms. For to give alms is to show mercy. If you are wise, begin with yourself: for how are you merciful to another, if cruel to yourself? Hear the Scripture, which says to you, Have mercy on your own soul, and please God. Return to your conscience, you that live in evil or unbelief; and then you find your soul begging, or perhaps struck dumb with want. In judgment and love give alms to your soul. What is judgment? Do what is displeasing to yourself. What is charity? Love God, love your neighbor. If you neglect this alms, love as much you like, you do nothing, since you do it not to yourself.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Vel hoc dicit in Pharisaeorum reprehensionem: quia illa sola praecepta attentius observari iubebant a populis subiectis quae causa erant illis reddituum fecundorum; unde nec minima olerum postponebant, opus autem ingerendae dilectionis ad Deum et iudicii iustam censuram negligebant.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Or He says it by way of censure upon the Pharisees, who ordered those precepts only to be strictly observed by their people, which were the cause of fruitful returns to themselves. Hence they omitted not even the smallest herbs, but despised the work of inspiring love to God, and the just awarding of judgment.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Quia enim Deum contemnebant, indifferenter sacra tractantes, praecipit eis dilectionem Dei habere. Per iudicium vero dilectionem innuit proximi; nam quod aliquis iuste iudicet proximo, ex eius dilectione provenit.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. For because they despised God, treating sacred things with indifference, He commands them to have love to God; but by judgment He implies the love of our neighbor. For when a man judges his neighbor justly, it proceeds from his love to him.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Vel iudicium, ideo quia non omnia quae agunt in iudicium referunt: caritatem, ideo quia non ex affectu diligunt Deum. Sed ne rursus fidei studiosos nos faciat operum negligentes, perfectionem fidelis viri brevi sermone concludit, ut et fide et operibus approbetur, dicens haec autem oportuit facere, et illa non omittere.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Or judgment, because they do not bring to examination every thing that they do; charity, because they love not God with their heart. But that He might not make us zealous of the faith, to the neglect of good works, He sums up the perfection of a good man in a few words, these ought you to have done, and not to leave the other undone.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Matthaeum</b>: Ubi quidem sermo Iudaicae mundationis agebatur, totaliter praeterivit; sed quia decima eleemosyna quaedam est, et nondum erat tempus expresse interimendi legalia, propter hoc dicit haec oportuit facere.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Where indeed the subject treated was the Jewish cleansing, He altogether passed it by, but as the tithe is a kind of almsgiving, and the time was not yet come for absolutely destroying the customs of the law, therefore He says, these ought you to have done.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Arrogantiam quoque iactantium Iudaeorum redarguit, dum primatus appetunt; sequitur enim vae vobis Pharisaeis, qui diligitis primas cathedras in synagogis, et salutationes in foro.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; He reproves also the arrogance of the boasting Jews in seeking the preeminence: for it follows, Woe to you, Pharisees, for you love the uppermost seats in the synagogues, &amp;c.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Per ea quibus illos reprehendit, nos facit meliores: vult etenim nos ambitione carere, et non plus venari apparentiam quam veri existentiam; quod tunc Pharisaei agebant. Salutari enim ab aliquibus, et praesidere eis, non vere nos idoneos esse ostendit; pluribus enim haec contingunt, cum boni non sint; unde subdit vae vobis qui estis ut monumenta quae non apparent. Volentes enim ab hominibus salutari et eis praesidere ut magni aestimentur, ab occultis sepulchris non differunt, quae nitent quidem extrinsecus ornamentis, sunt autem plena omni spurcitia.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; By means of those things for which He blames us He makes us better. For He would have us be free from ambition, and not desire after vain show rather than the reality, which the Pharisees were then doing. For the greetings of men, and the rule over them, do not move us to be really useful, for these things fall to men though they be not good men. Therefore he adds, Woe to you, who are as graves which appear not. For in wishing to receive greetings from men and to exercise authority over them, that they might be accounted great, they differ not from hidden graves, which glitter indeed with outward ornaments, but within are full of all uncleanness.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Et quasi sepulchra quae non apparent, specie fallunt visuque decipiunt transeuntes; unde sequitur et homines ambulantes supra nesciunt; ita scilicet ut cum foris speciosa promittant, plena intus foetoris includant.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; And like graves which appear not, they deceive by their outside beauty, and by their look impose upon the passers by; as it follows, And the men that walk over them are not aware of them; so much that in truth, though they give outward promise of what is beautiful, inwardly they enclose all manner of pollution.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Matthaeum</b>: Sed quod tales extiterint Pharisaei, non est mirabile; si autem nos digni reputati fieri templa Dei, fiamus repente sepulchra solum foetorem continentia, hoc est extremae miseriae.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But that the Pharisees were so, cannot be wondered at. But if we who are counted worthy to be the temples of God suddenly become graves full only of corruption, this is indeed the lowest wretchedness.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Ait autem hic apostata Iulianus, vitanda esse sepulchra, quae Christus ipse ait esse immunda; sed ignoravit vim verborum salvatoris; non enim iussit a monumentis discedere, sed eis comparavit Pharisaeorum fictitium populum.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Now here the apostate Julian says, that we must avoid graves which Christ says are unclean; but he knew not the force of our Savior’s words, for He did not command us to depart from the graves, but likened to them the hypocritical people of the Pharisees.

Exemplo patenti utitur ad eos dirigendum.

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; But Christ brings a severe charge against the Lawyers, and subdues their foolish pride, as it follows, And he said, Woe to you also, you Lawyers, for you lade men, &amp;c. He brings forward an obvious example for their direction. The Law was burdensome to the Jews as the disciples of Christ confess, but these Lawyers binding together legal burdens which could not be borne, placed them upon those under them, taking care themselves to have no toil whatever.

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Having then condemned the burdensome dealing of the Lawyer, He brings a general charge against all the chief men of the Jews, saying, Woe to you who build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; This is a good answer to the foolish superstition of the Jews, who in building the tombs of the prophets condemned the deeds of their fathers, but by rivaling their fathers’ wickedness, throw back the sentence upon themselves. For not the building but the imitation of their deeds is looked upon as a crime. Therefore He adds, Truly you bear witness that you allow, &amp;c.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Simulabant quidem se, ob favorem vulgi captandum, patrum suorum horrere perfidiam, memorias prophetarum qui ab eis occisi sunt, magnifice honorando; sed ipso ore testificantur quantum paternae nequitiae consentiant, iniuriis agendo dominum a prophetis praenuntiatum; unde subditur propterea et sapientia Dei dixit: mittam ad illos prophetas et apostolos, et ex illis occident et persequentur.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; They pretended indeed, in order to win in the favor of the multitude, that they were shocked at the unbelief of their fathers, since by splendidly honoring the memories of the prophets who were slain by them they condemned their deeds. But in their very actions they testify how much they coincide with their fathers’ wickedness, by treating with insult that Lord whom the prophets foretold. Hence it is added, Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall slay and persecute.

Sed nequaquam hos crediderim apostolis in catalogi ordine praeferendos.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; But if the same Wisdom of God sent prophets and Apostles, let heretics cease to assign to Christ a beginning from the Virgin; let them no longer declare one God of the Law and Prophets, another of the New Testament. For although the Apostolic Scripture often calls by the name of prophets not only those who foretell the coming Incarnation of Christ, but those also who foretell the future joys of the kingdom of heaven, yet I should never suppose that these were to be placed before the Apostles in the order of enumeration.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Athanasius</b> Sive autem occidant, mors occisorum altius contra eos clamabit; sive persequantur, memorialia suae iniquitatis emittunt.

          <td><b>ATHAN</b>. Now if they kill, the death of the slain will cry out the louder against them; if they pursue, they send forth memorials of their iniquity, for flight makes the pursuit of the sufferers to redound to the great disgrace of the pursuers. For no one flees from the merciful and gentle, but rather from the cruel and evil-minded man. And therefore it follows, That the blood of all the prophets who have been slain from the foundation of the world may be required of this generation.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Quaeritur quomodo sanguis omnium prophetarum atque iustorum ab una Iudaeorum generatione requiratur, cum multi sanctorum, sive ante incarnationem, sive post, ab aliis nationibus sint interempti. Sed moris est Scripturarum duas saepe generationes hominum, bonorum malorumque computare.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; It is asked, How comes it that the blood of all the prophets and just men is required of the single generation of the Jews; whereas many of the saints, both before the Incarnation and after, have been slain by other nations? But it is the manner of the Scriptures frequently to reckon two generations of men, one of the good, and the other of the evil.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Etsi ergo dicat demonstrative a generatione ista, non exprimit solum tunc astantes et audientes, sed quemlibet homicidam: astruitur enim simili simile.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Although then He says pointedly of this generation, He expresses not merely those who were then standing by Him and listening, but every manslayer. For like is attributed to like.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Matthaeum</b>: Ceterum si dicat, Iudaeos graviora passuros; hoc non immerito fit, eo quod et peiora omnibus ausi sunt, et nullo praeteritorum castigati fuerunt; sed cum vidissent alios peccasse et punitos fuisse, non fuerunt meliores effecti, sed similia commiserunt; non autem ita quod pro commissis aliorum alii luant poenam.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But if He means that the Jews are about to suffer worse things, this will not be undeserved, for they have dared to do worse than all. And they have been corrected by none of their past calamities, but when they saw others sin, and punished, they were not made better, but did likewise; yet it will not be that one shall suffer punishment for the sins of others.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Ostendit autem dominus Iudaeos esse heredes malitiae Cain, ex eo quod subdit a sanguine Abel usque ad sanguinem Zachariae, qui periit inter altare et aedem. Abel siquidem a Cain occisus est; Zachariam autem, quem occiderunt inter altare et aedem, quidam dicunt esse antiquum Zachariam filium Ioiadae sacerdotis.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. But our Lord shows that the Jews have inherited the malice of Cain, since he adds, From the blood of Abel, to the blood of Zacharias, &amp;c. Abel, inasmuch as he was slain by Cain; but Zacharias, whom they slew between the temple and the altar, some say was the Zacharias of old time, the son of Jehoiadah the Priest.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Quare igitur a sanguine Abel, qui primus martyrium passus est, mirum non est; sed quare usque ad sanguinem Zachariae, quaerendum est, cum et multi post eum usque ad nativitatem Christi, et ipso mox nato innocentes perempti sint; nisi forte, quia Abel pastor ovium, Zacharias sacerdos fuit, et hic in campo, ille in atrio templi necatus est, utriusque gradus martyres, et laici scilicet, et altaris officio mancipati, sub eorum intimantur vocabulo.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Why He begins from the blood of Abel, who was the first martyr, we need not wonder; but why, to the blood, of Zacharias, is a question, since many were slain after him even up to our Lord’s birth, and soon after His birth the Innocents, unless perhaps it was because Abel was a shepherd, Zacharias a Priest. And the one was killed in the field, the other in the court of the temple, martyrs of each class, that is, under their names are shadowed both laymen, and those engaged in the office of the altar.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius Nyssenus</b>: Quidam autem dicunt, quod Zacharias pater Ioannis spiritu prophetiae coniciens mysterium virginitatis intactae Dei genitricis, nequaquam sequestravit illam a loco templi virginibus deputato, volens ostendere quod in potestate conditoris omnium erat novum ortum ostendere, qui enixae vigorem caelibatus non auferret. Erat autem hic locus medius inter altare et aedem, in qua erat altare aeneum situm, ubi propter hoc eum occiderunt. Aiunt etiam, quod, cum audirent regem mundi venturum, dispensative metu subiectionis aggrediuntur eum qui attestabatur ortum ipsius, mactantes sacerdotem in templo.
          <td><b>GREG NYSS</b>. But some say that Zacharias, the father of John, by the spirit of prophecy forecasting the mystery of the immaculate virginity of the mother of God, in no wise separated her from the part of the temple set apart for virgins, wishing to show that it was in the power of the Creator of all things to manifest a new birth, while he did not deprive the mother of the glory of her virginity. Now this part was between the altar and the temple, in which was placed the brazen altar, where for this reason they slew him. It is said also, that when they heard the King of the world was about to come, form fear of subjection they designedly attacked him who bore witness to His coming, and slew the priest in the temple.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Graecus</b>: Alii autem aliam causam dicunt esse interitus Zachariae: cum enim occiderentur infantes, magnus Ioannes cum coaetaneis suis occidendus erat; sed Elisabeth eripiens filium de medio caedis, petiit eremum: unde cum satellites Herodis Elisabeth et puerum non invenirent, convertunt iram in Zachariam, occidentes ipsum ministrantem in templo. Sequitur vae vobis legisperitis, qui tulistis clavem scientiae.
          <td><b>GREEK EX</b>. But others give another reason for the destruction of Zacharias. For at the murder of the children the blessed John was to be slain with the rest of the same age, but Elizabeth, snatching up her son from the midst of the slaughter, sought the desert. And so when Herod’s soldiers could not find Elisabeth and the child, they turn their wrath against Zacharias, killing him as he was ministering in the temple. It follows, Woe to you, lawyers, for you have taken away the key of knowledge.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Basilius</b>: Haec vox vae, quae intolerabilibus profertur doloribus, eis convenit qui paulo post detrudendi erunt in grave supplicium.
          <td><b>BASIL</b>; This word woe, which is uttered with pain intolerable, is suited to those who were shortly after to be cast out into grievous punishment
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Clavem autem scientiae ipsam dicimus esse legem: erat enim lex umbra et figura iustitiae Christi. Decebat ergo legisperitos quasi indagantes legem Moysi et dicta prophetarum, reserare quodammodo populo Iudaeorum ianuas notitiae Christi. Hoc autem non fecerunt; sed e contra derogabant divinis miraculis, et contra eius dogmata clamabant: quid eum auditis? Sic igitur tulerunt, idest abstulerunt, clavem scientiae; unde sequitur ipsi non introistis, et eos qui introibant prohibuistis. Sed et fides est clavis scientiae: fit enim per fidem veritatis cognitio, secundum illud: nisi credideritis, non intelligetis. Sustulerunt igitur legisperiti clavem scientiae, non permittentes homines credere in Christum.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Now we say, the law itself is the key of knowledge. For it was both a shadow and a figure of the righteousness of Christ, therefore it became the Lawyers, as instructors of the Law of Moses and the words of the Prophets, to reveal in a certain measure to the Jewish people the knowledge of Christ This they did not, but on the contrary detracted from the divine miracles, and spoke against His teaching, Why hear you him? So then they took away the key of knowledge. Hence it follows, You entered not in yourselves, and them that were entered in you hindered. But faith also is the key of knowledge. For by faith comes also the knowledge of truth according to that of Isaiah, Unless you have believed, you will not understand. The Lawyers then have taken away the key of knowledge, not permitting men to believe in Christ.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Those also are even now condemned under the name of Jews, and made subject to future punishment, who, while usurping to themselves the teaching of divine knowledge, both hinder others, and do not themselves acknowledge that which they profess.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. Now all these things Matthew records to have been said after our Lord had come into Jerusalem. But Luke relates them here, when our Lord was yet on His journey to Jerusalem.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; But how true were the charges of unbelief, hypocrisy, and impiety, brought against the Pharisees and Lawyers they themselves testify, striving not to repent, but to entrap the Teacher of truth; for it follows, And as he said these things to them, the Pharisees and Lawyers began to urge him vehemently.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Sumitur autem insistere pro instare, vel invidere, vel saevire. Coeperunt autem interrumpere sermonem eius in pluribus; unde sequitur et os eius opprimere de multis.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Now this urging is taken to mean pressing upon Him, or threatening Him, or waxing furious against Him. But they began to interrupt His words in many ways, as it follows, And to force him to speak of many things.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Cum enim plures interrogant unum de diversis materiis, cum nequeat simul omnibus respondere, videtur insipientibus quod dubitet. Hoc igitur ingeniabantur et illi nefarii contra ipsum; sed et aliter quaerebant os eius opprimere; scilicet ut provocarent eum ad aliquid dicendum, unde posset damnari; unde sequitur insidiantes ei, et quaerentes aliquid capere de ore eius, ut accusarent eum. Quod primo dixerat opprimere, nunc dicit capere, vel rapere, aliquid ex ore eius. Interrogabant eum nunc quidem de lege, ut arguant eum quasi blasphemum obloquentem de Moyse; nunc vero de Caesare, ut accusent eum tamquam insidiosum et hostem maiestatis Caesareae
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. For when several are questioning a man on different subjects, since he can not reply to all at once, foolish people think he is doubting. This also was part of their wicked design against Him; but they sought also in another way to control His power of speech, namely, by provoking Him to say something by which He might be condemned; whence it follows, Laying in wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him. Having first spoken of “forcing,” Luke now says to catch or seize something from His mouth; at one time indeed they asked Him concerning the Law, that they might convict as a blasphemer Him who accused Moses; but at another time concerning Caesar, that they might accuse Him as a traitor and rebel against the majesty of Caesar.

          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Pharisaei quidem conabantur Iesum capere in sermone, ut populos ab eo abducerent; hoc autem in contrarium vertitur: magis enim adibant populi per millenarios congregati, adeo cupientes haerere Christo ut se invicem comprimerent: tam validum quid est veritas, et dolus imbecillis ubique; unde dicitur multis autem turbis circumstantibus, ita ut se invicem conculcarent, coepit dicere ad discipulos suos: attendite a fermento Pharisaeorum, quod est hypocrisis.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. The Pharisees sought indeed to catch Jesus in His talk, that they might lead away the people from Him. But this design of theirs is reversed. For the people came all the more to Him gathered together by thousands, and so desirous to attach themselves to Christ, that they pressed one upon another. So mighty a thing is truth, so feeble every where deceit. Whence it is said, And when there were gathered together a great multitude, insomuch that they bode upon one another, he began to say to his disciples, Beware you of the leaven of tile Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.

          <td><b>Beda</b>: Nam sicut modicum fermentum totam farinae massam corrumpit, sic simulatio animum tota virtutum sinceritate et veritate fraudabit.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Our Lord has introduced a most forcible argument for preserving simplicity, and being zealous for the faith, that we should not after the manner of faithless Jews put one thing in practice, while in words we pretend another, namely, that at the last day the hidden thoughts accusing or else excusing one another, shall be seen to reveal the secrets of our mind. Whence it is added, There is nothing hid which shall not be revealed.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. As if He says to His disciples, Although now some call you deceivers and wizards, time shall reveal all things and convict them of calumny, while it makes known your virtue. Therefore whatsoever things I have spoken to you in the small corner of Palestine, these boldly and with open brow, casting away all fear, proclaim to the whole world.

Ergo dicit praedicabitur in tectis: idest cunctis audientibus palam dicetur.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Or He says this, because all the things which the Apostles of old spoke and suffered amid the darkness of oppression and the gloom of the prison, are now that the Church is made known through the world and their acts are read, publicly proclaimed. The words, shall be proclaimed on the housetops, are spoken according to the manner of the country of Palestine, where they are accustomed to live on the housetops. For their roofs were not after our way raised to a point, but flat shaped, and level at the top. Therefore He says, proclaimed on the housetops; that is, spoken openly in the hearing of all men.

Hic etiam intelligere potes quod lux sit Evangelium, tecta vero altae apostolorum animae. Quotquot vero consiliati sunt Pharisaei, divulgata sunt postmodum, et audita in Evangelii luce, flante magno praecone spiritu sancto super apostolorum animas.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Or this is addressed to the Pharisees; as if He said, O Pharisees, what you have spoken in darkness, that is, all your endeavors to tempt me in the secrets of your hearts, shall be heard in the light, for I am the light, and in My light shall be known whatsoever your darkness devises. And what you have spoken in the ear and in closets, that is, whatsoever in whispers you have poured into one another’s ears, shall be proclaimed on the housetops, that is, was as audible to me as if it had been cried aloud on the housetops. Herein also you may understand that the light is the Gospel, but the housetop the lofty souls of the Apostles. But whatever things the Pharisees plotted together, were afterwards divulged and heard in the light of the Gospel, the great Herald, the Holy Spirit, presiding over the souls of the Apostles.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Since unbelief springs from two causes, either from a deeply-seated malice or a sudden fear; lest any one from terror should be compelled to deny the God whom he acknowledges in his heart, He well adds, And I say to you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the body, &amp;c.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Non quibuscumque enim simpliciter hic sermo convenire videtur, sed his qui Deum ex tota diligunt mente: quibus convenit dicere: quis nos separabit a caritate Christi? Qui autem non tales sunt, labiles sunt, et ad prosiliendum parati. Porro dominus dicit: maiorem hac dilectionem nemo habet quam ut animam suam ponat quis pro amicis suis. Quomodo autem non est inconvenientissimum Christo non rependere quod ab eo recepimus?
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; For it is not absolutely to every one that this discourse seems to apply, but to those who love God with their whole heart to whom it belongs to say, Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? But they who are not such, are tottering, and ready to fall down. Moreover out Lord says, Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. How then is it not most ungrateful to Christ not to repay Him what we receive?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Mortem etiam docet non esse terribilem, quam locupletiore fenore sit immortalitas redemptura.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; He tells us also, that that death is not terrible for which at a far more costly rate of interest immortality is to be purchased.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; We must then consider that crowns and honors are prepared for the labors of those upon whom men are continually venting forth their indignation, and to them the death of the body is the end of their persecutions. Whence He adds, And after this have nothing more that they can do.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Observe how our Lord makes His disciples superior to all, by exhorting them to despise that very death which is terrible to all. At the same time also he brings them proofs of the immortality of the soul: adding, I will forewarn you whom you shall fear: fear him, which after he has killed has power to cast into hell.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Mors enim naturae finis, non poenae est; et ideo mortem supplicii corporalis esse defectum, poenam vero animae esse perpetuam, Deumque solum esse metuendum, cuius potestati non natura praescribat, sed eadem natura subiaceat, concludit: ita dico vobis, hunc timete.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; For our natural death is not the end of punishment; and therefore He concludes that death is the cessation of bodily punishment, but the punishment of the soul is everlasting. And God alone is to be feared, to whose power nature prescribes not, but is herself subject; adding, Yes, I say to you, Fear him.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Hinc nota, quod peccatoribus quidem mors ad supplicium fertur, et hic cruciatis ipsis per interitum, et consequenter in Gehennam detrusis; sed si sermonem discusseris, quiddam aliud intelliges: non enim dicit: qui mittit in Gehennam; sed qui potestatem habet mittere: non enim quicumque cum peccato moriuntur, semper mittuntur in Gehennam. Hoc autem dico propter oblationes et distributiones quae fiunt pro defunctis, quae non parum conducunt etiam his qui in gravibus peccatis mortui sunt.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Here observe, that upon sinners death is sent as a punishment, since they are here tormented by destruction, and afterwards thrust down into hell. But if you will sift the words you will understand something farther. For He says not, “Who casts into hell,” but has power to cast. For not every one dying in sin is forthwith thrust down into hell, but there is sometimes pardon given for the sake of the offerings and prayers which are made for the dead.

Quasi dicat: si Deus oblivionem passerum non habet, hominum quomodo habere potest?
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Our Lord then had instilled the virtue of simplicity, had awakened a courageous spirit. Their faith alone was wavering, and well did He strengthen it by adding with respect to things of less value, Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings? and not one of them is forgotten before God. As if He said, If God forgets not the sparrows, how can He man?

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; But perhaps some one will say, How is it that the Apostle says, Does the Lord care for oxen? whereas an ox is of more value than a sparrow; but to care for is one thing, to have knowledge another.

Dicitur autem Deus aliquorum immemor fieri propter eorum facinora.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; Literally, hereby is signified the quickness of the Divine foresight, which reaches even to the least things. But mystically, the five sparrows justly represent the spiritual senses, which have perception of high and heavenly things: beholding God, hearing the Divine voice, tasting of the bread of life, smelling the perfume of Christ’s anointing, handling the Word of Life. And these being sold for two farthings, that is, being lightly esteemed by those who count as perishing whatever is of the Spirit, are not forgotten before God. But God is said to be forgetful of some because of their iniquities.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Vel hi quinque sensus duobus assibus venduntur, novo scilicet et veteri testamento: et ideo non dantur oblivioni a Deo: quorum enim sensus traduntur verbo vitae, ut sint apti ad spirituale pabulum, horum semper memor est dominus.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Or these five senses are sold for two farthings, that is, the New and Old Testament, and are therefore not forgotten by God. Of those whose senses are given up to the word of life that they may be fit for the spiritual food, the Lord is ever mindful.

Quinque igitur corporis sensus si terrenarum sordium cibum quaerant, ad superiorum operum fructus revolare non possunt. Est ergo malus passer qui volandi usum terrenae vitio labis aboleverit, quales sunt isti passeres, qui dipondio veneunt, luxuriae scilicet pretio saecularis: adversarius enim tamquam captiva mancipia vilioris pretio aestimationis addicit; at dominus tamquam speciosa servitia, quae ad imaginem sui fecit, idoneos sui operis aestimat et magno pretio nos redemit.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Or else; A good sparrow is one which nature has furnished with the power of flying; for nature has given us the grace of flying, pleasure has taken it away, which loads with meats the soul of the wicked, and molds it towards the nature of a fleshly mass. The five senses of the body then, if they seek the food of earthly alloy, cannot fly back to the fruits of higher actions. A bad sparrow therefore is one which has lost its habit of flying through the fault of earthly groveling; such are those sparrows which are sold for two farthings, namely, at the price of worldly luxury. For the enemy sets up his, as it were, captive slaves, at the very lowest price. But the Lord, being the fit judge of His own work, has redeemed at a great price us, His noble servants, whom He has made in His own image.

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; It is His care then diligently to know the life of the saints. Whence it follows, But the hairs of your heads are all numbered; by which He means, that of all things which relate to them He has most accurate knowledge, for the numbering manifests the minuteness of the care exercised.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Denique numerum capillorum non in actu computationis, sed in facilitate cognitionis accipitur. Bene tantum numerati dicuntur, quia ea quae volumus servare, numeramus.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Lastly, the numbering of the hairs is not to be taken with reference to the act of reckoning, but to the capability of knowing. Yet they are well said to be numbered, because those things which we wish to preserve we number.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Or, by the head of each of the faithful, you must understand a conversation meet for Christ, but by his hair, the works of bodily mortification which are numbered by God, and are worthy of the Divine regard.

          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Si igitur tanta Dei est maiestas ut unus ex passeribus, aut nostrorum numerus capillorum praeter scientiam Dei non sit: quam indignum est aestimare quod fidelium corda dominus aut ignoret, aut spernat, qui viliora cognoscat? Unde convenienter concludit nolite ergo timere: multis passeribus pluris estis vos.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; If then such is the majesty of God, that a single sparrow or the number of our hair is not beside His knowledge, how unworthy is it to suppose that the Lord is either ignorant of the hearts of the faithful, or despises them so as to account them of less value. Hence He proceeds to conclude, Fear not then, you are of more value than many sparrows.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Non plures estis legendum est, quod ad comparationem numeri pertinet; sed pluris estis hoc est, apud Deum maioris dignitatis.

          <td><b>ATHAN</b>. Now I ask the Arians, if God, as if disdaining to make all other things, made only His Son, but deputed all things to His Son; how is it that He extends His providence even to such trifling things as our hair, and the sparrows? For upon whatever things He exercises His providence, of these is He the Creator by His own word.

          <td><b>Athanasius</b> Viri quidem antiqui, studiosus Origenes et mirandus Theognostus, hanc conscribunt esse spiritus sancti blasphemiam, quando qui digni reputati sunt dono spiritus sancti per Baptismum, regrediuntur ad peccandum: ob hoc enim aiunt illos nec veniam obtinere, prout Paulus dicit: impossibile est eos qui facti sunt participes spiritus sancti, et prolapsi sunt, revocari rursum ad poenitentiam. Addidit autem uterque intentionem propriam. Nam Origenes causam huius sic explicat: Deus quidem pater omnia percurrit et singula continet; virtus autem filii ad sola rationalia extenditur; spiritus vero sanctus solus inest participantibus eum in dono Baptismatis. Quando ergo cathecumeni peccant, et gentiles, peccant in filium, qui in eis manet; possunt tamen veniam obtinere, cum digni fiunt dono regenerationis: quando vero baptizati delinquunt, dicit hoc nefas attingere spiritum, ad quem cum pervenissent, peccaverunt: et ideo irrevocabilem fore damnationem. Theognostus vero ait, quod qui primum et secundum excessit limen, minorem poenam meretur; sed qui tertium quoque pertransit, non amplius accipiet veniam. Primum quidem et secundum limen vocavit doctrinam patris et filii; tertium vero in participatione spiritus sancti, secundum illud: cum venerit spiritus veritatis, docebit vos omnem veritatem: non tamquam doctrina spiritus dogma filii superet, sed quia filius condescendit imperfectis, spiritus vero signaculum est eorum qui perficiuntur. Sic igitur, non quia superet spiritus filium, expers est veniae blasphemia spiritus, sed quia imperfectorum quidem est remissio, perfectis vero nulla restat excusatio. Sed cum filius sit in patre, est in illis in quibus est pater, nec abest spiritus; indivisibilis est enim sancta Trinitas. Ad haec, si omnia per filium facta sunt, et omnia in ipso consistunt, erit ipse nimirum in omnibus, ut necessarium sit peccantem in filium, in patrem et in spiritum sanctum peccare. Sacrum autem Baptisma in nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti datur: et sic peccantes post Baptismum in sanctam Trinitatem exercent blasphemiam. Ceterum si Pharisaei Baptismum non susceperant, qualiter redarguebat eos ac si blasphemassent in spiritum sanctum, cuius nondum erant facti participes; praesertim cum non de peccatis simpliciter, sed de blasphemia eos increpabat? Differunt autem: quoniam qui peccat, transgreditur legem; qui vero blasphemat, in ipsam offendit deitatem. Sed aliter. Si eis qui delinquunt post Baptisma, non indulgetur vindicta reatuum, qualiter apostolus poenitenti in Corintho condonat: retrogressos vero Galatas parit, quousque Christus denuo formetur in eis? Cur autem et Novatum arguimus interimentem poenitentiam post Baptismum? Apostolus igitur ad Hebraeos non dissipat poenitentiam peccatorum. Sed ne putarent secundum ritum legis, poenitentiae causa multa fore et quotidiana Baptismata, ob hoc poenitere quidem monet; unicam autem fore insinuat per Baptisma renovationem. Talia vero considerans recurro ad dispensationem quae fit in Christo, qui Deus existens, homo factus est: tamquam Deus suscitabat mortuos; sicut carne vestitus sitiebat, laborabat et patiebatur. Quando igitur aliqui spectantes humana, vident dominum sitientem et patientem, et obloquuntur in salvatorem velut in hominem, peccant quidem, possunt tamen cito cum poenituerint, accipere veniam, praetendentes pro causa fragilitatem corporis; quando vero rursus aspicientes aliqui opera deitatis, dubitant de natura corporis, ipsi quoque nimium peccant; sed et his poenitentibus cito potest ignosci, eo quod et ipsi excusationem habent ab operum magnitudine. Quando vero divinitatis opera retorquent ad Diabolum, merito irrevocabilem ferunt scientiam, quoniam arbitrati sunt Diabolum fore Deum, et verum Deum nihil plusquam Daemones in operibus putaverunt habere. Ad hanc ergo perfidiam Pharisaei pervenerant: salvatore enim ostendente patris opera, mortuos suscitans, caecos illuminans, et similia faciens, huiusmodi opera dicebant esse Beelzebub: aeque enim dicere poterant videntes mundi ordinem et erga eum provisionem quod mundus a Beelzebub est creatus. Quamdiu igitur ad humana spectantes mente claudicabant dicentes: nonne hic est carpentarii filius? Et: quomodo litteras quas non didicit, novit? Sustinebat eos tamquam in filium hominis peccantes; sed ubi magis insaniunt dicentes opera Dei esse Beelzebub, non amplius eos sustinuit. Sic enim et tamdiu patres eorum sustinebat, quamdiu causa panis et aquae murmurabant; sed postquam vitulum conflantes, in eum collata sibi divinitus beneficia referunt, puniti sunt: primo quidem non paucis eorum occisis, postmodum dixit: ego autem in die ultionis visitabo hoc peccatum eorum. Talem ergo et nunc Pharisaei audiunt sententiam, ut in flamma Diabolo parata perpetuo corrodantur cum eo. Non igitur faciendo collationem inter blasphemiam dictam in ipsum et spiritum sanctum, haec dixit, tamquam maior sit spiritus; sed utraque blasphemia in ipsum prolata, hanc minorem, illam validiorem ostendit: ipsum enim videntes hominem vituperabant, et eius opera Beelzebub esse dicebant.
          <td><b>ATHAN</b>. The ancients indeed, the learned Origen and the great Theognostus, describe this to be the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, when they who have been counted worthy of the gift of the Holy Spirit in Baptism, fall back into sin. For they say that for this reason they can not obtain pardon; as Paul says, It is impossible for those who have been made partakers of the Holy Ghost to renew them again, &amp;c. But each adds his own explanation. For Origen gives this as his reason; God the Father indeed penetrates and contains all things, but the power of the Son extends to rational things only; the Holy Spirit is only in those who partake of Him in the gift of Baptism. When then catechumens and heathens sin, they sin against the Son who abides in them, yet they may obtain pardon when they become worthy of the gift of regeneration. But when the baptized commit sin, he says that their offense touches the Spirit, after coming to whom they have sinned, and therefore their condemnation must be irrevocable. But Theognostus says, that he who has gone beyond both the first and second threshold deserves less punishment, but he who has also passed the third, shall no more receive pardon. By the first and second threshold, he speaks of the doctrine of the Father and the Son, but by the third the partaking of the Holy Spirit. According to St. John, When the Spirit of truth is come, he will lead you into all truth. Not as though the doctrine of the Spirit was above that of the Son, but because the Son condescends to those who are imperfect, but the Spirit is the seal of those who are perfect. If then not because the Spirit is above the Son, blasphemy against the Spirit is unpardonable; but because remission of sin is indeed to the imperfect, but no excuse remains to the perfect, therefore since the Son is in the Father, He is in those in whom the Father and the Spirit are not absent, for the Holy Trinity cannot be divided. Besides this, if all things were made by the Son, and all things consist in Him, He will Himself be truly in all; so that it must needs be, that he who sins against the Son, sins against the Father also, and against the Holy Spirit. But holy Baptism is given in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit. And so they that sin after baptism commit blasphemy against the holy Trinity. But if the Pharisees had not received baptism, how did He condemn them as if they had spoken blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, of which they were not yet partakers, especially since He did not accuse them simply of sin, but of blasphemy? But these differ, for he who sins transgresses the Law, but he who blasphemes offends against the Deity Himself. But again, if to those who sin after baptism there is no remission of the punishment of their offenses, how does the Apostle pardon the penitent at Corinth; but he travails in birth of the backsliding Galatians until Christ be formed again in them. And why also do we oppose Novatus, who does away with repentance after baptism? The Apostle to the Hebrews does not thus reject the repentance of sinners, but lest they should suppose that as according to the rites of the Law, under the veil of repentance there could be many and daily baptisms, he therefore warns them indeed to repent, but tells them that there could be only one renewal, namely, by Baptism. But with such considerations I return to the dispensation which is in Christ, who being God was made man; as very God raised the dead; as clothed with the flesh, thirsted, labored, suffered. When any then, looking to human things, see the Lord athirst or in suffering, and speak against the Savior as if against a man, they sin indeed, yet may speedily on repentance receive pardon, alleging as excuse the weakness of His body. And again when any, beholding the works of Deity, doubt concerning the nature of the body, they also sin grievously. But these too if they repent may be quickly pardoned, seeing that they have an excuse in the greatness of the works. But when they refer the works of God to the Devil, justly do they undergo the irrevocable sentence, because they have judged God to be the Devil, and the true God to have nothing more in His works than the evil spirits. To this unbelief then the Pharisees had come. For when the Savior manifested the works of the Father, raising the dead, giving sight to the blind, and such like deeds, they said that these were the works of Beelzebub. As well might they say, looking at the order of the world and the providence exercised over it, that the world was created by Beelzebub. As long then as regarding human things they erred in knowledge, saying, Is not this the carpenter’s son, and how knows this man things which he never learnt? He suffered them as sinning against the Son of man; but when they wax more furious, saying that the works of God are the works of Beelzebub, He no longer endured them. For thus also He endured their fathers so long as their murmurings were for bread and water; but when having found a calf, they impute to it the divine mercies they had received, they were punished. At first indeed multitudes of them were slain, afterwards He said indeed, Nevertheless, in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them. Such then is the sentence passed upon the Pharisees, that in the flame prepared for the devil they shall be together with him everlastingly consumed. Not then to make comparison between a blasphemy spoken against Himself and the Holy Spirit said He these things, as if the Spirit were the greater, but each blasphemy being uttered against Him, He shows the one to be greater, the other less. For looking at Him as man they reviled Him, and said that His works were those of Beelzebub.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. As these two brothers were contending concerning the division of their paternal inheritance, it follows that one meant to defraud the other; but our Lord teaches us that we ought not to be set on earthly things, and rebukes him that called Him to the division of inheritance; as it follows, And he said to him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?

Therefore is this brother deservedly disappointed who desired to occupy the steward of heavenly things with corruptible, seeing that between brothers no judge should intervene, but natural affection should be the umpire to divide the patrimony, although immortality not riches should be the patrimony which men should wait for.

Non meminit communis naturae, nec arbitratus est oportere quod superfluit, dispensari egentibus: et horrea quidem crepabant prae copia conditorum: avarus tamen animus nequaquam implebatur, nolens veteribus cedere propter avaritiam, nova non valens suscipere propter multitudinem: propter quod imperfecta erant eius consilia, et steriles curae; unde sequitur et cogitabat intra se, dicens: quid faciam, quia non habeo quo congregem fructus meos? Conqueritur aeque pauperibus. An non quem premit inopia, dicit: quid faciam? Unde victus, unde calceamenta? Talia et locuples profert: urgent enim ipsius animam divitiae a promptuariis emanantes, ne forte cum exiverint prosint egentibus; a simili gulosorum, qui mallent edacitate crepare quam indigentibus de reliquiis impartiri.

But what are the things wherewith this man repays his Benefactor? He remembered not his fellow-creatures, nor deemed that he ought to give of his superfluities to the needy. His barns indeed bursting from the abundance of his stores, yet was his greedy mind by no means satisfied. He was unwilling to put up with his old ones because of his covetousness, and not able to undertake new ones because of the number, for his counsels were imperfect, and his care barren. Hence it follows, And he thought. His complaint is like that of the poor. Does not the man oppressed with want say, What shall I do, whence can I get food, whence clothing? Such things also the rich man utters. For his mind is distressed on account of his fruits pouring out from his storehouse, lest perchance when they have come forth they should profit the poor; like the glutton who had rather burst from eating, than give any thing of what remains to the starving.

You do well, for the storehouses of iniquity are worthy of destruction. Bull down your barns, from which no one receives comfort. He adds, I will build greater. But if you shall complete these, wilt you again destroy them? What more foolish than laboring on for ever. Your barns, if you will, are the home of the poor. But you will say, Whom do I wrong by keeping what is my own? For it follows also, And there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods. Tell me what is yours, from whence did you get it and bring it into life? As he who anticipates the public games, injures those who are coming by appropriating to himself what is appointed for the common use, so likewise the rich who regard as their own the common things which they have forestalled.

Now it behoves us not to indulge in delights which fattening the body make lean the soul, and bring a heavy burden upon it, and spread darkness over it, and a thick covering, because in pleasure our governing part which is the soul becomes the slave, but the subject part, namely the body, rules. But the body is in need not of luxuries but of food, that it may be nourished, not that it may be racked and melt away. For not to the soul alone are pleasures hurtful, but to the body itself, because from being a strong body it becomes weak, from being healthy diseased, from being active slothful, from being beautiful unshapely, and from youthful old.

On this account many times the soul rises and sinks into the deep again, when it ought to depart from the body. For the consciousness of our sins is ever pricking us, but most of all when we are going to be dragged before the awful tribunal. For when the whole accumulation of crimes is brought up again, and placed before the eyes, it astounds the mind. And as prisoners are always indeed sorrowful, but particularly at the time when they are going to be brought before the judge; so also the soul at this time is greatly tormented by sin and afflicted, but much more after it has been removed.

Vel quia animati corporis est nutrimentum suscipere, congrue animae nutriri attribuit; nam et virtus nutritiva dicitur anima; ut sic intelligatur: ne solliciti sitis nutritivae parti animae quid edatis. Potest autem etiam corpus mortuum vestiri; unde subdit neque corpori vestro quid induamini.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. The Lord carries us onward by degrees to a more perfect teaching. For He taught us above to beware of covetousness, and He added the parable of the rich man, intimating thereby that the fool is he who desires more than is enough. Then as His discourse goes on, He forbids us to be anxious even about necessary things, plucking out the very root of covetousness; whence he says, Therefore I say to you, Take no thought. As if He said, Since he is a fool, who awards to himself a longer measure of life, and is thereby rendered more covetous; be not you careful for Your soul, what you shall eat, not that the intellectual soul eats, but because there seems no other way for the soul to dwell united to the body except by being nourished. Or because it is a part of the animate body to receive nourishment, he fitly ascribes nourishment to the soul. For the soul is called also a nutritive power, as it is so understood. Be not then anxious for the nourishing part of the soul, what you shall eat. But a dead body may also be clothed, therefore he adds, Nor for your body, what you shall put on.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Now the words, Take no thought, are not the same as do no work, but, “Have not your minds fixed on earthly things.” For it so happens, that the man who is working takes no thought.

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Now the soul is more excellent than food, and the body than clothing. Therefore He adds, The life is more than meat, &amp;c. As if He said, “God who has implanted that which is greater, how will He not give that which is less?” Let not our attention then be stayed upon trifling things, nor our understanding serve to seek for food and raiment, but rather think on whatever saves the soul, and raises it to the kingdom of heaven.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Now nothing is more likely to produce conviction in believers that God can give us all things, than the fact, that the ethereal spirit perpetuates the vital union of the soul and body in close fellowship, without our exertion, and the health-giving use of food does not fail until the last day of death has arrived. Since then the soul is clothed with the body as with a garment, and the body is kept alive by the vigor of the soul, it is absurd to suppose that a supply of food will be wanting to us, who are in possession of the everlasting substance of life.

Verum est igitur causam inopiae nostrae avaritiam videri: etenim illis idcirco sine labore pabuli usus exuberat, quo fructus ad escam communem datos, speciali quodam nesciunt vindicare dominatu. Nos communia amisimus, dum propria vindicamus: nam nec proprium quicquam ubi perpetuum nihil, nec certa copia ubi incertus eventus.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>: But it is a great thing to follow up this example in faith. For to the birds of the air who have no labor of tilling, no produce from the fruitfulness of crops, Divine Providence grants an unfailing sustenance. It is true then that the cause of our poverty seems to be covetousness. For they have for this reason a toiless and abundant use of food, because they think not of claiming to themselves by any special right fruits given for common food. We have lost what things were common by claiming them as our own. For neither is any thing a man’s own, where nothing is perpetual, nor is supply certain when the end is uncertain.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Matthaeum</b>: Cum autem posset dominus exemplum ab hominibus sumere qui minime terrena curaverunt, Eliam dico, Moysen et Ioannem, et ceteros huiusmodi, commemoravit volatilia, sequens vetus testimonium, quod ad apem transmittit et formicam, et alia huiusmodi; quibus naturales quosdam mores inseruit conditor.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Now whereas our Lord might have taken an example from the men who have cared least about earthly things, such as Elias, Moses, and John, and the like, He made mention of the birds, following the Old Testament, which sends us to the bee and the ant, and others of the same kind, in whom the Creator has implanted certain natural dispositions.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theodoretus</b>: Ideo autem omissa mentione aliorum volatilium, corvorum mentionem facit, quia pullos corvorum speciali providentia Deus nutrit: nam corvi pariunt quidem, non autem nutriunt, sed negligunt pullos suos: quibus miro modo ab aere pabulum quadam aura delatum ad os pervenit, quod hiantes suscipiunt, et sic nutriuntur. Forsan etiam et talia per synecdochen dicta sunt, toto significato per partem: unde in Matthaeo dominus remittit ad volatilia caeli, hic vero specialiter ad corvos, tamquam gulosiores et rapaciores.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Now the reason that he omits mention of the other birds, and speaks only of the ravens, is, that the young of the ravens are by an especial providence fed by God. For the ravens produce indeed, but do not feed, but neglect their young, to who in a marvelous manner from the air their food comes, brought as it were by the wind, which they receive having their mouths open, and so are nourished. Perhaps also such things were spoken by synecdoche, i.e. the whole signified by a part. Hence in Matthew our Lord refers to the birds of the air, but here more particularly to the ravens, as being more greedy and ravenous than others.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Eusebius</b>: In corvis etiam aliquid plus significat: avibus enim colligentibus legumina promptius est alimentum, vescentibus vero carnibus, sicut corvis, difficilius est ad habendum; nec tamen huiusmodi aves defectum pabuli patiuntur propter providentiam Dei diffusam ubique. Utitur autem ad idem et tertio syllogismo, dicens quis autem vestrum cogitando potest adicere ad staturam suam cubitum unum?
          <td><b>EUSEBIUS</b>. By the ravens also he signifies something else, for the birds which pick up seeds have a ready source of food, but those that feed on flesh as the ravens do have more difficulty in getting it. Yet birds of this kind suffer from no lack of food, because the providence of God extends every where; but he brings to the same purpose also a third argument, saying, And which of you by taking thought can add to his stature?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Nota quod animam quidem semel dedit Deus, et eadem perseverat; sed corpus quotidie sumit incrementum. Pertransiens igitur animam quasi non recipientem augmentum, de solo corpore facit mentionem, dans intelligere quod non augetur per solum alimentum, sed provisione divina, per hoc quod nullus nutrimentum accipiendo aliquid ad suam staturam adicere potest; unde concluditur si ergo neque quod minimum est potestis, quid de ceteris solliciti estis?
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Observe, that when God has once given a soul, it abides the same, but the body is taking growth daily. Passing over then the soul as not receiving increase, he makes mention only of the body, giving us to understand that it is not increased by food alone, but by the Divine Providence, from the fact that no one by receiving nourishment can add any thing to his stature. It is therefore concluded, If you then be not able to do that thing which is least, take no thought for the rest.

          <td><b>EUSEBIUS</b>. If no one has by his own skill contrived a bodily stature for himself, but can not add even the shortest delay to the prefixed limit of his time of life, why should we be vainly anxious about the necessaries of life?

But if a man wishes to be adorned with precious raiment, let him observe closely how even down to the flowers which spring from the earth God extends His manifold wisdom, adorning them with divers colors, so adapting to the delicate membranes of the flowers dyes far superior to gold and purple, that under no luxurious king, not even Solomon himself, who was renowned among the ancients for his riches as for his wisdom and pleasures, has so exquisite a work been devised; and hence it follows, But I say to you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.

Quod est exprimentis pretiositatem et providentiam humani generis. Denique, cum increpare deceret, utitur et hic moderantia, non infidelitatis, sed paucitatis fidei arguens, cum subdit pusillae fidei; ut per hoc magis excitet nos ad dictorum persuasionem; ut non solum non cogitemus de vestibus, sed nec affectemus vestimentorum decorem.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He does not here employ the example of the birds, making mention of a swan or a peacock, but the lilies, for he wishes to give force to the argument on both sides, that is to say, both from the meanness of the things which have obtained such honor, and from the excellence of the honor conferred upon them; and hence a little after He does not call them lilies, but grass, as it is added, If then God so clothe the grass, which today is, He says not, which tomorrow is not, but tomorrow is cast into the oven; nor does He say simply, God clothe, but He says, God so clothe, which has much meaning, and adds, how much more you, which expresses His estimation and care of the human race. Lastly, when it behoves Him to find fault, He deals here also with mildness, reproving them not for unbelief, but for littleness of faith, adding, O you of little faith, that He may so the more rouse us up to believe in His words, that we should not only take no thought about our apparel, but not even admire elegance in dress.

Unde bene et hic vestitus gloria sua Salomon, et alibi coopertus ostenditur, quod infirmitatem corporeae naturae, velut virtute quadam mentis adopertam, operum gloria vestiebat.

Nec tamen in nobis misericordiam Dei desperare debemus, quibus per resurrectionis gratiam dominus similem Angelorum speciem pollicetur.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Nor does it seem of light moment, that a flower is either compared to man, or even almost more than to man is preferred to Solomon, to make us conceive the glory expressed, from the brightness of the color to be that of the heavenly angels; who are truly the flowers of the other world, since by their brightness the world is adorned, and they breathe forth the pure odor of sanctification, who shackled by no cares, employed in no toilsome task, cherish the grace of the Divine bounty towards them, and the gifts of their heavenly nature. Therefore well also is Solomon here described to be clothed in his own glory, and in another place to be veiled, because the frailty of his bodily nature he clothed as it were by the powers of his mind to the glory of his works. But the Angels, whose diviner nature remains free from bodily injury, are rightly preferred, although he be the greatest man. We should not however despair of God’s mercy to us, to whom by the grace of His resurrection He promises the likeness of angels.

And indeed that all these things belong to the Divine counsel is plain to every one, yet are they conferred by God upon those that seek them, in order that by learning that God listens to our lower petitions, we may be raised to the desire of higher things, just as we see in children, who as soon as they are born cling to their mother’s breasts, but when the child grows up it despises the milk, and seeks after a necklace or some such thing with which the eye is delighted; and again when the mind has advanced together with the body, giving up all childish desires, he seeks from his parents those things which are adapted to a perfect life.

          <td><b>Augustinus de quaest. Evang</b>: Prohibita autem sollicitudine de alimentis, consequenter ne extollantur admonuit, dicens nolite in sublime tolli. Primo enim haec ad necessitatem complendam homo quaerit; cum autem his abundaverit, incipit de talibus superbire. Tale est hoc ac si se vulneratus aliquis iactet, quia habeat multa emplastra in domo, cum illi bonum esset ut vulnera non haberet, et ne uno quidem indigeret emplastro.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Now having forbidden all thought about food, he next goes on to warn men not to be puffed up, saying, Neither be you lifted up, for man first seeks these things to satisfy his wants, but when he is filled, he begins to be puffed up concerning them. This is just as if a wounded man should boast that he had many plasters in his house, whereas it were well for him that he had no wounds, and needed not even one plaster.

          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Vel elevationem nihil aliud vocat quam vagum mentis motum, alias aliud meditantis, et ex hoc salientis ad aliud, et sublimia cogitantis.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Or by being lifted up he means nothing else but an unsteady motion of the mind, meditating first one thing, then another, and jumping from this to that, and imagining lofty things.

          <td><b>Basilius</b>: Et ut intelligas huiusmodi elevationem, memento vanitatis propriae iuventutis; si quando manens solus cogitasti de vita et promotionibus, discurrens a principatu in principatum, amplexus es divitias, aedificasti palatia, amicis bene fecisti, ultus es inimicos. Est autem peccatum talis abstractio: intenta enim circa superflua delectatio a veritate seducit; unde convenienter subdit haec enim omnia gentes mundi quaerunt, scilicet voluptatem, divitias et huiusmodi.
          <td><b>BASIL</b>; And that you may understand an elation of this kind, remember the vanity of your own youth; if at any time while by yourself you have thought about life and promotions, passing rapidly from one dignity to another, have grasped riches, have built palaces, benefited friends, been revenged upon enemies. Now such abstraction is sin, for to have our delights fixed upon useless things, leads away from the truth. Hence He goes on to add, For all these things do the nations of the world seek after, &amp;c.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He said not “God,” but your Father, to incite them to greater confidence. For who is a father, and would not allow the want of his children to be supplied? But He adds another thing also; for you could not say that He is indeed a father, yet knows not that we are in need of these things. For He who has created our nature, knows its wants.

          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Ostendit autem consequenter nec ad praesens, nec in reliquum fidelibus gratiam defuturam, si modo qui divina desiderant, terrena non quaerant.

Novit rex quemadmodum familiam suam pascat, alat et vestiat; unde sequitur verumtamen quaerite primum regnum Dei; et haec omnia adicientur vobis.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; But He goes on to show, that neither at the present time, nor hereafter, will grace be lacking to the faithful, if only they who desire heavenly things seek not earthly; for it is unworthy for men to care for meats, who fight for a kingdom.

To this we must answer, first, that every thing existing in the world if it were in itself evil, would be no creation of God, for every creation of God is good.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Moreover, because all things are not taken away by theft, He adds a more excellent reason, and one which admits of no objection whatever, saying, For where your treasure is, there will your hearts be also; as if He says, “Suppose that neither moth corrupts nor thief takes away, yet this very thing, namely, to have the heart fixed in a buried treasure, and to sink to the earth a divine work, that is, the soul, how great a punishment it deserves.”

          <td><b>EUSEBIUS</b>. For every man naturally dwells upon that which is the object of his desire, and thither he directs all his thoughts, where he supposes his whole interest to rest. If any one then has his whole mind and affections, which he calls the heart, set on things of this present life, he lives in earthly things. But if he has given his mind to heavenly things, there will his mind be; so that he seems with his body only to live with men, but with his mind to have already reached the heavenly mansion.

But because it is a small thing not to do evil, unless also men strive to labor in good works, it is added, And your lamps burning in your hands; for we hold burning lamps in our hands, when by good works we show forth bright examples to our neighbors.

And after their example we order our life, that as they living together without evil, are prepared to welcome their Lord’s return, so we also, keeping watch at the door, should make ourselves ready to obey Him when He comes knocking; for it follows, that when he comes and knocks, they may open to him immediately.

For he who trembles to depart from the body, has no wish to open to the Judge knocking, and dreads to see that Judge whom he remembers to have despised. But he who rests secure concerning his hope and works, immediately opens to Him that knocks; for when he is aware of the time of death drawing near, he grows joyful, because of the glory of his reward; and hence it is added, Blessed are the servants whom the Lord when he comes shall find watching. He watches who keeps the eyes of his mind open to behold the true light; who by his works maintains that which he beholds, who drives from himself the darkness of sloth and carelessness.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Or, He will gird Himself, in that He imparts not the whole fullness of blessings, but confines it within a certain measure. For who can comprehend God how great He is? Therefore are the Seraphims said to veil their countenance, because of the excellence of the Divine brightness. It follows, and will make them to sit down; for as a man sitting down causes his whole body to rest, so in the future coming the Saints will have complete rest; for here they have not rest for the body, but there together with their souls their spiritual bodies partaking of immortality will rejoice in perfect rest.

The “sitting down” is taken to be the repose from many labors, a life without annoyance, the divine conversation of those that dwell in the region of light enriched with all holy affections, and an abundant pouring forth of all gifts, whereby they are filled with joy. For the reason why Jesus makes them to sit down, is that He might give them perpetual rest, and distribute to them blessings without number. Therefore it follows, And will pass over and serve them.

And therefore He adds, And if he shall come in the second watch, &amp;c. For they who keep watch on the walls of cities, or observe the attacks of the enemy, divide the night into three or four watches.

Or, to the first watch belong those who live more carefully, as having gained the first step, but to the second, those who keep the measure of a moderate conversation, but to the third, those who are below these. And the same must be supposed of the fourth, and if it should so happen also of the fifth. For there are different measures of life, and a good rewarder metes out to every man according to his deserts.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Or since the watches are the hours of the night which lull men to sleep, you must understand that there are also in our life certain hours which make us happy if we are found awake. Does any one seize your goods? Are your children dead? Are you accused? But if at these times you have done nothing against the commandments of God, He will find you watching in the second and third watch, that is, at the evil time, which brings destructive sleep to idle souls.

          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Quidam hunc furem intelligunt esse Diabolum, domum animam, patremfamilias hominem: non tamen videtur haec acceptio consonare sequentibus: adventus enim domini comparatur huic furi tamquam ex inopinato proveniens, secundum illud apostoli: dies domini sicut fur, ita in nocte veniet; unde et hic subditur et vos estote parati: quia qua hora non putatis filius hominis veniet.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Some understand this thief to be the devil, the house, the soul, the goodman of the house, man. This interpretation, however, does not seem to agree with what follows. For the Lord’s coming is compared to the thief as suddenly at hand, according to the word of the Apostle, The day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night. And hence also it is here added, Be you also ready, for the Son of man comes at an hour when you think not.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius in Evang</b>: Vel aliter. Nesciente patrefamilias, fur domum perfodit: quia dum a sui custodia spiritus dormit, improvisa mors veniens carnis nostrae habitaculum irrumpit; furi autem resisteret si vigilaret: quia adventum iudicis, qui occulte animam capit, praecavens, ei poenitendo occurreret, ne impoenitens periret. Horam vero ultimam dominus idcirco nobis voluit esse incognitam, ut dum illam praevidere non possumus, ad illam sine intermissione praeparemur.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. Or else; unknown to the master the thief breaks into the house, because while the spirit sleeps instead of guarding itself; death comes unexpectedly, and breaks into the dwelling place of our flesh. But he would resist the thief if he were watching, because being on his guard against the coming of the Judge, who secretly seizes his soul, he would by repentance go to meet Him, lest he should perish impenitent. But the last hour our Lord wishes to be unknown to us, in order as we cannot foresee it, we may be unceasingly preparing for it.

          <td><b>Beda</b>: Duo dominus in praemissa parabola monuerat; et se videlicet subito venturum, et illum eos paratos expectare debere. Sed de quo horum, an de utroque Petrus interrogaverit, quosve sibi sociisque suis comparaverit, cum ait ad nos dicis, an ad omnes? Non facile patet. Et quidem in eo quod ait nos, et omnes, non alios quam apostolos apostolorumque similes et ceteros fideles; vel Christianos et infideles, vel eos qui viritim, idest sigillatim morientes, sui iudicis adventum nolentes volentesque suscipiunt, et eos qui in universali iudicio vivi sunt in carne reperiendi, significare putandum est. Mirum est autem si Petrus dubitavit, vel omnibus sobrie et pie et iuste vivendum expectantibus beatam spem; vel inopinatum singulorum et omnium futurum esse iudicium. Unde restat intelligi, his scilicet duobus iam bene cognitis, ea quae nescire poterat, quaesisse; videlicet si sublimia illa vitae caelestis instituta, quibus possessa vendere, sacculos qui non veterascerent facere, lumbis praecinctis lucernisque ardentibus vigilare praeceperat, ad apostolos solum similesque eorum, aut ad omnes qui salvandi sunt, pertineant.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Our Lord had taught two things in the preceding parable to all, even that He would come suddenly, and that they ought to be ready and waiting for Him. But it is not very plain concerning which of these, or whether both, Peter asked the question, or whom he compared to himself and his companions, when he said’ Speak you to us, or to all? Yet in truth by these words, us and all, he must be supposed to mean none other than the Apostles, and those like to the Apostles, and all other faithful men; or Christians, and unbelievers; or those who dying separately, that is, singly, both unwillingly indeed and willingly, receive the coming of their Judge, and those who when the universal judgment comes are to be found alive in the flesh. Now it is marvelous if Peter doubted that all must live soberly, piously, and justly, who wait for a blessed hope, or that the judgment will to each and all be unexpected. It therefore remains to be supposed, that knowing these two things, he asked about that which he might not know, namely, whether those sublime commands of a heavenly life in which He bade us sell what we have and provide bags which wax not old, and watch with our loins girded, and lamps burning, belonged to the Apostles only, and those like to them, or to all who were to be saved.

For I ask, where will be found the steward that possesses in himself faithfulness and wisdom? for as in the management of goods, whether a man be careless yet faithful to his master, or else wise yet unfaithful, the things of the master perish; so also in the things of God there is need of faithfulness and wisdom. For I have known many servants of God, and faithful men, who because they were unable to manage ecclesiastical affairs, have destroyed not only possessions, but souls, exercising towards sinners indiscreet virtue by extravagant rules of penance or unseasonable indulgence.

          <td><b>Isidorus</b>: Additum est etiam in tempore, quod beneficium non suo tempore datum redditur cassum, et nomen beneficii perdit. Idem panis esurienti quidem appetibilis est, satiato autem non multum. De huius autem servi dispensatoris praemio subdit, dicens beatus ille servus quem cum venerit dominus, invenerit sic facientem.
          <td><b>ISIDORE PELEUS</b>; It was added also in their due season, because a benefit not conferred at its proper time is rendered vain, and loses the name of a benefit. The same bread is not equally coveted by the hungry man, and him that is satisfied. But with respect to this servant’s reward for his stewardship, He adds, Blessed is that servant whom his Lord when he comes shall find so doing.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Basilius</b>: Non dicit agentem a casu, sed sic facientem: non enim vincere solum convenit, sed etiam certare legitime: hoc autem est sic singula exequi sicut recipimus in mandatis.
          <td><b>BASIL</b>; He says not, ‘doing,’ as if by chance, but so doing. For not only conquest is honorable, but to contend lawfully, which is to perform each thing as we have been commanded.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Sic ergo fidelis servus et prudens, opportuno tempore distribuens prudenter cibaria famulis, hoc est spirituales escas, beatus erit, iuxta dictum salvatoris: in hoc scilicet quod obtinebit adhuc maiora, et merebitur praemia familiaribus debita; unde sequitur vere dico vobis, quia super omnia quae possidet constituet illum.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Thus the faithful and wise servant prudently giving out in due season the servants’ food, that is, their spiritual meat, will be blessed according to the Savior’s word, in that he will obtain still greater things, and will be thought worthy of the rewards which are due to friends. Hence it follows, Of a truth I say to you, that he will make him ruler over all that he has.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Quanta enim inter bonos auditores et bonos doctores est meritorum distantia, tanta est etiam praemiorum: hos enim, adveniens, cum vigilantes invenerit, faciet discumbere; illos autem cum fideliter prudenterque dispensantes invenerit, super omnia quae possidet constituet, idest super omnia caelestis regni gaudia: non utique ut horum soli dominium teneant; sed ut eorum abundantius ceteris sanctis aeterna possessione fruantur.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; For whatever difference there is in the merits of good hearers and good teachers, such also there is in their rewards; for the one whom when He comes He finds watching, He will make to sit down; but the others whom He finds faithful and wise stewards, He will place over all that He has, that is, over all the joys of the kingdom of heaven, not certainly that they alone shall have power over them, but that they shall more abundantly than the other saints enjoy eternal possession of them.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Vel super omnia bona sua constituet eum, non solum super suam familiam, sed ut tam terrena quam caelestia ei obediant; qualis fuit Iesus Nave et Elias; alter soli, alter nubibus mandans: et omnes sancti, quasi Dei amici, rebus Dei utuntur. Quicumque etiam vitam virtuose peragit, et servos suos, idest iram et concupiscentiam, recte disposuit, exhibens temporibus singulis mensuram frumenti, irae quidem, ut afficiatur in habentes odio Deum, concupiscentiae vero ut necessaria utatur carnis provisione, ordinans eam in Deum: talis, inquam, constituetur super omnia quae possidet dominus, dignus omnia per speculativum intellectum intueri.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Or, he will make him ruler over all that he has, not only over His own household, but that earthly things as well as heavenly shall obey him. As it was with Joshua the son of Nun, and Elias, the one commanding the sun, the other the clouds; and all the Saints as God’s friends use the things of God. Whosoever also passes his life virtuously, and has kept in due submission his servants, that is, anger and desire, supplies to them their portion of food in due season; to anger indeed that he may feel it against those who hate God, but to desire that he may exercise the necessary provision for the flesh, ordering it to God. Such an one, I say, will be set over all things which the Lord has, being thought worthy to look into all things by the light of contemplation.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Matthaeum</b>: Dominus autem non solum ex honore bonis reservato, sed ex minis poenae in malos corrigit auditorem; unde sequitur quod si dixerit servus ille in corde suo: moram facit dominus meus venire.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But our Lord not only by the honors kept in store for the good, but by threats of punishment upon the bad, leads the hearer to correction, as it follows, But if that servant shall say in his heart, My Lord delays his coming.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Nota, inter vitia servi mali ascriptum quod tardum domini sui reditum putaverit; non autem inter boni virtutes annumeratum, quod hunc citum speraverit, sed tantum fideliter ministraverit. Nil ergo melius est quam ut patienter sustineamus ignorare quod sciri non potest; sed tantum laboremus ut idonei inveniamur.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Observe that it is counted among the vices of a bad servant that he thought the coming of his Lord slow, yet it is not numbered among the virtues of the good that he hoped it would come quickly, but only that he ministered faithfully. There is nothing then better than to submit patiently to be ignorant of that which can not be known, but to strive only that we be found worthy.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Ex eo autem quod non consideratur hora finis, multa peccata eveniunt: nam si cogitaremus dominum venire, et praesto esse terminum vitae nostrae, minus utique peccaremus; unde sequitur et coeperit percutere pueros et ancillas, et edere, et bibere, et inebriari.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Now from not considering the time of our departure, there proceed many evils. For surely if we thought that our Lord was coming, and that the end of our life was as at hand, we should sin the less. Hence it follows, And shall begin to strike the man servants and maidens, and to eat and drink and be drunken.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: In hoc servo cunctorum praesulum malorum narratur damnatio: qui neglecto domini timore, non modo ipsi luxuriae vacant, sed etiam subditos iniuriis stimulant; quamvis et typice possit intelligi pueros et ancillas percutere, corda infirmorum pravo exemplo vitiare; edere autem, bibere et inebriari, facinoribus et saeculi illecebris, quae hominem dementant, occupari. De eius autem poena subditur veniet dominus servi illius die qua non sperat, scilicet iudicii vel mortis, et dividet eum.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; In this servant is declared the condemnation of all evil rulers, who, forsaking the fear of the Lord, not only give themselves up to pleasures, but also provoke with injuries those who are put under them. Although these words may be also understood figuratively, meaning to corrupt the hearts of the weak by an evil example; and to eat, drink, and be drunken, to be absorbed in the vices and allurements of the world, which overthrow the mind of man. But concerning his punishment it is added, The Lord of that servant will come in a day when he looks not for him, that is, the day of his judgment or death, and will cut him in sunder.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Basilius</b>: Non quidem dividitur corpus, ut hoc quidem exponatur tormentis, illud vero dimittatur: nam fabulosum est hoc, neque iusti iudicii, cum deliquerit totum, dimidium pati poenam: nec anima secatur, tota criminosam conscientiam possidens, et cum corpore mala cooperans; sed divisio eius est perpetua alienatio animae a spiritu. Nunc enim etsi non sit gratia spiritus indignis, videtur tamen utcumque adesse, conversionem eorum expectans ad salutem; tunc vero totaliter amputabitur ab anima. Spiritus ergo sanctus et bravium est iustorum, et prima condemnatio peccatorum, quoniam eum indigni amittent.
          <td><b>BASIL</b>; The body indeed is not divided, so that one part indeed should be exposed to torments, the other escape. For this is a fable, nor is it a part of just judgment when the whole has offended that half only should suffer punishment; nor is the soul cut in sunder, seeing that the whole possesses a guilty consciousness, and cooperates with the body to work evil; but its division is the eternal severing of the soul from the Spirit. For now although the grace of the Spirit is not in the unworthy, yet it seems ever to be at hand expecting their turning to salvation, but at that time it will be altogether cut off from the soul. The Holy Spirit then is the prize of the just, and the chief condemnation of sinners, since they who are unworthy will lose Him.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Vel dividet eum, a fidelium consortio segregando, et eis qui nunquam ad fidem pertinuerant sociando; unde sequitur partemque eius cum infidelibus ponet; quia qui suorum et domesticorum curam non habet, fidem negavit, et est infideli deterior, ut ait apostolus.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Or He will cut him in sunder, by separating him from the communion of the faithful, and dismissing him to those who have never attained to the faith. Hence it follows, And will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers; for he who has no care for his own and those of his own house, has denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Recte etiam infidelis dispensator cum infidelibus partem accipiet, quia vera caruit fide.

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; For the man of understanding who has given up his will to baser things will shamelessly implore pardon, because he has committed an inexcusable sin, departing as it were maliciously from the will of God, but the rude or unlearned man will more reasonably ask for pardon of the avenger. Hence it is added, But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Here some object, saying, He is deservedly punished who, knowing the will of His Lord, pursues it not; but why is the ignorant punished? Because when he might have known, he would not, but being himself slothful, was the cause of his own ignorance.

Sed in dato quidem non dicit aliquid plus petendum, sed in commendato sive deposito: nam gratia verbi incremento eget, et a doctore requiritur amplius: non enim decet eum torpere, sed augere verbi talentum.

Teachers indeed are given the grace to perform miracles, but entrusted the grace of speech and learning. But not in that which is given, He says, is any thing more to be sought, but in that which is entrusted or deposited; for the grace of the word needs increase. But from a teacher more is required, for he should not lie idle, but improve the talent of the word.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Or else, much is often given also to certain individuals, upon whom is bestowed the knowledge of God’s will, and the means of performing what they know; much also is given to him to whom, together with his own salvation, is committed the care also of feeding our Lord’s flock. Upon those then who are gifted with more abundant grace a heavier penalty falls; but the mildest punishment of all will be theirs, who, beyond the guilt they originally contracted, have added none besides; and in all who have added, theirs will be the more tolerable who have committed fewest iniquities.

And when you see the south wind blowing, you say, There will be heat, &amp;c. As if He says, Your words and works show me to be opposed to you. You may therefore suppose that I came not to give peace, but the storm and whirlwind. For I am a cloud, and I come out of the west, that is, from human nature; which has been long since clothed with the thick darkness of sin. I came also to send fire, that is, to stir up heat.

For it is possible to discover some things with respect to coming rain, still more concerning heat and the force of the winds, whether partial or universal, stormy or gentle. But the great advantage that is rendered to life by these conjectures is known to every one.

Demus igitur operam ut dum in hoc sumus vitae curriculo constituti, tamquam a malo adversario, ita ab improbo liberemur actu; ne dum imus cum adversario ad magistratum, in via nostrum condemnet errorem. Quis autem est magistratus nisi penes quem omnis potestas est? Hic autem magistratus tradit reum iudici, ei scilicet cui vivorum et mortuorum tribuit potestatem, scilicet Iesu Christo, per quem occulta redarguuntur, et improbi operis poena mandatur. Ipse exactori tradit, et in carcerem mittit; dicit enim: tollite et mittite illum in tenebras exteriores. Et exactores suos monstrat esse Angelos, de quibus dicit: exibunt Angeli, et separabunt malos de medio iustorum, et mittent eos in caminum ignis. Sed subditur dico tibi: non exies inde donec etiam novissimum minutum reddas. Si enim qui pecuniam solvunt, non prius evacuant fenoris nomen quam totius sortis usque ad minimum quocumque solutionis genere quantitas universa solvatur; sic compensatione caritatis actuumque reliquorum, vel satisfactione quacumque peccati poena dissolvitur.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Or our adversary is the devil, who lays his baits for sin, that he may have those his partners in punishment who were his accomplices in crime; our adversary is also every vicious practice. Lastly, our adversary is an evil conscience, which affects us both in this world, and will accuse and betray us in the next. Let us then give heed, while we are in this life’s course, that we may be delivered from every bad act as from an evil enemy. Nay, while we are going with our adversary to the magistrate, as we are in the way, we should condemn our fault. But who is the magistrate, but He in whose hands is all power? But the Magistrate delivers the guilty to the Judge, that is, to Him, to whom He gives the power over the quick and dead, namely, Jesus Christ, through Whom the secrets are made manifest, and the punishment of wicked works awarded. He delivers to the officer, and the officer casts into prison, for He says, Bind him hand and foot, and cast him into outer darkness. And he shows that His officers are the angels, of whom he says, The angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just, and shall cast them into the furnace of fire; but it is added, I tell you, you shall not depart thence till you have paid the very last mite. For as they who pay money on interest do not get rid of the debt of interest before that the amount of the whole principal is paid even up to the least sum in every kind of payment, so by the compensation of love and the other acts, or by each particular kind of satisfaction the punishment of sin is canceled.

Discrepant etiam, quod ille quadrantem, iste minutum posuit; uterque autem dixit novissimum. Cunctis autem hominibus duos Angelos adesse legimus; malum qui adversa exhortatur, bonum qui optima persuadet. Ille autem adversarius noster, quotiescumque peccamus, exultat, sciens quoniam habet potestatem apud principem saeculi huius, qui se miserat, exultandi et gloriandi. In Graeco autem cum articulo tu, qui singularitatis significator est, adversarium posuit, ut ostenderet singulis hominibus singulos adversarios esse, qui ubique eos sequantur; principem vero sine articulo posuit, ne certum videretur ostendere, sed unum de pluribus: non enim unusquisque nostrum habet proprium principem, sed suae genti communem. Da ergo operam ut libereris ab adversario tuo, sive a principe, ad quem te adversarius trahit, habendo sapientiam, iustitiam, fortitudinem et temperantiam. Si autem dederis operam, esto in eo qui dicit: ego sum via; alioquin trahet te adversarius ad iudicem. Dicit autem trahit, ut ostendat nolentes ad condemnationem compelli. Iudicem autem alium nescio nisi dominum nostrum Iesum Christum, qui tradit exactori. Singuli exactores proprios habemus: dominantur exactores, si debuerimus aliquid: si omnibus universa reddidero, nemo exactor est, et intrepida mente respondeo: nihil tibi debeo. Quod si debitor fuero, mittet me exactor in carcerem, nec patietur exire, nisi debitum omne persolvero: non enim habet exactor potestatem ut mihi saltem quadrantem concedat. Qui donavit debitori quingentos denarios, et alii quinquaginta, dominus erat; iste qui exactor est, dominus non est; sed a domino ad exigenda debita praepositus. Novissimum autem minutum dicit gracile et tenue: peccata enim nostra aut pinguia sunt, aut tenuia. Beatus igitur est qui non peccat. Secundo autem si tenue peccatum habeat, inter ipsa quoque tenuia diversitas est: alioquin non diceret donec novissimum redderet minutum. Si enim parum debet, non egredietur nisi solvat minimum quadrantem; qui autem magno debito fuit obnoxius, infinita ei ad reddendum saecula numerabuntur.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; Or else, He here introduces four characters, the adversary, the magistrate the officer, and the judge. But with Matthew the character of the magistrate is left out, and instead of the officer a servant is introduced. They differ also in that the one has written a farthing, the other a mite, but each has called it the last. Now we say that all men have present with them two angels, a bad one who encourages them to wicked deeds, a good one who persuades all that is best. Now the former, our adversary whenever we sin rejoices, knowing that he has an occasion for exaltations and boasting with the prince of the world, who sent him. But in the Greek, “the adversary” is written with the article, to signify that he is one out of many, seeing that each individual is under the ruler of his nation. Give diligence then that you may be delivered from your adversary, or from the ruler to whom the adversary drags you, by having wisdom, justice, fortitude, and temperance. But if you have given diligence, let it be in Him who says, I am the life, otherwise the adversary will hale you to the judge. Now he says, hale, to point out that they are forced unwillingly to condemnation. But I know no other judge but our Lord Jesus Christ who delivers to the officer. Each of us have our own officers; the officers exercise rule over us, if we owe any thing. If I paid every man every thing, I come to the of officers and answer with a fearless heart, “I owe them nothing.” But if I am a debtor, the officer will cast me into prison, nor will he suffer me to go out from thence until I have paid every debt. For the officer has no power to let me off even a farthing. He who forgave one debtor five hundred pence and another fifty, was the Lord, but the exactor is not the master, but one appointed by the master to demand the debts. But the last mite he calls slight and small, for our sins are either heavy or slight. Happy then is he who sin not, and next in happiness he who has sinned slightly. Even among slight sins there is diversity, otherwise he would not say until he has paid the last mite. For if he owes a little, he shall not come out till he pays the last mite. But he who has been guilty of a great debt, will have endless ages for his payment.

          <td><b>GLOSS</b>. As He had been speaking of the punishments of sinners, the story is fitly told Him of the punishment of certain particular sinners, from which He takes occasion to denounce vengeance also against other sinners: as it is said, There were present at that season some that told him of the Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.

Dicebant etiam non oportere alias a statutis victimis in lege Moysi offerre Deo; unde prohibebant statutas a populo victimas pro salute imperatoris et populi Romani offerre. Pilatus ergo indignatus in Galilaeos, iussit inter ipsas victimas, quas ritu legis se offerre putabant, occidi, ita quod sanguis offerentium oblatis victimis misceretur. Credente autem vulgo, iustissime praedictos talia passos esse, quasi scandala seminantes in populo, incitantes principes in odium subditorum, narraverunt haec salvatori, volentes percipere quid ei super hoc videretur. Ipse autem peccatores hos esse ponit; non tamen hic asserit talia passos esse, tamquam peiores non patientibus; unde sequitur et respondens dixit illis: putatis quod hi Galilaei prae omnibus Galilaeis peccatores fuerunt, quia talia passi sunt? Non, dico vobis.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; For these were followers of the opinions of Judas of Galilee, of whom Luke makes mention in the Acts of the Apostles, who said, that we ought to call no man master. Great numbers of them refusing to acknowledge Caesar as their master, were therefore punished by Pilate. They said also that men ought not to offer God any sacrifices that were not ordained in the law of Moses, and so forbade to offer the sacrifices appointed by the people for the safety of the Emperor and the Roman people. Pilate then, being enraged against the Galileans, ordered them to be slain in the midst of the very victims which they thought they might offer according to the custom of their law; so that the blood of the offerers was mingled with that of the victims offered. Now it being generally believed that these Galileans were most justly punished, as sowing offences among the people, the rulers, eager to excite against Him the hatred of the people, relate these things to the Savior, wishing to discover what He thought about them. But He, admitting them to be sinners, does not however judge them to have suffered such things, as though they were worse than those who suffered not. Whence it follows, And he answered an said to them, Suppose you that these Galileans were sinners above all the Galileans, &amp;c.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Punit enim Deus quosdam peccatorum, amputans eorum nequitiam, et poenam illis statuens leviorem, et plene semovens eos ab aliis, et viventes in malitia corrigens per horum damnationem. Rursus alios hic non punit, ut si sibi caverint poenitentes, praesentem poenam effugiant, et futurum supplicium: si vero perseveraverint, maius patiantur tormentum.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. For God punishes some sinners by cutting off their iniquities, and appointing to them hereafter a lighter punishment, or perhaps even entirely releasing them, and correcting those who are living in wickedness by their punishment. Again, he does not punish others, that if they take heed to themselves by repentance they may escape both the present penalty and future punishment, but if they continue in their sins, suffer still greater torment.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Titus</b>: Manifestat et hic, quia quaecumque ex iudiciis accidunt in reorum supplicium, non solum iudicantium potestate, sed etiam nutu Dei contingunt; unde sive iusta conscientia puniat iudex, sive aliud intendens condemnet, commendandum est negotium divinae censurae.
          <td><b>TITUS BOST</b>. And he here plainly shows, that whatever judgments are passed for the punishment of the guilty, happen not only by the authority of the judges, but the will of God. Whether therefore the judge punishes upon the strict grounds of conscience, or has some other object in his condemnation, we must ascribe the work to the Divine appointment.

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; To save therefore the multitudes, from the intestine seditions, which were excited for the sake of religion, He adds, but unless you repent, and unless you cease to conspire against your rulers, for which you have no divine guidance, You shall all likewise perish, and your blood shall be united to that of your sacrifices.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. And herein he shows that He permitted them to suffer such things, that the heirs of the kingdom yet living might be dismayed by the dangers of others. “What then,” you will say, “is this man punished, that I might become better?” Nay, but he is punished for his own crimes, and hence arises an opportunity of salvation to those who see it.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; But because they repented not in the fortieth year of our Lord’s Passion, the Romans coming, (whom Pilate represented, as belonging to their nation,) and beginning from Galilee, (whence our Lord’s preaching had begun,) utterly destroyed that wicked nation, and defiled with human blood not only the courts of the temples, where they were wont to offer sacrifices, but also the inner parts of the doors, (where there was no entrance to the Galileans.)

Non, dico vobis. Non enim hic omnes punit, dans aliis inducias poenitendi; nec tamen cunctos futurae punitioni reservat, ne plures providentiam abnegarent.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Again, there had been eighteen others crushed to death by the falling of a tower, of whom He adds the same things, as it follows, Or those eighteen upon whom the tower of Siloam fell and slew them, think you that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem? I tell you, Nay, For he does not punish all in this life, giving them a time meet for repentance. Nor however does he reserve all for future punishment, lest men should deny His providence.

          <td><b>TITUS BOST</b>. Now one tower is compared to the whole city, that the destruction of a part may alarm the whole. Hence it is added, But, except you repent, you shall all likewise perish; as if He said, The whole city shall shortly be smitten if the inhabitants continue in impenitence.

          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Mystice autem in illis, quorum sanguinem Pilatus miscuit cum sacrificiis eorum, figura quaedam videtur, eos tangens, qui coactu diabolico non pure offerunt sacrificium, quorum oratio est in peccatum, sicut de Iuda scriptum est, qui proditionem sanguinis dominici inter sacrificia positus cogitabat.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; In those whose blood Pilate mingled with the sacrifices, there seems to be a certain mystical type, which concerns all who by the compulsion of the Devil offer not a pure sacrifice, whose prayer is for a sin, as it was written of Judas, who when he was amongst the sacrifices devised the betrayal of our Lord’s blood.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Pilatus enim, qui interpretatur os malleatoris, Diabolum significat, semper caedere paratum; sanguis peccatum, sacrificia bonas actiones exprimunt. Pilatus ergo sanguinem Galilaeorum cum sacrificiis eorum miscet, quando Diabolus eleemosynam et cetera bona fidelium, vel carnis delectatione, vel humanae laudis ambitione, vel qualibet alia peste commaculat. Illi etiam Hierosolimytae a ruina turris oppressi significant Iudaeos, qui poenitere noluerunt, cum moenibus suis esse perituros. Non frustra decem et octo, qui numerus apud Graecos ex i et e, hoc est eisdem litteris quibus nomen Iesu incipit, exprimitur: significat enim Iudaeos hinc maxime perituros, quod nomen salvatoris recipere noluerunt. Illa turris significat illum qui est turris fortitudinis, quae merito est in Siloe, quae interpretatur missus; significat enim eum qui missus a patre venit in mundum, qui omnes super quos cecidit conteret.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; For Pilate, who is interpreted, “The mouth of the hammerer,” signifies the devil ever ready to strike. The blood expresses sin, the sacrifices good actions. Pilate then mingles the blood of the Galileans with their sacrifices when the devil stains the alms and other good works of the faithful either by carnal indulgence, or by courting the praise of men, or any other defilement. Those men of Jerusalem also who were crushed by the falling of the tower, signify that the Jews who refuse to repent will perish within their own walls. Nor without meaning is the number eighteen given, (which number among the Greeks is made up of I and H, that is, of the same letters with which the name of Jesus begins.) And it signifies that the Jews were chiefly to perish, because they would not receive the name of the Savior. That tower represents Him who is the tower of strength. And this is rightly in Siloam, which is interpreted, “sent;” for it signifies Him who, sent by the Father, came into the world, and who shall grind to powder all on whom He falls.

          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Vinea domini Sabaoth erat quam dedit in rapinam gentium. Apta autem synagogae arboris istius comparatio est: quia sicut arbor ista redundans foliis fluentibus, spem possessoribus suis cassa speratorum proventuum expectatione destituit: ita etiam in synagoga dum doctores eius operibus infecundi, verbis tamen velut foliis redundantibus gloriantur, inanis umbra legis exuberat. Haec etiam sola arbor ab initio germinat poma pro floribus, et poma decident ut poma succedant; manent tamen aliqua priorum perrara, nec decidunt. Etenim primus synagogae populus velut inutilis decidit fructus ut de pinguedine religionis antiquae novus Ecclesiae populus emergeret; primo tamen ex Israel, grossi maturescentis exemplo, pulcherrimorum gratia fructuum caeteris praestiterunt: quibus dicitur: sedebitis super duodecim thronos. Nonnulli tamen ficum istam non synagogae, sed malitiae et improbitatis figuram putant: hi tamen in nullo distant, nisi quod pro specie genus eligunt.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; There was a vineyard of the Lord of hosts, which He gave for a spoil to the Gentiles. And the comparison of the fig tree to the synagogue is well chosen, because as that tree abounds with wide and spreading foliage, and deceives the hopes of its possessor with the vain expectation of promised fruit, so also in the synagogue, while its teachers are unfruitful in good works, yet magnify themselves with words as with abundant leaves, the empty shadow of the law stretches far and wide. This tree also is the only one which puts forth fruit in place of flowers. And the fruit falls, that other fruit may succeed; yet some few of the former remain, and do not fall. For the first people of the synagogue fell off as a useless fruit, in order that out of the fruitfulness of the old religion might arise the new people of the Church; yet they who were the first out of Israel whom a branch of a stronger nature bore, under the shadow of the law and the cross, in the bosom of both, stained with a double juice after the example of a ripening fig, surpassed all others in the grace of most excellent fruits; to whom it is said, You shall sit upon twelve thrones. Some however think the fig tree to be a figure not of the synagogue, but of wickedness and treachery; yet these differ in nothing from what has gone before, except that they choose the genus instead of the species.

Denique ex sequentibus docet non se ante tempus venisse, qui per triennium venit; sic enim habes: dixit autem ad cultorem vineae: ecce anni tres sunt ex quo venio quaerens fructum in ficulnea hac et non invenio. Venit ad Abraham, venit ad Moysen, venit ad Mariam, hoc est, venit in signaculo, venit in lege, venit in corpore: adventum eius ex beneficiis recognoscimus: alibi purificatio, alibi sanctificatio, alibi iustificatio est; circumcisio purificavit, lex sanctificavit, gratia iustificavit. Ergo populus Iudaeorum neque purificari potuit, quia circumcisionem corporis, non animi habuit; neque sanctificari, quia virtutem legis ignorans, carnalia magis quam spiritualia sequebatur; neque iustificari, quia delictorum suorum poenitentiam non gerens, gratiam nesciebat. Merito ergo nullus fructus in synagoga inventus est; et ideo iubetur excidi; sequitur enim succide ergo illam: ut quid etiam terram occupat? Bonus autem cultor, et fortassis ille in quo Ecclesiae fundamentum est, praesagiens, alterum ad gentes, se autem ad eos qui ex circumcisione sunt, esse mittendum, religiose ne excidatur intervenit, fretus vocatione sua etiam populum Iudaeorum per Ecclesiam posse salvari; unde sequitur at ille respondens, dixit illi: domine, dimitte illam et hoc anno.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; But our Lord sought, not because He was ignorant that the fig tree had no fruit, but that He might show in a figure that the synagogue ought by this time to have fruit. Lastly, from what follows, He teaches that He Himself came not before the time who came after three years. For so it is said, Then said he to the dresser of the vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none. He came to Abraham, He came to Moses, He came to Mary, that is, He came in the seal of the covenant, He came in the law, He came in the body. We recognise His coming by His gifts; at one time purification, at another sanctification, at another justification. Circumcision purified, the law sanctified, grace justified. The Jewish people then could not be purified because they had not the circumcision of the heart, but of the body; nor be sanctified, because ignorant of the meaning of the law, they followed carnal things rather than spiritual; nor justified, because not working repentance for the their offences, they knew nothing of grace. Rightly then was there no fruit found in the synagogue, and consequently it is ordered to be cut down; for it follows, Cut it down, why cumbers it the ground? But the merciful dresser, perhaps meaning him on whom the Church is founded, foreseeing that another would be sent to the Gentiles, but he himself to them who were of the circumcision, piously intercedes that it may not be cut off; trusting to his calling, that the Jewish people also might be saved through the Church. Hence it follows, And he answering said to him, Lord, let it alone this year also. He soon perceived hardness of bears and pride to be the causes of the barrenness of the Jews. He knew therefore how to discipline, who knew how to censure faults. Therefore adds He, till I shall dig about it. He promises that the hardness of their hearts shall be dug about by the Apostles’ spades, lest a heap of earth cover up and obscure the root of wisdom. And He adds, and dung it, that is, by the grace of humility, by which even the fig is thought to become fruitful toward the Gospel of Christ. Hence He adds, And if it bear fruit, well, that is, it shall be well, but if not, then after that you shall cut it down.

But our Lord came three times to the fig tree, because He sought after man’s nature before the law, under the law, and under grace, by waiting, admonishing, visiting; but yet He complains that for three years he found no fruit, for there are some wicked men whose hearts are neither corrected by the law of nature breathed into them, nor instructed by precepts, nor converted by the miracles of His incarnation.

To dig about it, is to teach humility and patience, for the ground which has been dug is lowly. The dung signifies the soiled garments, but they bring forth fruit. The soiled garment of the dresser, is the grief and mourning of sinners; for they who do penance and do it truly are in soiled garments.

Tu tamen attende, quod ubi quidem opus fieri iussit, sicut cum paralytico iussit grabatum tollere, transtulit sermonem ad maius, convincens eos per dignitatem patris, cum dicit: pater meus usque modo operatur, et ego operor; hic autem ubi totum faciens verbo, nihil aliud adicit, ex his quae ipsi faciebant, calumniam solvit.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Well then does he call the ruler of the synagogue a hypocrite, for he had the appearance of an observer of the law, but in his heart was a crafty and envious man. For it troubles him not that the Sabbath is broken, but that Christ is glorified. Now observe, that whenever Christ orders a work to be done, (as when He ordered the man sick of the palsy to take up his bed,) He raises His words to something higher, convincing men by the majesty of the Father, as He says, My Father works until now, and I work. But in this place, as doing every thing by word, He adds nothing further, refuting their calumny by the very things which they themselves did.

          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Arguitur autem archisynagogus ut hypocrita, dum bruta quidem adaquat in sabbato, mulierem vero non magis genere quam fide filiam Abrahae, non dignam putat solvi ab aegritudinis vinculo; unde subdit hanc autem filiam Abrahae, quam alligavit Satanas ecce decem et octo annis, non oportuit solvi a vinculo isto die sabbati? Malebat siquidem mulierem tamquam quadrupedia cernere terram, quam hominum staturam recipere, dummodo Christus non magnificaretur. Non autem erat eis quid responderent; sed ipsi sibi ipsis erant irrefragabilis reprehensio; unde sequitur et cum haec diceret, erubescebant omnes adversarii eius; sed populus, quasi commoda ex miraculis consequens, laetabatur de signis; unde sequitur et omnis populus gaudebat in universis quae gloriose fiebant ab eo. Nam claritas operum omnem quaestionem solvebat apud eos qui non quaerebant mentibus perversis.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Now the ruler of the synagogue is convicted a hypocrite, in that he leads his cattle to watering on the Sabbath-day, but this woman, not more by birth than by faith the daughter of Abraham, he thought unworthy to be loosed from the chain of her infirmity. Therefore He adds, And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham whom Satan has bound lo, these eighteen years, to be loosed from this bond on the sabbath-day? The ruler preferred that this woman should like the beasts rather look upon the earth than receive her natural stature, provided that Christ was not magnified. But they had nothing to answer; they themselves unanswerably condemned themselves. Hence it follows, And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed. But the people, reaping great good from His miracles, rejoiced at the signs which they saw, as it follows, And all the people rejoiced;. For the glory of His works vanquished every scruple in them who sought Him not with corrupt hearts.

          <td><b>Gregorius in Evang</b>: Mystice autem hoc significat ficulnea infructuosa quod mulier inclinata: humana enim natura ad peccatum ex voluntate corruens, quia fructum obedientiae ferre noluit, statum rectitudinis amisit; et hoc significat ficulnea reservata quod mulier erecta.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. Mystically the unfruitful fig tree signifies the woman that was bowed down. For human nature of its own will rushes into sin, and as it would not bring forth the fruit of obedience, has lost the state of uprightness. The same fig tree preserved signifies the woman made upright.

Nec aliter curari potuisset haec mulier, nisi quia legem implevit et gratiam: nam in decem verbis legis perfectio est, in octavo numero resurrectionis plenitudo.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Or the fig tree represents the synagogue; afterwards in the infirm woman there follows as it were a figure of the Church, which having fulfilled the measure of the law and the resurrection, and now raised up on high in that eternal resting place, can no more experience the frailty of our weak inclinations. Nor could this woman be healed except she had fulfilled the law and grace. For in ten sentences is contained the perfection of the law, and in the number eight the fullness of the resurrection.

          <td><b>Gregorius</b>: Vel aliter. Sexto die homo factus est, atque eodem sexto die opera cuncta domini perfecta sunt. Senarius autem numerus in trigonum ductus, decem et octo facit. Quia ergo homo qui sexto die factus est, perfecta opera habere noluit, sed ante legem, sub lege, atque in exordio inchoantis gratiae infirmus extitit, decem et octo annis mulier curva fuit.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. Or else; man was made on the sixth day, and on the same sixth day were all the works of the Lord finished, but the number six multiplied three times makes eighteen. Because then man who was made on the sixth day was unwilling to do perfect works, but before the law, under the law, and at the beginning of grace, was weak, the woman was bowed down eighteen years.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Verb. Dom</b>: Quod ergo significat triennium in arbore, hoc decem et octo anni in illa muliere, quia ter seni decem et octo faciunt. Curva autem erat, sursum aspicere non poterat, quia sursum corda sine causa audiebat.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. That which the three years signified in the tree, the eighteen did in the woman, for three times six is eighteen. But she was crooked and could not look up, for in vain she heard the words, lift up your hearts.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius</b>: Omnis enim peccator terrena cogitans, caelestia non requirens, sursum respicere non valet; quia dum desideria inferiora sequitur, a mentis suae rectitudine curvatur; et hoc semper videt, et sine intermissione cogitat. Vocavit eam dominus et erexit: quia illuminavit et audivit. Vocat enim quandoque, sed non erigit: quia plerumque videmus quae agenda sunt, sed opera non implemus: usitata enim culpa obligat mentem, ut nequaquam surgere possit ad rectitudinem. Conatur, et labitur: quia ubi diu sponte perstitit, ibi cum noluerit cadit.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. For every sinner who thinks earthly things, not seeking those that are in heaven, is unable to look up. For while pursuing his baser desires, he declines from the uprightness of his state; or his heart is bent crooked, and he ever looks upon that which he unceasingly thinks about. The Lord called her and made her upright, for He enlightened her and succored her. He sometimes calls but does not make upright, for when we are enlightened by grace, we oft-times see what should be done, but because of sin do not practice it. For habitual sin binds down the mind, so that it cannot rise to uprightness. It makes attempts and fails, because when it has long stood by its own will, when the will is lacking, it falls.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Opus autem sabbati signum futuri est, quod unusquisque perfunctus lege et gratia, per misericordiam Dei corporeae fragilitatis molestiis exuetur. Cur autem aliud animal indicavit, nisi ut ostenderet futurum ut Iudaicus et gentilis populus, sitim corporis, aestusque mundi huius, dominici fontis ubertate deponat; et sic per vocationem duorum populorum Ecclesiam salvam futuram?
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Now this miracle is a sign of the coming sabbath, when every one who has fulfilled the law and grace, shall by the mercy of God put off the toils of this weak body. But why did He not mention any more animals, save to show that the time would come when the Jewish and Gentile nations should quench their bodily thirst, and this world’s heat in the fullness of the fountain of the Lord, and so through the calling forth of two nations, the Church should be saved.

          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Alio loco granum sinapis legitur, ubi confertur. Ergo si regnum caelorum sicut granum sinapis est, et fides sicut granum sinapis, fides est utique regnum caelorum quod intra nos est. Granum quidem sinapis res est vilis et simplex: si teri coeperit, vim suam fundit: et fides simplex primo videtur: sed si atteratur adversis, gratiam suae virtutis effundit. Grana sinapis martyres sunt. Habebant odorem fidei, sed latebat: venit persecutio, contriti sunt gladio, per totius mundi terminos grana sui sparsere martyrii. Ipse etiam dominus granum est sinapis: teri voluit, ut diceremus: Christi bonus odor sumus; seminari voluit velut granum sinapis, quod acceptum homo misit in hortum suum: in horto enim Christus captus et sepultus est, ubi etiam resurrexit et factus est arbor; unde sequitur et factum est in arborem magnam. Dominus enim noster granum est cum sepelitur in terra, arbor cum elevatur in caelum. Est etiam arbor mundum obumbrans; unde sequitur et requieverunt volucres caeli in ramis eius, idest potestates caelorum, et quicumque spiritualibus factis evolare meruerunt. Ramus est Petrus, ramus est Paulus, in quorum sinus per quosdam disputationum recessus, qui eramus longe, assumptis virtutum remigiis advolamus. Ergo semina in horto tuo Christum. Hortus utique locus est plenus florum, in quo gratia tui operis effloreat, et multiplex odor variae virtutis exhalet. Ibi ergo Christus ubi fructus est seminis.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; In another place, a grain of mustard seed is introduced where it is compared to faith. If then the mustard seed is the kingdom of God, and faith is as the grain of mustard seed; faith is truly the kingdom of heaven, which is within us. A grain of mustard seed is indeed a mean and trifling thing, but as soon as it is crushed, it pours forth its power. And faith at first seems simple, but when it is buffeted by adversity, pours forth the grace of its virtue. The martyrs are grains of mustard seed. They have about them the sweet odor of faith, but it is hidden. Persecution comes; they are smitten by the sword; and to the farthest boundaries of the whole world they have scattered the seeds of their martyrdom. The Lord Himself also is a grain of mustard seed; He wished to be bruised that we might see that we are a sweet savor of Christ. He wishes to be sown as a grain of mustard seed, which when a man takes he puts it into his garden. For Christ was taken and buried in a garden, where also he rose again and became a tree, as it follows, And it waxed into a great tree. For our Lord is a grain when He is buried in the earth, a tree when He is lifted up into the heaven. He is also a tree overshadowing the world, as it follows, And the fowls of the air rested in his branches; that is, the heavenly powers and they whoever (for their spiritual deeds) have been thought worthy to fly forth. Peter is a branch, Paul is a branch, into whose arms, by certain hidden ways of disputation, we who were afar off now fly, having taken up the wings of the virtues. Sow then Christ in your garden; a garden is truly a place full of flowers, wherein the grace of your work may blossom; and the manifold odor of your different virtues be breathed forth. Wherever is the fruit of the seed, there is Christ.

As then the mustard seed is surpassed in size by the seeds of other herbs, yet so increases as to become the shelter of many birds; so also the life-giving doctrine was at first in the possession only of few? but afterwards spread itself abroad.

          <td><b>Beda</b>: Homo autem Christus est, hortus est Ecclesia, eius disciplinis colenda; qui bene dicitur granum accepisse, quia dona quae nobis cum patre tribuit ex divinitate, nobiscum accipit ex humanitate. Crevit autem Evangelii praedicatio cunctum disseminata per orbem; crescit et in mente cuiusque credentis, quia nemo repente fit perfectus. Crescendo autem non herbarum, quae velociter arescunt, sed arborum instar exurgit.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Now the man, is Christ, the garden, His Church, to be cultivated by His discipline. He is well said to have taken the grain, because the gifts which He together with the Father gave to us from His divinity, He took from His humanity. But the preaching of the Gospel grew and was disseminated throughout the whole world. It grows also in the mind of every believer, for no one is suddenly made perfect. But in its growth, not like the grass, (which soon withers,) but it rises up like the trees. The branches of this tree are the manifold doctrines, on which the chaste souls, soaring upwards on the wings of virtue, build and repose.

Paulus enim quasi granum modicum accepit Ananiae rudimentum; sed plantans illud in viridario suo, produxit multas et bonas doctrinas, in quibus habitant qui sunt intellectu excelsi, puta Dionysius, Hierotheus, et alii quamplures.

For Paul received the instruction of Ananias as it were a small grain, but planting it in his garden, he brought forth many good doctrines, in which they dwell who have high heavenly thoughts, as Dionysius, Hierotheus, and many others. He next likens the kingdom of God to leaven, for it follows, And again he says, if Whereunto shall I liken it? It is like to leaven, &amp;c.

Me tamen sequi iuvat quod ipse dominus docuit, fermentum esse spiritualem doctrinam Ecclesiae. Ecclesia autem renatum hominem in corpore et anima et spiritu, fermento spirituali sanctificat, cum tria haec pari quadam cupiditatum lance consentiunt, et aequalis aspirat concordia voluptatum.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; But we are the meal of the woman which hide the Lord Jesus in the secrets of our hearts, until the heat of heavenly wisdom penetrates our innermost recesses. And since He says it was hid in three measures, it seems fitting that we should believe the Son of God to have been hid in the Law, veiled in the Prophets, manifested in the preaching of the Gospel. Here however I am invited to proceed farther, because our Lord Himself has taught us, that the leaven is the spiritual teaching of the Church. Now the Church sanctifies with its spiritual leaven the man who is renewed in body, soul, and spirit, seeing that these three are united in a certain equal measure of desire, and there breathes forth a complete harmony of the will. If then in this life the three measures abide in the same person until they are leavened and become one, there will be hereafter an incorruptible communion with them that love Christ.

          <td><b>Glossa</b>: Praemissis similitudinibus de multiplicatione evangelicae doctrinae, eius diffusioni ubique praedicando intendit; unde dicitur et ibat per civitates et castella, docens, et iter faciens in Ierusalem.
          <td><b>GLOSS</b>. Having spoken in parables concerning the increase of the teaching of the Gospel, he every where endeavors to spread it by preaching. Hence it is said, And he went through the cities and villages.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Non enim sola parva loca visitabat, sicut faciunt qui simplices fallere volunt, neque solas civitates, ut ostentatores faciunt et gloriam quaerentes; sed sicut communis dominus et pater omnibus providens, omnia circuibat. Non autem visitabat municipia, vitans Ierusalem, ac si timeret legisperitorum reprehensiones, aut mortem, quae poterat inde contingere; unde subdit et iter faciens in Ierusalem. Nam ubi plures erant aegroti, ibi se medicus magis ingerebat. Sequitur ait autem quidam illi: domine, si pauci sunt qui salvantur?
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. For he did not visit the small places only, as they do who wish to deceive the simple, nor the cities only, as they who are fond of show, and seek their own glory; but as their common Lord and Father providing for all, He went about every where. Nor again did He visit the country towns only, avoiding Jerusalem, as if He feared the cavils of the lawyers, or death, which might follow therefrom; and hence he adds, And journeying towards Jerusalem. For where there were many sick, there the Physician chiefly showed Himself. It follows, Then said one to him, Lord, are there few that be saved?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Glossa</b>: Quae quidem quaestio ad hoc pertinere videtur de quo supra agebatur: nam in praemissa similitudine dixerat, quod requieverunt volucres caeli in ramis eius; per quod intelligi potest multos esse qui salutis requiem consequentur. Et quia ille unus pro omnibus quaesierat, dominus non singulariter ei respondet; unde sequitur ipse autem dixit ad illos: contendite intrare per angustam portam.
          <td><b>GLOSS</b>. This question seems to have reference to what had gone before. For in the parable which was given above, He had said, that the birds of the air rested on its branches, by which it might be supposed that there would be many who would obtain the rest of salvation. And because one had asked the question for all, the Lord does not answer him individually, as it follows, And he said to them, Strive to enter in at the strait gate.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Basilius</b>: Sicut enim in via terrena exitus a recto multam latitudinem habet; sic qui egreditur a tramite ducente ad regnum caelorum, in multa latitudine erroris reperitur. Rectum autem iter est angustum, qualibet declinatione periculosa existente, sive dextrorsum, sive sinistrorsum; sicut in ponte, a quo utrinque divertens flumini immergitur.
          <td><b>BASIL</b>; For as in earthly life the departure from right is exceeding broad, so he who goes out of the path which leads to the kingdom of heaven, finds himself in a vast extent of error. But the right way is narrow, the slightest turning aside being full of danger, whether to the right or to the left, as on a bridge, where he who slips on either side is thrown into the river.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Angusta etiam porta aerumnam et patientiam sanctorum significat. Sicut enim pugnarum victoria attestatur militis strenuitati, sic praeclarum efficiet valida perpessio laborum et tentationum.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; The narrow gate also represents the toils and sufferings of the saints. For as a victory in battle bears witness to the strength of the soldiers, so a courageous endurance of labors and temptations will make a man strong.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Matthaeum</b>: Quid est ergo quod dominus alibi dicit: iugum meum suave est, et onus meum leve? Non quidem contradicit; sed hoc dictum est propter tentationum naturam, illud vero propter affectum transeuntium. Est enim molestum aliquid naturae, facile reputari quando id affectanter amplectimur. Si etiam via salutis angusta erit in introitu, tamen per eam pervenitur ad latitudinem; e contrario vero lata deducit ad interitum.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. What then is that which our Lord says elsewhere, My yoke is easy, and my burden is light? There is indeed no contradiction, but the one was said because of the nature of temptations, the other with respect to the feeling of those who overcame them. For whatever is troublesome to our nature may be considered easy when we undertake it heartily. Besides also, though the way of salvation is narrow at its entrance, yet through it we come into a large space, but on the contrary the broad way leads to destruction.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius Moralium</b>: Dicturus autem angustae portae introitum, praemisit contendite: quia nisi mentis contentio ferveat, unda mundi non vincitur, per quam anima semper ad ima revocatur.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. Now when He was about to speak of the entrance of the narrow gate, He said first, strive, for unless the mind struggles manfully, the wave of the world is not overcome, by which the soul is ever thrown back again into the deep.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Non videtur autem dominus satisfacere quaerenti utrum pauci sint qui salventur, dum declarat viam per quam quisque potest fieri iustus. Sed dicendum, quod mos erat salvatoris non respondere interrogantibus secundum quod eis videbatur, quoties inutilia quaerebant, sed respiciendo quod utile audientibus foret. Quid autem commodi proveniret audientibus scire an multi sint qui salventur, an pauci? Necessarium autem magis erat scire modum quo aliquis pervenit ad salutem. Dispensative ergo ad quaestionis vaniloquium nihil dicit, sed transfert suum sermonem ad rem magis necessariam.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Now our Lord does not seem to satisfy him who asked whether there are few that be saved, when He declares the way by which man may become righteous. But it must be observed, that it was our Savior’s custom to answer those who asked Him, not according as they might judge light, as often as they put to Him useless questions, but with regard to what might be profitable to His hearers. And what advantage would it have been to His hearers to know whether there should be many or few who would be saved. But it was more necessary to know the way by which man may come to salvation. Purposely then He says nothing in answer to the idle question, but turns His discourse to a more important subject.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Verb. Dom</b>: Vel aliter. Confirmavit dominus quod audivit, scilicet quod pauci sunt qui salvantur, quia per angustam portam pauci intrant. Alio autem loco hoc idem ipse ait: arcta est via quae ducit ad vitam, et pauci sunt qui ingrediuntur per illam; unde subditur quia multi, dico vobis, quaerent intrare.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or else, our Lord confirmed the words He heard, that is, by saying that there are few who are saved for few enter by the strait gate, but in another place He says this very thing, Narrow is the way which leads to life, and few there are who enter into it. Therefore He adds, For many I say to you shall seek to enter;
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Salutis amore provocati; et non poterunt, itineris asperitate deterriti.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Urged thereto by their love of safety, yet shall not be able, frightened by the roughness of the road.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Basilius</b>: Vacillat enim anima, quando quidem considerat aeterna, eligendo virtutem: quando praesentia respicit, praeferendo illecebras: hic intuetur otia carnis, illic subiectionem ipsius; hic ebrietatem, illic sobrietatem; hic dissolutos risus, illic copiam lacrymarum; hic choreas, illic orationes; hic fistulas, illic fletus; hic luxuriam, illic castimoniam.
          <td><b>BASIL</b>; For the soul wavers to and fro, at one time choosing virtue when it considers eternity, at another preferring pleasures when it looks to the present. Here it beholds ease, or the delights of the flesh, there its subjection or captive bondage; here drunkenness, there sobriety; here wanton mirth, there overflowing of tears; here dancing, there praying; here the sound of the pipe, there weeping; here lust, there chastity.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Verb. Dom</b>: Non autem contrarius sibi est dominus, qui dixit, quod pauci sunt qui intrant per angustam portam; et alibi dicit: multi ab oriente et occidente venient. Pauci sunt in comparatione perditorum, multi in societate Angelorum. Vix videntur grana quando area trituratur; sed tanta massa processura est de area hac ut impleat horreum caeli.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Now our Lord in no wise contradicts Himself when He says, that there are few who enter in at the strait gate, and elsewhere, Many shall come from the east and the west; for there are few in comparison with those who are lost, many when united with the angels. Scarcely do they seem a grain when the threshing floor is swept, but so great a mass will come forth from this floor, that it will fill the granary of heaven.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Quod autem detestabiles sint qui intrare non possunt, per evidens exemplum declaravit, subdens cum autem intraverit paterfamilias, et clauserit ostium, incipietis foris stare, et pulsare ostium, dicentes: domine, aperi nobis. Sicut si patrefamilias, qui multos ad convivium vocavit, ingresso cum convivis, et ostio recluso, postmodum pulsantes adveniant.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; But that they who cannot enter are regarded with wrath, He has strewn by an obvious example, as follows, When once the master of the house has risen up, &amp;c. as if when the master of the house who has called many to the banquet has entered in with his guests, and shut to the door, then shall come afterwards men knocking.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Est autem paterfamilias Christus, qui cum ubique ex divinitate sit, illis iam intus esse dicitur quos in caelo praesens sua visione laetificat; sed quasi foris est his quos in hac peregrinatione certantes occultus adiuvat. Intrabit vero cum totam Ecclesiam ad sui contemplationem perducet; claudet ostium, cum reprobis locum poenitentiae tollet; qui foris stantes pulsabunt, idest a iustis segregati misericordiam quam contempserunt, frustra implorabunt; unde sequitur et respondens dicet vobis: nescio vos unde sitis.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; The master of the house is Christ, who since as very God He is every where, is already said to be within those whom though He is in heaven He gladdens with His visible presence, but is as it were without to those whom while contending in this pilgrimage, He helps in secret. But He will enter in when He shall bring the whole Church to the contemplation of Himself. He will shut the door when He shall take away from the reprobate all room for repentance. Who standing without will knock, that is, separated from the righteous will in vain implore that mercy which they have despised. Therefore it follows, And he will answer and say to you, I know you not whence you are.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius Moralium</b>: Nescire Dei improbare est; sicut et nescire mentiri vir verax dicitur qui labi per mendacium dedignatur: non quod, si mentiri velit, nesciat, sed quod falsa loqui veritatis amore contemnat. Veritatis igitur lumen tenebras, quas reprobat, ignorat. Sequitur tunc incipietis dicere: manducavimus coram te, et bibimus, et in plateis nostris docuisti.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. For God not to know is for Him to reject, as also a man who speaks the truth is said not to know how to lie, for he disdains to sin by telling a lie, not that if he wished to lie he knew not how, but that from love of truth he scorns to speak what is false. Therefore the light of truth knows not the darkness which it condemns. It follows, Then shall you begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in your presence, &amp;c.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Hoc Israelitis convenit, qui secundum ritum legis offerentes Deo victimas edebant et gaudebant. Audiebant quoque in synagogis libros Moysi, qui in suis scriptis non quae sua sunt, sed quae Dei tradebat.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; This refers to the Israelites, who, according to the practice of their law, when offering victims to God, eat and are merry. They heard also in the synagogues the books of Moses, who in his writings delivered not his own words, but the words of God.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Vel simpliciter ad Israelitas dicitur: eo quod ex eis Christus secundum carnem natus est, et cum eo comedebant et bibebant, et eum praedicantem audiebant. Sed et Christianis haec congruunt; nos enim comedimus corpus Christi et bibimus sanguinem eius quotidie, ad mensam mysticam accedentes, docetque in plateis animarum nostrarum.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Or it is said to the Israelites, simply because Christ was born of them according to the flesh, and they ate and drank with Him, and heard Him preaching. But these things also apply to Christians. For we eat the body of Christ and drink His blood as often as we approach the mystic table, and He teaches in the streets of our souls, which are open to receive Him.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Vel mystice manducat coram domino et bibit qui verbi pabulum avide suscipit; unde quasi exponendo subditur in plateis nostris docuisti. Scriptura enim in obscurioribus cibus est, quia quasi exponendo frangitur, et manducando glutitur; potus est in apertioribus, ubi ita sorbetur sicut invenitur. Non autem festivitatum epulatio iuvat quem fidei pietas non commendat; non scientia Scripturarum notum Deo facit quem operum iniquitas indignum ostendit; unde subditur et dicet vobis: nescio vos unde sitis. Discedite a me, operarii iniquitatis.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Or mystically, he eats and drinks in the Lord’s presence who eagerly receives the food of the word. Hence it is added for explanation, You have taught in our streets. For Scripture in its more obscure places is food, since by being expounded it is as it were broken and swallowed. In the clearer places it is drink, where it is taken down just as it is found. But at a feast the banquet does not delight him whom the piety of faith commends not. The knowledge of the Scriptures does not make him known to God, whom the iniquity of his works proves to be unworthy; as it follows, And he will say to you, I know not whence you are; depart from me.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Basilius</b>: Illis forsitan loquitur quos describit apostolus in propria persona, dicens: si linguis hominum loquar et Angelorum, et habeam omnem scientiam, et distribuero omnes facultates meas in cibos pauperum, caritatem autem non habuero, nihil mihi prodest. Quod enim non fit divini amoris intuitu, sed ad acquirendam ab hominibus laudem, non invenit laudem apud Deum.
          <td><b>BASIL</b>; He perhaps speaks to those whom the Apostle describes in his own person, saying, If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have all knowledge, and give all my goods to feed the poor, but have not charity, it profits me nothing. For whatever is done not from regard to the love of God, but to gain praise from men, obtains no praise from God.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Attende etiam quod detestabiles sunt illi in quorum plateis dominus docet: unde si docentem eum audierimus, non in plateis sed in angustiis, et humilibus cordibus, non erimus detestabiles.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Observe also that they are objects of wrath in whose street the Lord teaches. If then we have heard Him teaching not in the streets, but in poor and lowly hearts, we shall not be regarded with wrath.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Duplex autem ostenditur Gehennae poena; scilicet frigoris et fervoris; unde sequitur ibi erit fletus et stridor dentium: fletus enim de ardore, stridor dentium de frigore solet excitari. Vel stridor dentium prodit indignantis affectum, quod qui sero poenitet, sero sibi irascatur.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; But the twofold punishment of hell is here described, that is, the feeling cold and heat. For weeping is wont to be excited by heat, gnashing of teeth by cold. Or gnashing of teeth betrays the feeling of indignation, that he who repents too late, is too late angry with himself.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Glossa</b>: Vel stridebunt dentes qui hic de edacitate gaudebant, flebunt oculi qui hic per concupiscentias vagabantur. Per utrumque autem veram impiorum resurrectionem designat.
          <td><b>GLOSS</b>; Or the teeth will gnash which here delighted in eating, the eyes will weep which here wandered with desire. By each He represents the real resurrection of the wicked.

Et venient ab oriente et occidente, et ab Aquilone et Austro, et accumbent in regno Dei.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. This also refers to the Israelites with whom He was speaking, who receive from this their severest blow, that the Gentiles have rest with the fathers, while they themselves are shut out. Hence He adds, When you shall see Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of God, &amp;c.

          <td><b>EUSEBIUS</b>. For the Fathers above mentioned, before the times of the Law, forsaking the sins of many gods to follow the Gospel way, received the knowledge of the most high God; to whom many of the Gentiles were conformed through a similar manner of life, but their children suffered estrangement from the Gospel rules; and herein it follows, And behold they are last which shall be first, and they are first which shall be last.

For fear then of losing their office as rulers of the people, and lacking their gains, with pretended love for Him, they persuade Him to depart from hence, as it is said, The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying to him, Get you out and depart hence, for Herod will kill you: but Christ, who searches the heart and the reins, answers them meekly and under figure.

Hoc se promittit operaturum quod Iudaeis displicebat: scilicet quod immundis imperaret spiritibus, et eriperet a morbis infirmantes, usque dum propria sponte sustineret crucis patibulum.

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Or else the discourse seems to change here, and not to refer so much to the character of Herod as some think, as to the lies of the Pharisees. For He almost represents the Pharisees themselves to be standing near, when He said, Go tell this fox, as it is in the Greek. Therefore he commanded them to say that which might rouse the multitude of Pharisees. Behold, said He, I cast out devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and on the third day I shall be perfected. He promises to do what was displeasing to the Jews, namely, to command the evil spirits, and deliver the sick from disease, until in His own person He should undergo the suffering of the cross. But because the Pharisees thought that He who was the Lord of hosts, feared the hand of Herod. He refutes this, saying, Nevertheless I must walk today and tomorrow, and the day following. When He says must, He by no means implies a necessity imposed upon Him, but rather that He walked where He liked according to the inclination of His wild, until He should come to the end of the dreadful cross, the time of which Christ shows to be now drawing near, when He says, Today and tomorrow,

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. As if He says, What think you of My death? Behold, a little while, and it will come to pass. But by the words, Today and tomorrow, are signified many days; as we also are wont to say in common conversation, “Today and tomorrow such a thing takes place,” not that it happens in that interval of time. And to explain more clearly the words of the Gospel, you must not understand them to be, I must walk to day and to morrow, but place a stop after today and tomorrow, then add, and walk on the day following, as frequently in reckoning we are accustomed to say, “The Lord’s day and the day after, and on the third I will go out,” as if by reckoning two, to denote the third. So also our Lord speaks as if calculating, I must do so to day, and so to morrow, and then afterward on the third day I must go to Jerusalem.

Cum audis non capit, idest non decet extra Ierusalem prophetam interimi, non putes vim coactivam Iudaeis inductam, sed quantum ad eorum affectum sanguinis avidum convenienter hoc dicit; velut si quis praedonem atrocissimum videns dicat: non oportet hanc viam, in qua praedo insidiatur viatoribus, immunem esse a sanguine: sic et non oportebat alibi quam ubi morabantur praedones perire dominum prophetarum: nam assueti prophetarum sanguinibus occident et dominum; unde sequitur Ierusalem, Ierusalem, quae occidis prophetas, et lapidas eos qui mittuntur ad te.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. But because they said to Him, Depart from hence, for Herod seeks to kill you, speaking in Galilee where Herod reigned, He shows that not in Galilee, but in Jerusalem it had been fore-ordained that He should suffer. Hence it follows, For it can not be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem. When you hear, It can not be (or it is not fitting) that a prophet should perish out of Jerusalem, think not that any violent constraint was imposed upon the Jews, but He says this seasonably with reference to their eager desire after blood; just as if any one seeing a most savage robber, should say, the road on which this robber lurks can not be without bloodshed to travelers. So also no where else but in the abode of robbers must the Lord of the prophets perish. For accustomed to the blood of His prophets, they will also kill the Lord; as it follows, O Jerusalem, which kills the prophets.

Itaque hydropico veniente in medium, interrogatione reprehendit insolentiam Pharisaeorum, eum arguere volentium; unde dicitur et ecce homo quidam hydropicus erat ante illum.

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Although our Lord knew the malice of the Pharisees, yet He became their guest, that He might benefit by His words and miracles those who were present.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; By a suitable example then He settles the question, strewing that they violate the sabbath by a work of covetousness, who contend that he does so by, a work of charity. Hence it follows, And they could not answer him again to these things. Mystically, the dropsical man is compared to him who is weighed down by an overflowing stream of carnal pleasures. For the disease of dropsy derives the name of a watery humor.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or we rightly compare the dropsical man to a covetous rich man. For as the former, the more he increases in unnatural moisture the greater his thirst; so also the other, the more abundant his riches, which he does not employ well, the more ardently he desires them.

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; For to rush forward hastily to honors which are not fitting for us, indicates rashness. and casts a slur upon our actions. Hence it follows, lest a more honorable man than you be invited, &amp;c.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Et sic quod concupivit, nequaquam obtinuit ambitiosus honoris, sed passus est repulsam; et satagens qualiter abundet honoribus, non honoratur. Et quia nihil est aequipollens modestiae, auditorem ad oppositum ducit.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. And so the seeker of honor obtained not that which he coveted, but suffered a defeat, and busying himself how he might be loaded with honors, is treated with dishonor. And because nothing is of so much worth as modesty, He leads His hearer to the opposite of this; not only for- him to seek the highest place, but bidding him search for the lowest. As it follows; But when you are bidden go and sit down in the lowest room.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Si enim aliquis non vult aliis praelocari, nanciscitur hoc ex divina sententia; unde sequitur ut cum venerit qui te invitavit, dicat tibi: amice, ascende superius. Haec dicens, non graviter obiurgat, sed leniter iniungit: sufficit enim monitio apud discretos; et sic pro humilitate aliquis coronatur honore; unde sequitur tunc erit tibi gloria coram simul discumbentibus.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; For if a man wishes not to be set before others, he obtains this honor according to the divine word. As it follows; That when he that bade you comes, he may say to you, Friend, go up higher. In these words He does not harshly chide, but gently admonishes; for a word of advice is enough for the wise. And thus for their humility men are crowned with honors; as it follows, Then shall you have worship.

          <td><b>Basilius</b>: Occupare igitur locum ultimum in conviviis, iuxta mandatum dominicum, conveniens est, sed rursum in hunc contentiose irruere reprobatum tamquam interemptorium ordinis et causativum tumultus: et de eo mota contentio aequiparabit vos litigantibus de primatu. Quapropter, sicut hic dominus dicit, expedit convivium facienti committere accubitus ordinem. Sic et in patientia nos mutuo sustinebimus honeste, et secundum ordinem omnia prosequentes, non ad apparentiam plurium; nec videbimur humilitatem pertractare per vehementem contradictionem; magis autem humilitatem per patientiam obtineremus: maius est enim ex repugnantia superbiae indicium quam ex primo accubitu, quando eum cum imperio obtinemus.
          <td><b>BASIL</b>; To take then the lowest place at a feast, according to our Lord’s command, is becoming to every man, but again to rush contentiously after this is to be condemned as a breach of order and cause of tumult; and a strife raised about it, will place you on a level with those who dispute concerning the highest place. Wherefore, as our Lord here says, it becomes him who makes the feast to arrange the order of sitting down. Thus in patience and love should we mutually bear ourselves, following all things decently according to order, not for external appearance or public display; nor should we seem to study or affect humility by violent contradiction, but rather gain it by condescension or by patience. For resistance or opposition is a far stronger token of pride than taking the first seat at meat, when we obtain it by authority.

Porro quomodo parva passio vanae gloriae, quae versabat primos perquirentes accubitus? Decebat igitur humilitatis magistrum omnem ramum pravae radicis amputare. Sed et illud considera, quia praesto coena, et passione primatus coram salvatore vexante miseros, opportunitatem habebat monitio.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Now let no one deem the above precepts of Christ to be trifling, and unworthy of the sublimity and grandeur of the Word of God. For you would not call him a merciful physician who professed to heal the gout, but refilled to cure a scar on the finger or a tooth-ache. Besides, how can that passion of vainglory appear slight, which moved or agitated those who sought the first seats. It became then the Master of humility to cut off every branch of the bad root. But observe this also, that when the supper was ready, and the wretched guests were contending for precedency before the eyes of the Savior, there was a fit occasion for advice.

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Having shown therefore from so slight an example the degradation of the ambitious and the exaltation of the humble-minded, He adds a great thing to a little, pronouncing a general sentence, as it follows, For every one who exalts himself shall be abased, and he that humbles himself shall be exalted. This is spoken according to the divine judgment, not after human experience, in which they who desire after glory obtain it, while others who humble themselves remain inglorious.

          <td><b>Beda</b>: Sed quoniam hanc admonitionem Evangelista parabolam vocat, breviter intuendum quid mystice significet. Quisquis nuptias Christi et Ecclesiae invitatus adierit, membris Ecclesiae per fidem coniunctus, non se extollat, quasi sublimior ceteris, de meritis gloriando: dabit enim locum honoratiori post invitato, cum illorum qui se in Christo secuti sunt agilitate praeitur, et cum rubore novissimum locum tenet, quando de aliis meliora cognoscens, quicquid de sua operatione celsum sentiebat humiliat. Sed recumbit aliquis in novissimo loco, secundum illud: quanto magnus es, humilia te in omnibus. Veniens autem dominus, quem humilem invenerit, amici nomine beatificans, ascendere superius praecipiet: quicumque enim humiliaverit se sicut parvulus, hic est maior in regno caelorum. Pulchre autem dicitur tunc erit tibi gloria, ne nunc quaerere incipias quod tibi servatur in fine. Potest etiam et hoc in hac vita intelligi; quia quotidie dominus suas nuptias intrat, superbos despiciens, et humilibus saepe tanta sui spiritus dona praestans, ut discumbentium, idest fidelium, coetus, eos admirando glorificet. Ex conclusione vero generali, quae subditur, manifeste claret praecedentem domini sermonem typice intelligendum. Neque enim omnis qui se coram hominibus exaltat, humiliatur; aut qui se in conspectu hominum humiliat, exaltatur ab eis: sed qui se de meritis elevat, humiliabitur a domino; et qui se de beneficiis humiliat, exaltabitur ab eo.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; But as the Evangelist calls this admonition a parable, we must briefly examine what is its mystical meaning. Whosoever being bidden has come to the marriage feast of Christ’s Church, being united to the members of the Church by faith, let him not exalt himself as higher than others by boasting of his merits. For he will have to give place to one more honorable who is bidden afterwards, seeing that he is overtaken by the activity of those who followed him, and with shame he occupies the lowest place, now that knowing better things of the others he brings low whatever high thoughts he once had of his own works. But a man sits in the lowest place according to that verse, The greater you are, humble yourself in all things. But the Lord when He comes, whomsoever He shall find humble, blessing him with the name of friend, He will command him to go up higher. For whoever humbles himself as a little child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. But it is well said, Then shall you have glory, that you may not begin to seek now what is kept for you in the end. It may also be understood, even in this life, for daily does God come to His marriage feast, despising the proud; and often giving to the humble such great gifts of His Spirit, that the assembly of those who sit at meat, i.e. the faithful, glorify them in wonder. But in the general conclusion which is added, it is plainly declared that the preceding discourse of our Lord must be understood typically. For not every one who exalts himself before men is abased; nor is he who humbles himself in their sight, exalted by them. But whoever exalts himself because of his merits, the Lord shall bring low, and him who humbles himself on account of his mercies, shall He exalt.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Many are the sources from which friendships are made. Leaving out all unlawful ones, we shall speak only of those which are natural and moral; the natural are, for instance, between father and son, brother and brother, and such like; which He meant, saying, Nor your brethren, nor your kinsmen; the moral, when a man has become your guest or neighbor; and with reference to these He says, nor your neighbors.

Non ait: et fiet tibi peccatum. Cui simile est id quod alibi dicit: et si bene feceritis his qui vobis bene faciunt, quae vobis est gratia? Sunt tamen quaedam mutua fratrum vicinorumque convivia, quae non solum in praesenti retributionem, sed et damnationem percipiunt in futuro; quae aut collatione omnium celebrantur; aut vicibus solent a contubernalibus exhiberi: in quibus ad hoc convenitur ut foeda gerantur, et ex copia incitetur libidinis diversa voluptas.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Brothers then, and friends, and the rich, are not forbidden, as though it were a crime to entertain one another, but this, like all the other necessary intercourse among men, is strewn to fail in meriting the reward of everlasting life; as it follows, Lest perchance they also bid you again, and a recompense be made you. He says not, “and sin be committed against you.” And the like to this He speaks in another place, And if you do good to those who do good to you, what thank have you? There are however certain mutual feastings of brothers and neighbors, which not only incur a retribution in this life, but also condemnation hereafter. And these are celebrated by the general gathering together of all, or the hospitality in turn of each one of the company; and they meet together that they may perpetrate foul deeds, and through excess of wine be provoked to all kinds of lustful pleasure.

            <p><b>CHRYS</b>. For the humbler our brother is, so much c the more does Christ come through him and visit us. For he who entertains a great man does it often from vainglory. And elsewhere, But very often interest is his object, that through such a one he may gain promotion. I could indeed mention many who for this pay court to the most distinguished of the nobles, that through their assistance they may obtain the greater favor from the prince. Let us not then ask those who can recompense us, as it follows, And you shall be blessed, for they cannot recompense you. And let us not be troubled when we receive no return of a kindness, but when we do; for if we have received it we shall receive nothing more, but if man does not repay us, God will.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; And though all rise again, yet it is called the resurrection of the just, because in the resurrection they doubt not that they are blessed. Whoever then bids the poor to his feast shall receive a reward hereafter. But he who invites his friends, brothers, and the rich, has received his reward.

For the oxen till the ground, but men at a distance from faith, given up to earthly things, refuse to believe in any thing, but what they arrive at by means of the five-fold sense of the body. “I believe nothing but what I see.” If such were our thoughts, we should be hindered from the supper by those five yoke of oxen.

Quasi enim per odium diligitur qui carnaliter sapiens, dum prava nobis ingerit, non auditur.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. But it may be asked, how are we bid to hate our parents and our relations in the flesh, who are commanded to love even our enemies? But if we weigh the force of the command we are able to do both, by rightly distinguishing them so as both to love those who are united to us by the bond of the flesh, and whom we acknowledge our relations, and by hating and avoiding not to know those whom we find our enemies in the way of God. For he is as it were loved by hatred, who in his carnal wisdom, pouring into our ears his evil sayings, is not heard.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; For if for your sake the Lord renounces His own mother, saying, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren? why do you deserve to be preferred to your Lord?

          <td><b>GREG</b>. Now to show that this hatred towards relations proceeds not from inclination or passion, but from love, our Lord adds, yes, and his own life also. It is plain therefore that a man ought to hate his neighbor, by loving as himself him who hated him. For then we rightly hate our own soul when we indulge not its carnal desires, when we subdue its appetites, and wrestle against its pleasures.

          <td><b>GREG</b>. Or because the cross is so called from torturing. In two ways we bear our Lord’s cross, either when by abstinence we afflict our bodies, or when through compassion of our neighbor we think all his necessities our own. But because some exercise abstinence of the flesh not for God’s sake but for vain-glory, and show compassion, not spiritually but carnally, it is rightly added, And comes after me. For to bear His cross and come after the Lord, is to use abstinence of the flesh, or compassion to our neighbor, from the desire of an eternal gain.

The cost therefore of building the tower, and the strength of the ten thousand against the king who has twenty thousand, mean nothing else than that each one should forsake all that he has. The foregoing introduction tallies then with the final conclusion. For in the saying that a man forsakes all that he has, is contained also that he hates his father and mother, his wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes and his own wife also. For all these things are a man’s own, which entangle him, and hinder him from obtaining not those particular possessions which will pass away with time, but those common blessings which will abide for ever.

          <td><b>BASIL</b>; But our Lord’s intention in the above-mentioned example is not indeed to afford occasion or give liberty to any one to become His disciple or not, as indeed it is lawful not to begin a foundation, or not to treat of peace, but to show the impossibility of pleasing God, amidst those things which distract the soul, and in which it is in danger of becoming an easy prey to the snares and wiles of the devil.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; But there is a difference between renouncing all things and leaving all things.

Fitly then He compares His disciples to salt, inasmuch as they are regenerated by water and the Spirit; and as living altogether spiritually and not according to the flesh, they after the manner of salt change the corrupt life of men who live on the earth, and by their own virtuous lives delight and season their followers.

          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Non solum autem eos qui donati sunt magistrali gratia, sed etiam idiotas exposcit ad modum salis fieri utiles proximis. Si vero qui futurus est utilis aliis, fiat reprobus, iuvari non poterit; unde sequitur si autem sal evanuerit, in quo condietur?
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. But not only those who are gifted with the grace of teachers, but private individuals also He requires to become like salt, useful to those around them. But if’ he who is to be useful to others becomes reprobate, he cannot be profited, as it follows, But if the salt has lost his savor, wherewith shall it be seasoned?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Quasi dicat: si quis semel condimento veritatis illuminatus ad apostasiam redierit, quo alio doctore corrigetur? Qui scilicet eam quam ipse gustavit sapientiae dulcedinem, vel adversis saeculi perterritus, vel illecebris illectus abiecit; unde sequitur neque in terram, neque in sterquilinium utile est; sed foras mittetur. Sal enim cum ad condiendos cibos carnesque siccandas valere desierit, nulli iam usui aptum erit: neque enim in terram utile est, cuius iniectu germinare prohibetur, neque in sterquilinium agriculturae profuturum: sic qui post agnitionem veritatis retrocedit, neque ipse fructum boni operis ferre, nec alios excolere valet; sed foras mittendus est, hoc est ab Ecclesiae unitate secernendus.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; As if He says, “If a man who has once been enlightened by the seasoning of truth, falls back into apostasy, by what other teacher shall he be corrected, seeing that the sweetness of wisdom which he tasted he has cast away, alarmed by the troubles or allured by the attractions of the world; hence it follows, It is neither fit for the land, nor yet to the dunghill, &amp;c. For salt when it has ceased to be fit for seasoning food and drying flesh, will be good for nothing. For neither is it useful to the land, which when it is cast thereon is hindered from bearing, nor for the dunghill to benefit the dressing of the land. So he who after knowledge of the truth falls back, is neither able to bring forth the fruit of good works himself, nor to instruct others; but he must be cast out of doors, that is, must be separated from the unity of the Church.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Verum, quia sermo parabolicus et obscurus erat, excitans dominus auditores, ne qualitercumque acciperent quod dictum est de sale, subdit qui habet aures audiendi, audiat; hoc est, si cui sapientia inest, intelligat: aures enim hic cognoscitivam vim animae et aptitudinem intelligendi accipere debemus.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. But because His discourse was in parables and dark sayings, our Lord, in order to rouse His hearers that they might not receive indifferently what was said of the salt, adds, He that has ears to hear, let him hear, that is, as he has wisdom let him understand. For we must take the ears here as the perceptive power of the mind and capacity of understanding.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Audiat etiam non contemnendo, sed obediendo, et faciendo quae dicit.

          <td><b>Gregorius in Evang</b>: Ex qua re colligitur quia vera iustitia compassionem habet, falsa dedignationem; quamvis et iusti soleant recte peccatoribus indignari. Sed aliud est quod agitur typo superbiae, aliud quod zelo disciplinae: quia iusti, etsi foris increpationes per disciplinam exaggerant, intus tamen dulcedinem per caritatem servant: praeponunt sibi in animo ipsos plerumque quos corrigunt: quod agentes per disciplinam subditos, et per humilitatem custodiunt semetipsos. At contra hi qui de falsa iustitia superbire solent, ceteros quosque despiciunt, nulla infirmantibus misericordia condescendunt; et quo se peccatores esse non credunt, eo deterius peccatores fiunt: de quorum numero Pharisaei erant, qui diiudicantes dominum quod peccatores susciperet, arenti corde ipsum fontem misericordiae reprehendebant.

          <td><b>GREG</b>, From which we may gather, that true justice feels compassion, false justice scorn, although the just are wont rightly to repel sinners. But there is one act proceeding from the swelling of pride, another from the zeal for discipline. For the just, though without they spare not rebukes for the sake of discipline, within cherish sweetness from charity. In their own minds they set above themselves those whom they correct, whereby they keep both them under by discipline, and themselves by humility. But, on the contrary, they who from false justice are wont to pride themselves, despise all others, and never in mercy condescend to the weak; and thinking themselves not to be sinners, are so much the worse sinners. Of such were the Pharisees, who condemning our Lord because He received sinners, with parched hearts reviled the very fountain of mercy. But because they were so sick that they knew not of their sickness, to the end that they might know what they were, the heavenly Physician answers them with mild applications. For it follows, And he spoke this parable to them, saying What man of you having a hundred sheep, and if he lose one of them, does not go after it, &amp;c. He gave a comparison which man might recognize in himself; though it referred to the Creator of men. For since a hundred is a perfect number, He Himself had a hundred sheep, seeing that He possessed the nature of the holy angels and men. Hence he adds, Having a hundred sheep.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Hinc percipe latitudinem regni salvatoris nostri.

Sed ex his una oberravit, scilicet genus humanum, quod terram colit.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; We may hence understand the extent of our Savior’s kingdom. For He says there are a hundred sheep, bringing to a perfect sum the number of rational creatures subject to Him. For the number hundred is perfect, being composed of ten decades.

Quia scilicet Angelorum choros reliquit in caelo. Tunc autem homo caelum deseruit, cum peccavit. Et ut perfecta summa ovium integraretur in caelo, homo perditus quaerebatur in terra; unde sequitur et vadit ad illam quae perierat, donec inveniat illam.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. One sheep then perished when man by sinning left the pastures of life. But in the wilderness the ninety and nine remained, because the number of the rational creatures, that is to say of Angels and men who were formed to see God, was lessened when man perished; and hence it follows, Does he not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, because in truth he left the companies of the Angels in heaven. But man then forsook heaven when he sinned. And that the whole body of the sheep might be perfectly made up again in heaven, the lost man was sought for on earth; as it follows, And go after that &amp;c.

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; But was He then angry with the rest, and moved by kindness only to one? By no means. For they are in safety, the right hand of the Most Mighty being their defense. It behoved Him rather to pity the perishing, that the remaining number might not seem imperfect. For the one being brought back, the hundred regains its own proper form.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or He spoke of those ninety and nine whom He left in the wilderness, signifying the proud, who bear solitude as it were in their mind, in that they wish to appear themselves alone, to whom unity is wanting for perfection. For when a man is torn from unity, it is by pride; since desiring to be his own master, he follows not that One which is God, but to that One God ordains all who are reconciled by repentance, which is obtained by humility.

          <td><b>Gregorius Nyssenus</b>: Cum autem pastor invenisset ovem, non punivit: non duxit ad gregem urgendo; sed superponens humero, et portans, clementer annumeravit gregi; unde sequitur et cum invenerit ovem, imponit in humeros suos gaudens.
          <td><b>GREG NYSS</b>. But when the shepherd had found the sheep, he did not punish it, he did not get it to the flock by driving it, but by placing it upon his shoulder, and carrying it gently, he united it to his flock. Hence it follows, And when he has found it, he lays it upon his shoulders rejoicing.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius</b>: Ovem humeris suis imposuit, quia humanam naturam suscipiens, peccata nostra ipse portavit.

Amicos et vicinos vocat Angelorum choros; quia amici eius sunt, quia voluntatem eius continue in sua stabilitate custodiunt; vicini quoque eius sunt, quia claritatem visionis illius sua assiduitate perfruuntur.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. He placed the sheep upon his shoulders, for taking man’s nature upon Him he bore our sins. But having found the sheep, he returns home; for our Shepherd having restored man, returns to his heavenly kingdom. And hence it follows, And coming he collects together his friends and neighbors, saying to them, Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost. By his friends and neighbors He means the companies of Angels, who are His friends because they are keeping His will in their own steadfastness; they are also His neighbors, because by their own constant waiting upon Him they enjoy the brightness of His sight.

          <td><b>Gregorius</b>: Et notandum, quod non dicit congratulamini inventae ovi, sed mihi: quia videlicet eius est gaudium vita nostra; et cum nos ad caelum reducimur, solemnitatem laetitiae illius implemus.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. And we must observe that He says not, “Rejoice with the sheep that is found,” but with me, because truly our life is His joy, and when we are brought home to heaven we fill up the festivity of His joy.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Angeli autem, quoniam sunt rationales, non immerito hominum redemptione laetantur; unde sequitur dico vobis, quod ita gaudium erit in caelo super uno peccatore poenitentiam agente, quam supra nonaginta novem iustis, qui non indigent poenitentia. Hoc proficiat ad incentiva probitatis, si unusquisque conversionem suam gratam fore credat coetibus Angelorum, quorum aut affectare patrocinium, aut vereri debet offensam.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Now the angels, inasmuch as they are intelligent beings, do not unreasonably rejoice at the redemption of men, as it follows, I say to you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repents, more than over ninety and nine just persons who need no repentance. Let this serve as an incentive to goodness, for a man to believe that his conversion will be pleasing to the assembled angels, whose favor he ought to court, or whose displeasure to fear.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius</b>: Plus autem de conversis peccatoribus quam de stantibus iustis in caelo gaudium esse fatetur; quia plerumque hi qui nullis se oppressos peccatorum molibus sciunt, stant quidem in via iustitiae, sed tamen ad caelestem patriam anxie non anhelant, et plerumque pigri remanent ad exercenda bona praecipua, quia securi sibi sunt quod nulla commiserint mala graviora: at contra nonnunquam hi qui se aliqua illicita egisse meminerunt, ex ipso suo dolore compuncti, ad amorem Dei inardescunt, et quia errasse se a Deo considerant, damna praecedentia lucris sequentibus recompensant. Maius ergo gaudium fit in caelo, quia et dux in praelio plus eum militem diligit qui post fugam reversus hostem fortiter premit, quam eum qui numquam terga praebuit, et numquam aliquid fortiter fecit. Sic agricola illam amplius terram amat quae post spinas uberes fructus profert, quam eam quae numquam spinas habuit, et numquam fertilem messem producit. Sed inter haec sciendum est, quia sunt plerique iusti, in quorum vita tantum est gaudium, ut eis quaelibet peccatorum poenitentia praeponi nullatenus possit. Hinc ergo colligendum quantum Deo gaudium faciat quando humiliter plangit iustus, si facit in caelo gaudium quando hoc quod male gessit, per poenitentiam damnat iniustus.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. But he allows there is more joy in heaven over the converted sinner, than over the just who remain steadfast; for the latter for the most part, not feeling themselves oppressed by the weight of their sins, stand indeed in the way of righteousness, but still do not anxiously sigh after the heavenly country, frequently being slow to perform good works, from their confidence in themselves that they have committed no grievous sins. But, on the other hand, sometimes those who remember certain iniquities that they have committed, being pricked to the heart, from their very grief grow inflamed towards the love of God; and because they consider they have wandered from God, make up for their former losses by the succeeding gains. Greater then is the joy in heaven, just as the leader in battle loves that soldier more who having turned from flight, bravely pursues the enemy, than him who never turned his back and never did a brave act. So the husbandman rather loves that land which after bearing thorns yields abundant fruit, than that which never had thorns, and never gave him a plentiful crop. But in the mean time we must be aware that there are v very many just men in whose life there is so much joy, that no penitence of sinners however great can in any way be preferred to them. Whence we may gather what great joy it causes to God when the just man humbly mourns, if it produces joy in heaven when the unrighteous by his repentance condemns the evil that he has done.

By the preceding parable, in which the race of mankind was spoken of as a wandering sheep, we were shown to be the creatures of the most high God, who has made us, and not we ourselves, and we are the sheep of his pasture. But now is added a second parable, in which the race of man is compared to a piece of silver which was lost, by which he shows that we were made according to the royal likeness and image, that is to say, of the most high God. For the piece of silver is a coin having the impress of the king’s image, as it is said, Or what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one, &amp;c.

For it is God Himself, God and the wisdom of God, but the Lord has formed the nature of angels and men to know Him, and has created them after His likeness.

For the candle is a light in an earthen vessel, but the light in an earthen vessel is the Godhead in the flesh. But the candle being lit, it follows, And disturbs the house. Because verily no sooner had his Divinity shone forth through the flesh, than all our consciences were appalled. Which word of disturbance differs not from that which is read in other manuscripts, sweeps, because the corrupt mind if it be not first overthrown through fear, is not cleansed from its habitual faults. But when the house is broken up, the piece of silver is found, for it follows, And seeks diligently till she find it; for truly when the conscience of man is disturbed, the likeness of the Creator is restored in man.

Vel forsan poenitentiae lampadem, sed in domo propria, idest in seipso et in sua conscientia, oportet perquirere drachmam perditam, idest regis imaginem, quae non penitus deperiit, sed est tecta sub fimo, qui significat carnis contagia; quibus studiose abstersis, idest dilutis per solertiam vitae, elucescit quod quaeritur: unde oportet ipsam quae invenit gratulari; necnon ad participia gaudii vocare vicinas, idest contubernales virtutes, idest rationabilem et concupiscibilem et innatum iracundiae affectum, et si quae sint tales vires circa animam consideratae, quas docet gaudere in domino.

          <td><b>GREG NYSS</b>. Or else; this I suppose is what our Lord sets before us in the search after the lost piece of silver, that no advantage attaches to us from the external virtues which He calls pieces of silver, although all of them be ours, as long as that one is lacking to the widowed soul, by which in truth it obtains the brightness of the Divine image. Wherefore He first bids us light a candle, that is to say, the divine word which brings hidden things to light, or perhaps the torch of repentance. But in his own house, that is, in himself and his own conscience, must a man seer; for the lost piece of silver, that is, the royal image, which is not entirely defaced, but is hid under the dirt, which signifies its corruption of the flesh, and this being diligently wiped away, that is, washed out by a well-spent life, that which was sought for shines forth. Therefore ought she who has found it to rejoice, and to call to partake of her joy the neighbors, (that is, the companion virtues,) reason, desire, and anger, and whatever powers are observed round the soul, which she teaches to rejoice in the Lord. Then concluding the parable, He adds, There is joy in the presence of the angels over one sinner that repents.

Cogitandum est etiam ut per hoc conditori suo satisfaciat: ut qui commisit prohibita, sibi abscindere debeat etiam concessa; et se reprehendat in minimis qui se meminit in maximis deliquisse.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. To work repentance is to mourn over past sins, and not to commit things to be mourned over. For he who weeps over some things so as yet to commit others, still knows not how to work repentance, or is a hypocrite; he must also reflect that by so doing he satisfies not his Creator, since he who had done what was forbidden, must cut off himself even from what is lawful, and so should blame himself in the least things who remembers that he has offended in the greatest.

Praesens ergo parabola proponitur cum dicitur ait autem: homo quidam habuit duos filios. Sunt qui dicant de duobus filiis istis seniorem Angelos esse, iuniorem vero hominem ponunt, qui in longinquam peregrinationem abierit, quando in terram de caelis et Paradiso cecidit: et aptant consequentia, respicientes ad casum vel statum Adae. Sed hic sensus pius quidem videtur, nescio tamen si verus sit: quia iunior filius ad poenitentiam venit sua sponte, recordatus praeteritae abundantiae patris sui; dominus autem veniens ad poenitentiam vocavit humanum genus, dum sponte sua regredi, unde ceciderat, non cogitaret. Deinde senior filius in reditu et salute fratris sui tristatur; cum dominus dicat laetitiam esse apud Angelos super uno peccatore poenitentiam agente.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. There is also in the above-mentioned parable a rule of distinction with reference to the characters or dispositions of the sinners. The father receives his penitent son, exercising the freedom of his will, so as to know from whence he had fallen; and the shepherd seeks for the sheep that wanders and knows not how to return, and carries it on his shoulders, comparing to an irrational animal the foolish man, who, taken by another’s guile, had wandered like a sheep. This parable is then set forth as follows; But he said, A certain man had two sons. There are some who say of these two sons, that the elder is the angels, but the younger, man, who departed on a long journey, when he fell from heaven and paradise to earth; and they adapt what follows with reference to the fall or condition of Adam. This interpretation seems indeed a lenient one, but I know not if it be true. For the younger son came to repentance of his own accord, remembering the past plenty of his father’s house, but the Lord coming called the race of man to repentance, because he saw that to return of their own accord to whence they had fallen had never been in their thoughts; and the elder son is vexed at the return and safety of his brother, whereas the Lord says, There is joy in heaven over one sinner repenting.

Ab ipso ergo exordio creaturae mortalium, maior filius ad cultum unius Dei pertinet, minor autem petit ut sibi pars substantiae quae eum tangeret, daretur a patre; unde sequitur et dixit adolescentior ex illis patri: pater, da mihi portionem substantiae quae me contingit; tamquam anima potestate sua delectata, id quod illi est vivere, intelligere, meminisse, vel ingenio alacri excellere, petit, quae divina sunt munera. Haec autem in potestate sua accepit per liberum arbitrium; unde sequitur et divisit illis substantiam.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. This man then having two sons is understood to be God having two nations, as if they were two roots of the human race; and the one composed of those who have remained in the worship of God, the other, of those who have ever deserted God to worship idols. From the very beginning then of the creation of mankind the elder son has reference to the worship of the one God, but the younger seeks that the part of the substance which fell to him should be given him by his father. Hence it follows, And the younger of them said to his father, Give me the portion of goods which falls to me; just as the soul delighted with its own power seeks that which belongs to it, to live, to understand, to remember, to excel in quickness of intellect, all which are the gifts of God, but it has received them in its own power by free will.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Now you see that the Divine patrimony is given to them that seek; nor think it wrong in the father that he gave it to the younger, for no age is weak in the kingdom of God; faith is not weighed down by years. He at least counted himself sufficient who asked, And I wish he had not departed from his father, nor had the hindrance of age.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. But that which is said to have taken place not many days after, namely, that gathering all together he set out abroad into a far country, which is forgetfulness of God, signifies that not long after the institution of the human race, the soul of man chose of its free will to take with it a certain power of its nature, and to desert Him by whom it was created, trusting in its own strength, which it wastes the more rapidly as it has abandoned Him who gave it. Hence it follows, And there wasted his substance in riotous living. But he calls a riotous or prodigal life one that loves to spend and lavish itself with outward show, while exhausting itself within, since every one follows those things which pass on to something else, and forsakes Him who is closest to himself. As it follows, And when he had spent all, there arose a great famine in that land. The famine is the want of the word of truth. It follows, And he began to be in want.

This then is the meaning of the parable. The Pharisees and Scribes reproved Him because He received sinners; He set forth the parable in which He calls God the man who is the father of the two sons, (that is, the righteous and the sinners,) of whom the first degree is of the righteous who follow righteousness from the beginning, the second is of those men who are brought back by repentance to righteousness.

Now the Scripture says, that the father divided equally between his two sons his substance, that is, the knowledge of good and evil, which is a true and everlasting possession to the soul that uses it well. The substance of reason which flows from God to men at their earliest birth, is given equally to all who come into this world, but after the intercourse that follows, each one is found to possess more or less of the substance; since one believing that which he has received to be from his father, preserves it as his patrimony, another abuses it as something that may be wasted away, by the liberty of his own possession. But the freedom of will is shown in that the father neither kept back the son who wished to depart, nor forced the other to go that desired to remain, lest he should seem rather the author of the evil that followed. But the youngest son went afar off, not by changing his place, but by turning aside his heart. Hence it follows, He took a journey into a far country.

But whence could he know this who had that great forgetfulness of God, which exists in all idolaters, unless it was the reflection of one returning to his right understanding, when the Gospel was preached. Already might such a soul see that many preach the truth, among whom there were some not led by the love of the truth itself, but the desire of getting worldly profit, who yet do not preach another Gospel like the heretics. Therefore are they rightly called mercenaries. For in the same house there are men who handle the same bread of the word, yet are not called to an eternal inheritance, but hire themselves for a temporal reward.

Sed si Deus novit omnia, vocem tamen tuae confessionis expectat: ore enim confessio fit ad salutem quia alleviat pondus erroris quisquis ipse se onerat; et accusationis excludit invidiam qui accusatorem praevenit confitendo. Frustra velis occultare quem nihil fallit, et sine periculo prodas quod scias esse iam cognitum: confitere magis ut interveniat pro te Christus, roget pro te Ecclesia, illacrymet populus; nec verearis ne non impetres.

I have sinned; this is the first confession of sin to the Author of nature, the Ruler of mercy, the Judge of faith. But though God knows all things, He yet waits for the voice of your confession. For with the mouth confession is made to salvation, since he lightens the load of error, who himself throws the weight upon himself, and shuts out the hatred of accusation, who anticipates the accuser by confessing. In vain would you hide from Him whom nothing escapes; and you may safely discover what you know to be already known. Confess the rather that Christ may intercede for thee, the Church plead for you, the people weep over you: nor fear that you will not obtain; your Advocate promises pardon, your Patron favor, your Deliverer promises you the reconciliation of your Father’s affection.

Let us do likewise, and not be wearied with the length of the way, for if we are willing, the return will become swift and easy, provided that we desert sin, which led us out from our father’s house.

I had rather then be a son than a sheep. For the sheep is found by the shepherd, the son is honored by the father.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or running he fell upon his neck; because the Father abandoned not His Only-Begotten Son, in whom He has ever been running after our distant wanderings. For God, was in Christ reconciling the world to himself. But to fall upon his neck is to lower to his embrace His own Arm, which is the Lord Jesus Christ. But to be comforted by the word of God’s grace to the hope of pardon of our sins, this is to return after a long journey to obtain from a father the kiss of love. But already planted in the Church, he begins to confess his sins, nor says be all that he promised he would say. For it follows, And his son said to him, &amp;c. He wishes that to be done by grace, of which he confesses himself unworthy by any merits of his own. He does not add what he had said, when meditating beforehand, Make me as one of your hired servants. For when he had not bread, he desired to be even a hired servant, which after the kiss of his father he now most nobly disdained.

          <td><b>Beda</b>: Idest in operatione, ut per opera fides clarescat, et per fidem opera confirmentur.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; That is, his working, that by works faith may shine forth, and by faith his works be strengthened.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Vel annulus in manu pignus est spiritus sancti, propter gratiae participationem, quae digito bene significatur.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or the ring on the hand is a pledge of the Holy Spirit, because of the’ participation of grace, which is well signified by the finger.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Vel iubet annulum dari, sive signaculum salutaris symbolum, seu magis desponsationis insigne et nuptiarum pignus, quibus Christus Ecclesiam sponsat, cum anima resipiscens per annulum fidei iungitur.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Or he orders the ring to be given, which is the symbol of the seal of salvation, or rather the badge of betrothment, and pledge of the nuptials with which Christ espouses His Church. Since the soul that recovers is united by this ring of faith to Christ.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Calceamenta autem in pedes praeparatio est evangelizandi ad non tangenda terrena; de quibus sequitur et calceamenta in pedes eius.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But the shoes on the feet are the preparation for preaching the Gospel, in order not to touch earthly things.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Vel mandat calceamenta pedibus imponi, aut propter cooperienda vestigia, ut per lubricum mundi istius iter fixus incedat; aut propter mortificationem membrorum: vitae enim nostrae cursus in Scripturis pes appellatur; et mortificationis species calceamentis imponitur, quia de animalium mortuorum pellibus conficiuntur. Addit et vitulum illi saginatum, iugulandum in convivii exhibitione; sequitur enim et adducite vitulum saginatum, idest dominum Iesum Christum; quem vitulum nominat propter hostiam corporis immaculati: saginatum autem dixit, quia pinguis et opimus intantum est ut pro totius mundi salute sufficiat. Non autem ipse pater vitulum immolavit, sed aliis immolandum tradidit; permittente enim patre consentiens filius ab hominibus crucifixus est.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Or he bids them put shoes on his feet, either for the sake of covering the soles of his feet that he may is walk firm along the slippery path of the world, or for the mortification of his members. For the course of our life is called in the Scriptures a foot, and a kind of mortification takes place in shoes; inasmuch as they are made of the skins of dead animals. He adds also, that the fatted calf must be frilled for the celebration of the feast. For it follows, And bring the fatted calf, that is, the Lord Jesus Christ, whom he calls a calf, because of the sacrifice of a body without spot; but he called it fatted, because it is rich and costly, inasmuch as it is sufficient for the salvation of the whole world. But the Father did not Himself sacrifice the calf, but gave it to be sacrificed to others. For the Father permitting, the Son consenting thereto by men was crucified.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Vel vitulus saginatus est ipse dominus, secundum carnem satiatus opprobriis. Quod autem imperat ut adducant eum, quid aliud est nisi ut praedicent eum, et annuntiando faciant venire in exhausta fame viscera filii esurientis? Nam etiam ut occidant eum iubet: hoc est, ut mortem eius insinuent: tunc enim cuique occiditur cum credit occisum: sequitur enim et manducemus.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or, the fatted calf is our Lord Himself in the flesh loaded with insults. But in that the Father commands them to bring it, what else is this but that they preach Him, and by declaring Him cause to revive, yet unconsumed by hunger, the bowels of the hungry son? He also bids them kill Him, alluding to His death. For He is then killed to each man who believes Him slain. It follows, And let us eat.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Bene carnem vituli, quia sacerdotalis est victima, quae pro peccatis fiebat. Epulantem autem inducit, cum dicit epulemur, ut ostenderet quoniam paternus est cibus, salus nostra; et patris est gaudium, nostrorum redemptio peccatorum.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Rightly the flesh of the calf, because it is the priestly victim which was offered for sin. But he introduces him feasting, when he says, Be merry; to show that the food of the Father is our salvation; the joy of the Father the redemption of our sins.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Ipse enim pater gaudet in reditu filii, et convivatur in vitulo: quia misericordiae suae fructum in immolatione filii sui gaudens creator, in acquisitione populi credentis epulatur; unde sequitur quia hic filius meus mortuus erat et revixit; perierat, et inventus est.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. For the father himself rejoices in the return of his son, and feasts on the calf, because the Creator, rejoicing in the acquisition of a believing people, feasts on the fruit of His mercy by the sacrifice of His Son. Hence it follows, For this my son was dead, and is alive again.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Ille periit qui fuit. Itaque gentes non sunt, Christianus est. Potest tamen et hic una species accipi generis humani. Fuit Adam, et in illo fuimus omnes; periit Adam, et in illo omnes perierunt. Homo igitur in illo homine qui perierat reformatur. Potest et de agente poenitentiam dictum videri, quia non moritur nisi qui aliquando vixerit. Et gentes quidem cum crediderint, per gratiam vivificantur; qui vero lapsus fuerit, per poenitentiam reviviscit.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; He is dead who was. Therefore the Gentiles are not, the Christian is. Here however might be understood one individual of the human race; Adam was, and in him we all were. Adam perished, and in him we all have perished. Man shell is restored in that Man who has died. It might also seem to be spoken of one working repentance, because he dies not who has not at one time lived. And the Gentiles indeed when they have believed are made alive again by grace. But he who has fallen recovers by repentance.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Quantum ergo ad vitiorum conditionem mortuus fuerat desperatus; sed quantum ad humanam naturam, quae mutabilis est, et potest a vitio ad virtutem converti, deperditus dicitur: nam minus est perdi quam mori. Quilibet autem revocatus et mundatus a crimine, saginati vituli particeps causa laetitiae fit patri et famulis eius, idest Angelis et sacerdotibus; unde sequitur et coeperunt omnes epulari.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. As then with respect to the condition of his sins, he had been despaired of; so in regard to human nature, which is changeable and can be turned from vice to virtue, he is said to be lost. For it is less to be lost than to die. But every one who is recalled and turned from sin, partaking of the fatted calf, becomes an occasion of joy to his father and his servants, that is, the angels and priests. Hence it follows, And they all began to be merry.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Istae epulae atque festivitas nunc celebrantur, per orbem terrarum Ecclesia dilatata atque diffusa: vitulus enim ille in corpore et sanguine dominico et offertur patri, et pascit totam domum.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Those banquets are now celebrated, the Church being enlarged and extended throughout the whole world. For that calf in our Lord’s body and blood is both offered up to the Father, and feeds the whole house.

        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de quaest.

Veniens autem de agro domum appropinquare coepit; idest, labore servilis operis improbato, ex eisdem Scripturis Ecclesiae libertatem consideravit; unde sequitur et cum veniret, et appropinquaret domui, audivit symphoniam et chorum; idest, spiritu sancto plenos vocibus consonis Evangelium praedicare; sequitur enim et vocavit unum de servis, et interrogavit quid hoc esset: idest, sumit ad legendum aliquem prophetarum, et in eo quaerens quodammodo interrogat unde ista festa in Ecclesia celebrantur, in qua se esse non videt. Respondet ei servus patris propheta; sequitur enim isque dixit illi: frater tuus venit et occidit pater tuus vitulum saginatum, quia salvum illum recepit; quasi dicat: in extremis terrae fuit frater tuus; sed inde maior exultatio cantantium domino canticum novum, quia laus eius ab extremis terrae, et propter eum qui absens erat, occisus est vir sciens ferre imbecillitatem: quia quibus non est narratum de eo viderunt.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. The elder son is the people of Israel, not indeed gone into a distant country, yet not in the house, but in the field, that is, in the paternal wealth of the Law and the Prophets, choosing to work earthly things. But coming from the field he began to draw nigh to the house, that is, the labor of his servile works being condemned by the same Scriptures, he was looking upon the liberty of the Church. Whence it follows; And as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing; that is, men filled with the Holy Spirit, with harmonious voices preaching the Gospel. It follows, And he called one of the servants, &amp;c. that is, he takes one of the prophets to read, and as he searches in it, asks in a manner, why are those feasts celebrated in the Church at which he finds himself present? His Father’s servant, the prophet, answers him. For it follows; And he said to him, your brother is come, &amp;c. As if he should say, your brother was in the farthest parts of the earth, but hence the greater rejoicing of those who sing a new song, because His praise is from the end of the earth; and for his sake who was afar off, was slain the Man who knows how to bear our infirmities, for they who have not been told of Him have seen Him.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Adolescentiori autem filio, idest populo ex gentibus, Israel, tamquam maior frater, beneficium paternae benedictionis invidit; quod faciebant Iudaei, quia Christus cum gentibus epularetur; unde sequitur indignatus est autem, et nolebat introire.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; But the younger son, that is the Gentile people, is envied by Israel as the elder brother, the privilege of his father’s blessing. Which the Jews did because Christ sat down to meat with the Gentiles, as it follows; And he was angry, and would not go in, &amp;c.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Indignatur etiam et nunc, et adhuc non vult intrare. Cum ergo plenitudo gentium introierit, egredietur opportuno tempore pater eius, ut etiam omnis Israel salvus fiat; unde sequitur pater ergo illius egressus coepit rogare eum. Erit enim quandoque aperta vocatio Iudaeorum in salutem Evangelii; quam manifestationem vocationis tamquam egressum patris appellat ad rogandum maiorem filium. Deinde quae respondit maior filius, quaestiones duas habent; sequitur enim at ille respondens dixit patri suo: ecce tot annis servio tibi, et nunquam mandatum tuum praeterivi. De mandato non praetergresso facile illud occurrit, non de omni mandato dictum, sed de uno maxime necessario, quod nullum alium Deum praeter unum creatorem omnium colere visus est. Neque iste filius in omnibus Israelitis, sed in his intelligitur personam habere qui numquam ab uno Deo ad simulacra conversi sunt. Quamquam enim terrena desideraret, ab uno tamen Deo iste desiderabat bona, quamvis communia cum pecoribus: unde et in Psalmo 72, 23 dicitur: ut iumentum factus sum apud te, et ego semper tecum. Sed quis est hoedus quem numquam accepit ad epulandum? Sequitur enim et nunquam dedisti mihi hoedum, ut cum amicis meis epularer. Peccator hoedi nomine significari valet.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. He is angry even also now, and still is unwilling to enter. When then the fullness of the Gentiles shall have come in, His father will go out at the fit time that all Israel also may be saved, as it follows, therefore came his father out and entreated him. For there shall be at some time an open calling of the Jews to the salvation of the Gospel. Which manifestation of calling he calls the going out of the father to entreat the elder son. Next the answer of the elder son involves two questions; for it follows, And he answering said to his father, Lo these many years do I serve you, either transgressed I at any time your commandment. With respect to the commandment not transgressed, it at once occurs, that it was not spoken of every command, but of that most essential one, that is, that he was seen to worship no other God but one, the Creator of all. Nor is that son to be understood to represent all Israelites, but those who have never turned from God to idols. For although he might desire earthly things, yet sought he them from God alone, though in common with sinners. Hence it is said, I was as a beast before you, and I am always with you. But who is the kid which he never received to make merry upon? for it follows, You never gave me a kid, &amp;c. Under the name of a kid the sinner may be signified.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Iudaeus hoedum requirit, Christianus agnum; et ideo illis Barabbas solvitur, nobis agnus immolatur. Quae res etiam in hoedo videtur, quia Iudaei ritum veteris sacrificii perdiderunt. Vel qui hoedum quaerunt, expectant Antichristum.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; The Jew requires a kid, the Christian a lamb, and therefore is Barabbas released to them, to us a lamb is sacrificed. Which thing also is seen in the kid, because the Jews have lost the ancient rite of sacrifice. Or they who seek for a kid wait for Antichrist.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Sed non invenio exitum huius sententiae. Multum enim absurdum est eum cui post dicitur tu mecum es semper, hoc a patre optasse ut Antichristo crederet. Neque omnino aliquem Iudaeorum, qui Antichristo credituri sunt, istum filium fas est intelligi. Quomodo autem epularetur ex illo hoedo, si ipse est Antichristus, qui ei non crederet? At si hoc est epulari ex hoedi occisione, quod est de Antichristi perditione laetari; quomodo dicit filius quem recepit pater, hoc sibi non fuisse concessum, cum omnes filii de eius perditione laetaturi sint? Ipsum igitur sibi dominum negatum ad epulandum conqueritur, dum eum peccatorem putat: cum enim hoedus est illi genti, idest cum eum sabbati violatorem et profanatorem aestimat, iucundari epulis illius non meruit.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But I do not see the object of this interpretation, for it is very absurd for him to whom it is afterwards said, You are ever with me, to have wished for this from his father, i.e. to believe in Antichrist. Nor altogether can we rightly understand any of the Jews who are to believe in Antichrist to be that son. And how could he feast upon that kid which is Antichrist who did not believe in him? But if to feast upon the slain kid, is the same as to rejoice at the destruction of Antichrist, how does the son whom the father did not entertain say that this was never given him, seeing that all the sons will rejoice at his destruction? His complaint then is, that the Lord Himself was denied him to feast upon, because he deems Him a sinner. For since He is a kid to that nation which regards Him as a violator and profaner of the Sabbath, it was not meet that they should be made merry at his banquet.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. But the father does not rebuke him as a liar, but commending his steadfastness with him invites him to the perfection of a better and happier rejoicing. Hence it follows, But he said to him, Son, you are ever with me.

          <td><b>JEROME</b>; Or after having said, “This is boasting, not truth,” the father does not agree with him, but restrains him in another way, saying, You are with me, by the law under which you are bound; not as though he had not sinned, but because God continually drew him back by chastening. Nor is it wonderful that he lies to his father who hates his brother.

          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Quid autem sibi vult quod addidit et omnia mea tua sunt, quasi non sint et fratris? Sed sic a perfectis et immortalibus filiis habentur omnia, ut sint et omnium singula, et omnia singulorum: ut enim cupiditas nihil sine angustia, ita nihil cum angustia caritas tenet. Sed quomodo omnia? Nonne et Angelos Deus in possessionem tali filio subiecisse putandus est? Si possessionem sic accipias ut eius possessor ipse sit dominus, non utique omnia: non enim domini erimus, sed consortes potius Angelorum. Si vero possessio sic intelligitur; quomodo recte dicimus possidere animas veritatem, non invenio cur non vere ac proprie id possimus accipere: non enim illud loquimur ut dominas veritatis dicamus animas. Aut si nomine possessionis ab hoc sensu impedimur, illud quoque auferatur: non enim ait pater: omnia possides, sed omnia mea tua sunt; nec tamen ut ipsius domini. Quod enim est in nostra pecunia, potest familiae nostrae vel alimentum esse, vel ornamentum, vel aliud huiusmodi. Et certe cum ipsum patrem recte ille possit suum dicere, non video quomodo quae ipsius sunt, non etiam recte sua vocare possit, diversis dumtaxat modis.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. But what means he that he adds, And all that I have is yours, as if they were not his brother’s also? But it is thus that all things are looked at by perfect and immortal children, that each is the possession of all, and all of each. For as desire obtains nothing without want, so charity nothing with w ant. But how all things? Must then God be supposed to have subjected the angels also to the possession of such a son? If you so take possession as that the possessor of a thing is its lord, certainly not all things. For we shall not be the lords, but the companions of angels. Again, if possession is thus understood, how do we rightly say that our souls possess truth? I see no reason why we may not truly and properly say so. For we do not so speak as to call our souls the mistresses of truth. Or if by the term possession we are hindered from this sense, let that also be set aside. For the father says not, “You possess all things,” but All that I have is yours, still not as if you were its lord. For that which is our property may be either food for our families, or ornament, or something of the kind. And surely, when he can rightly call his father his own, I do not see why he may not also rightly call his own what belongs to his father, only in different ways. For when we shall have obtained that blessedness, the higher things will be ours to look upon, equal things ours to have fellowship with, the lower things ours to rule. Let then the elder brother join most safely in the rejoicing.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Or he was in the field, that is, in the world, pampering his own flesh, that he might be filled with bread, and sowing in tears that he might reap in joy, but when he found what was being done, he was unwilling to enter into the common joy.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Or to take the whole differently; the character of the son who seems to complain is put for all those who are offended at the sudden advances and salvation of the perfect, as David introduces one who took offense at the peace of sinners.

          <td><b>TITUS BOST</b>. The elder son then as a husbandmen was engaged in husbandry, digging not the land, but the field of the soul, and planting trees of salvation, that is to say, the virtues.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Quaeritur autem si afficitur passione livoris dolens in prosperis aliorum. Dicendum est autem, quod nullus sanctorum dolet in talibus; immo bona aliorum sua existimat. Non autem oportet omnia quaecumque parabola continet, ad litteram pertractare; sed sensum elicientes cuius causa componitur, nihil aliud perscrutari. Haec ergo parabola ad hoc est composita ut peccatores non diffidant reverti, scientes quod magna consequentur: unde introducit alios turbatos in eorum bonis, ut indicet eos livore tabescentes, sed tanto decore honoratos redeuntes, ut etiam invidiosi possint aliis fieri.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But it is asked, whether one who grieves at the prosperity of others is affected by the passion of envy. We must answer, that no Saint grieves at such things; but rather looks upon the good things of others as his own. Now we must not take every thing contained in the parable literally, but bringing out the weaning which the author had in view, search for nothing farther. This parable then was written to the end that sinners should not despair of returning, knowing that they shall obtain great things. Therefore he introduces others so troubled at these good things as to be consumed with envy, but those who return, treated with such great honor as to become themselves an object of envy to others.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Vel Pharisaeorum intentionem corrigit dominus per praesentem parabolam, quos ex hypothesi nominat iustos; quasi dicat: esto vere vos iustos esse, nec transgressos aliquod mandatorum: numquid igitur propter hoc non oportet admittere a flagitiis redeuntes?
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Or by this parable our Lord reproves the will of the Pharisees, whom according to the argument he terms just, as if to say, Let it be that you are truly just, having transgressed none of the commandments, must we then for this reason refuse to admit those who turn away from their iniquities?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Hieronimus</b>: Vel aliter. Omnis iustitia in comparatione Dei est iniustitia; unde Paulus: quis me liberabit de corpore mortis huius? Unde apostoli indignati sunt pro petitione matris filiorum Zebedaei.
          <td><b>JEROME</b>; Or, in another way, all justice in comparison of the justice of God is injustice. Therefore Paul says, Who shall deliver me from the body of this death? and hence were the Apostles moved with anger at the request of the sons of Zebedee.

          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Quod et nos ipsi quandoque patimur; vivunt enim quidam praestantissimam et optimam vitam; alius autem in ipso senio multoties ad Deum convertitur, vel forsitan extremum diem claudere debens, ac diluit reatus, domino miserante. Hoc quidem aliquando respuunt ex importuna pusillanimitate, non attendentes mentem salvatoris, qui de salute pereuntium gaudet.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; We also ourselves sometimes; for some live a most excellent and perfect life, another ofttime even in his old age is converted to God, or perhaps when just about to close his last day, through God’s mercy washes away his guilt. But this mercy some men reject from restless timidity of mind, not counting upon the will of our Savior, who rejoices in the salvation of those who are perishing.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. The son then says to the father, For nothing I left a life of sorrow, ever harassed by sinners who were my enemies, and never have you for my sake ordered a kid to be slain, (that is, a sinner who persecuted me,) that I might enjoy myself for a little. Such a kid was Ahab to Elijah, who said, Lord, they have killed your prophets.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Vel aliter. Notatur hic frater usque adeo ut de villa venire dicatur, hoc est terrenis operibus occupatus, ignorans quae sunt spiritus Dei, ut denique numquam pro se vel hoedum quaeratur occisum: non enim pro invidia, sed pro venia mundi agnus est immolatus. Invidus hoedum quaerit, innocens agnum pro se desiderat immolari. Ideo et senior dicitur, eo quod cito quis per invidiam consenescat; ideo et foris stat, eo quod malevolentia eum excludat; ideo chorum et symphoniam audire non potest, hoc est nonnulla theatralis incentiva lasciviae, sed plebis concordiam concinentis quae de peccatore salvato dulcem laetitiae suavitatem resultat; qui enim sibi iusti videntur, indignantur quando alicui peccatum fatenti venia laxatur. Quis tu es qui domino contradicas, ne videlicet culpam relaxaret, cum tu cui volueris ignoscas? Sed remittendis post poenitentiam debemus favere peccatis; ne dum veniae alterius invidemus, ipsi eam non mereamur a domino. Non invideamus de longinqua regione remeantibus, quia et nos fuimus in regione longinqua
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Or else, This brother is described so as to be said to come from the farm, that is, engaged in worldly occupations, so ignorant of the things of the Spirit of God, as at last to complain that a kid had never been slain for him. For not for envy, but for the pardon of the world, was the Lamb sacrificed. The envious seeks a kid, the innocent a lamb, to be sacrificed for it. Therefore also is he called the elder, because a man soon grows old through envy. Therefore too he stands without, because his malice excludes him; therefore could he not hear the dancing and music, that is, not the wanton fascinations of the stage, but the harmonious song of a people, resounding with the sweet pleasantness of joy for a sinner saved. For they who seem to themselves righteous are angry when pardon is granted to one confessing his sins. Who are you that speak against your Lord, that he should not, for example, forgive a fault, when you pardon whom you will? But we ought to favor forgiving sin after repentance, lest while grudging pardon to another, we ourselves obtain it not from our Lord. Let us not envy those who return from a distant country, seeing that we ourselves also were afar off.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Opinio quaedam erronea aggravata mortalibus auget crimina, minuit bona: ea vero est opinari quod ea quaecumque possidemus in usu vitae, possideamus ut domini; et ideo etiam opportune ea apprehendimus tamquam bona praecipua. Sed contrarium est: non enim nos ut domini in vita praesenti collocati sumus in propria domo, sed tamquam hospites et advenae quo nolimus ducimur, et quo tempore non putamus: qui nunc locuples est, in brevi fit mendicus. Ergo quicumque sis, noveris te esse dispensatorem alienorum, et quod transitorii usus et brevis tibi iura concessa sunt. Abiecto ergo ab anima dominii fastu, sumas humilitatem et modestiam villici.
          <td><b>PSEUDO-CHRYS</b>. There is a certain erroneous opinion inherent in mankind, which increases evil and lessens good. It is the feeling that all the good things we possess in the course of our life we possess as lords over them, and accordingly we seize them as our especial goods. But it is quite the contrary. For we are placed in this life not as lords in our own house, but as guests and strangers, led whither we would not, and at a time we think not of. He who is now rich, suddenly becomes a beggar. Therefore whoever you are, know yourself to be a dispenser of the things of others, and that the privileges granted you are for a brief and passing use. Cast away then from your soul the pride of power, and put on the humility and modesty of a steward.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Interea evulsus a villicatione eripitur; sequitur enim et vocavit illum, et ait ei: quid hoc audio de te? Redde rationem villicationis tuae: iam enim non poteris villicare. Quotidie talia nobis per effectus exclamat dominus, ostendens nobis fruentem in meridie sospitate, priusquam vesperascat, exanimem, et alium inter prandia expirantem; et diversimode ab hac villicatione discedimus. Sed fidelis dispensator, qui de propria dispensatione confidit, desiderat cum Paulo dissolvi et esse cum Christo; is autem cuius sunt vota terrena, anxiatur in exitu: unde de hoc villico subditur ait autem villicus intra se: quid faciam, quia dominus meus aufert a me villicationem? Fodere non valeo, mendicare erubesco. Impotentem esse in opere crimen est vitae inertis; non enim timeret, si consuevisset affectare labores. Quod si secundum allegoriam accipiamus parabolam, post transmigrationem hinc factam non est tempus operandi. Vita praesens habet exercitium mandatorum, futura vero solatium. Si nihil operatus es hic, frustra in futurum curas; sed nec mendicando proficies. Huius indicium sunt virgines fatuae: quae imprudenter a prudentibus mendicaverunt, sed reversae sunt vacuae; quilibet enim suam conversationem ut tunicam induit; non est autem eam exuere, nec ambire cum alio. Sed debitorum remissionem ingeniatus est nequitiae villicus, statuens sibi malorum remedium in conservis; sequitur enim scio quid faciam, ut cum amotus fuero a villicatione, recipiant me in domos suas. Quoties enim quis exitum suum percipiens, levat beneficio sarcinam peccatorum, vel relaxando debita debitori, vel tribuens inopibus copiam, ea quae sunt domini largiens: multos amicos conciliat praebituros sibi coram iudice testimonium veritatis non vocibus, sed bonorum operum ostensione; quin etiam paraturos per testimonium refrigerii mansionem. Nihil autem est nostrum, sed omnia sunt ditionis Dei; unde sequitur convocatis itaque debitoribus domini sui, dicebat primo: quantum debes domino meo? At ille dixit: centum cados olei.
          <td><b>PSEUDO-CHRYS</b>. Meanwhile he is taken and thrust out of his stewardship; for it follows, And he called him, and said to him, What is this that I hear of you? give an account of your stewardship, for you can be no longer steward. Day after day by the events which take place our Lord cries aloud to us the same thing, showing us a man at midday rejoicing in health, before the evening cold and lifeless; another expiring in the midst of a meal. And in various ways we go out from our stewardship; but the faithful steward, who has confidence concerning his management, desires with Paul to depart and be with Christ. But he whose wishes are on earth is troubled at his departing. Hence it is added of this steward, Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do, for my Lord takes away from me the stewardship? I cannot dig, to beg I all ashamed. Weakness in action is the fault of a slothful life. For no one would shrink who had been accustomed to apply himself to labor. But if we take the parable allegorically, after our departure hence there is no more time for working; the present life contains the practice of what is commanded, the future, consolation. If you have done nothing here, in vain then are you careful for the future, nor will you gain any thing by begging. The foolish virgins are an instance of this, who unwisely begged of the wise, but returned empty. For every one puts on his daily life as his inner garment; it is not possible for him to put it off or exchange it with another. But the wicked steward aptly contrived the remission of debts, to provide for himself an escape from his misfortunes among his fellow-servants; for it follows, I am resolved what to do, that when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses. For as often as a man perceiving his end approaching, lightens by a kind deed the load of his sins, (either by forgiving a debtor his debts, or by giving abundance to the poor,) dispensing those things which are his Lord’s, he conciliates to himself many friends, who will afford him before the judge a real testimony, not by words, but by the demonstration of good works, nay moreover will provide for him by their testimony a resting-place of consolation. But nothing is our own, all things are in the power of God. Hence it follows, So he called every one of his Lord’s debtors to him, and said to the first, How much owe you to my Lord? And he said, A hundred casks of oil.

Sequitur deinde alii dixit: tu vero quantum debes? Qui ait: centum coros tritici. Corus modiis triginta completur. Sequitur ait illi: accipe litteras tuas, et scribe octoginta; quintam partem ei dimittens. Simpliciter ergo sic potest accipi. Quisquis indigentiam pauperis vel ex dimidia, vel ex quinta alleviat parte, misericordiae suae mercede donandus est.

It follows, Then said he to another, And how much owe you? And he said, A hundred measures of wheat. A corus is made up of thirty bushels. And he said to him, Take your bill, and write fourscore, forgiving him a fifth part. It may be then simply taken as follows: whosoever relieves the want of a poor man, either by supplying half or a fifth part, will be blessed with the reward of his mercy.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or because out of the hundred measures of oil, he caused fifty to be written down by the debtors, and of the hundred measures of w heat, fourscore, the meaning thereof is this, that those things which every Jew performs toward the Priests and Levites should be the more attendant in the Church of Christ, that whereas they give a tenth, Christians should give a half, as Zaccheus gave of his goods, or at least by giving two tenths, that is, a fifth, exceed the payments of the Jews.

          <td><b>Origenes</b>: Verum, quia gentiles dicunt prudentiam esse virtutem, et definiunt eam peritiam bonorum, malorum et neutrorum; vel cognitionem agendorum et non agendorum: considerandum est utrum haec dictio plura aut unum significet. Dicitur enim quod Deus paravit caelos prudentia: constat bonam esse prudentiam, qua dominus caelos paravit. Dicitur etiam in Genesis secundum Lxx, quod serpens prudentissimus erat: ubi prudentiam non virtutem dicit, sed astutiam ad mala inclinationem habentem; et secundum hoc dicitur quod dominus laudavit villicum, quia prudenter egisset; hoc est callide et perperam. Et forsitan quod dixit laudavit, non secundum veram commendationem, sed abusive dictum est; ut cum dicimus aliquem commendari in mediocribus et indifferentibus rebus, et quodammodo mirandos esse concursus et acumen, quibus vigor mentis elicitur.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; But because the Gentiles say that wisdom is a virtue, and define it to be the experience of what is good, evil, and indifferent, or the knowledge of what is and what is not to be done, we must consider whether this word signifies many things, or one. For it is said that God by wisdom prepared the heavens. Now it is plain that wisdom is good, because the Lord by wisdom prepared the heavens. It is said also in Genesis, according to the LXX, that the serpent was the wisest animal, wherein he does not make wisdom a virtue, but evil-minded cunning. And it is in this sense that the Lord commended the steward that he had done wisely, that is, cunningly and evilly. And perhaps the word commended was spoken not in the sense of real commendation, but in a lower sense; as when we speak of a man being commended in slight and indifferent matters, and in a certain measure clashings and sharpness of wit are admired, by which the power of the mind is drawn out.

De iustis laboribus eleemosynas facite: non enim corrupturi estis iudicem Christum. Si de praeda inopis dares aliquid iudici ut pro te iudicaret, si iudex ille pro te iudicabit, tanta vis est iustitiae ut etiam tibi displiceat. Noli tibi pingere talem Deum; fons iustitiae est. Noli ergo eleemosynas facere de fenore et usuris: fidelibus dico, quibus corpus Christi erogamus: sed si pecunias tales habetis, de malo est quod habetis. Iam nolite malum facere. Zachaeus dixit: dimidium rerum mearum do pauperibus. Ecce quomodo currit qui currit facere amicos de mammona iniquitatis: et ne reus aliunde teneretur: si cui aliquid tuli, quadruplum reddam. Est et alius intellectus. Mammona iniquitatis divitiae saeculi sunt omnes, undecumque sint. Si enim veras divitias quaeris, aliae sunt, quibus Iob nudus abundabat, quando in Deum cor plenum habebat. Istae autem ab iniquitate appellantur divitiae, quia verae non sunt: paupertate enim plenae sunt, et semper obnoxiae casibus: si enim verae divitiae essent, securitatem tibi darent.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. That which the Hebrews call mammon, in Latin is “riches.” As if He said, “Make to yourselves friends of the riches of unrighteousness.” Now some misunderstanding this, seize upon the things of others, and so give something to the poor, and think that they are doing what is commanded. That interpretation must be corrected into, Give alms of your righteous labors. For you will not corrupt Christ your Judge. If from the plunder of a poor man, you were to give any thing to the judge that he might decide for you, and that judge should decide for you, such is the force of justice, that you would be ill pleased in yourself. Do not then make to yourself such a God. God is the fountain of Justice, give not your alms then from interest and usury. I speak to the faithful, to whom we dispense the body of Christ. But if you have such money, it is of evil that you have it. Be no longer doers of evil. Zaccheus said, Half my goods I give to the poor. See how he runs who runs to make friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; and not to be held guilty from any quarter, he says, If have taken any thing from any one, I restore fourfold. According to another interpretation, the mammon of unrighteousness are all the riches of the world, whenever they come. For if you seek the true riches, there are some in which Job when naked abounded, when he had his hears full towards God. The others are called riches from unrighteousness; because they are not true riches, for they are full of poverty, and ever liable to chances. For if they were true riches, they would give you security.

          <td><b>BASIL</b>; Or if you have succeeded to a patrimony, you receive what has been amassed by the unrighteous; for in a number of predecessors some one must needs be found who has unjustly usurped the property of others. But suppose that your father has not been guilty of exaction, whence have you your money? If indeed you answer, “From myself;” you are ignorant of God, not having the knowledge of your Creator; but if, “From God,” tell me the reason for which you receive it. Is not the earth and the fullness thereof the Lord’s? If then whatever is ours belongs to our common Lord, so will it also belong to our fellow-servant.

Therefore when He said, Make to yourselves friends, he added, of the mammon of unrighteousness, to show, that their friendship will not alone protect us unless good works accompany us, unless we righteously cast away all riches unrighteously amassed. The most skillful then of all arts is that of almsgiving. For it builds not for us houses of mud, but lays up in store an everlasting life. Now in each of the arts one needs the support of another; but when we ought to show mercy, we need nothing else but the will alone.

Quod igitur talibus nullus spiritualium donorum fructus proveniat, manifestis exemplis ostendit, subdens qui fidelis est in minimo, et in maiori fidelis est; et qui in modico iniquus est, et in maiori iniquus est. Aperit autem nobis dominus oculum cordis, exponens quod dixerat, cum subdit si ergo in iniquo mammona fideles non fuistis, quod verum est quis credet vobis? Est igitur minimum iniquitatis mammona, idest terrenae divitiae; quae superna sapientibus nihil esse videntur. Arbitror ergo aliquem esse in modico fidelem, cum de his minimis, oppressis aerumna subsidium impertitur. Itaque si in modico fuerimus perfidi, quo pacto ab eo obtinebimus verum, idest divinorum charismatum, uber donum, animae humanae imprimens divinam speciem? Quod autem ad hoc tendat intentio verborum domini, per sequentia patet; dicit enim et si in alieno non fuistis fideles, quod vestrum est quis dabit vobis?
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Thus then Christ taught those who abound in riches, earnestly to love the friendship of the poor, and to have treasure in heaven. But He knew the sloth of the human mind, how that they who court riches bestow no work of charity upon the needy. That to such men there results no profit of spiritual gifts, He shows by obvious examples, adding, He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much; and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much. Now our Lord opens to us the eye of the heart, explaining what He had said, adding, If therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteousness mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches? That which is least then is the mammon of unrighteousness, that is, earthly riches, which seem nothing to those that are heavenly wise. I think then that a man is faithful in a little, when he imparts aid to those who are bowed down with sorrow. If then we have been unfaithful in a little thing, how shall we obtain from hence the true riches, that is, the fruitful gift of Divine grace, impressing the image of God on the human soul? But that our Lord’s words incline to this meaning is plain from the following; for He says, And if you have not been faithful in that which is another man’s who shall give you that which is your own?

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Riches are foreign to us, because they are something beyond nature, they are not born with us, and they do not pass away with us. But Christ is ours, because He is the life of man. Lastly, He came to His own.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Thus then hitherto He has taught us how faithfully we ought to dispose of our wealth.

          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Non quia duo, sed unus est dominus: nam etsi sint qui mammonae serviant, tamen non ille novit aliqua iura dominatus, sed ipsi sibi iugum servitutis imponunt. Unus est dominus, quia unus est Deus: unde patet patris et filii unum esse dominatum: et huius rationem assignat subdens aut enim unum odio habebit, et alterum diliget; aut uni adhaerebit, et alterum contemnet.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Not because the Lord is two, but one. For although there are who serve mammon, yet he knows no rights of lordship; but has himself placed upon himself a yoke of servitude. There is one Lord, because there is one God. Hence it is evident, that the power of the Father and the Son is one and He assigns a reason, thus saying, For either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other.

          <td><b>Augustinus de quaest.

For no one when asked whether he loves the devil, answers that he loves him, but rather that he hates him; but all generally proclaim that they love God. Therefore either he will hate the one, (that is, the devil,) and love the other, (that is, God;) or will hold to the one, (that is, the devil, when he pursues as it were temporal wants,) and will despise the other, (that is, God,) as when men frequently neglect His threats for their desires, who because of His goodness flatter themselves that they will have impunity.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Let then the covetous hear this, that we can not at the same time serve Christ and riches; and yet He said not, “Who has riches,” but, who serves riches; for he who is the servant of riches, watches them as a servant; but he who has shaken off the yoke of servitude, dispenses them as a master; but he who serves mammon, verily serves him who is set over those earthly things as the reward of his iniquity, and is called the prince of this world.

But John first openly preached that the kingdom of heaven was at hand, as well as also the remission of sins by the laver of regeneration. Hence it follows, Since that time the kingdom of heaven is preached, and every one presses into it.

Sed ideo vim facimus naturae ut non ad terrena demergat, sed ad superna se erigat.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; For the Law delivered many things according to nature, as being more indulgent to our natural desires, that it might call us to the pursuit of righteousness.

Quis autem videns divino insudantes cultui, et pene suam carnem mortificantes, non revera fatebitur illos vim inferre regno caelorum? Sed et si quis indagaverit mirandum propositum venerandorum martyrum, fatebitur eos vim irrogare in regnum caelorum.
          <td><b>EUSEBIUS</b>. A great struggle befalls men in their ascent to heaven. For that men clothed with mortal flesh should be able to subdue pleasure and every unlawful appetite, desiring to imitate the life of angels, must be compassed with violence. But who that looking upon those who labor earnestly in the service of God, and almost put to death their flesh, will not in reality confess that they do violence to the kingdom of heaven.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. They also do violence to the kingdom of heaven, in that they not only despise all temporal things, but also the tongues of those who desire their doing so. This the Evangelist added, when he said that Jesus was derided when He spoke of despising earthly riches.

Praeterit enim figura huius mundi; de lege autem nec unius quidem litterae summitas, idest nec minima quaeque a sacramentis spiritualibus vacant: et tamen lex et prophetae usque ad Ioannem; quia non potuit ultra venturum prophetizari qui Ioannis praeconio iam venisse clarebat. Quod autem de lege in perpetuum non violanda praedixerat, uno exempli gratia de illa sumpto confirmat testimonio, dicens omnis qui dimittit uxorem suam, et ducit alteram, moechatur; et qui dimissam a viro ducit, moechatur: ut ex hoc uno discerent etiam in ceteris eum non ad solvenda, sed implenda decreta legis venisse.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; But lest they should suppose that in His words, the Law and the Prophets were until John, He preached the destruction of the Law or the Prophets, He obviates such a notion, adding, And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law should fail. For it is written, the fashion of this world passes away. But of the Law, not even the very extreme point of one letter, that is, not even the least things are destitute of spiritual sacraments. And yet the Law and the Prophets were until John, because that could always he prophesied as about to come, which by the preaching of John it was clear had come. But that which He spoke beforehand concerning the perpetual inviolability of the Law, He confirms by one testimony taken therefrom for the sake of example, saying, Whosoever puts away his wife, and marries another, commits adultery: and whosoever marries her that is put away from her husband, commits adultery; that from this one instance they should learn that He came not to destroy but to fulfill the commands of the Law.

          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Quod enim cum imperfectis lex imperfecte loqueretur, ex hoc patet quod duris praecordiis Iudaeorum ait: si vir odio habuerit coniugem, dimittet eam; quia cum homicidae essent et gauderent in sanguine, nec astrictorum sibi miserebantur: adeo ut filios et filias mactarent Daemonibus. Nunc vero perfectioris doctrinae opus est; ob hoc igitur dico, quod si quis repudiat coniugem, non incumbente causa fornicationis, moechatur, et qui aliam duxerit, moechatur.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. For that to the imperfect the Law spoke imperfectly is plain from what he says to the hard hearts of the Jews, “If a man hate his wife, let him put her away,” because since they were murderers and rejoiced in blood, they had no pity even upon those who were united to them, so that they slew their sons and daughters for devils. But now there is need of a more perfect doctrine. Wherefore I say, that if a man puts away his wife, having no excuse of fornication, he commits adultery, and he who marries another commits adultery.

          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Prius autem dicendum arbitror de lege coniugii, ut postea de prohibendo divortio disputemus. Quidam putant omne coniugium a Deo esse, quia scriptum est: quod Deus coniunxit, homo non separet. Quomodo ergo apostolus dixit: si infidelis discedit, discedat? In quo ostendit non a Deo esse omne coniugium: neque enim Christiani gentilibus Dei iudicio coniunguntur. Noli ergo uxorem dimittere, ne Deum tuae culpae diffitearis auctorem. Etenim si alienos, multo magis uxoris debes tolerare et emendare mores: quae cum parvulis feta dimittitur: durum si excludas parentem, pignora teneas, ut ad contumeliam parentis addas etiam pietatis iniuriam; durius si propter matrem etiam filios simul pellas. Patierisne liberos tuos vivente te esse sub vitrico; ac incolumi matre, esse sub noverca? Quam periculosum si fragilem adolescentiae aetatem errori offeras; quam impium, si eius destituas senectutem cuius defloraveris iuventutem. Pone si repudiata non nubat; et hoc tibi debuit displicere, cui adultero fidem servat. Pone si nubat; necessitas illius tuum crimen est; et quod coniugium putas, adulterium est. Hoc moraliter tamen: quia supra proposuerat regnum Dei evangelizari; et cum dixisset de lege unum apicem non posse cadere, subiecit omnis qui dimittit uxorem suam et ducit alteram, moechatur, etc.; vir Christus est, uxor Ecclesia, caritate uxor, integritate virgo. Ergo quem Deus traxit ad filium, non separet persecutio, non avertat luxuria, non philosophia depraedetur, haereticus non inficiat, Iudaeus non separet. Adulteri sunt omnes qui adulterare cupiunt fidei et sapientiae veritatem.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; But we must first speak, I think, of the law of marriage, that we may afterwards discuss the forbidding of divorce. Some think that all marriage is sanctioned by God, because it is written, Whom God has joined, let not man put asunder. How then does the Apostle say, If the unbelieving depart, let him depart? Herein he shows that the marriage of all is not from God. For neither by God’s approval are Christians joined with Gentiles. Do not then put away your wife, lest you deny God to be the Author of your union. For if others, much more ought you to bear with and correct the behavior of your wife. And if she is sent away pregnant with children, it is a hard thing to shut out the parent and keep the pledge; so as to add to the parents’ disgrace the loss also of filial affection. Harder still if because of the mother you drive away the children also. Would you suffer in your lifetime your children to be under a step-father, or when the mother was alive to be under a step-mother? How dangerous to expose to error the tender age of a young wife. How wicked to desert in old age one, the flower of whose growth you have blighted. Suppose that being divorced she does not marry, this also ought to be displeasing to you, to whom though an adulterer, she keeps her troth. Suppose she marries, her necessity is your crime, and that which you suppose marriage, is adultery. But to understand it morally. Having just before set forth that the kingdom of God is preached, and said that one tittle could not fall from the Law, He added, Whosoever puts away his wife, &amp;c. Christ is the husband; whomsoever then God has brought to His son, let not persecution sever, nor lust entice, nor philosophy spoil, nor heretics taint, nor Jew seduce. Adulterers are all such as desire to corrupt truth, faith, and wisdom.

If you regard not the commands of God, at least have compassion on your own state, and fear lest also you become such as he. But sickness has some comfort if it receives help.

For you could never be guilty of such folly, as to suppose the corporeal bosom of one man able to hold so many souls, nay, to use your own words, so many bodies as the Angels carry thither as they did Lazarus. But perhaps you imagine that one soul to have alone deserved to come to that bosom. If you would not fall into a childish mistake, you must understand Abraham’s bosom to be a retired and hidden resting-place where Abraham is; and therefore called Abraham’s, not that it is his alone, but because he is the father of many nations, and placed first, that others might imitate his preeminence of faith.

Because when he lived pleasantly in the broad road, he had many busy flatterers; when he came to his end, all forsook him. For it simply follows, and was buried in hell.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. As it made the poor man’s affliction heavier while he lived to lie before the rich man’s gate, and to behold the prosperity of others, so when the rich man was dead it added to his desolation, that he lay in hell and saw the happiness of Lazarus, feeling not only by the nature of His own torments, but also by the comparison of Lazarus’s honor, his own punishment the more intolerable. Hence it follows, But lifting up his eyes. He lifted up his eyes that he might look on him, not despise him; for Lazarus was above, he below. Many angels carried Lazarus; he was seized by endless torments. Therefore it is not said, being in torment, but torments. For he was wholly in torments, his eyes alone were free, so that he might behold the joy of another. His eyes are allowed to be free that he may be the more tortured, not having that which another has. The riches of others are the torments of those who are in poverty.

For they who have followed the path to the heavenly country, when they leave the flesh, are kept back by the gates of hell; not that punishment smites them as sinners, but that resting in some more remote places, (for the intercession of the Mediator was not yet come,) the guilt of their first fault prevents them from entering the kingdom.

He who is in the kingdom of heaven, I know not whether he can have compassion on him who is in hell. The Creator pities His creature. There came one Physician who was to heal all; others could not heal. Send Lazarus. You err, wretched man. Abraham cannot send, but he can receive. To dip the tip of his finger in water. You would not deign to look upon Lazarus, and now you desire his finger. What you seek now, you ought to have done to him when alive. You are in want of water, who before despised delicate food. Mark the conscience of the sinner; he durst not ask for the whole of the finger. We are instructed also how good a thing it is not to trust in riches. See the rich man in need of the poor who was before starving. Things are changed, and it is now made known to all who was rich and who was poor. For as in the theaters, when it grows towards evening, and the spectators depart, then going out, and laying aside their dresses, they who seemed kings and generals are seen as they really are, the sons of gardeners and fig-sellers. So also when death is come, and the spectacle is over, and all the masks of poverty and riches are put off, by their works alone are men judged, which are truly rich, which poor, which are worthy of honor, which of dishonor.

Sed iustorum animae, quamvis in suae naturae bonitate misericordiam habeant, iam tamen auctoris sui iustitiae coniunctae, tanta rectitudine constringuntur ut nulla ad reprobos compassione moveantur. Nec iniusti ergo ad beatorum sortem transeunt, quia damnatione perpetua constringuntur; nec iusti ad reprobos transire possunt, quia erecti iam per iustitiam iudicii, eis nullo modo ex aliqua compassione miserentur.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. For as the wicked desire to pass over to the elect, that is, to depart from the pangs of their sufferings, so to the afflicted and tormented would the just pass in their mind by compassion, and wish to set them free. But the souls of the just, although in the goodness of their nature they feel compassion, after being united to the righteousness of their Author, are constrained by such great uprightness as not to be moved with compassion towards the reprobate. Neither then do the unrighteous pass over to the lot of the blessed, because they are bound in everlasting condemnation, nor can the righteous pass to the reprobate, because being now made upright by the righteousness of judgment, they in no way pity them from any compassion.

Illud enim quod scriptum est hoc capite: ut et ipsi recipiant vos in aeterna tabernacula, non de superbis et immisericordibus scriptum est, sed de his qui sibi eos amicos de operibus misericordiae fecerunt, quod iusti non velut propria potestate, quasi gratificando recipiunt, sed permissione divina.

For that which was written, that they may receive you into everlasting habitations, was not said of the proud and unmerciful, but of those who have made to themselves friends by their works of mercy, whom the righteous receive, not as if by their own power benefiting them, but by Divine permission.

Sed et illud considera, quod quisque mortuus servus est. Quaecumque vero dicunt Scripturae, dicit dominus: unde etsi resurgat mortuus, etsi caelitus descenderit Angelus, omnibus magis sunt dignae fide Scripturae: nam Angelorum dominus, vivorum et mortuorum, eas instituit. Si autem sciret hoc Deus, quod mortui resurgentes prodessent viventibus, non hoc omisisset, qui pro utilitate nostra singula quaeque tractat. Sed etsi crebro resurgerent mortui, hoc iterum tempore contemneretur; sed et Diabolus facile introduceret perversa dogmata, id quoque per organa sua fingens, non quidem suscitans vere defunctos, sed quibusdam fallaciis spectantium frustrans intuitum, vel ingenians quosdam mortem simulare.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But that it is true that he who hears not the Scriptures, takes no heed to the dead who rise again, the Jews have testified, who at one time indeed wished to kill Lazarus, but at another laid hands upon the Apostles, notwithstanding that some had risen from the dead at the hour of the Cross. Observe this also, that every dead man is a servant, but whatever the Scriptures say, the Lord says. Therefore let it be that dead men should rise again, and an angel descend from heaven, the Scriptures are more worthy of credit than all. For the Lord of Angels, the Lord as well of the living and the dead, is their author. But if God knew this that the dead rising again, profited the living, He would not have omitted it, seeing that He disposes all things for our advantage. Again, if the dead were often to rise again, this too would in time be disregarded. And the devil also would easily insinuate perverse doctrines, devising resurrection also by means of his own instruments, not indeed really raising up the deceased, but by certain delusions deceiving the sight of the beholders, or contriving, that is, setting up some to pretend death.

Ita illi cura fuit de vivis, quamvis quid agerent omnino nesciret, sicut nobis est cura de mortuis, quamvis quid agant omnino nesciamus. Sed rursus occurrit quaestio: quomodo hic Abraham esse sciebat Moysen et prophetas, idest libros eorum? Ubi etiam noverat divitem illum in deliciis, Lazarum vero in doloribus vixisse? Verum non cum haec agerentur in vivis, sed eis mortuis potuit Lazaro indicante cognoscere, ne falsum sit quod ait propheta: Abraham nescivit nos. Possunt et ab Angelis, qui rebus quae aguntur hic, praesto sunt, audire aliquid mortui; possunt etiam aliqua quae necessarium est eos nosse, non solum praeterita, verum etiam futura spiritu Dei revelante cognoscere.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But some one may say, If the dead have no care for the living, how did the rich man ask Abraham, that he should send Lazarus to his five brethren? But because he said this, did the rich man therefore know what his brethren were doing, or what was their condition at that time? His care about the living was such that he might yet be altogether ignorant what they were doing, just as we care about the dead, although we know nothing of what they do. But again the question occurs, How did Abraham know that Moses and the prophets are here in their books? Whence also had he known that the rich man had lived in luxury, but Lazarus in affliction. Not surely when these things were going on in their lifetime, but at their death he might know through Lazarus’ telling him, that in order that might not be false which the prophet says; Abraham heard us not. The dead might also hear something from the angels who are ever present at the things which are done here. They might also know some things which it was necessary for them to have known, not only past, but also future, through the revelation of the Church of God.

Epulatio splendida, iactantia legis est, in qua gloriabantur, plus ad pompam elationis abutentes ea, quam ad necessitatem salutis utentes.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. But these things may be so taken in allegory, that by the rich man we understand the proud Jews ignorant of the righteousness of God, and going about to establish their own. The purple and fine linen are the grandeur of the kingdom. And the kingdom of God (he says) shall be taken away from you. The sumptuous feasting is the boasting of the Law, in which they gloried, rather abusing it to swell their pride, than using it as the necessary means of salvation. But the beggar, by name Lazarus, which is interpreted “assisted,” signifies want; as, for instance, some Gentile, or Publican, who is all the more relieved, as he presumes less on the abundance of his resources.

          <td><b>GREG</b>. Lazarus then full of sores, figuratively represents the Gentile people, who when turned to God, were not ashamed to confess their sins. Their wound was in the skin. For what is confession of sins but a certain bursting forth of wounds. But Lazarus, full of wounds, desired to be fed by the crumbs which fell from the rich man’s table, and no one gave to him; because that proud people disdained to admit any Gentile to the knowledge of the Law, and words flowed down to him from knowledge, as the crumbs fell from the table.

De longinquo autem ad videndum Lazarum oculos dives levat, quia dum per damnationis suae supplicia infideles in imo sunt, fideles quosque ante diem extremi iudicii super se in requie attendunt, quorum post gaudia contemplari nullatenus possunt. Longe vero est quod conspiciunt, quia illuc per meritum non attingunt. In lingua autem amplius ardere ostenditur, quia infidelis populus verba legis in ore tenuit, quae opere servare contempsit. Ibi ergo amplius ardebit ubi se amplius ostendit scire quod facere noluit. Abraham autem filium eum vocat, quem tamen a tormento non liberat: quoniam huius infidelis populi patres, quia multos a sua fide deviasse considerant, eos nulla compassione a tormentis eripiunt, quos tamen per carnem filios recognoscunt.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. Sometimes also in the holy Word by dogs are understood preachers; according to that, That the tongue of your dogs may be red by the very blood of your enemies; for the tongue of dogs while it licks the wound heals it; for holy teachers, when they instruct us in confession of sin, touch as it were by the tongue the soul’s wound. The rich man was buried in hell, but Lazarus was carried by angels into Abraham’s bosom, that is, into that secret rest of which the truth says, Many shall come from the east and the west, and shall lie down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven, but the children of the kingdom shall be cast into outer darkness. But being afar off, the rich man lifted up his eyes to behold Lazarus, because the unbelievers while they suffer the sentence of their condemnation, lying in the deep, fix their eyes upon certain of the faithful, abiding before the day of the last Judgment in rest above them, whose bliss afterwards they would in no wise contemplate. But that which they behold is afar off, for thither they cannot attain by their merits. But he is described to burn chiefly in his tongue, because the unbelieving people held in their mouth the word of the Law, which in their deeds they despised to keep. In that part then a man will have most burning wherein he most of all shows he knew that which he refused to do. Now Abraham calls him his son, whom at the same time he delivers not from torments; because the fathers of this unbelieving people, observing that many have gone aside from their faith, are not moved with any compassion to rescue them from torments, whom nevertheless they recognize as sons.

Those brethren have sent you into these torments, they cannot be saved unless they die; otherwise it must needs be that the brethren dwell with their brother. But why seek you that I should send Lazarus? They have Moses and the Prophets. Moses was the poor Lazarus who counted the poverty of Christ greater than the riches of Pharaoh. Jeremiah, cast into the dungeon, was fed on the bread of affliction; and all the prophets teach those brethren. But those brethren cannot be saved unless some one rise from the dead. For those brethren, before Christ was risen, brought me to death; He is dead, but those brethren have risen again. For my eye sees Christ, my ear hears Him, my hands handle Him. From what we have said then, we determine the fit place for Marcion and Manichaeus, who destroy the Old Testament. See what Abraham says, If they hear not Moses and the prophets. As though he said, you do well by expecting Him who is to rise again; but in them Christ speaks. If you will hear them, you will hear Him also.

Or is there any Apostolical man, poor in speech, but rich in faith, who keeps the true faith, requiring not the appendage of words. To such a one I liken him who ofttimes beaten by the Jews offered the wounds of his body to be licked as it were by certain dogs. Blessed dogs, to whom the dropping from such wounds so falls as to fill the heart and mouth of those whose office it is to guard the house, preserve the flock, keep off the wolf ! And because the word is bread, our faith is of the word; the crumbs are as it were certain doctrines of the faith, that is to say, the mysteries of the Scriptures. But the Arians, who court the alliance of regal power that they may assail the truth of the Church, do not they seem to you to be in purple and fine linen? And these, when they defend the counterfeit instead of the truth, abound in flowing discourses. Rich heresy has composed many Gospels, and poor faith has kept this single Gospel, which it had received. Rich philosophy has made itself many gods, the poor Church has known only one. Do not those riches seem to you to be poor, and that poverty to be rich?

          <td><b>Augustinus de quaest. Evang</b>: Aliter etiam intelligi potest illa narratio, ut Lazarum dominum significare accipiamus iacentem ad ianuam illius divitis, quia se ad aures superbissimas Iudaeorum incarnationis humilitate deiecit, cupiens saturari de micis quae cadebant de mensa divitis, idest quaerens ab eis vel minima opera iustitiae, quae suae mensae, idest suae potestati, per superbiam non usurparent: quae opera quamvis minima, et sine disciplina perseverantiae vitae bonae, saltem interdum vel casu facerent, sicut micae de mensa cadere solent. Ulcera, passiones sunt domini; canes qui ea lingebant, gentes sunt, quos immundos Iudaei dicebant; et tamen passiones domini in sacramentis corporis et sanguinis eius per totum iam orbem suavitate devotissima lambunt. Sinus Abrahae intelligitur secretum patris, quo post passionem resurgens assumptus est dominus, quo eum portatum ab Angelis ideo dictum puto, quia ipsam receptionem, qua in secretum patris accessit, Angeli annuntiaverunt discipulis. Cetera secundum superiorem expositionem accipi possunt: quia secretum patris bene intelligitur ubi etiam ante resurrectionem iustorum animae vivunt cum Deo
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Again also that story may be so understood, as that we should take Lazarus to mean our Lord; lying at the gate of the rich man, because he condescended to the proud ears of the Jews in the lowliness of His incarnation; desiring to be fed from the crumbs which fell from the rich man’s table, that is, seeking from them even the least works of righteousness, which through pride they would not use for their own table, (that is, their own power,) which works, although very slight and without the discipline of perseverance in a good life, sometimes at least they might do by chance, as crumbs frequently fall from the table. The wounds are the sufferings of our Lord, the dogs who licked them are the Gentiles, whom the Jews called unclean, and yet, with the sweetest odor of devotion, they lick the sufferings of our Lord in the Sacraments of His Body and Blood throughout the whole world. Abraham’s bosom is understood to be the hiding place of the Father, whither after His Passion our Lord rising again was taken up, whither He was said to be carried by the angels, as it seems to me, because that reception by which Christ reached the Father’s secret place the angels announced to the disciples. The rest may be taken according to the former explanation, because that is well understood to be the Father’s secret place, where even before the resurrection the souls of the righteous live with God.

          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Quia Pharisaei existentes avari convitiabantur Christo de paupertate praedicanti, induxit parabolam divitis et Lazari. Deinde cum discipulis confert de Pharisaeis, indicans eos schismaticos et divinae viae impeditores esse; unde dicitur et ait ad discipulos suos: impossibile est ut non veniant scandala, idest impedimenta bonae et Deo placitae conversationis.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Because the Pharisees were covetous and railed against Christ when He preached poverty, He put to them the parable of the rich man and Lazarus. Afterwards, in speaking with His disciples concerning the Pharisees, He declares them to be men who caused division, and placed obstacles in the divine way. As it follows: Then said he to his disciples, It is impossible but that offenses will come, that is, hindrances to a good life and which is pleasing to God.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Sunt autem duplicia scandala: quorum haec quidem divinae gloriae refragantur, haec vero prodeunt solum ad irrogandum fratribus impedimentum: nam excogitationes haeresum, et quicumque contra veritatem fit sermo, divinae gloriae refragatur. Non tamen ad praesens memorari videntur huiusmodi scandala, sed magis ea quae contingunt inter amicos et fratres; sicut iurgia, detractiones et huiusmodi; unde postea subdit si peccaverit in te frater tuus.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Now there are two kinds of offenses, of which the one resist the glory of God, but the other serve only to cause a stumbling-block to the brethren. For the inventions of heresies, and every word that is spoken against the truth, are obstructions to the glory of God. Such offenses however do not seem to be mentioned here, but rather those which occur between friends and brethren, as strifes, slanders, and the like. Therefore He adds afterwards, If your brother trespass against you, rebuke him.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Vel dicit, quod necesse est emergere multa praedicationis et veritatis obstacula, sicut Pharisaei impediebant Christi praedicationem. Quaerunt autem aliqui: si necesse est ut veniant scandala, cur dominus arguit scandalorum auctorem? Sequitur enim vae autem illi per quem veniunt: quidquid enim parit necessitas veniale est. Sed attende, quod necessitas ista ex libero arbitrio sortitur originem. Videns enim dominus qualiter homines innituntur malo, nec proponunt aliquid boni, dixit quod quantum est ex consequentia eorum quae videntur, necesse est contingere scandala: sicut si medicus videns quemquam mala dieta utentem, dicat: necesse est hunc aegrotare; et ideo inducenti scandala vae dicit, et poenam ei comminatur, dicens utilius est illi si lapis molaris imponatur circa collum eius, et proiciatur in mare, quam ut scandalizet unum de pusillis istis.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Or, He says that there must arise many obstacles to preaching and to the truth, as the Pharisees hindered the preaching of Christ. But some ask, If it needs be that offenses should come, why does our Lord rebuke the author of the offenses? for it follows, But woe to him through when they came. For whatsoever necessity engenders is pardonable, or deserving of pardon. But observe, that necessity itself derives its birth from free-will. For our Lord, seeing how men cling to evil, and put forward nothing good, spoke with reference to the consequence of those things which are seen, that offenses must needs come; just as if a physician, seeing a man using an unwholesome diet, should say, It is impossible but that such a one should be sick. And therefore to him that causes offenses He denounces woe, and threatens punishment, saying, It were better for him that a mill-stone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, &amp;c.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Secundum morem provinciae Palaestinae loquitur; cum maiorum criminum apud veteres Iudaeos fuerit poena, ut in profundum ligato saxo demergerentur. Et revera utilius est innoxium poena, quamvis atrocissima, temporali tamen, vitam finire corpoream, quam fratri nocentem mortem animae mereri perpetuam. Recte autem qui scandalizari potest, pusillus appellatur: qui enim magnus est, quodcumque viderit, quodcumque passus fuerit, non declinat a fide. Inquantum ergo sine peccato possumus, evitare proximorum scandalum debemus. Si autem de veritate scandalum sumitur, utilius permittitur scandalum, quam veritas relinquatur.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; This is spoken according to the custom of the province of Palestine; for among the ancient Jews the punishment of those who were guilty of the greater crimes was that they should be sunk into the deep with a stone tied to them; and in truth it were better for a guilty man to finish his bodily life by a punishment however barbarous, yet temporal, than for his innocent brother to deserve the eternal death of his soul. Now he who can be offended is rightly called a little one; for he who is great, whatsoever he is witness of; and how great soever his sufferings, swerves not from the faith. As far then as we can without sin, we ought to avoid giving offense to our neighbors. But if an offense is taken at the truth, it is better to let the offense be, than that truth should be abandoned.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Per scandalizantis autem poenam bravium salvantis addisce: nisi enim unius animae salus esset sibi nimium curae, non comminaretur scandalizantibus tantam poenam.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But by the punishment of the man who offends, learn the reward of him who saves. For had not the salvation of one soul been of such exceeding care to Christ, he would not threaten with such a punishment the offender.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; After the parable of the rich man who is tormented in punishment, Christ added a commandment to give forgiveness to those who turn themselves from their trespasses, lest any one through despair should not be reclaimed from his fault; and hence it is said, Take heed to yourselves.

Et quoniam multae sunt scandalizantium differentiae: quidam enim sunt insanabiles, quidam sanabiles; ideo subiungit si peccaverit in te frater tuus, increpa illum; et si poenitentiam egerit, dimitte illi.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. As if He says, Offenses must needs come; but it does not follow that you must perish, if only you be on your guard: as it need not that the sheep should perish when the wolf comes, if the shepherd is watching. And since there are great varieties of offenders, (for some are incurable, some are curable,) He therefore adds, If your brother trespass against you, rebuke him.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Ut neque difficilis venia, nec remissa sit indulgentia: neque austera percellat invectio, vel conniventia non invitet ad culpam; unde et alibi dicitur: corripe ipsum inter te et ipsum solum: plus enim proficit amica correctio quam accusatio turbulenta. Illa pudorem incutit, haec indignationem movet. Servetur potius quod prodi metuat qui monetur: bonum quippe est ut amicum magis te qui corripitur credat, quam inimicum: facilius enim consiliis acquiescitur quam iniuriae succumbitur. Infirmus custos diuturnitatis est timor, pudor autem bonus magister officii: qui enim metuit reprimitur, non emendatur. Pulchre autem posuit si peccaverit in te: non enim est aequa conditio in Deum hominemque peccare.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; That there might neither be hard-wrung pardon, nor a too easy forgiveness, neither a harsh upbraiding, to dishearten, nor an overlooking of faults, to invite to sin; therefore it is said in another place, Tell him his fault between him and you alone. For better is a friendly correction, than a quarrelsome accusation. The one strikes shame into a man, the other moves his indignation. He who is admonished will more likely be saved, because he fears to he destroyed. For it is well that he who is corrected should believe you to be rather his friend than his enemy. For we have readily give ear to counsel than yield to injury. Fear us a weak preserver of consistency, but shame is an excellent master of duty. For he who fears is restrained, not amended. But He has well said, If he trespass against you. For it is not the same thing to shun against God and to sin against man.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Intuendum est autem, quia non passim peccanti dimittere iubet, sed poenitentiam agenti: hoc enim ordine scandala declinare possumus, si nullum laedamus, si peccantem zelo iustitiae corripimus, si poenitenti misericordiae viscera pandimus.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; But we must mark, that He does not bid us forgive every one who sins, but him only who repents of his sins. For by taking this course we may avoid offenses, hurting no one, correcting the sinner with a righteous zeal, extending the bowels of mercy to the penitent.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Sed quaereret aliquis: si cum pluries indulserim fratri, iterum fit nocivus, quid agendum est secum? Ideo quaestioni huic respondens subdit et si septies in die peccaverit in te, et septies in die conversus fuerit ad te dicens: poenitet me, dimitte illi.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. But some one may well ask, If when I have several times forgiven my brother he again trespass against me, what must I do with him? In answer therefore to this question He adds, And if he trespass against you seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to you, saying, I repent; forgive him.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; By using the number seven He assigns no bound to the giving of pardon, but commands us either to forgive all sins, or always to forgive the penitent. For by seven the whole of any thing or time is frequently represented.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. The disciples hearing our Lord discoursing of certain arduous duties, such as poverty, and avoiding offenses, entreat Him to increase their faith, that so they might be able to follow poverty, (for nothing so prompts to a life of poverty as faith and hope in the Lord,) and through faith to guard against giving offenses.

We may indeed understand that they asked for the increase of that faith by which men believe in the things which they see not; but there is further signified a faith in things, whereby not with the words only, but the things themselves present, we believe.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He mentions the mustard seed, because, though small in size, it is mightier in power than all the others. He implies then that the least part of faith can do great things. But though the Apostles did not transplant the mulberry tree, do not you accuse them; for our Lord said not, You shall transplant, but, You shall be able to transplant. But they did not, because there was no need, seeing that they did greater things.

But mystically by the mulberry tree, (whose fruit and branches are red with a blood-red color,) is represented the Gospel of the cross, which, through the faith of the Apostles being uprooted by the word of preaching from the Jewish nation, in which it was kept as it were in the lineal stock, was removed and planted in the sea of the Gentiles.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Or this is said because faith keeps out the unclean spirit, especially since the nature of the tree falls in with this meaning. For the fruit of the mulberry is at first white in the blossom, and being formed from thence grows red, and blackens as it gets ripe. The devil also having by transgression fallen from the white flower of the angelic nature and the bright beams of his power, grows terrible in the black odor of sin.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. The mulberry may be also compared to the devil, for as by the leaves of the mulberry tree certain worms are fed, so the devil, by the imaginations which proceed from him, is feeding for us a never dying worm; but this mulberry tree faith is able to pluck out of our souls, and plunge it into the deep.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Because faith makes its possessor a keeper of God’s commandments, and adorns him with wonderful works; it would seem from thence that a man might thereby fall into the sin of pride. Our Lord therefore forewarned His Apostles by a fit example, not to boast themselves in their virtues, saying, But which of you having a servant plowing, &amp;c.

          <td><b>Augustinus de quaest. Evang</b>: Vel aliter. Hanc ergo fidem praestantissimae veritatis plerisque non intelligentibus, videri potest dominus discipulis suis non ad id quod petierant respondisse. Difficile autem mihi apparet; nisi intelligamus ex fide in fidem, idest ex fide ista, qua ministratur Deo, in eam significasse transferri ubi fruantur Deo. Augebitur enim fides cum primo verbis praedicantibus, deinde rebus apparentibus creditur: sed illa contemplatio summam quietem habet, quae in aeterno Dei regno retribuitur. Summa vero quies illa praemium est iustorum laborum, qui in Ecclesiae administratione peraguntur: et ideo quamvis in agro aret servus aut pascat, hoc est in vita saeculari vel terrena verset negotia, vel stultis hominibus tamquam pecoribus serviat; opus est ut post illos labores domum veniat; hoc est Ecclesiae societur.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or else; To the many who understand not this faith in the truth already present, our Lord might seem not to have answered the petitions of His disciples. And there appears a difficulty in the connection here, unless we suppose He meant the change from faith to faith, from that faith, namely, by which we serve God, to that whereby we enjoy Him. For then will our faith be increased when we first believe the word preached, next the reality present. But that joyful contemplation possesses perfect peace, which is given to us in the everlasting kingdom of God. And that perfect peace is the reward of those righteous labors, which are performed in the administration of the Church. Be then the servant in the field ploughing, or feeding, that is, in this life either following his worldly business, or serving foolish men, as it were cattle, he must after his labors return home, that is, be united to the Church.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Vel servus de agro egreditur, cum intermisso ad tempus opere praedicandi, ad conscientiam doctorem recurrit, sua secum acta vel dicta retractans; cui non statim dominus dicit transi, de hac vita mortali; recumbe, idest in aeterna sede beatae vitae refovere.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Or the servant departs from the field when giving up for a time his work of preaching, the teacher retires into his own conscience, pondering his own words or deeds within himself. To whom our Lord does not at once say, Go from this mortal life, and sit down to meat, that is, refresh yourself in the everlasting resting-place of a blessed life.

          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Intelligitur enim quia nullus recumbit nisi ante transierit. Denique et Moyses ante transivit, ut magnum visum videret. Sicut ergo tu non solum non dicis servo tuo recumbe, sed exigis ab eo aliud ministerium; ita nec in te patitur dominus unius usum esse operis et laboris: quia dum vivimus, debemus semper operari; unde sequitur et non dicat ei: para quod coenem, et praecinge te, et ministra mihi, donec manducem et bibam?
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; For we know that no one sits down before he has first passed over. Moses indeed also passed over, that he might see a great sight. Since then you not only say to your servant, Sit down to meat, but require from him another service, so in this life the Lord does not put up with the performance of one work and labor, because as long as we live we ought always to work. Therefore it follows, And will not rather say, Make ready wherewith I may sup.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Iubet parari quod coenet, hoc est post laborem apertae locutionis humilitatem quoque considerationis propriae exhibere: tali coena dominus pasci desiderat. Praecingi autem est mentem humiliatam ab omnibus fluctuantium cogitationem finibus, quibus operum gressus impediri solet, constringere: nam qui vestimenta praecingit, hoc agit ne incedens involvatur ad lapsum. Ministrare vero Deo, est absque gratiae eius auxilio nihil virium habere profiteri.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; He bids make ready wherewith he may sup, that is, after the labors of public discourse, He bids him humble himself in self-examination. With such a supper our Lord desires to be fed. But to gird one’s self is to collect the mind which has been enfolded in the base coil of fluctuating thoughts, whereby its steps in the cause of good works are wont to be entangled. For he who girds up his garments does so, that in walking he may not be tripped up. But to minister to God, is to acknowledge that we have no strength without the help of His grace.

Non puto. Per hoc morbus superbiae tollitur. Quid superbis? Ignoras quod si non persolvis debitum, periculum imminet; si vero persolvas, nullam gratiam facis? Secundum illud Pauli: si evangelizavero, non est mihi gloria; necessitas enim mihi est: vae mihi si non evangelizavero.
            <p>Considera ergo, quod qui apud nos dominantur, non referunt gratias, cum aliqui subditorum statuta sibi prosequuntur obsequia; sed ex benevolentia saepius suorum provocantes affectum, maiorem eis appetitum serviendi aggenerant. Sic et Deus petit quidem a nobis famulatum iure servitii; verum, quia clemens et bonus est, honores laborantibus pollicetur; et supereminet sudoribus subiectorum benevolentiae magnitudo.
          <td>
            <b>CYRIL</b>; Our Lord teaches us that it is no more than the just and proper right of a master to require, as their bounder duty, subjection from servants, adding, Does he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not. Here then is the disease of pride cut away. Why boast you yourself? Do you know that if you pay not your debt, danger is at hand, but if you pay, you do nothing thank-worthy? As St. Paul says, For though I preach the Gospel I have nothing to glory of, for necessity is laid upon me, yea woe is to me if I preach not the Gospel.
            <p>Observe then that they who have rule among us, do not thank their subjects, when they perform their appointed service, but by kindness gaining the affections of their people, breed in them a greater eagerness to serve them. So likewise God requires from us that we should wait upon Him as His servants, but because He is merciful, and of great goodness, He promises reward to them that work, and the greatness of His loving-kindness far exceeds the labors of His servants.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">

The sun obeys, the moon submits herself, the angels are subject; let us not then seek praise from ourselves. Therefore He adds in conclusion, So likewise you, when you have done all good things, say, We are unprofitable servants, we have done that which it was our duty to do.

Coloris quippe vitium lepra est; vera ergo falsis inordinate permixta in una disputatione vel narratione hominis, tamquam in unius corporis colore apparentia, significant lepram, tamquam veris falsisque colorum fucis humana corpora variantem atque maculantem. Hi autem tam vitandi sunt Ecclesiae ut, si fieri potest, longius remoti magno clamore Christum interpellent. Quod autem praeceptorem eum invocaverunt, satis puto significari vere lepram falsam esse doctrinam, quam bonus praeceptor abstergat. Nullum autem eorum quibus haec corporalia beneficia dominus praestitit, invenitur misisse ad sacerdotem nisi leprosos. Sacerdotium enim Iudaeorum figura fuit sacerdotii quod est in Ecclesia. Cetera autem vitia per seipsum interius in conscientia dominus sanat et corrigit; doctrina vero vel imbuendi per sacramenta, vel catechizandi per sermonem potestas Ecclesiae tributa est. Qui dum irent, mundati sunt: quia gentiles, ad quos venerat Petrus, nondum accepto Baptismatis sacramento, per quod spiritualiter ad sacerdotes pervenitur, infusione spiritus sancti mundati declarantur. Quisquis ergo in Ecclesiae societate doctrinam integram veramque assequitur, eo quod manifestetur, varietate mendaciorum tamquam lepra caruisse, et tamen ingratus Deo mundatori suo gratiarum agendarum pia humilitate non prosternitur, similis est illis de quibus dicit apostolus quod cum Deum cognovissent, non ut Deum magnificaverunt, aut gratias egerunt. Ideo tales in novenario numero tamquam imperfecti remanebunt: novem enim indigent uno ut quadam unitatis forma coagulentur, ut decem sint. Ille autem qui gratias egit, unicae Ecclesiae significatione approbatus est. Et quia illi erant Iudaei, amisisse per superbiam declarati sunt regnum caelorum, ubi maxime unitas custoditur. Iste vero, qui erat Samaritanus, quod interpretatur custos, illi a quo accepit tribuens quod accepit, secundum illud: fortitudinem meam ad te custodiam, unitatem regni humili devotione servavit.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. The lepers may be taken mystically for those who, having no knowledge of the true faith, profess various erroneous doctrines. For they do not conceal their ignorance, but brazen it forth as the highest wisdom, making a vain show of it with boasting words. But since leprosy is a blemish in color, when true things appear clumsily mixed up with false in a single discourse or narration, as in the color of a single body, they represent a leprosy streaking and disfiguring as it were with true and false dyes the color of the human form. Now these lepers must be so put away from the Church, that being as far removed as possible, they may with loud shouts call upon Christ. But by their calling Him Teacher, I think it is plainly implied that leprosy is truly the false doctrine which the good teacher may wash away. Now we find that of those upon whom our Lord bestowed bodily mercies, not one did He send to the priests, save the lepers, for the Jewish priesthood was a figure of that priesthood which is in the Church. All vices our Lord corrects and heals by His own power working inwardly in the conscience, but the teaching of infusion by means of the Sacrament, or of catechizing by word of mouth, was assigned to the Church. And as they went, they were cleansed; just as the Gentiles to whom Peter came, having not yet received the sacrament of Baptism, whereby we come spiritual to the priests, are declared cleansed by the infusion of the Holy Spirit. Whoever then follows true and sound doctrine in the fellowship of the Church, proclaiming himself to be free from the confusion of lies, as it were a leprosy, yet still ungrateful to his Cleanser does not prostrate himself with pious humility of thanksgiving, is like to those of whom the Apostle says, that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, nor were thankful. Such then will remain in the ninth number as imperfect. For the nine need one, that by a certain form of unity they may be cemented together, in order to become ten. But he who gave thanks was approved of as a type of the one only Church. And since these were Jews, they are declared to have lost through pride the kingdom of heaven, wherein most of all unity is preserved. But the man who was a Samaritan, which is by interpretation “guardian,” giving back to Him who gave it that which he had received, according to the Psalm, My strength will I preserve for you, has kept the unity of the kingdom with humble devotion.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Cecidit autem in faciem, quia ex malis quae se perpetrasse meminit, erubescit: qui surgere et ire praecipitur: quia qui infirmitatem suam cognoscens humiliter iacet, per divini verbi consolationem ad fortia opera proficere iubetur. Si autem fides salvum fecit eum qui se ad agendas gratias inclinavit: ergo perfidia perdit eos qui de acceptis beneficiis Deo dare gloriam neglexerunt, quapropter fidem per humilitatem augeri debere, sicut in parabola superiori decernitur, ita hic ipsis rebus ostenditur.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; He fell upon his face, because he blushes with shame when he remembers the evils he had committed. And he is commended to rise and walk, because he who, knowing his own weakness, lies lowly on the ground, is led to advance by the consolation of the divine word to mighty deeds. But if faith made him whole, who hurried himself back to give thanks, therefore does unbelief destroy those who have neglected to give glory to God for mercies received. Wherefore that we ought to increase our faith by humility, as it is declared in the former parable, so in this is it exemplified in the actions themselves.

Praedicit ergo eis, quod antequam de caelo veniat, in fine saeculi persecutio irruet super eos; unde dicitur et ait ad discipulos suos: venient dies quando desideretis videre unum diem filii hominis, et non videbitis; significans quod tanta erit persecutio, quod unum diem eius videre cupiant, illius scilicet temporis quo adhuc conversabantur cum Christo. Sane Iudaei Christum multis angustiaverunt improperiis et iniuriis; sed in comparatione malorum maiorum minora eligenda videntur.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; When our Lord said, The kingdom of God is within you, He would fain prepare His disciples for suffering, that being made strong they might be able to enter the kingdom of God; He therefore foretells to them, that before His coming from heaven at the end of the world, persecution will break out upon them. Hence it follows, And he said to the disciples, The days will come, &amp;c. meaning that so terrible will be the persecution, that they would desire to see one of His days, that is, of that time when they yet walked with Christ. Truly the Jews ofttimes beset Christ with reproaches and insults, and sought to stone Him, and ofttimes would have hurled Him down film the mountain; but even these seem to be looked upon as slight in comparison of greater evils that are to come.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Tunc enim absque sollicitudine vivebant, Christo eos procurante, et protegente; sed futurum erat quando Christo absente traderentur periculis, ad reges et principes ducti; et tunc tempus primum cuperent quasi tranquillum.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. For their life was then without trouble, for Christ took care of them and protected them. But the time was coming when Christ should be taken away, and they should be exposed to perils, being brought before kings and princes, and then they should long for the first time and its tranquillity.

Bonum ergo est diem Christi desiderare. Nec tamen magnitudine desiderii nobis somnia fingere debemus, quasi instet dies domini; unde sequitur et dicent vobis: ecce hic, ecce illic: nolite ire, neque sectemini.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Or, by the day of Christ He signifies His kingdom, which we hope will come, and He lightly says, one day, because there shall no darkness disturb the glory of that blessed time. It is right then to long for the day of Christ, yet from the earnestness of our longing, let us not vision to ourselves as though the day were at hand. Hence it follows, And they shall say to you, Lo here! and, Lo there!

Non enim apparebit super terram ambulans, sicut quidam homo communis, sed universaliter irradiabit, ostendens cunctis iubar propriae deitatis.
          <td><b>EUSEBIUS</b>. As if he said, If at the coming of Antichrist, his fame shall be spread abroad, as though Christ had appeared, go not out, nor follow him. For it cannot be that He who was once seen on earth, shall any more dwell in the corners of the earth. It will therefore be he of whom we speak, not the true Christ. For this is the clear sign of the second coming of our Savior, that suddenly the luster of His coming shall fill the whole world; and so it follows, For as the lightning that lightens, &amp;c. For He will not appear walking upon the earth, as any common man, but will illuminate our whole universe, manifesting to all men the radiance of His divinity.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">

Si autem dominus in iudicio sicut fulgur apparebit, nullus tunc in sua mente latere permittitur: quia ipso iudicis fulgore penetratur. Potest autem haec domini responsio et de illo eius adventu quo quotidie venit in Ecclesiam accipi. Intantum enim saepe haeretici turbaverunt Ecclesiam, dicendo in suo dogmate fidem Christi manere, ut fideles illorum temporum desiderarent dominum, vel uno die, si fieri posset, redire ad terras, ut per seipsum quomodo se habeat fidei veritas, intimaret. Et non videbitis, inquit: quia non est opus corporali visione dominum redire: quia semel per universum mundum Evangelii vigorem exhibuit.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; And he well says, that lightens out of the one part under heaven, because the judgment will be given under the heaven, that is, in the midst of the air, as the Apostle says, We shall be caught up together with them in the clouds. But if the Lord shall appear at the Judgment like lightning, then shall no one remain hidden in the deep of his heart, for the very brightness of the Judge pierces through him; we may also take this answer of our Lord to refer to His coming, whereby He comes daily into His Church. For ofttimes have heretics so vexed the Church, by saying that the faith of Christ stands in their own dogma, that the faithful in those times longed that the Lord would if it were possible even for one day return to the earth, and Himself make known what was the true faith. And you shall not see it, because it need not that the Lord should again testify by a bodily presence that which has been spiritually declared by the light of the Gospel, once scattered and diffused throughout the whole world.

          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Opinabantur autem discipuli quod vadens Hierosolymam statim ostenderet regnum Dei.

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Now His disciples supposed that He would go to Jerusalem, and would at once make a manifestation of the kingdom of God. To rid them therefore of this belief, He informs them that it became Him first to suffer the Life-giving Passion, then to ascend to the Father and shine forth from above, that He might judge the world in righteousness. Hence He adds, But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation.

          <td><b>Beda</b>: Generationem non tantum Iudaeorum, verum etiam omnium reproborum appellat; a quibus etiam nunc filius hominis in corpore suo, hoc est in Ecclesia, multa patitur, et reprobatur.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; He means the generation not only of the Jews, but also of all wicked men, by whom even now in His own body, that is, His Church, the Son of man suffers many things, and is rejected. But while He spoke many things of His coming in glory, He inserts something also concerning His Passion, that when men saw Him dying, whom they had heard would be glorified, they might both soothe their sorrow for His sufferings by the hope of the promised glory, and at the same time prepare themselves, if they love the glories of His kingdom, to fool; without alarm upon the horrors of death.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. For refusing to believe the words of warning they were suddenly visited with a real punishment from God; but their unbelief proceeded from self-indulgence, and softness of mind. For such as a man’s wishes and inclinations are, will also be his expectations. Therefore it follows, they eat and drank.

          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Bene causam diluvii de nostris asserit processisse peccatis: quia Deus malum non creavit, sed nostra sibi merita reperierunt: non quia coniugia damnentur: neque enim alimenta damnantur, cum in istis successionis, in illis naturae subsidia sint; sed in omnibus modus quaeritur: quicquid enim abundantius est, a malo est.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; He rightly declares the deluge to have been caused by our sins, for God did not create evil, but our deservings found it out for themselves. Let it not however be supposed that marriages, or again meat and drink, are condemned, seeing that by the one succession is sustained, by the other nature, but moderation is to be sought for in all things. For whatsoever is more than this is of evil.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Now Noah builds the ark mystically. The Lord builds His Church of Christ’s faithful servants, by uniting them together in one, as smooth pieces of wood; and when it is perfectly finished, He enters it: as at the day of Judgment, He who ever dwells within His Church enlightens it with His visible presence. But while the ark is in building, the wicked flourish, when it is entered, they perish; as they who revile the saints in their warfare here, shall when they are crowned hereafter be smitten with eternal condemnation.

          <td><b>EUSEBIUS</b>. Having used the example of the deluge, that no one might expect a future deluge by water, our Lord cites, secondly, the example of Lot, to show the manner of the destruction of the wicked, namely, that the wrath of God would descend upon them by fire from heaven.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Passing by the unutterable wickedness of the Sodomites, He mentions only those which may be thought trifling offenses, or none at all; that you may understand how fearfully unlawful pleasures are punished, when lawful pleasures taken to excess receive for their reward fire and brimstone.

          <td><b>EUSEBIUS</b>. He does not say that fire came down from heaven upon the wicked Sodomites before that Lot went out from them, just as the deluge did not swallow up the inhabitants of the earth before that Noah entered the ark; for as long as Noah and Lot dwelt with the wicked, God suspended His anger that they might not perish together with the sinners, but when He would destroy those, He withdrew the righteous. So also at the end of the world, the consummation shall not come before all the just are separated from the wicked.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. For when Antichrist has come, then shall men become wanton, given up to abominable vices, as the Apostle says, Lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God. For if Antichrist is the dwelling-place of every sin, what else will he then implant in the miserable race of men, but what belongs to himself. And this our Lord implies by the instances of the deluge and the people of Sodom.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Mystice autem Lot, qui interpretatur declinans est populus electorum, qui dum in Sodomis, idest inter reprobos, ut advena, moratur, quantum valet, eorum scelera declinat. Exeunte autem Lot, Sodoma perit: quia in consummatione saeculi exibunt Angeli, et separabunt malos de medio iustorum, et mittent eos in caminum ignis. Ignis tamen et sulphur, quae de caelo pluisse commemorat, non ipsam perennis supplicii flammam, sed subitaneum diei illius significat adventum.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Now mystically, Lot, which is interpreted ‘turning aside,’ is the people of the elect, who, while in Sodom, i.e. among the wicked, live as strangers, to the utmost of their power turning aside from all their wicked ways. But when Lot went out, Sodom is destroyed, for at the end of the world, the angels shall go forth and sever the wicked from among the just, and cast them into a furnace of fire. The fire and brimstone, however, which He relates to have rained from heaven, does not signify the flame itself of everlasting punishment, but the sudden coming of that day.

Evang</b>: In tecto enim est qui excedens carnalia tamquam in aura libera spiritualiter vivit; vasa enim in domo sunt sensus carnales, quibus ad investigandum veritatem quae intellectu capitur, multi utentes, penitus erraverunt. Caveat ergo spiritualis homo ne in die tribulationis rursus vita carnali, quae per sensus corporis pascitur, delectatus, ad vasa huius mundi tollenda descendat. Sequitur et qui in agro similiter non redeat retro; idest, qui operatur in Ecclesia, sicut Paulus plantans, et sicut Apollo rigans, non respiciat spem saecularem, cui renuntiavit.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. For he is on the housetop who, departing from carnal things, breathes as it were the free air of a spiritual life. But the vessels in the house are the carnal senses, which many using to discover truth which is only taken in by the intellect, have entirely missed it. Let the spiritual man then beware, lest in the day of tribulation he again take pleasure in the carnal life which is fed by the bodily senses, and descend to take away this world’s vessels. It follows, And he that is in the field, let him not return back; that is, He who labors in the Church, as Paul planting and Apollos watering, let him not look back upon the worldly prospects which he has renounced.

          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Haec autem omnia Matthaeus pro captione Hierosolymorum a domino dicta fatetur, ut, supervenientibus Romanis, nec domi consistentes descendere deberent pro quocumque necessario, sed protinus arripere fugam, nec in agro manentes redire domum. Et nimirum in captione Hierosolymorum constat haec evenisse, et iterum fore ventura in Antichristi adventu; magis autem in ipso tempore consummationis, cum et tunc intolerabilis sit futura calamitas.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Matthew relates all these things to have been said by our Lord, with reference to the destruction of Jerusalem, that when the Romans came upon them, they who were on the housetop should not come down to take any thing, but fly at once, nor they that were in the field return home. And surely so it was at the taking of Jerusalem, and again will be at the coming of Antichrist, but much more at the completion of all things, when that intolerable destruction shall come.

          <td><b>Eusebius</b>: Innuit ergo per hoc futuram esse persecutionem a filio perditionis in Christi fideles. Diem igitur illam vocat tempus praecedens finem mundi; in quo qui fugit, non revertatur, et amittens bona non curet, nec imitetur coniugem Lot, qui post fugam in exitu de civitate Sodomorum reversa mortua est, et columna salis effecta; unde sequitur memores estote uxoris Lot.
          <td><b>EUSEBIUS</b>. He hereby implies that a persecution will come from the son of perdition upon Christ’s faithful. By that day then He means the time previous to the end of the world, in which let not him who is flying return, nor care to lose his goods, lest he imitate Lot’s wife, who when she deaf out of the city of Sodom, turning back, died, and became a pillar of salt.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Quae ideo quia retrospexit, perdidit naturae suae munus: retro enim Satanas, retro enim Sodoma. Quapropter fuge intemperantiam, declinato luxuriam, recordare quia ille qui se veteribus studiis non reflexit, ideo evasit quia pervenit ad montem; illa, quoniam ad posteriora respexit, nec mariti adiuta suffragio, ad montem pervenire potuit, sed remansit.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Because thus she looked behind, she lost the gift of her nature. For Satan is behind, behind also Sodom. Wherefore flee from intemperance, turn away from lust, for recollect, that he who turned not back to his old pursuits escaped, because he reached the mount; whereas she looking back to what was left behind, could not even by the aid of her husband reach the mount, but remained fixed.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de quaest. Evang</b>: Significat igitur uxor Lot eos qui in tribulatione retrospiciunt, et se a spe divinae promissionis avertunt: et ideo statua salis facta est ut admonendo homines ne hoc faciant, tamquam condiat cor eorum, ne sint fatui.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Lot’s wife represents those who in time of trouble look back and turn aside from the hope of the divine promise, and hence she was made a pillar of salt as a warning to men not to do likewise, and to season as it were their hearts, lest they become corrupt.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Consequenter subiungit subsequentia praemissorum, dicens quicumque quaesierit salvare animam, perdet illam: quasi dicat: non quaerat aliquis in persecutionibus Antichristi curare propriam animam; nam perdet eam; quisquis autem caedibus et periculis se dederit, salvus erit; unde sequitur et quicumque perdiderit illam, vivificabit eam; nequaquam se tyranno subiciens propter vitae amorem.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Next follows the promise, Whosoever shall seek, &amp;c. as if he said, Let no man in the persecutions of Antichrist seek to secure his life, for he shall lose it, but whoso shall expose himself to trials and death shall be safe, never submitting himself to the tyrant from his love of life.

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; How a man may lose his own life to save it, St. Paul explains when he speaks of some who crucified their flesh with the affections and lusts, that is, with perseverance and devotion engaging in the conflict.

But not all who abound in riches are wicked, but if one is good and elect in the faith, he will be taken, but another who is not so will be left. For when our Lord descends to judgment, He will send His Angels, who while they leave behind on the earth the rest to suffer punishment, will bring the holy and righteous men to Him; according to the Apostle’s words, We shall be caught up together in the clouds to meet Christ in the air.

For some nobly bear up against the burden of poverty, leading a lowly but honest life, and these shall be taken up; but the others are very active in wickedness, and they shall be left.

At vero sancta Ecclesia, vel anima nullis maculata contagiis delictorum, quae tale triticum molit quod solis aeterni calore torridum sit, bonam similaginem de penetralibus hominum Deo offert. Qui sint autem agricolae, possumus reperire, si advertamus duas mentes esse in nobis: unam exterioris hominis, quae corrumpitur; aliam interioris, quae per sacramentum renovatur. Istae igitur sunt operantes in agro nostro; quarum altera bonum fructum diligentia dat, altera amittit incuria. Vel duos populos interpretemur in hoc mundo, qui agro comparatur: quorum alter, qui fidelis est, assumitur; alter, qui infidelis est, relinquitur.
          <td>Or those grinding at the mill seem to represent such as seek nourishment from hidden sources, and from secret places draw forth things openly to view. And perhaps the world is a kind of corn mill, in which the soul is shut up as in a bodily prison. And in this corn mill either the synagogue or the soul exposed to sin, like the wheat, softened by grinding and spoilt by too great moisture, cannot separate the outward from the inner parts, and so is left because its flour dissatisfies. But the holy Church, or the soul which is not soiled by the stains of sin, which grinds such wheat as is ripened by the heat of the eternal sun, presents to God a good flour from the secret shrines of the heart. Who the two men in the field are we may discover if we consider, that there are two minds in us, one of the outer man which wastes away, the other of the inner man which is renewed by the Sacrament. These are then the laborers in the field, the one of which by diligence brings forth good fruit, the other by idleness loses that which he has. Or those who are compared we may interpret to be two nations, one of which being faithful is taken, the other being unfaithful is left.

Tertium genus est eorum qui operantur in Ecclesiae ministerio, tamquam in agro Dei.

The first is composed of those who prefer their ease and quiet, and busy not themselves in secular or ecclesiastical concerns. And this quiet life of theirs is signified by the bed. The next class embraces those who being placed among the people are governed by teachers. And such he has described by the name of women, because it is best for them to be ruled by the advice of those who are set over them; and he has described these as grinding at the mill, because in their hands revolves the wheel and circle of temporal concerns. And with reference to these matters he has represented them as grinding together, inasmuch as they give their services to the benefit of the Church. The third class are those who labor in the ministry of the Church as in the field of God. In each of these three classes then there are two sorts of men, of which the one abide in the Church and are taken up, the other fall away and are left.

Nonne tibi videntur aquilae circa corpus, quando veniet in nubibus, et videbit eum omnis oculus? Est autem corpus, de quo dictum est: caro mea vere est cibus.

And do not you see the eagles around, the body are the women and Apostles gathered together around our Lord’s sepulcher? Do not you see them then, When he shall come in the clouds, and every eye shall behold him? But the body is that of which it was said, My flesh is meat indeed; and around this body are the eagles which fly about on the wings of the Spirit, around it also eagles which believe that Christ has come in the flesh.

Our Lord utters His parables, either for the sake of the comparison, as in the instance of the creditor, who when forgiving his two debtors all that they owed him was most loved by him who owed him most; or on account of the contrast, from which he draws his conclusion; as, for example, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith. So also here when he brings forward the case of the unjust judge.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Vide quod impudentem erga homines esse, gravioris est mali indicium: Deum enim quamplures non timent, attamen humano cohibentur pudore, et ideo minus peccant; cum vero fit aliquis impudens etiam quoad homines, tunc excrescit cumulus vitiorum. Sequitur vidua autem quaedam erat in illa civitate.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. We may observe, that irreverence towards man is a token of a greater degree of wickedness. For as many as fear not God, yet are restrained by their shame before men, are so far the less sinful; but when a man becomes reckless also of other men, the burden of his sins is greatly increased. It follows, And there was a widow in that city.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Ista vidua potest habere similitudinem Ecclesiae, quae desolata videtur donec veniat dominus, qui nunc in secreto curam eius gerit. Sed quia sequitur et veniebat ad eum dicens: vindica me de adversario meo. Et nolebat per multum tempus, hic monet cur electi Dei se vindicare deprecentur, quod etiam in Apocalypsi Ioannis de martyribus dicitur, cum apertissime moneamur ut pro nostris inimicis et persecutoribus oremus. Intelligendum est autem eam vindictam esse iustorum ut omnes mali pereant. Pereunt autem duobus modis: aut conversione ad iustitiam, aut amissa per supplicium potestate. Itaque si omnes homines convertentur ad Deum, Diabolus tamen remaneret in saeculi fine damnandus; quem finem cum iusti videre desiderant, non absurde vindictam desiderare dicuntur.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. The widow may be said to resemble the Church, which appears desolate until the Lord shall come, who now secretly watches over her. But in the following words, And she came to him, saying, Avenge me, &amp;c. we are told the reason why the elect of God pray that they may be avenged; which we find also said of the martyrs in the Revelations of St. John, though at the same time we are very plainly reminded to pray for our enemies and persecutors. This avenging of the righteous then we must understand to be, that the wicked may perish. And they perish in two ways, either by conversion to righteousness, or by punishment having lost the opportunity of conversion. Although, if all men were converted to God, there would still remain the devil to be condemned at the end of the world. And since the righteous are longing for this end to come, they are not unreasonably said to desire vengeance.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Vel aliter. Quoties nobis ab aliquibus irrogantur offensae, tunc gloriosam esse putabimus oblivionem malorum: quoties vero aliquid ad ipsam Dei gloriam peccant, contra dogmatis divini ministros bellantes, tunc Deum adimus postulantes subsidium, et exclamantes contra impugnantes gloriam eius.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Or else; Whenever men inflict injury upon us, we must then think it a noble thing to be forgetful of the evil; but when they offend against the glory of God by taking up arms against the ministers of God’s ordinance, we then approach God imploring His help, and loudly rebuking them who impugn His glory.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Apud iniquissimum ergo iudicem usque ad effectum implendi desiderii valuit trahere perseverantia deprecantis; unde sequitur post haec autem dixit intra se: etsi Deum non timeo, neque hominem revereor, tamen quia molesta est mihi haec vidua, vindicabo illam, ne in novissimo veniens sugillet me. Multo igitur certiores esse debent qui Deum perseveranter rogant, fontem iustitiae atque misericordiae; unde sequitur ait autem dominus: audite quid iudex iniquitatis dicat. Deus autem non faciet vindictam electorum suorum clamantium ad se die ac nocte et patientiam habebit in illis?
          <td><b>AUG</b>. If then with the most unjust judge, the perseverance of the suppliant at length prevailed even to the fulfillment of her desire, how much more confident ought they to feel who cease not to pray to God, the Fountain of justice and mercy? And so it follows. And the Lord said, Hear what, &amp;c.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Quasi dicat: si iudicem imbutum quolibet scelere demulsit assiduitas, quanto magis patrem misericordiae Deum flectemus ad pietatem orando? Unde sequitur dico autem vobis, quia cito faciet vindictam illorum. Tentaverunt autem quidam subtilius hanc indagare parabolam; dicunt enim viduam esse quamlibet animam quae pristinum virum, scilicet Diabolum, excludit, ob hoc ei adversantem quod accedit ad Deum iustitiae iudicem; qui neque Deum timet, nam ipse solus est Deus; sed nec veretur hominem, non est enim apud Deum personarum acceptio. Huius igitur viduae, idest animae supplicantis, iugiter sibi contra Diabolum miseretur Deus, demulcente eum instantia eius. Postquam autem dominus docuit quod utendum sit in tempore consummationis oratione pro tunc futuris periculis, subdit verumtamen filius hominis veniens, putas, inveniet fidem in terra?
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. As if He said, If perseverance could melt a judge defiled with every sin, how much more shall our prayers incline to mercy God the Father of all mercies! But some have given a more subtle meaning to the parable, saying, that the widow is a soul that has put off the old man, (that is, the devil,) who is her adversary, because she approaches God, the righteous Judge, who neither fears (because He is God alone) nor regards man, for with God there is no respect of persons. Upon the widow then, or soul ever supplicating Him against the devil, God shows mercy, and is softened by her importunity. After having taught us that we must in the last days resort to prayer because of the dangers that are coming, our Lord adds, Nevertheless, when the Son of man comes, shall he find faith on the earth?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Verb. Dom</b>: Dicit autem dominus de fide quae perfecta est: ipsa enim vix invenitur in terra. Ecce plena est Ecclesia Dei: quis huc accederet, si nulla esset fides: quis non montes transferret, si plena esset fides?
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Our Lord speaks this of perfect faith, which is seldom found on earth. See how full the Church of God is; were there no faith, who would enter it? Were there perfect faith, who would not move mountains?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Cum autem omnipotens conditor in forma filii hominis apparuerit, tanta erit raritas electorum, ut non tam ob clamorem fidelium, quam torporem aliorum, totius mundi sit acceleranda ruina. Quod autem dominus hic quasi dubitative dicit, non dubitat, sed arguit: nam et nos aliquando de rebus quas certas habemus, increpative verbum dubitationis promimus; ut si dicatur servo: considera, forsitan dominus tuus sum.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; When the Almighty Creator shall appear in the form of the Son of man, so scarce will the elect be, that not so much the cries of the faithful as the torpor of the others will hasten the world’s fall. Our Lord speaks then as it were doubtfully, not that He really is in doubt, but to reprove us; just as we sometimes, in a matter of certainty, might use the words of doubt, as, for instance, in chiding a servant, “Remember, am I not your master?”
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Hoc autem dominus adicit, ut ostendat quod si fides deficit, oratio perit. Ergo ut oremus credamus, et ut ipsa fides non deficiat oremus. Fides fundit orationem, fusa oratio fidei impetrat firmitatem.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Our Lord adds this to show, that when faith fails, prayer dies. In order to pray then, we must have faith, and that our faith fail not, we must pray. Faith pours forth prayer, and the pouring forth of the heart in prayer gives steadfastness to faith.

          <td><b>Augustinus de Verb. Dom</b>: Quia fides non est superborum, sed humilium, praemissis subiecit parabolam de humilitate, et contra superbiam; unde dicitur dixit autem et ad quosdam qui in se confidebant tamquam iusti, et aspernabantur ceteros, parabolam istam.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Since faith is not a gift of the proud but of the humble, our Lord proceeds to add a parable concerning humility and against pride.

          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Quia enim superbia plus quam aliae passiones vexat hominum mentes, ideo crebrius de hac monet.

Causa igitur confidentium in seipsis, non autem totum attribuentium Deo, sed ob hoc etiam ceteros contemnentium, parabolam proponit, ostendens quod iustitia quamvis hominem approximet Deo, si tamen assumat superbiam, ad infimum deicit hominem; unde sequitur duo homines ascenderunt in templum ut orarent: unus Pharisaeus, et alter publicanus.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Pride also beyond all other passions disturbs the mind of man. And hence the very frequent warnings against it. It is moreover a contempt of God; for when a man ascribes the good he does to himself and not to God, what else is this but to deny God? For the sake then of those that so trust in themselves, that they will not ascribe the whole to God, and therefore despise others, He puts forth a parable, to show that righteousness, although it may bring man up to God, yet if he is clothed with pride, casts him down to hell.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Graecus</b>: Diligentiam quidem orationis docuit nos per viduam et iudicem; hic autem per Pharisaeum et publicanum docet nos quomodo sint ei dirigenda precamina, ne sit infructuosum orationis negotium.

          <td><b>GREEK EX</b>. To be diligent in prayer was the lesson taught by our Lord in the parable of the widow and the judge, He now instructs us how we should direct our prayers to Him, in order that our prayers may not be fruitless. The Pharisee was condemned because he prayed heedlessly. As it follows, The Pharisee stood and prayed with himself.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Per hoc quod dicit stans, elatum eius animum notat: ipso enim habitu superbissimus videbatur.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. It is said “standing,” to denote his haughty temper. For his very posture betokens his extreme pride.

          <td><b>Basilius</b>: Dicit autem apud se orabat; quasi non apud Deum, quia ad seipsum redibat per peccatum superbiae; sequitur enim Deus, gratias ago tibi.
          <td><b>BASIL</b>; “He prayed with himself,” that is, not with God, his sin of pride sent him back into himself. It follows, God, I thank you.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Non reprehenditur quia Deo gratias agebat, sed quia nihil sibi addi cupiebat. Ergo iam plenus es, iam abundas; non est quare dicas: dimitte nobis debita nostra. Quis est igitur qui impune oppugnat gratiam, si reprehenditur qui superbe agit gratias? Audiant qui dicunt: Deus me hominem fecit; ego me iustum facio. O peior et detestabilior Pharisaeo, qui superbe iustum se dicebat, sed tamen inde gratias Deo agebat.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. His fault was not that he gave God thanks, but that he asked for nothing further. Because you are full and abound, you have no need to say, Forgive us our debts. What then must be his guilt who impiously fights against grace, when he is condemned who proudly gives thanks? Let those hear who say, “God has made me man, I made myself righteous. O worse and more hateful than the Pharisee, who proudly called himself righteous, yet gave thanks to God that he was so.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Attende autem seriem orationis Pharisaei. Primo namque dixit quae ei aberant, deinde subiungit quae habebat; sequitur enim quia non sum sicut ceteri hominum, raptores, iniusti, adulteri.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Observe the order of the Pharisee’s prayer. He first speaks of that which he had not, and then of that which he had. As it follows, That I am not as other men are.

          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Diceret saltem: sicut multi homines. Quid est ceteri homines, nisi omnes praeter ipsum? Ego, inquit, iustus sum, ceteri peccatores.

          <td><b>Gregorius Moralium</b>: Quatuor quippe sunt species quibus omnis tumor arrogantium demonstratur: cum bonum aut a semetipsis habere se aestimant; aut si sibi datum desuper credunt, pro suis se hoc accepisse meritis putant; aut certe cum iactant se habere quod non habent; aut despectis ceteris singulariter videri appetunt habere quod habent; unde et Pharisaeus hic bonorum sibi operum merita singulariter tribuit.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. There are different shapes in which the pride of self-confident men presents itself; when they imagine that either the good in them is of themselves; or when believing it is given them from above, that they have received it for their own merits; or at any rate when they boast that they have that which they have not. Or lastly, when despising others they aim at appearing singular in the possession of that which they have. And in this respect the Pharisee awards to himself especially the merit of good works.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Ecce autem ex vicino publicano maioris erat ei tumoris occasio; sequitur enim velut etiam hic publicanus; quasi dicat: ego solus sum, iste de ceteris est.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. See how he derives from the Publican near him a fresh occasion for pride. It follows, Or even as this Publican; as if he says, “I stand alone, he is one of the others.”

          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Non enim satiaverat contemptum eius tota humana natura, sed et publicanum aggressus est. Moderatius autem peccasset, si publicanum excepisset; nunc autem uno verbo et absentes invadit, et vulnera praesentis lacessit. Non est autem gratiarum actio invectiva aliorum. Si regratiaris Deo, ipse tibi tantum sufficiat, nec te ad homines transferas, nec proximum condemnes.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. To despise the whole race of man was not enough for him; he must yet attack the Publican. He would have sinned, yet far less if he had spared the Publican, but now in one word he both assails the absent, and inflicts a wound on him who was present. To give thanks is not to heap reproaches on others. When you returns thanks to God, let Him be all in all to you. Turn not your thoughts to men, nor condemn your neighbor.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Basilius</b>: Discrepat autem elatus a conviciatore sola habitudine: is enim in alios utitur conviciis, hic autem se mentis temeritate extollit.
          <td><b>BASIL</b>; The difference between the proud man and the scorner is in the outward form alone. The one is engaged in reviling others, the other in presumptuously extolling: himself.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Qui autem aliis conviciatur, sibi et aliis multa mala facit. Primo enim audientem reddit peiorem: quia si sit peccator, fit laetior, criminis invento collega; si sit iustus, extollitur, per aliena crimina inductus de se magna putare. Secundo communitatem Ecclesiae laedit: non enim omnes audientes vituperant eum solum qui peccavit, sed ritui Christiano contumelias innectunt. Tertio Dei gloriam blasphemare facit: sicut enim nobis recte agentibus nomen Dei glorificatur, sic nobis peccantibus blasphematur. Quarto eum qui audivit opprobria, confundit, impudentiorem eum et adversarium faciens. Quinto statuit se poenae obnoxium, rebus prolatis quae sibi non conveniunt.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He who rails at others does much harm both to himself and others. First, those who hear him are rendered worse, for if sinners they are made glad in finding one as guilty as themselves, if righteous, they are exalted, being led by the sins of others to think more highly of themselves. Secondly, the body of the Church suffers; for those who hear him are not all content to blame the guilty only, but to fasten the reproach also on the Christian religion. Thirdly, the glory of God is evil spoken of for as our well-doing makes the name of God to be glorified, so our sins cause it to be blasphemed. Fourthly, the object of reproach is confounded and becomes more reckless and immovable. Fifthly, the ruler is himself made liable to punishment for uttering things which are not seemly.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Expedit autem non solum declinare a malo, sed etiam agere bonum; et ideo cum dixisset: non sum sicut adulteri, subiungit per oppositum ieiuno bis in sabbato. Sabbatum hi dicebant hebdomadam ab ultima die quietis. Ieiunabant enim Pharisaei secunda et quinta feria. Sic igitur ieiunia obiecit contra passionem adulterii: nam ex voluptate est lascivia. Rapacibus vero et iniustis opposuit decimarum solutionem; sequitur enim decimas do omnium quae possideo; quasi dicat: adeo rapinas et nequitias refugio ut etiam mea contribuam.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. It becomes us not only to shun evil, but also to do good; and so after having said, I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, he adds something by way of contrast, I fast twice in a week. They called the week the Sabbath, from the last day of rest. The Pharisees fasted upon the second and fifth day. He therefore set fasting against the passion of adultery, for lust is born of luxury; but to the extortioners and usurists he opposed the payment of tithes; as it follows, I give tithes of all I possess; as if he says, So far am I from indulging in extortion or injuring, that I even give up what is my own.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius Moralium</b>: Ecce civitatem cordis sui insidiantibus hostibus per elationem aperuit, quam frustra per ieiunium et orationem clausit. Incassum munita sunt cetera, cum locus unus, de quo hosti patet aditus, munitus non est.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. So it was pride that laid bare to his wily enemies the citadel of his heart, which prayer and fasting had in vain kept closed. Of no use are all the other fortifications, as long as there is one place which the enemy has left defenseless.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Quaere autem in verbis eius: nihil invenies quod Deum rogaverit: ascendit quidem orare, noluit Deum rogare, sed se laudare, et roganti insultare. Publicanum autem cordis conscientia removebat, sed pietas applicabat; unde sequitur et publicanus a longe stans nolebat nec oculos ad caelum levare.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. If you look into his words, you will find that he asked nothing of God. He goes up indeed to pray, but instead of asking God, praises himself; and even insults him that asked. The Publican, on the other hand, driven by his stricken conscience afar off, is by his piety brought near.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Quamvis autem publicanus stetisse dicatur, distabat tamen a Pharisaeo tam verbis quam habitu, nec non et corde contrito: nam verebatur oculos levare in caelum, censens indignos visionis supernae eos qui maluerunt bona terrena spectare et quaerere; necnon et pectus tundebat; unde sequitur sed percutiebat pectus suum, cor quodammodo pungens causa cogitationum pravarum, nec non et excitans ut dormitans: unde non aliud quam Deum propitiatorem petebat; sequitur enim dicens: Deus, propitius esto mihi peccatori.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Although reported to have stood, the Publican yet differed from the Pharisee, both in his manner and his words, as well as in his having a contrite heart. For he feared to lift up his eyes to heaven, thinking unworthy of the heavenly vision those which had loved to gaze upon and wander after earthly things. He also smote his breast, striking it as it were because of the evil thoughts, and moreover rousing it as if asleep. And thus he sought only that God would be reconciled to him, as it follows, saying, God, be merciful.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Audivit quia non sum velut hic publicanus, nec indignatus est, sed compunctus: detexit ille vulnus, quaerit hic medicinam. Nemo igitur illud frigidum proferat verbum: non audeo, pudorosus sum, non possum aperire os. Talis reverentia est diabolica: vult enim Diabolus obserare tibi fores accessus ad Deum.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He heard the words, that I am not as the Publican. He was not angry, but pricked to the heart. The one uncovered the wound, the other seeks for its remedy. Let no one then ever put forth so cold an excuse as, I dare not, I am ashamed, I cannot open my mouth. The devils have that kind of fear. The devil would fain close against you every door of access to God.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Quid igitur miraris si Deus ignoscit, quando ipse agnoscit? De longinquo stabat; Deo tamen appropinquabat, et eum dominus de prope attendebat: excelsus enim dominus, et humilia respicit; nec oculos ad caelum levabat ut respiceret; tremebat conscientia, spes sublevabat; percutiebat pectus suum, poenas de seipso exigebat: propterea dominus confitenti parcebat. Audisti superbum accusatorem, audisti humilem reum: audi nunc iudicem dicentem amen dico vobis: descendit hic iustificatus in domum suam ab illo.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Why then marvel you, whether God pardons, since He himself acknowledges it. The Publican stood afar off, yet drew near to God. And the Lord was nigh to him, and heard him, For the Lord is on high, yet has he regard to the lowly. He lifted not so much as his eyes to heaven; that he might be looked upon, he looked not himself. Conscience weighed him down, hope raised him up, he smote his own breast, he exacted judgment upon himself. Therefore did the Lord spare the penitent. You have heard the accusation of the proud, you have heard the humble confession of the accused. Hear now the sentence of the Judge: Verily I say to you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Geminos aurigas et duas bigas in stadio positas sermo praesens proponit: in altera peccatum et humilitatem: et vides bigam peccati superare iustitiam, non propriis virtutibus, sed humilitatis coniunctae; illam vero devictam non fragilitate iustitiae, sed mole et tumore superbiae: nam sicut humilitas per sui eminentiam peccati pondus superat, et saliens attingit Deum; sic superbia ob sui molem de facili iustitiam deprimit. Si ergo plura facta strenue geras, putas autem te posse praesumere, tota caruisti oratione; si vero mille feras in conscientia fasces reatuum, et hoc solum de te credas quod es infimus omnium, multam obtinebis ante Deum fiduciam. Et ideo suae sententiae causam assignans subdit quia omnis qui se exaltat, humiliabitur; et qui se humiliat, exaltabitur. Humilitatis nomen multiplex est. Est enim quaedam virtus humilitas, iuxta illud: cor contritum et humiliatum, Deus, non despicies. Est et humilitas ab aerumnis, iuxta illud: humiliavit in terra vitam meam. Est et humilitas a peccatis et superbia et insatiabilitate divitiarum: quid enim humilius his qui se submittunt in divitiis et potentatu, et haec reputant magna?
          <td><b>CHRYS</b> This parable represents to us two chariots on the race course, each with two charioteers in it. In one of the chariots it places righteousness with pride, in the other sin and humility. You see the chariot of sin outstrip that of righteousness, not by its own strength but by the excellence of humility combined with it, but the other is defeated not by righteousness, but by the weight and swelling of pride. For as humility by its own elasticity rises above the weight of pride, and leaping up reaches to God, so pride by its great weight easily depresses righteousness. Although therefore you are earnest and constant in well doing, yet think you may boast yourself, you are altogether devoid of the fruits of prayer. But you that bear a thousand loads of guilt on your conscience, and only think this thing of yourself that you are the lowest of all men, shall gain much confidence before God. And He then goes on to assign the reason of His sentence. For every one who exalts himself shall be abased, and he that humbles himself shall be exalted. The word humility has various meanings. There is the humility of virtue, as, A humble and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise. There is also a humility arising from sorrows, as, He has humbled my life upon the earth. There is a humility derived from sin, and the pride and insatiability of riches. For can anything be more low and debased than those who grovel in riches and power, and count them great things?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Basilius</b>: Similiter etiam et exaltari laudabiliter contingit, quando scilicet non humilia cogitas, sed mens tua est per magnanimitatem in virtutem erecta. Talis autem animi celsitudo est eminentia in tristitiis, terrenorum contemptus, conversatio in caelis: et videtur huiusmodi mentis sublimitas eamdem habere differentiam ad elationem quam arrogantia parit, quam habet corpulentia corporis bene dispositi ad inflationem carnis cum ex hydropisi tumet.
          <td><b>BASIL</b>; In like manner it is possible to be honorably elated when your thoughts indeed are not lowly, but your mind by greatness of soul is lifted up towards virtue. This loftiness of mind is seen in a cheerfulness amidst sorrow or a kind of noble dauntlessness in trouble, a contempt of earthly things, and a conversation in heaven. And this loftiness of mind seems to differ from that elevation which is engendered of pride, just as the stoutness of a well-regulated body differs from the swelling of the flesh which proceeds from dropsy.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Haec igitur fastus inflatio ab ipsis caelis potest deprimere non caventem; humilitas vero et ab ipsa abysso reatuum hominem sublimare: haec enim prae Pharisaeo publicanum salvavit, latronem ante apostolos in Paradisum duxit; illa vero etiam incorpoream ingressa est potestatem. Ceterum si iuncta delicto humilitas tam facile currit, ut superbiam iustitiae transeat; si iustitiae coniunxeris eam, quomodo non ibit? Assistet ipsa tribunali divino in medio Angelorum cum fiducia multa. Rursus si fastus coniunctus iustitiae eam deprimere potuit, si coniunctus sit peccato, in quantam Gehennam detrudet? Hoc dico, non ut negligamus iustitiam, sed ut fastum vitemus.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. This inflation of pride can cast down even from heaven the man that takes not warning, but humility can raise a man up from the lowest depth of guilt. The one saved the Publican before the Pharisee, and brought the thief into Paradise before the Apostles; the other entered even into the spiritual powers. But if humility though added to sin has made such rapid advances, as to pass by pride united to righteousness, how much swifter will be its course when you add to it righteousness? It will stand by the judgment-seat of God in the midst of the angels with great boldness. Moreover if pride joined to righteousness had power to depress it, to what a hell will it thrust men when added to sin? This I say not that we should neglect righteousness, but that we should avoid pride.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Sed forsitan mirabitur aliquis, quomodo Pharisaeus, cum pauca verba suae laudis protulerit, condemnatur; Iob vero cum plurima fuderit, coronatur. Eo scilicet quod Pharisaeus talia dicebat criminando alios, nulla ratione cogente; Iob vero, urgentibus eum amicis, et pressuris prementibus, coactus est proprias virtutes referre ad Dei gloriam, ne homines desisterent a profectu virtutis.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. But should any one perchance marvel that the Pharisee for uttering a few words in his own praise is condemned, while Job, though he poured forth many, is crowned, I answer, that the Pharisee spoke these at the same time that he groundlessly accused others; but Job was compelled by an urgent necessity to enumerate his own virtues for the glory of God, that men might not fall away from the path of virtue.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Typice autem Pharisaeus est populus Iudaeorum, qui ex iustificationibus legis extollit merita sua; publicanus vero gentilis est, qui longe a Deo positus, confitetur peccata sua; quorum unus superbiendo recessit humiliatus, alter lamentando appropinquare meruit exaltatus.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Typically, the Pharisee is the Jewish people, who boast of their ornaments because of the righteousness of the law, but the Publican is the Gentiles, who being at a distance from God confess their sins. Of whom the one for His pride returned humbled, the other for his contrition was thought worthy to draw near and be exalted.

          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Durum autem aliquibus videri potest quod discipuli dominum infantulos adire prohibebant; sequitur enim quod cum viderent discipuli, increpabant illos. Ubi vel mysterium intelligas, vel affectum. Neque enim hoc invidia aut in pueros mentis asperitate faciebant; sed sedulae servitutis obsequia domino deferebant, ne comprimeretur a turbis. Respuenda quippe est utilitas nostra ubi divinitatis iniuria est. In mysterio autem, quia prius salvari populum Iudaeorum, ex quo secundum carnem nati fuerant, gestiebant. Sciebant quidem mysterium quod utrisque populis vocatio deberetur: nam et pro Chananaea muliere supplicarunt; sed fortasse adhuc ordinem nesciebant; unde sequitur Iesus autem convocans eos dixit: sinite parvulos venire ad me, et nolite vetare eos: talium est enim regnum Dei. Non aetas praefertur aetati: alioquin obesset adolescere. Cur ergo pueros dicit aptos esse regno caelorum? Fortasse quia malitiam nesciant, fraudare non noverint, referire non audeant, scortari ignorent, opes, honorem, ambitionem non appetant. Sed non ignorare ista, virtus est, sed contemnere: non enim virtus est non posse peccare, sed nolle. Non igitur pueritia, sed aemula puerilis simplicitatis bonitas designatur.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; It may be thought strange by some that the disciples wished to prevent the little children from coming to our Lord, as it is said, when they saw it, they rebuked them. But we must understand in this either a mystery, or the effect of their love to Him. For they did it not from envy or harsh feeling towards the children, but they manifested a holy zeal in their Lord’s service, that he might not be pressed by the crowds. Our own interest must be given up where an injury is threatened to God. But we may understand the mystery to be, that they desired the Jewish people to be first saved, of whom they were according to the flesh. They knew indeed the mystery, that to both nations the call was to be made, (for they entreated for the Canaanitish woman,) but perhaps they were still ignorant of the order. It follows, But Jesus called them to him, and said, Suffer little children, &amp;c. One age is not preferred to another, else it were hurtful to grow up. But why does He say that children are fitter for the kingdom of heaven? It is because they are ignorant of guile, are incapable of theft, dare not return a blow, are unconscious of lust, have no desire for wealth, honors, or ambition. But to be ignorant of these things is not virtue, we must also despise them. For virtue consists not in our inability to sin, but in our unwillingness. Childhood then is not meant here, but that goodness which rivals the simplicity of childhood.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Unde signanter dixit talium, non istorum, ut ostenderet non aetatem regnare, sed mores; et his qui similem haberent innocentiam et simplicitatem, praemia repromitti.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; If Hence our Lord pointedly says, of such, not “of these,” to show that to character, not to age, is the kingdom given, and to such as have a childlike innocence and simplicity is the promise of the reward.

          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Denique hoc salvator expressit dicens amen dico vobis: quicumque non acceperit regnum Dei sicut puer, non intrabit in illud. Quis puer imitandus est apostolis Christi, nisi de quo Isaias dixit: puer natus est nobis, qui cum malediceretur, non maledicebat? Itaque in pueritia est quaedam venerabilis morum senectus, et in senectute innocens pueritia.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Lastly, our Savior expressed this when He said, Verily I say to you, Whoever will not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, &amp;c. What child were Christ’s Apostles to imitate but Him of whom Esaias speaks, Unto us a Child is given? Who when He was reviled, reviled not again. So that there is in childhood a certain venerable antiquity, and in old age a childlike innocence.

Quomodo non bonus, cum bonitatis suae substantia ex patre assumpta non degeneravit in filio, quae non degeneravit in spiritu? Spiritus tuus bonus deducet me in terram rectam. Quod si bonus spiritus qui accepit a filio, bonus utique et ille qui tradidit. Itaque quia legisperitus est iste qui tentat, sicut in libro alio demonstratur, ei bene dixit nemo bonus nisi unus Deus: ut admoneret, quia scriptum est: non tentabis dominum Deum tuum; sed magis confiteretur domino, quoniam bonus.

But should it strike any one that it is said, none is good, let this also strike him, save God, and if the Son is not excepted from God, surely neither is Christ excepted from good. For how is He not good who is born from good? A good tree brings forth good fruits. How is He not good, seeing that the substance of His goodness which He took to Him from the Father has not degenerated in the Son which did not degenerate in the Spirit. Your good spirit, he says, shall lead me into a land of uprightness. But if the Spirit is good who received from the Son, verily He also is good who gave It. Because then it was a lawyer who tempted Him, as is plainly strewn in another book, He therefore well said, None is good, save God, that He might remind him that it was written, You shall not tempt the Lord your God, but he the rather gives thanks to the Lord that He is good.

I am learned in the Old Testament, but I see in you something far more excellent. For you make no earthly promises, but preach the kingdom of heaven. Tell me then, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? The Savior then considering his meaning, because faith is the way to good works, passes over the question he asked, and leads him to the knowledge of faith; as if a man was to ask a physician, “What shall I eat?” and he was to show him what ought to go before his food. And then He sends him to His Father, saying, Why call you me good? not that He was not good, for He was the good branch from the good tree, or the good Son of the good Father.

But you may observe that these commandments consist in not doing certain things; that if you have not committed adultery, you are chaste; if you steal not, honestly disposed; if you bear not false witness, truth-telling.

Sequitur qui ait: haec omnia custodivi a iuventute mea.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Honor is concerned not only with paying respect, but also with giving bountifully. For it is honoring to reward deserts. Feed your father, feed your mother, and when you have fed them you have not requited all the pangs and agony your mother underwent for you. To the one you owe all you have, to the other all you are. What a condemnation, should the Church feed those whom you are able to feed! But it may be said, What was going to bestow upon my parents, I prefer to give to the Church. God seeks not a gift which will starve your parents, but the Scripture says as well that parents are to be fed, as that they are to be left for God’s sake, should they check the love of a devout mind. It follows, And he said, All these things have I kept from my youth up.

          <td><b>Hieronymus</b>: Mentitur adolescens. Si enim quod postpositum est in mandatis: diliges proximum tuum sicut teipsum, opere complesset, quomodo postea audiens: vade, et vende omnia quae habes, et da pauperibus, tristis abscessit?
          <td><b>JEROME</b>; The young man speaks false, for if he had fulfilled that which was afterwards placed among the commandments, You shall love your neighbor as yourself, how was it that when he heard, Go and sell all that you have, and give to the poor, he went away sorrowful?

          <td><b>Beda</b>: Vel non est putandus esse mentitus, sed simpliciter ut vixerit, scilicet exterius, esse confessus: alioquin nequaquam Marcus diceret quod Iesus intuitus eum dilexit eum.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Or we must not think him to have lied, but to have avowed that he had lived honestly, that is, at least in outward things, else Mark could never have said, And Jesus seeing him, loved him.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Titus</b>: Ostendit autem consequenter dominus quod si aliquis vetus testamentum peregit, perfectus non est, sed deest ei sequi Christum; unde subditur quo audito Iesus ait ei: adhuc unum tibi deest: omnia quaecumque habes vende, et da pauperibus, et habebis thesaurum in caelo; quasi dicat: quaeris quomodo sit possidenda vita aeterna: sparge facultates pauperibus, et obtinebis illam. Parva sunt quae impendis, magna quae recipis.
          <td><b>TITUS BOST</b>. Our Lord next declares, that though a man has kept the old covenant, he is not perfect, since he lacks to follow Christ. You yet lack one thing, Sell all that you have, &amp;c. As if He says, you ask how to possess eternal life; scatter your goods among the poor, and you shall obtain it. A little thing is that you spend, you receive great things.

          <td><b>Athanasius</b>: Non enim mundum despicientes putemus grandia quidem abdicasse, quia tota terra est in comparatione caeli brevissima: quapropter si toti terrae dominaremur, ei abrenuntiantes, nihil dignum esset in comparatione regni caelorum.
          <td><b>ATHAN</b>. For when we despise the world, we must not imagine we have resigned any thing great, for the whole earth in comparison of the heaven is but a span long; therefore even should they who renounce it be lords of the whole earth, yet still it would be nothing worth in comparison of the kingdom of heaven.

          <td><b>BASIL</b>; He does not tell us to sell our goods, because they are by nature evil, for then they would not be God’s creatures; He therefore does not bid us cast them away as if they were bad, but distribute them; nor is any one condemned for possessing them, but for abusing them. And thus it is, that to lay out our goods according to God’s command both blots out sins, and bestows the kingdom.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Poterat quidem Deus alere pauperes et sine hoc quod nos misereremur eorum; sed vult dantes dilectione astringi accipientibus.

          <td><b>BASIL</b>; When our Lord says, Give to the poor, it becomes a man no longer to be careless, but diligently to dispose of all things, first of all by himself if in any measure he is able, if not, by those who are known to be faithful, and prudent in their management; for cursed is he who does the work of the Lord negligently.

Sed valde consonat quod subiunxit et veni, sequere me: quod ostenditur ex dilectione esse: in hoc enim cognoscent omnes quod mei estis discipuli, si dilectionem habueritis ad invicem.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But it is asked, how does Christ acknowledge the giving all things to the poor to be perfection, whereas St. Paul declares this very thing without charity to be imperfect. Their harmony is shown in the words which succeed, And come, follow me, which betokens it to be from love. For herein shall all men know that you are my disciples, if you have love one toward another.

          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Quoniam dives, audita opum abiectione, tristatus fuit, dominus admiranter locutus est; dicit enim videns autem Iesus illum tristem factum, dixit: quam difficile qui pecunias habent in regnum Dei intrabunt. Non dicit: impossibile est eos intrare, sed difficile; possunt enim per divitias adipisci superna, sed difficile est: quia viscosiores sunt visco divitiae, et vix evellitur animus occupatus ab eis: sed subsequenter ut impossibile hoc indicat, cum dicit facilius est enim camelum per foramen acus transire, quam divitem intrare in regnum Dei. Nam sive per camelum animal intelligas, sive funem nauticum crassum; quocumque modo impossibile est quod foramen acus totum capiat camelum. Si igitur facilius est camelum per foramen acus transire quam divitem salvari, et hoc quod facilius est, impossibile est; impossibilius ergo est salvari divitem. Quid igitur dicendum? Equidem quod vere sic habet, divitem servari non posse. Neque mihi dicas, quod salvatus sit dives quispiam, qui sua dederit: non enim dives salvatus est, sed quia pauper factus, vel dispensator existens servatus est, non dives. Aliud est enim dispensator, aliud dives: dives est qui sibi divitias reservat, dispensator vero cui divitiae propter alios concreditae sunt.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Our Lord, seeing that the rich man was sorrowful when it was told him to surrender his riches marveled, saying, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God! He says not, It is impossible for them to enter, but it is difficult. For they might through their riches reap a heavenly reward, but it is a hard thing, seeing that riches are more tenacious than birdlime, and hardly is the soul ever plucked away, that is once seized by them. But he next speaks of it as impossible. It is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye. The word in the Greek answers equally to the animal called the camel, and to a cable, or ship rope. However we may understand it, impossibility is implied. What must we say then? First of all that the thing is positively true, for we must remember that the rich man differs from the steward, or dispenser of riches. The rich man is he who reserves his riches to himself, the steward or dispenser one who holds them entrusted to his care for the benefit of others.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Abraham quidem possidebat opes pauperibus; et qui iuste eas possident, quasi suscipientes a Deo dispensant in divinis mandatis; qui vero contra Deum acquisierunt, et in expendendo faciunt illud idem, meretricibus et parasitis dantes, vel humi abscondentes, egenis vero nihil impendentes. Non ergo prohibet ditari, sed opibus famulari: vult necessariis ut eis utamur, non ut custodiamus: nam famuli est custodire, sed domini dispensare. Si conservari eas vellet, non tradidisset eas hominibus, sed sineret in terra iacere.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Abraham indeed possessed wealth for the poor. And all they who righteously possess it, spend it as receiving it from God, according to the divine command, while those who have acquired wealth in an ungodly way, are ungodly in their use of it; whether in squandering it on harlots or parasites, or hiding it in the ground, but sparing nothing for the poor. He does not then forbid men to be rich, but to be the slaves of their riches. He would have us use them as necessary, not keep guard over them. It is of a servant to guard, of a master to dispense. Had he wished to preserve them, He would never have given them to men, but left them to remain in the earth.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Porro attendas illud quod divitem quidem impossibile dicit salvari, possidentem vero divitias difficile; quasi dicat: dives, qui captus est a divitiis, et famulatur eis, non salvabitur; habens vero illas, scilicet qui eis dominatur, vix salvabitur causa humanae fragilitatis. Conatur enim nos Diabolus supplantare quoadusque possidemus divitias, et difficile est aufugere decipulas eius: ideoque bonum est paupertas, et quasi tentatione carens.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Again, observe that He says, a rich man can not possibly be saved, but one who possesses riches hardly; as if he said, The rich man who has been taken captive by his riches, and is a slave to them, shall not be saved; but he who possesses or is the master of them shall with difficulty be saved, because of human infirmity. For the devil is ever trying to make our foot slip as long as we possess riches, and it is a hard matter to escape his wiles. Poverty therefore is a blessing, and as it were free from temptation.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Nulla enim est divitiarum commoditas, anima patiente penuriam; nec laesio paupertatis, anima divitiis affluente. Si autem ditescentis indicium est nullius egere, et pauperascentis indigere; palam est quod magis esse pauperem facit magis ditescere: facilius est enim quod quis in paupertate quam in divitiis opes contemnat: neque enim talis est ambitus ut per magis habere sedetur; sed per hoc consuevit magis accendi, sicut ignis quando maiorem suscipit escam. Quae autem mala videntur esse inopiae, communia sunt; quae vero divitiarum, propria sunt earum.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. There is no profit in riches while the soul suffers poverty, no hurt in poverty, while the soul abounds in wealth. But if the sign of a man waxing rich is to be in need of nothing and of becoming poor to be in want, it is plain that the poorer a man is, the richer he grows. For it is far easier for one in poverty to despise wealth, than for the rich. Nor again is avarice wont to be satisfied by having more, for thereby are men only the more inflamed, just as a fire spreads, the more it has to feed upon. Those which seem to be the evils of poverty, it has in common with riches, but the evils of riches are peculiar to them.

          <td><b>Augustinus de quaest. Evang</b>: Divitem ergo hic appellat cupidum rerum temporalium, et de talibus superbientem. His divitibus contrarii sunt pauperes spiritu, quorum est regnum caelorum. Mystice autem facilius est Christum pati pro dilectoribus saeculi, quam dilectores saeculi ad Christum posse converti. Cameli enim nomine se intelligi voluit, quia sponte humiliatus infirmitatis nostrae onera sustulit. Per acum autem punctiones significat, per punctiones dolores in passione susceptos; foramen autem acus dicit angustiam passionis.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. The name of “rich” he here gives to one who covets temporal things, and boasts himself in them. To such rich men are opposed the poor in spirit, of whom is the kingdom of heaven. Now mystically it is easier for Christ to suffer for the lovers of this world, than for the lovers of this world to be converted to Christ. For by the name of a camel He would represent Himself: for He voluntarily humbled Himself to bear the burdens of our infirmity. By the needle He signifies sharp piercings, and thereby the pangs received in His Passion, but by the form of the needle He describes the straitening of the Passion.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Matthaeum</b>: Hic autem sermo quasi gravis transcendebat discipulorum virtutem; unde sequitur et dixerunt qui haec audiebant: et quis potest salvus fieri? Hoc dixerunt discipuli, non de se, sed de toto mundo timentes.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. These weighty words so far exceeded the capacity of the disciples, that when they heard them, they asked, Who then can be saved? not that they feared for themselves, but for the whole world.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Cum autem incomparabiliter maior sit turba pauperum, quae, divitibus perditis, potest salvari; intellexerunt, omnes qui divitias amant, etiam si adipisci nequeant, in divitum numero deputari. Sequitur ait illis: quae impossibilia sunt apud homines, possibilia sunt apud Deum: quod non ita intelligendum est, quasi dives cum cupiditate et superbia in regnum Dei sit intraturus; sed possibile est Deo ut a cupiditate et superbia ad caritatem et humilitatem convertatur.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Seeing that there is an incomparably greater number of poor which might be saved by forsaking their riches, they understood that all who love riches, even though they cannot obtain them, were to be counted among the number of the rich. It follows, And he said to them, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God, which must not be taken as if a rich man with covetousness and pride might enter into the kingdom of God, but that it is possible with God for a man to be converted from covetousness and pride, to charity and humility.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Apud homines ergo, quorum serpit intentio ad terrena, impossibilis est salus, ut dictum est; apud Deum vero possibilis est. Cum enim homo consiliarium habet Deum, et iustificationes et doctrinas paupertatis imbiberit, necnon eius auxilium invocet, hoc fiet possibile.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. With men therefore whose thoughts creep earthward, salvation is impossible, but with God it is possible. For when man shall have God for his counselor, and shall have received the righteousness of God and His teaching concerning poverty, as well as have invoked His aid, this shall be possible to him.

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; The rich man who has despised many things will naturally expect a reward, but he who possessing little resigns what he has, may fairly ask what there is in store for him; as it follows, Then Peter said, lo, we have left all. Matthew adds, What shall we have therefore?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Quasi dicat: fecimus quod iussisti: quid igitur dabis nobis praemii? Et quia non sufficit dimittere omnia, iungit quod perfectum est, dicens et secuti sumus te.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; As if he says, We have done what you command us, what reward then will you give us? And because it is not enough to have left all things, he adds that which made it perfect, saying, And have followed you.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Illud autem necesse est dicere, quod paucis abrenuntiantes, quantum spectat ad propositum et obedientiam, pari lance cum opulentis penduntur, paribus utentes affectibus, dum rerum quas possident abiectionem ultro inferunt; unde sequitur amen dico vobis: nemo est qui reliquerit domum aut parentes aut fratres aut uxores aut filios aut agros propter regnum Dei, et non recipiat multo plura in hoc tempore, et in saeculo futuro vitam aeternam. Elevat ad acceptissimam spem omnes audientes, iureiurando promittens, dum apponit sermoni amen. Doctrina enim divina mundum vocante ad fidem Christi, forsitan aliqui respicientes parentes infideles, noluerunt eos turbare veniendo ad fidem; et similis est ratio aliorum germanorum. Deserunt autem quidam patrem et matrem, et totius parentelae amorem despiciunt propter amorem Christi.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; It was necessary to say this, because those who forsake a few things, as far as regards their motives and obedience, are weighed in the same balance with the rich, who have forsaken all, inasmuch as they act from the like affections, in voluntarily making a surrender of all that they possess. And therefore it follows, Verily I say to you, there is no man that has left house, &amp;c. who shall not receive manifold more, &amp;c. He inspires all who hear Him with the most joyful hopes, confirming His promises to them with an oath, beginning His declaration with Verily. For when the divine teaching invites the world to the faith of Christ, some perhaps regarding their unbelieving parents are unwilling to distress them by coming to the faith, and have the like respect of others of their relations; while some again forsake their father and mother, and hold lightly the love of their whole kindred in comparison of the love of Christ.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Sensus igitur iste est: qui propter regnum Dei inquirendum omnes affectus contempserit, omnes saeculi divitias, delicias risusque calcaverit, multo plura in praesenti recipiet. Cuius sententiae occasione, quidam Iudaicam mille annorum fabulam post resurrectionem iustorum aedificant, quando omnia quae propter Deum dimittimus, multiplici nobis sint fenore reddenda, et insuper vita aeterna donanda: nec vident inexperti, quod si in ceteris digna sit repromissio, in uxoribus tamen, iuxta alios Evangelistas centenis, appareat turpitudo; praesertim cum dominus in resurrectione non esse nubendum testetur; et iuxta Marcum, ea quae dimissa fuerint, in hoc tempore cum persecutionibus accipienda confirmet, quasi in illis mille annis abesse dogmatizant.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; The sense then is this; He who in seeking the kingdom of God has despised all earthly affections, has trampled under foot all riches, pleasures, and smiles of the world, shall receive far greater in the present time. Upon the ground of this declaration, some of the Jews build up the fable of a millennium after the resurrection of the just, when all things which we have given up for God’s sake shall be restored with manifold interest, and eternal life be granted. Nor do they from their ignorance seem to be aware, that even if in other things there might be a fit promise of restoration, yet in the matter of wives, who might be according to some Evangelists an hundred fold, it would be manifestly shocking, especially since our Lord declares that in the resurrection there will be no marrying. And according to Mark, those things which have been given up, He declares shall be received at this time with persecutions, which these Jews assert will be absent for a thousand years.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Hoc ergo dicimus, quod omissis temporalibus et carnalibus, multo maiora sibi aliquis vindicabit: quoniam et apostoli, cum pauca dimiserint, obtinuerunt multiplicia dona charismatum, et celebres reputati sunt ubique. Erimus ergo similes illis: si domum quis dimittat, recipiet mansiones supernas, si patrem, patrem habebit caelestem; si a germanis recesserit, in fratrem hunc recipiet Christus; cum dimiserit coniugem, inveniet divinam sapientiam, a qua procreabit spiritales fructus, inveniet Ierusalem caelestem, quae est mater nostra; a fratribus etiam et a sororibus sui propositi glutino spirituali colligatis, multo in hac vita gratiosiorem recipiet caritatem.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; This then we say, that he who gives up all worldly and carnal things will gain for himself far greater, inasmuch as the Apostles, after leaving a few things, obtained the manifold gifts of grace, and were accounted great every where. We then shall be like to them. If a man has left his home, he shall receive an abiding place above. If his father, he shall have a Father in heaven. If he has forsaken his kindred, Christ shall take him for a brother. If he has given up a wife, he shall find divine wisdom, from which he shall beget spiritual offspring. If a mother, he shall find the heavenly Jerusalem, who is our mother. From brethren and sisters also united together with him by the spiritual bond of his will, he shall receive in this life far more kindly affections.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He speaks with His disciples apart, concerning His Passion. For it was not fitting to publish this word to the multitudes, lest they should be troubled, but to His disciples He foretold it, that being habituated by expectation, they might be the more able to bear it.

Sed et resurrectionem eius David praedixit dicens: non derelinques animam meam in Inferno. Unde hic subditur et tertia die resurget.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Esaias prophesied of this when he said, I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting. The Prophet also foretold the crucifixion, saying, He has poured out his soul to death, and was numbered with the transgressors; as it is said here, And after they have scourged him, they shall put him to death. But David foretold Christ’s resurrection, For you shall not leave my soul in hell, and so it is here added, And on the third day he shall rise again.

          <td><b>Isidorus</b>: Admiror autem dementiam quaerentium cur Christus ante triduum resurrexit: si enim resurgeret tardius quam praedixerat, impotentiae esset; celerius vero est summae virtutis indicium. Si quem enim cum spoponderit suo creditori post triduum persolvere debitum, eadem die satisfacientem viderimus; non fallacem, sed potius ut veridicum eum mirabimur. Dicam etiam quod non dixit se post tres dies resurrecturum, sed die tertia. Habes parasceven, habes sabbatum usque ad solis occasum; et post sabbatum resurrexit.
          <td><b>ISIDORE PELEUS</b>; I marvel at the folly of those who ask how Christ rose again before the three days. If indeed He rose later than he had foretold, it were a mark of weakness, but if sooner, a token of the highest power. For when we see a man who has promised his creditor that he will pay him his debt after three days, fulfilling his promise on that very day, we are so far from looking upon him as deceitful, that we admire his veracity. I must add, however, that He said not that He should rise again after three days, but on the third day. You have then the preparation, the Sabbath until sun set, and the fact that He rose after the Sabbath was over.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; For because they desired His life above all things, they could not hear of His death, and as they knew him to be not only a spotless man, but also very God, they thought He could in no wise die. And whenever in the parables, which they frequently heard Him utter, He said any thing concerning His Passion, they believed it to be spoken allegorically, and referred to something else. Hence it follows, And this saying was hid; from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken. But the Jews, who conspired against His life, knew that He spoke concerning His Passion, when he said, The Son of man must be lifted up; therefore said they, We have heard in our law that Christ abides for ever, and how say you the Son of man must be lifted up?

          <td><b>Augustinus de quaest.

De numero quidem nulla esset quaestio, si alter Evangelistarum de uno tacuisset, unius reminiscens: nam et Marcus unum commemorat, cum et egredientibus eis ab Iericho dicit illuminatum; cuius et nomen dixit et patrem, ut intelligamus eum fuisse potissimum, alterum ignotum, ut merito ille notus etiam solus decenter commemoraretur. Sed quoniam quae sequuntur in Evangelio secundum Lucam, aptissime ostendunt illud quod ipse narrat, adhuc venientibus ipsis Iericho factum esse, nihil aliud restat intelligere, nisi bis esse factum hoc miraculum; semel in uno caeco, cum adhuc veniret in illam civitatem; iterum in duobus, cum inde egrederetur: ut illud unum Lucas, alterum Matthaeus enarret.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. We might understand the expression of being nigh to Jericho, as if they had already gone out of it, but were still near. It might, though less common in this sense, be so taken here, since Matthew relates, that as they were going out of Jericho, two men received their sight who sat by the way side. There need be no question n about the number, if we suppose that one of the Evangelists remembering only one was silent about the other Mark also mentions only one, and he too says that he received his sight as they were going out of Jericho; he has given also the name of the man and of his father, to let us understand that this one was well known, but the other not so, so that it might come to pass that the one who was known would be naturally the only one mentioned. But seeing that what follows in St. Luke’s Gospel most plainly proves the truth of his account, that while they were yet coming to Jericho, the miracle took place, we cannot but suppose that there were two such miracles, the first upon one blind man when our Lord was coming to that city, the second on two, when He was departing out of it; Luke relating the one, Matthew the other.

Et oculati quidem secundum opinionem loquebantur; sequitur enim dixerunt autem ei, quod Iesus Nazarenus transiret. Caecus vero vera clamabat: alia docetur, et alia praedicat; nam sequitur et clamavit dicens: Iesu fili David, miserere mei. Quis te docuit haec, o homo? Num perlegisti libros privatus luminibus? Unde igitur nosti luminare mundi? Vere dominus illuminat caecos.
          <td><b>PSEUDO-CHRYS</b>. There was a great multitude gathered round Christ, and the blind man indeed knew Him not, but felt a drawing towards Him, and grasped with his heart what his sight embraced not. As it follows, And when he heard the multitude passing by, he asked what it was. And those that saw spoke indeed according to their own opinion. And they told him that Jesus of Nazareth passes by. But the blind man cried out. He is told one thing, he proclaims another; for it follows, And he cried out, saying, Jesus, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me. Who taught you this, O man? Have you that are deprived of sight read books? Whence then know you the Light of the world? Verily the Lord gives sight to the blind.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: In Iudaismo autem nutritus non ignoravit quod de progenie David Deus secundum carnem nasceretur; et ideo ei ut Deo loquitur, dicens miserere mei. Hunc imitentur qui in duo dividunt Christum: hic enim Christum tamquam Deum adit, et filium David eum nominat. Mirentur autem instantiam confessionis eius: quidam enim eum confitentem fidem compescebant. Sequitur et qui praeibant increpabant eum ut taceret. Sed per inhibitiones huiusmodi non impediebatur eius audacia. Novit enim fides omnibus repugnare et in omnia triumphare: utile enim est pro cultu divino pudorem deponere: nam si causa pecuniae sunt impudentes nonnulli, pro animae salute non decet bonam induere impudentiam? Unde sequitur ipse vero multo magis clamabat: fili David, miserere mei. Sistit autem Christum vox invocantis in fide, et invocantes in fide respicit; et ideo merito vocat caecum, et accedere iussit; unde sequitur stans autem Iesus iussit illum adduci ad se, ut scilicet qui prius fide eum tetigerat, appropinquaret et corpore. Appropinquantem caecum dominus interrogat; nam sequitur et cum appropinquasset, interrogavit illum, dicens: quid tibi vis faciam? Dispensative interrogat, non quasi ignorans; sed ut scirent astantes quod non petebat pecuniam, sed divinam efficaciam, ut a Deo; unde sequitur at ille dixit: domine, ut videam.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Having been brought up a Jew, he was not ignorant that of the seed of David should God be born according to the flesh, and therefore he addresses Him as God, saying, Have mercy upon me. Would that those might imitate him who divide Christ into two. For he speaks of Christ as God, yet calls Him Son of David. But they marvel at the justice of his confession, and some even wished to prevent him from confessing his faith. But by checks of this kind his ardor was not damped. For faith is able to resist all, and to triumph over all. It is a good thing to lay aside shame in behalf of divine worship. For if for money’s sake some ale bold, is it not fitting when the soul is at stake, to put on a righteous boldness? As it follows, But he cried out the more, Son of David, &amp;c. The voice of one invoking in faith stops Christ, for He looks back upon them who call upon Him in faith. And accordingly He calls the blind man to Him, and bids him draw nigh, that he in truth who had first laid hold on Him in faith, might approach Him also in the body. The Lord asks this blind man as he drew near, What will you that I shall do? He asks the question purposely, not as ignorant, but that those who stood by might know that he sought not money, but divine power from God. And thus it follows, But he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Vel quia calumniatores veritatis Iudaei possent dicere, ut in caeco nato: non est hic, sed similis eius; voluit ut caecus prius ostenderet defectum naturae, et tunc cognoscat gratiae maiestatem. At ubi petitionis modum caecus explicuit, tunc cum summa maiestate praecepit ei ut videret: unde sequitur et dixit illi Iesus: respice: quod redundabat in crimen perfidiae Iudaeorum: quis enim prophetarum talia dixit? Aspice tamen quid assumat medicus ab eo cui collata est sanitas; sequitur enim fides tua te salvum fecit. Pro fide enim venduntur beneficia; diffunditur enim gratia quam suscepit fides. Et sicut ab aliquo fonte hi quidem parvis vasis modicum aquae hauriunt, hi vero maioribus multum, fonte non distinguente mensuras; et secundum fenestras quae aperiuntur magis vel minus, splendor solis infunditur; ita secundum capacitatem intentionis hauritur gratia. Vertitur autem vox Christi in lucem languentis; erat enim verbum verae lucis; unde sequitur et confestim vidit. At caecus et ante beneficium fidem ostendit fervidam, et post beneficium benevolentiam observavit; sequitur enim et sequebatur illum magnificans Deum.
          <td><b>PSEUDO-CHRYS</b>. Or because the Jews perverting the truth might say, as in the case of him who was born blind, This is not he, but one like to him, He wished the blind first to make manifest the infirmity of his nature, that then he might fully acknowledge the greatness of the grace bestowed upon him. And as soon as the blind man explained the nature of his request, with words of the highest authority He commanded him to see. As it follows, And Jesus said to him, Receive your sight. This served only still more to increase the guilt of unbelief in the Jews. For what prophet ever spoke in this way? Observe moreover what the physician claims from him whom he has restored to health. Your faith has saved you. For faith then mercies are sold. Where faith is willing to accept, there grace abounds. And as from the same fountain some in small vessels draw little water, while others in large draw much, the fountain knowing no difference in measure; and as according to the windows which are opened, the sun sheds more or less of its brightness within; so according to the measure of a man’s motives does he draw down supplies of grace. The voice of Christ is changed into the light of the afflicted. For He was the Word of true light. And thus it follows, And immediately he said. But the blind man as before his restoration he showed an earnest faith, so afterwards did he give plain tokens of his gratitude; And he followed him, glorifying God.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; From which it is clear, that he was released from a double blindness, both bodily and intellectual. For he would not have glorified Him as God, had he not truly seen Him as He is. But he also gave occasion to others to glorify God; as it follows, And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.

          <td><b>PSEUDO-CHRYS</b>. We may here well inquire, why Christ forbids the healed demoniac who wished to follow Him, but permits the blind man who had received his sight. There seems to be a good reason for both the one case and the other. He sends away the former as a kind of herald, to proclaim aloud by the evidence of his own state his benefactor, for it was indeed a notable miracle to see a raving madman brought to a sound mind. But the blind man He allows to follow Him, since He was going up to Jerusalem about to accomplish the high mystery of the Cross, that men having a recent report of a miracle might not suppose that He suffered so much from helplessness as from compassion.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; In the blind man we have a type of the Gentile people, who have received by the Sacrament of our Lord the brightness of the light which they had lost. And it matters not whether the cure is conveyed in the case of one or two blind men, inasmuch as deriving their origin from Ham and Japhet, the sons of Noah, in the two blind men they put forward two authors of their race.

Dum igitur conditor noster appropinquat Iericho, caecus ad lumen redit: quia dum divinitas defectum nostrae carnis suscepit, humanum genus lumen quod amiserat recepit. Qui ergo aeternae lucis claritatem nescit, caecus est. Si autem tantum redemptorem credidit, qui dixit: ego sum via, iuxta viam sedet: si vero credidit, et exorat ut aeternum lumen recipiat, iuxta viam sedet et mendicat. Illi autem qui Iesum venientem praecedunt, designant carnalium desideriorum turbas, tumultusque vitiorum, qui priusquam Iesus ad cor nostrum perveniat, dissipant cogitationem nostram, et in ipsa nos nostra oratione conturbant. Ipse vero magis clamabat: quia quanto graviori tumultu cogitationum premimur, tanto orationi insistere ardentius debemus. Cum autem adhuc turbas phantasmatum in oratione patimur, Iesum aliquatenus transeuntem sentimus; cum vero orationi vehementer insistimus, Deus in corde figitur, et lux amissa reparatur. Vel transire humanitatis est, stare divinitatis. Caecum igitur clamantem dominus transiens audivit, stans illuminavit: quia per humanitatem suam vocibus nostrae caecitatis compatiendo misertus est, sed lumen nobis gratiae per divinitatis potentiam infundit.

          <td><b>GREG</b>. Or, blindness is a symbol of the human race, which in our first parent knowing not the brightness of heavenly light, now suffers the darkness of his condemnation. Jericho is interpreted ‘the moon,’ whose monthly wanings represent the feebleness of our mortality. While then our Creator is drawing nigh to Jericho, the blind is restored to sight, because when God took upon Him the weakness of our flesh, the human race received back the light which it had lost. He then who is ignorant of this brightness of the everlasting light, is blind. But if he does no more than believe in the Redeemer who said, I am the way, the truth, and the life; he sits by the way side. If he both believes and prays that he may receive the everlasting light, he sits by the way side and begs. Those that went before Jesus, as He was coming, represent the multitude of carnal desires, and the busy crowd of vices which before that Jesus comes to our heart, scatter our thoughts, and disturb us even in our prayers. But the blind man cried out the more; for the more violently we are assailed by our restless thoughts, the more fervently ought we to give ourselves to prayer. As long as we still suffer our manifold fancies to trouble us in our prayers, we feel in some measure Jesus passing try. But when we are very steadfast in prayer, God is fixed in our heart, and the lost light is restored. Or to pass by is of man, to stand is of God. The Lord then passing by heard the blind man crying, standing still restored him to sight, for by His humanity in compassion to our blindness He has pity upon our cries, by the power of His divinity He pours upon us the light of His grace. Now for this reason He asks what the blind man wished, that He might stir up his heart to prayer, for He wishes that to be sought in prayer, which He knows beforehand both that we seek and He grants.

Si quis enim Iesum videt, non potest nequitiis immorari. Duo autem erant impedimenta huic visioni: nam retardabat eum populus, non tam virorum quam peccatorum; erat autem parvus statura; unde sequitur et non poterat prae turba, quia statura pusillus erat.
          <td><b>TITUS BOST</b>. The seed of salvation had begun to spring up in him, for he desired to see Jesus, having never seen Him. For if he had seen Him, he would long since have given up the Publican’s wicked life. No one that sees Jesus can remain any longer in wickedness. But there were two obstacles to his seeing Him. The multitude not so much of men as of his sins prevented him, for he was little of stature.

Now Zacchaeus desired no more than to see, but He who is able to do more than v e ask for, granted to Him far above what he expected; as it follows, And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him.

Insons cum sontibus conversatur; fons iustitiae cum avaritia, quae est materia pravitatis: ingressus domum publicani, nullam ex avaritiae nebula iniuriam patitur, sed fulgore iustitiae avaritiam delet. Sed mordaces et criminationis amatores invehi tentant in his quae ab eo fiebant; sequitur enim et cum viderent omnes, murmurabant, dicentes quod ad hominem peccatorem divertisset. Ipse vero incusatus ut epulo et publicanorum amicus, spernebat haec, ut consummaret propositum: quia et medicus nisi patiatur saniem aegrotorum, non liberat a morbo; quod et tunc contigit, quoniam conversus est publicanus, et factus est melior. Sequitur stans autem Zachaeus, dixit ad Iesum: ecce dimidium bonorum meorum, domine, do pauperibus; et si quid aliquem defraudavi, reddo quadruplum. Audi mirabile. Nondum didicit, et obedit; et sicut sol per radios infusus in domum non illustrat verbo, sed opere; ita salvator radiis iustitiae, nequitiae fugavit caliginem: nam lux in tenebris lucet. Quodlibet autem unitum est validum, divisum autem debile; et ideo bipartit substantiam. Est autem diligentius attendendum, quod opes Zachaei non solum erant iniustae, sed etiam ex patrimonio fuerunt congregatae; alioquin quomodo poterat extorta inique restituere in quadruplum? Sciebat enim legem iubentem restituere in quadruplum male ablata, ut si lex non terreat, damna mitigent. Non ergo expectat Zachaeus legis censuram, ipse sibi iudex effectus.
          <td><b>PSEUDO-CHRYS</b>. Observe the gracious kindness of the Savior. The innocent associates with the guilty, the fountain of justice with covetousness, which is the source of injustice. Having entered the publican’s house, He suffers no stain from the mists of avarice, but disperses them by the bright beam of His righteousness. But those who deal with biting words and reproaches, try to cast a slur upon the things which were done by Him; for it follows, And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner. But He, though accused of being a wine-bibber and a friend of publicans, regarded it not, so long as He could accomplish His end. As a physician sometimes can not save his patients from their diseases without the defilement of blood. kind so it happened here, for the publican was converted, and lived a better life. Zacchaeus stood, and said to the Lord, Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have defrauded any man, I restore him fourfold. Behold here is a marvel: without learning he obeys. And as the sun pouring its rays into a house enlightens it not by word, but by work, so the Savior by the rays of righteousness put to flight the darkness of sin; for the light shines in darkness. Now every thing united is strong, but divided, weak, therefore Zacchaeus divides into two parts his substance. But we must be careful to observe, that his wealth was not made up from unjust gains, but from his patrimony, else how could he restore fourfold what he had unjustly extorted. He knew that the law ordered what was wrongly taken away to be restored fourfold, that if the law deterred not, a man’s losses might soften him. Zacchaeus waits not for the judgment of the law, but makes himself his own judge.

          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Sed si subtilius indagare velimus, nihil de propriis restabat facultatibus. Data enim medietate bonorum pauperibus, ex residuo reddebat laesis in quadruplo. Nec solum hoc promittebat, sed faciebat: non enim ait: dabo medietatem et restituam quadruplum, sed do et reddo. At Christus illi salutem annuntiat: sequitur enim ait Iesus ad eum, quia hodie salus huic domui facta est; ipsum Zachaeum significans assecutum fuisse salutem, per domum habitatorem significans; sequitur enim eo quod et ipse filius sit Abrahae: non enim vocasset Abrahae filium inanimatam fabricam.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. If we examine more closely, we shall see that nothing was left of his own property. For having given half of his goods to the poor, out of the remainder he restored fourfold to those whom he had injured. He not only promised this, but did it. For he says not, “I will give the half, and I will restore fourfold, but, I give, and I restore. To such Christ announces salvation; Jesus said to him, This day is salvation come to this house, signifying that Zacchaeus had attained to salvation, meaning by the house the inhabitant thereof. And it follows, forasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham. For He would not have given the name of a son of Abraham to a lifeless building.

Pulchre autem dicit et ipse, ut non solum eos qui iuste vixerant, sed et eos qui ab iniustitia resipiscunt, ad filios promissionis pertinere declaret.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Zacchaeus is called the son of Abraham, not because he was born of Abraham’s seed, but because he imitates his faith, that as Abraham left his country and his father’s house, so he abandoned all his goods in giving them to the poor. And He well says, “He also,” to declare that not only those who had lived justly, but those who are raised up from a life of injustice, belong to the sons of promise.

Sed quia murmurabant quidam eo quod moraretur cum viro peccatore, ad compescendos illos, subdit venit enim filius hominis quaerere et salvum facere quod perierat.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. He said not that he “was” a son of Abraham, but that he now is. For before when he was the chief among the publicans, and bore no likeness to the righteous Abraham, he was not his son. But because some murmured that he tarried with a man who was a sinner, he adds in order to restrain them, For the Son of man came to seek and to save that which was lost.

Tam enim procul est a me odium peccatorum quod eorum causa advenerim: nam medicus veni, non iudex; ob hoc conviva fio languentium, patiorque foetorem, ut praestem remedia. Quaeret autem aliquis: quomodo Paulus iubet, si quis frater fuerit procax aut avarus, cum huiusmodi nec cibum esse sumendum? Christus autem erat publicanorum conviva. Sed nondum provecti erant isti ut fierent fratres. Sed et tunc vitare praecepit Paulus fratres, cum perstant in malo; hi vero erant mutati.
          <td><b>PSEUDO-CHRYS</b>. Why do you accuse me if I bring sinners to righteousness? So far am I from hating them, that for their sakes I came. For I came to heal, not to judge, therefore am I the constant guest of those that are sick, and I suffer their noisomeness that I may supply remedies. But some one may ask, how does Paul bid us, If we have a brother that is a fornicator or covetous man, with such not even to take food; whereas Christ was the guest of publicans? They were not as yet so far advanced as to be brethren, and besides, St. Paul bids us avoid our brethren only when they persist in evil, but these were converted.

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; The crowd is the tumultuous state of an ignorant multitude, which cannot see the lofty top of wisdom. Zacchaeus therefore, while he was in the crowd, saw not Christ, but having advanced beyond the vulgar ignorance, was thought worthy to entertain Him whom he desired to look upon.

          <td><b>Beda</b>: Vel turba, idest vitiorum consuetudo quae caecum clamantem increpabat, etiam hunc suspicientem tardat; sed sicut amplius clamando caecus turbam vicit, ita pusillus terrena relinquendo, et arborem crucis ascendendo, turbam obstantem transcendit. Sicomorus namque, quae est arbor foliis moro similis, sed altitudine praestans, unde et a Latinis celsa nuncupatur, ficus fatua dicitur: et eadem dominica crux credentes alit ut ficus, ab incredulis irridetur ut fatua. Quam arborem pusillus statura Zachaeus, ut coexaltari possit, ascendit, cum quilibet humilis et propriae conscius infirmitatis clamat: mihi absit gloriari, nisi in cruce domini nostri Iesu Christi.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Or the crowd that is, the general habit of vice, which rebuked the blind man crying out, lest he should seek the light, also impedes Zacchaeus looking up, that he might not see Jesus; that as by crying out the more the blind man overcame the crowd, so the man weak in the faith by forsaking earthly things, and climbing the tree of the Cross, surmounts the opposing multitude. The sycamore, which is a tree resembling the mulberry in foliage, but exceeding it in height, whence by the Latins it is called “lofty,” is called the “foolish fig-tree,” and so the Cross of our Lord sustains believers, as the fig-tree figs, and is mocked by unbelievers as foolishness. This tree Zacchaeus, who was little in stature, climbed up, that he might be raised together with Christ; for every one who is humble, and conscious of his own weakness, cries out, God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Pulchre autem addidit, quia illa parte erat transiturus dominus, vel ubi sicomorus, vel ubi crediturus, ut mysterium servaret, et gratiam seminaret: sic enim venerat ut per Iudaeos veniret ad gentes. Vidit itaque Zachaeum sursum; iam enim sublimitas fidei inter fructus bonorum operum, inter fecundae altitudinem arboris eminebat. Zachaeus autem supra arborem est, quia est supra legem.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; He has well added, that our Lord was to pass that way, either where the sycamore-tree was, or where he was who was about to believe, that so He might preserve the mystery, and sow the seeds of grace. For He had so come as that through the Jews He came to the Gentiles. He sees then Zacchaeus above, for already the excellence of his faith shone forth amidst the fruits of good works, and the loftiness of the fruitful tree; but Zacchaeus stands out above the tree, as one who is above the law.

Manebat autem aliquando dominus in domo principis Pharisaeorum; sed eum opera digna Deo facientem lingua venenata carpebant: unde eorum perosus facinora discessit dicens: relinquetur domus vestra deserta. Hodie autem in domo pusilli Zachaei oportet illum manere, idest novae legis gratia coruscante in humilium nationum corde quiescere. Quod autem descendere de sicomoro, et sic mansionem in domo parare iubetur, hoc est quod ait apostolus: etsi cognovimus secundum carnem Christum, sed iam nunc non novimus (...). Etsi enim mortuus est ex infirmitate, sed vivit ex virtute Dei. Manifestum est autem Iudaeos gentium semper odisse salutem; sed salus, quae olim Iudaeorum domos implebat, hodie populum nationum illuxit, eo quod et ipse populus filius sit Abrahae, credendo in Deum.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; The Lord as He journeyed came to the place where Zacchaeus had climbed the sycamore, for having sent His preachers throughout the world in whom He Himself spoke and went, He comes to the Gentile people, who were already raised up on high through faith in His Passion, and whom when He looked up He saw, for He chose them through grace. Now our Lord once abode in the house of the chief of the Pharisees, but when He did works such as none but God could do, they railed at Him Wherefore hating their deeds He departed, saying, Your house shall be left to you desolate; but now He must needs stay at the house of the weak Zacchaeus, that is, by the grace of the new law brightly shining, He must take rest in the hearts of tile lowly nations. But that Zacchaeus is bid to come down from the sycamore tree, and prepare an abode for Christ, this is what the Apostle says, Yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we Him no more. And again elsewhere, For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he lives by the power of God. It is plain that the Jews always hated the salvation Of the Gentiles; but salvation, which formerly filled the houses of the Jews, has this day shone upon the Gentiles, forasmuch as this people also by believing on God is a son of Abraham.

Ascendit autem super sicomorum, idest voluptatis dulcedinem, quae significatur per ficum, deprimens eam; et sic sublimior factus, videt, et videtur a Christo.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. It is easy to turn this to a moral use. For whoever surpasses many in wickedness is small in spiritual growth, and cannot see Jesus for the crowd. For disturbed by passion and worldly things, he beholds not Jesus walking, that is, working in us, not recognizing His operation. But he climbs up to the top of a sycamore-tree, in that he rises above the sweetness of pleasure, which is signified by a fig, and subduing it, and so becoming more exalted, he sees and is seen by Christ.

          <td><b>Gregorius Moralium</b>: Vel quia sicomorus ficus fatua dicitur, pusillus Zachaeus sicomorum subiit, et dominum vidit: quia qui mundi stultitiam humiliter eligunt, ipsi Dei sapientiam subtiliter contemplantur. Quid enim in hoc mundo stultius quam amissa non quaerere, possessa rapientibus relaxare, nullam pro acceptis iniuriis iniuriam reddere?

          <td><b>GREG</b>. Or because the sycamore is from its name called the foolish fig, the little Zacchaeus gets up into the sycamore and sees the Lord, for they who humbly choose the foolish things of this world are those who contemplate most closely the wisdom of God. For what is more foolish in this world than not to seek for what is lost, to give our possessions to robbers, to return not injury for injury? However, by this wise foolishness, the wisdom of God is seen, not yet really as it is, but by the light of contemplation.

The Lord said to him, Make haste and come down, that is, “you have ascended by penitence to a place too high for you, come down by humility, lest your exaltation cause you to sky. I must abide in the house of a humble man. We have two kinds of goods in us, bodily, and spiritual; the just man gives up all his bodily goods to the poor, but he forsakes not his spiritual goods, but if he has extorted any thing from any one, he restores to him fourfold; signifying thereby that if a man by repentance walks in the Opposite path to his former perverseness, he by the manifold practice of virtue heals all his old offenses, and so merits salvation, and is called the son of Abraham, because he went out from his own kindred, that is, from his ancient wickedness.

He went into a far country, separated not so much by distance of place as by actual condition. For God Himself is nigh to every one of us, when our good works bind us to Him. And He is afar off, as often as by cleaving to destruction, we remove ourselves away from Him. To this earthly country then He came at a distance from God, that He might receive the kingdom of the Gentiles, according to the Psalm, Ask of me, and I will give you the heathen for your inheritance.

But when He adds, To receive for himself a kingdom, and to return; He points out His second appearance, when He shall come as a King and in great glory. He first of all calls Himself a man, because of His nativity in the flesh, then noble; not yet a King, because as yet at His first appearance He exercised no kingly power. It is also well said to obtain for Himself a kingdom, according to Daniel, Behold one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and a kingdom was given to him.

As it follows, And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds.
            <p><b>CHRYS</b>. Holy Scripture is accustomed to use the number ten as a sign of perfection, for if any one wishes to count beyond it, he has again to begin from unity, having in ten as it were arrived at a goal.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or by the ten pounds he signifies the law, because of the ten commandments, and by the ten servants, those to whom while under the law grace was preached. For so we must interpret the ten pounds given them for trading, seeing that they understood the law, when its veil was removed, to belong to the Gospel.

By those then who receive the pounds, He means His disciples, giving a pound to each, since He entrusts to all an equal stewardship; He bade them put it out to use, as it follows, Occupy till I come. Now there was no other employment but to preach the doctrine of His kingdom to those who would hear it. But there is one and the same doctrine for all, one faith, one baptism.

And rightly, since He is speaking of the Jews, are there two only who bring their pounds multiplied, not indeed by a gainful interest of money, but a profitable stewardship of the Gospel.

For the manifold meanings or interpretations which spring up concerning some individual precept or book, when reduced and brought together in one, make as it were a city of living eternal reasons. Hence a city is not a multitude of living creatures, but of reasonable beings bound together by the fellowship of one law. The servants then who bring an account of that which they had received, and are praised for having gained more, represent those giving in their account who have well employed what they had received, to increase their Lord’s riches by those who believe on Him, while they who are unwilling to do this are signified by that servant who kept his pound laid up in a napkin; of whom it follows, And the third came, saying, Lord, behold, here is your pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin, &amp;c. For there are some who flatter themselves with this delusion, saying, It is enough for each individual to answer concerning himself, what need then of others to preach and minister, in order that every one should be compelled also to give an account of himself, seeing that in the Lord’s sight even they are without excuse to whom tile law was not given, and who were not asleep at the time of the preaching of the Gospel, for they might have known the Creator through the creature; and then it follows, For I feared you, because you are an austere man, &amp;c. For this is, as it were, to reap when he did not sow, that is, to hold those guilty of ungodliness to whom this word of the law or the Gospel was not preached, and avoiding as it were this peril of Judgment, with slothful toil they rest from the ministration of the word. And this it is to tie up in a napkin what they had received.

He is called a wicked servant, as being slothful in business, and proud in questioning his Lord’s judgment. You knew that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow: wherefore then gave you not my money into the bank? As though he said, If you knew me to be a hard man, and a seeker of what is not mine own, why did not the thought of this strike you with terror, that you might be sure that I would require mine own with strictness? But money or silver is the preaching of the Gospel and the word of God, for the words of the Lord are pure words as silver tried in the fire.

Tamen si quis est qui personas exigat, potest aestimare de Philippo, quem spiritus sanctus misit in Gazam, quando Candacis reginae baptizavit eunuchum.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Nor is it for nothing that two disciples are directed thither; Peter to Cornelius, Paul to the rest. And therefore He did not mark out the persons, but determined the number. Still should any one require the persons, he may believe it to be spoken of Philip, whom the Holy Spirit sent to Gaza, when he baptized the eunuch of Queen Candace.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Or the two sent imply this, that the Prophets and Apostles make up the two steps to the bringing in of the Gentiles, and their subjection to Christ. But they bring the colt from a certain village, that it may be known to us that this people was rude and unlearned.

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Those men who were directed, when they were loosing the colt, did not use their own words, but spoke as Jesus had told them, that you may know that not by their own words, but the word of God, not in their own name but in Christ’s, they implanted the faith among the Gentile nations; and by the command of God the hostile powers ceased, which claimed to themselves the obedience of the Gentiles.

          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; The disciples next place their garments upon the ass, and cause the Savior to sit thereon, inasmuch as they take upon themselves the word of God, and make it to rest upon the souls of their hearers. They divest themselves of their garments, and strew them in the way, for the clothing of the Apostles is their good works. And truly does the ass loosened by the disciples and carrying Jesus, walk upon the garments of the Apostles, when it imitates their doctrine.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; For it pleased not the Lord of the world to be borne upon the ass’s back, save that in a hidden mystery by a more inward sitting, the mystical Ruler might take His seat in the secret depths of men’s souls, guiding the footsteps of the mind, bridling the wantonness of the heart. His word is a rein, His word is a goad.

          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; As long as our Lord was in the mount His Apostles only were with Him, but when He began to be near the descent, then there came to Him a multitude of the people.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Discipulos vocat non solum duodecim, aut septuaginta, sed omnes qui Christum sequebantur, seu causa miraculorum, seu ad aliquam delectationem doctrinae; quibus ingeri pueri potuerunt, ut narrant alii Evangelistae; unde sequitur super omnibus quas viderant virtutibus.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. He calls by the name of disciples not only the twelve, or the seventy-two, but all who followed Christ, whether for the sake of the miracles, or from a certain charm in His teaching, and to them may be added the children, as the other Evangelists relate. Hence it follows, For all the mighty works which they had seen.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Multas quidem virtutes domini viderant, sed maxime Lazari resurrectionem stupebant: nam, ut Ioannes ait: propterea obviam venit ei turba, quia audierunt eum fecisse hoc signum. Notandum enim est, non tunc primum salvatorem Ierusalem adiisse, sed multoties antea, sicut Ioannes commemorat.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; They beheld indeed many of our Lord’s miracles, but marveled most at the resurrection of Lazarus. For as John says, For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle. For it must be observed that this was not the first time of our Lord’s coming to Jerusalem, but He came often before, as John relates.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; The multitude then acknowledging God, proclaims Him King, repeats the prophecy, and declares that the expected Son of David according to the flesh had come, saying, Blessed be the King that comes in the name of the Lord.

          <td><b>Beda</b>: Idest in nomine Dei patris, quamvis possit intelligi et in nomine suo, quia et ipse dominus est. Sed melius verba eius nostrum dirigunt intellectum, quibus ait: ego veni in nomine patris mei; humilitatis enim magister est Christus. Non autem rex Christus dicitur ad exigendum tributum, vel ferro exercitum armandum, hostesque visibiliter debellandos: sed quod mentes regat, et in regnum caelorum credentes perducat: quod enim rex esse voluit Israel, miserationis indicium est, non potestatis augmentum. Verum quia Christus in carne totius mundi propitiatio illuxit, pulchre sibi invicem in laude eius caelestia simul et terrena concinunt: eo enim nascente, caelestium agmina cantant; eodem autem caelis se reddituro, mortales vicem laudis rependunt: unde sequitur pax in caelo.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; That is, in the name of God the Father, although it might be taken “in His own name,” since He Himself is the Lord. But His own words are better guides to the meaning when He says, I am come in my Father’s name. For Christ is the Master of humility. Christ is not called King as one who exacts tribute, or arms His forces with the sword, or visibly crushes His enemies, but because He rules men’s minds, and brings them believing, hoping, and loving into the kingdom of heaven. For He was willing to be King of Israel, to show His compassion, not to increase His power. But because Christ appeared in the flesh, as the redemption and light of the whole world, well do both the heaven and earth, each in their turn, chant His praises. When He is born into the world, the heavenly hosts sing; when He is about to return to heaven, men send back their note of praise. As it follows, Peace in heaven.

Sed Pharisaei hoc audientes murmurabant, eo quod turba eum regem vocabat, et laudabat ut Deum; referentes nomen regis ad seditionem, nomen vero domini ad blasphemiam; unde sequitur et quidam Pharisaeorum de turbis dixerunt ad illum: magister, increpa discipulos tuos.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. That is, the ancient warfare, wherein we were at enmity against God, has ceased. And glory in the highest, inasmuch as Angels are glorifying God for such a reconciliation. For this very thing, that God visibly walks in the land of His enemies, shows that He has peace with us. But the Pharisees when they heard that the crowd called Him King, and praised Him as God, murmured, imputing the name of King to sedition, the name of God to blasphemy. And some of the Pharisees said, Master, rebuke your disciples.

          <td><b>Beda</b>: Mira invidorum dementia; quem magistrum appellandum non dubitant, quia vera docentem noverant, huius discipulos, quasi melius edocti, redarguendos aestimant.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; And so at the crucifixion of our Lord, when His kinsfolk were silent from fear, the stones and rocks sang forth, while after that He gave up the ghost, the earth was moved, and the rocks were rent, and the graves opened.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Neque etiam mirum est si laudes domini contra naturam suam saxa respondeant, quem scopulis duriores praedicant peremptores, scilicet turba post exiguum crucifixura Deum, negans affectibus quem vocibus confitetur: aut fortasse, quia obmutescentibus Iudaeis post domini passionem, vivi erant secundum Petrum lapides clamaturi.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Nor is it wonderful that the stones against their nature should chant forth the praises of the Lord, whom His murderers, harder than the rocks, proclaim aloud, that is, the multitude, in a little while about to crucify their God, denying Him in their hearts, whole with their mouths they confess. Or perhaps it is said; because, when the Jews were struck silent after the Lord’s Passion, the living stones, as Peter calls them, were about to cry out.

            <b>ORIGEN</b>; When we also are silent, (that is, when the love of many wax cold,) the stones cry out, for God can from stones raise up children to Abraham.
            <p><b>AMBROSE</b>; Rightly we read that the crowds praising God met Him at the descent of the mountain, that they might signify that the works of the heavenly mystery had come to them from heaven.

          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; All the blessings which Jesus pronounced in His Gospel He confirms by His own example, as having declared, Blessed are the meek; He afterwards sanctions it by saying, Learn of me, for I am meek; and because He had said, Blessed are they that weep, He Himself also wept over the city.

          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Miserebatur enim eorum Christus, qui omnes homines vult salvari: quod nobis non patuisset, nisi per aliquod humanum fieret evidens: effusae enim lacrymae sunt signa tristitiae.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; For Christ had compassion upon the Jews, who wills that all men should be saved. Which had not been plain to us, were it not revealed by a certain mark of His humanity. For tears poured forth are the tokens of sorrow.

          <td><b>Gregorius in Evang</b>: Flevit igitur pius redemptor ruinam perfidae civitatis, quam ipsa civitas sibi non cognoscebat esse venturam; unde subditur dicens: quia si cognovisses et tu: subaudi: fleres, quae modo, quia nescis quod imminet, exultas; unde subditur et quidem in hac die tua, quae ad pacem tibi. Cum enim carnis se voluptatibus daret in die sua, quae ad pacem ei esse poterant habebat. Cur vero bona praesentia ad pacem habuerit, manifestatur cum subditur nunc autem abscondita sunt ab oculis tuis. Si enim a cordis eius oculis mala quae imminerent, abscondita non essent, laeta in praesentibus prosperis non fuisset; unde mox eius poena, quae imminebat, adiuncta est, cum sequitur quia venient dies in te.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. The merciful Redeemer wept then over the fall of the false city, which that city itself knew not was about to come upon it. As it is added, saying, If you had known, even you (we may here understand) would weep. You who now rejoice, for you know not what is at hand. It follows, at least in this your day. For when she gave herself up to carnal pleasures, she had the things which in her day might be her peace. But why she had present goods for her peace, is explained by what follows, But now they are hidden from your eyes. For if the eyes of her heart had not been hidden from the future evils which were hanging over her, she would not have been joyful in the prosperity of the present. Therefore He shortly added the punishment which was near at hand, saying, For the days shall come upon you.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Vel aliter.

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; If you had known, even you. The Jews were not worthy to receive the divinely inspired Scriptures, which relate the mystery of Christ. For as often as Moses is read, a veil overshadow s their heart that they should not see what has been accomplished in Christ, who being the truth puts to flight the shadow. And because they regarded not the truth, they rendered themselves unworthy of the salvation which flows from Christ.

For to this He came, that He should preach both to them that were near, and those that were afar off. But as they did not wish to receive the peace that was announced to them, it was hid from them. And therefore the siege which was shortly to come upon them He most expressly foretells, adding, For the days shall come upon you, &amp;c.

This too which is added, namely, They shall not leave in you one stone upon another, is now witnessed in the altered situation of the same city, which is now built in that place where Christ was crucified without the gate, whereas the former Jerusalem, as it is called, was rooted up from the very foundation. And the crime for which this punishment of overthrow was inflicted is added, Because you knew not the time of your visitation.

          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; I do not deny then that the former Jerusalem was destroyed because of the wickedness of its inhabitants, but I ask whether the weeping might not perhaps concern this your spiritual Jerusalem. For if a man has sinned after receiving the mysteries of truth, he will be wept over. Moreover, no Gentile is wept over, but he only who was of Jerusalem, and has ceased to be.

Who if they had known their own damnation, hanging over them, would together with the elect shed tears over themselves. But the corrupt soul here has its day, rejoicing in the passing time; to whom things present are its peace, seeing that it takes delight in that which is temporal. It shuns the foresight of the future which may disturb its present mirth; and hence it follows, But now are they hid from your eyes.

Undique etiam animam coangustant, quando ei non solum operis, verum etiam locutionis atque cogitationis iniquitates replicant: ut quae prius se per multa dilatavit in scelere, in extremum de omnibus angustetur in retributione. Tunc autem anima per conditionem reatus sui ad terram consternitur, cum caro, quam vitam suam credidit, redire ad pulverem urgetur. Tunc in morte filii illius cadunt, cum cogitationes illicitae, quae modo ex illa prodeunt, in extrema ultione dissipantur: quae etiam cogitationes per lapides significari valent: perversa enim mens, cum perversae cogitationi perversiorem adicit, quasi lapidem supra lapidem ponit; sed cum ad ultionem suam anima ducitur, omnis cogitationum constructio dissipatur. Pravam autem animam Deus assidue visitat praecepto, aliquando flagello, aliquando autem miraculo, ut vera quae nesciebat audiat; et ea contemnens, aut dolore compuncta redeat, aut beneficiis devicta, malum quod fecit erubescat. Sed quia visitationis suae tempus non cognoscit, in extremo vitae traditur suis inimicis.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. Or else; The evil spirits lay siege to the soul, as it goes forth from the body, for being seized with the love of the flesh, they caress it with delusive pleasures. They surround it with a trench, because bringing all its wickedness which it has committed before the eyes of its mind, they close confine it to the company of its own damnation, that being caught in the very extremity of life, it may see by what enemies it is blockaded, yet be unable to find any way of escape, because it can no longer do good works, since those which it might once have done it despised. On every side also they enclose the soul when its iniquities rise up before it, not only in deed but also in word and thought, that she who before in many ways greatly enlarged herself in wickedness, should now at the end be straitened every way in judgment. Then indeed the soul by the very condition of its guilt is laid prostrate on the ground, while its flesh which it believed to be its life is bid to return to dust. Then its children fall in death, when all unlawful thoughts which only proceed from it, are in the last punishment of life scattered abroad. These may also be signified by the stones. For the corrupt mind when to a corrupt thought it adds one more corrupt, places one stone upon another. But when the soul is led to its doom, the whole structure of its thoughts is rent asunder. But the wicked soul God ceases not to visit with His teaching, sometimes with the scourge and sometimes with a miracle; that the truth which it knew not it may hear, and though still despising it, may return pricked to the heart in sorrow, or overcome with mercies may be ashamed at the evil which it has done. But because it knows not the time of its visitation, at the end of life it is given over to its enemies, that with them it may be joined together in the bond of everlasting damnation.

Vendentes quippe in templo sunt qui hoc quod quibusdam iure competit, ad praemium largiuntur; iustitiam enim vendere est, hanc pro praemii acceptione servare.

          <td><b>GREG</b>. Mystically, such as the temple of God is in a city, such is the life of the religious in a faithful people. And there are frequently some who take upon themselves the religious habit, and while they are receiving the privilege of Holy Orders, are sinking the sacred office of religion into a bargain of worldly traffic. For the sellers in the temple are those who give at a certain price that which is the rightful possession of others. For to sell justice is to observe it on condition of receiving a reward. But the buyers in the temple are those, who whilst unwilling to discharge what is just to their neighbor, and disdaining to do what they are in duty bound to, by paying a price to their patrons, purchase sin.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Origenes in Lucam</b>: Si quis ergo vendit, eicietur; et praecipue si vendit columbas. Si enim ea quae mihi a spiritu sancto sunt revelata et credita, aut in vulgus pretio vendidero, aut absque mercede non docuero; quid aliud facio nisi columbam, idest spiritum sanctum, vendo?
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; If any then sells, let him be cast out, and especially if he sells doves.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Therefore our Lord teaches generally that all worldly bargains should be far removed from the temple of God; but spiritually He drove away the money-changers, who seek gain from the Lord’s money, that is, the divine Scripture, lest they should discern good and evil.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius</b>: Qui domum Dei speluncam latronum faciunt, quia dum perversi homines locum religionis tenent, ibi malitiae suae gladiis occidunt ubi vivificare proximos orationis suae intercessione debuerunt.

          <td><b>GREG</b>. And these make the house of God a den of thieves, because when corrupt men hold religious offices, they slay with the sword of their wickedness their neighbors, whom they ought to raise to life by the intercession of their prayers. The temple also is the soul of the faithful, which if it put forth corrupt thoughts to the injury of a neighbor, then is it become as it were a lurking place of thieves. But when the soul of the faithful is wisely instructed to shun evil, truth teaches daily in the temple.

Because they will not confess that which they knew, they were baffled, and the Lord would not tell them what He knew; as it follows, And Jesus said to them, Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things. For there are two reasons especially why we should conceal the truth from those that ask; for example, when the questioner is incapable of understanding what he asks, or when from hatred or contempt he is unworthy to have his questions answered.

And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and entreated him shamefully, and sent him away empty. 12. And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast him out. 13.

But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours. 15. So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do to them? 16. He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard it, they said, God forbid. 17. And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner? 18.

          <td><b>EUSEBIUS</b>. The rulers of the Jewish people being now assembled together in the temple, Christ put forth a parable foretelling by a figure the things they were about to do to Him, and the rejection that was in store for them.

          <td><b>Augustinus de Cons. Evang</b>: Tacuit Matthaeus brevitatis causa quod Lucas non tacet, parabolam istam non ad solos principes dictam, qui de potestate interrogaverunt, sed etiam ad plebem.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Matthew has omitted for brevity’s sake what Luke has not; namely, that the parable was spoken not to the rulers only who asked concerning His authority, but also to the people.

          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Plerique autem varie significationes de vineae appellatione derivant; sed evidenter Isaias vineam domini Sabaoth domum Israel esse memorat. Hanc vineam quis alius nisi Deus condidit?
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Now many derive different meanings from the name vineyard, but Esaias clearly relates the vineyard of the Lord of Sabaoth to be the house of Israel. This vineyard who else but God planted?

          <td><b>Beda</b>: Homo ergo qui plantavit vineam ipse est, qui iuxta aliam parabolam conduxit operarios in vineam suam.

          <td><b>EUSEBIUS</b>. But the parable which Esaias gives denounces the vineyard, whereas our Savior parable is not directed against the vineyard, but the cultivators of it, of whom it is added, And be let it out to husbandmen, that is, to the elders of the people, and the chief priests, and the doctors, and all the nobles.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Or each one of the people is the vineyard, each likewise is the husbandman, for every one of us takes care of himself. Having committed then the vineyard to the husbandmen, he went away, that is, he left them to the guidance of their own judgment Hence it follows, And went into a far country for a long time.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Non quia ex loco ad locum profectus est dominus, qui ubique semper praesens est; sed quia praesentior est diligentibus, negligentibus abest. Multis autem temporibus abfuit, ne praepropera videretur exactio: nam quo indulgentior liberalitas eo inexcusabilior pervicacia.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Not that our Lord journeys from place to place, seeing that He is ever present in every place, but that He is more present to those who love Him, while He removes Himself from those who regard Him not. But He was absent for a long time, lest His coming to require His fruit might seem too early. For the more indulgent it is, it renders obstinacy the less excusable.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Vel Deus absentavit se a vinea plurium annorum curriculis: quia postquam visus est in specie ignis descendisse in montem Sina, non amplius visibiliter praebuit eis suam praesentiam. Nulla tamen interpolatio contigit qua non mitteret Deus prophetas et iustos commonentes; unde sequitur et in tempore vindemiae, ille misit ad cultores servum, ut de fructu vineae darent illi.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Or God took Himself away from the vineyard for the course of many years, for since the time that He was seen to descend in the likeness of fire upon Mount Sinai, He no longer vouchsafed to them His visible presence; though no change took place, in which He sent not His prophets and righteous men to give warning thereof; as it follows, And at the time of the vintage he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Dicit autem de fructu vineae, quia non totum fructum, sed aliquid de fructu volebat accipere. Nam quid lucratur Deus a nobis nisi suam notitiam, quae etiam est nostra utilitas?
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. He says of the fruit of the vineyard, because not the whole fruit, but part only, He wished to receive. For what does God gain from us, but His own knowledge, which is also, our profit.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Bene autem fructum posuit, non proventum: nullus enim huius vineae proventus inventus est.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; But it is rightly written fruit, not increase. For there was no increase in this vineyard. The first servant sent was Moses, who for forty years sought of the husbandmen the fruit of the law which he had given, but he was wroth against them, for they provoked his spirit. Hence it follows, But they beat him, and sent him away empty.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Factum est autem ut plures alios destinaret, quos Iudaei inhonoros et inanes sibi, de quibus nihil potuerunt proficere, dimiserunt; unde sequitur et addidit alterum servum mittere.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; And it came to pass that He ordained many others, whom the Jews sent back to him disgraced and empty, for they could reap nothing from them; as it follows, And again he sent another servant.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Servus alter David significatur, qui missus est, ut post edicta legalia cultores vineae psalmodiae modulamine ad exercitium boni operis excitaret; sed et contra hunc dixerunt: quae nobis pars in David, aut quae haereditas in filio Isai? Unde sequitur illi autem hunc caedentes et afficientes contumelia, dimiserunt inanem. Sed nec sic destitit; sequitur enim et addidit tertium mittere: per quem prophetarum chorum intellige, qui continuis attestationibus populum convenerunt. Sed quem prophetarum non sunt persecuti? Unde sequitur qui et illum vulnerantes eiecerunt. His autem tribus servorum gradibus omnium sub lege doctorum figuram posse comprehendi, dominus alibi manifestat, dicens: quoniam necesse est impleri omnia quae sunt in lege Moysi et prophetis et Psalmis de me.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; By the other servant is meant David, who was sent after the commandment of the law, that he by the music of his psalmody might stir up the husbandmen to the exercise of good works. But they on the contrary declared, What portion have we in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse. Hence it follows, And they beat him also, and entreated him shamefully, and sent him away empty. But He does not stop here, for it follows, And again he sent a third: whereby we must understand the company of prophets who constantly visited the people with their testimony. But which of the Prophets did they not persecute; as it follows, And they wounded him also, and cast him out. Now these three successions of servants, our Lord elsewhere shows to comprehend under a figure all the teachers under the law, when He says, For all those things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses, and the Prophets, and the Psalms, concerning me.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Prophetis igitur talia mala passis, filius destinatur; sequitur enim dixit autem dominus vineae: quid faciam?
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. After the prophets then had suffered all these things, the Son is delegated; for it follows, Then said the Lord of the vineyard, What shall I do?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Quod dominus vineae dubitative loquitur, non de ignorantia venit: quid enim nesciat Deus pater? Sed ambigere dicitur, ut libera voluntas hominis servetur.
          <td>That the Lord of the vineyard speaks doubtingly, arises not from ignorance, for what is there that the Lord knows not; but He is said to hesitate, that the free will of man may be preserved.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Deliberat etiam secum dominus vineae quid agat, non quasi carens ministris, sed quia pertentato quolibet ingenio salutis humanae, populo vero nequaquam adiuto, aliud maius adiungit; unde consequenter dicit mittam filium meum dilectum: forsitan cum hunc viderint, verebuntur.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; The Lord of the vineyard also ponders what He should do, not that He is in need of ministers, but that having thoroughly tried every device of human aid, yet His people being in no wise healed, He may add something greater; as He goes on to say, I will send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence him when they see him.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Dixit autem hoc, non tamquam ignorans quod peius eum essent tractaturi quam prophetas: sed quia oportebat filium eis fieri reverendum. Quod si contumaces fuerint occidendo, hoc cumulat eorum crimen. Ne ergo dicerent aliqui divinam praescientiam necessario fuisse inobedientiae causam, ideo sic figurat sermonem.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Now He said this, not as ignorant that they would treat Him worse than they did the prophets, but because the Son ought to be reverenced by them. But if they should still be rebellious and slay Him, this would crown their iniquity. Lest therefore any should say that the Divine Presence has necessarily been the cause of their disobedience, He uses purposely this doubtful mode of speech.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Filium igitur unigenitum sibi missum perfidi Iudaei, quasi heredem removere cupientes, occiderunt crucifigendo, et eiecerunt negando; unde sequitur quem cum vidissent coloni, cogitaverunt intra se dicentes: hic est heres: occidamus eum, ut nostra fiat hereditas. Heres Christus est, idemque testator; heres, quia morti propriae supervivit, et testamentorum quae ipse contulit tamquam hereditaria in nostris profectibus emolumenta consequitur.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; When then the only-begotten Son was sent to them, the unbelieving Jews, wishing to be rid of the Heir, put Him to death by crucifying Him, and rejected Him by denying Him. Christ is the Heir and the Testator likewise. The Heir, because He survives His own death; and of the testament which He Himself bequeathed, He reaps as it were the hereditary profits in our advances.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Manifestissime autem dominus probat, Iudaeorum principes non per ignorantiam, sed per invidentiam crucifixisse filium Dei. Intellexerunt enim hunc esse cui dictum est: dabo tibi gentes haereditatem tuam; sequitur enim et eiectum extra vineam occiderunt; quia Iesus, ut sanctificaret per suum sanguinem populum, extra portam passus est.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; But Our Lord most clearly proves that the Jewish rulers crucified the Son of God not from ignorance but for envy. For they knew it was He to whom it was said, I will give you the heathen for your inheritance. And they cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him. Because Jesus, that He might sanctify the people by His blood, suffered without the gate.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Sed quia superius populum, non Ierusalem, loco vineae sumpsimus; forsan magis proprie dici potest, quod occidit quidem eum populus extra vineam; idest, extra populi manus passus est dominus, quia scilicet populus ei non propriis manibus necem intulit, sed tradens hunc Pilato et gentibus. Quidam autem per vineam Scripturam intellexerunt, cui non credentes, dominum necaverunt: unde extra vineam, idest extra Scripturam, dicitur dominus passus.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Since we have already assumed the people, not Jerusalem, to be the vineyard, it may perhaps be more properly said that the people indeed slew Him without the vineyard; that is, our Lord suffered without the hands of the people, because in truth the people did not with their own hands inflict death upon Him, but delivered Him up to Pilate and the Gentiles. But some by the vineyard have understood the Scripture, which not believing they slew the Lord. And so without the vineyard, that is, without Scripture, our Lord is said to have suffered.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Sive eiectus extra vineam et occisus est, quia prius est ab infidelium corde repulsus, ac deinde cruci addictus est.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Or was He cast out of the vineyard and slain, because He was first driven out of the hearts of the unbelievers, and then fastened to the cross?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Dispensationis autem, non negligentiae est post prophetas Christum venisse: non enim Deus omnia repente prosequitur, sed condescendit propter sui pietatem: quia si post servos venientem filium contempserunt, multo magis nec antea eum audirent: qui enim non audiebant minora praecepta, quomodo audivissent maiora?
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Now it was not accidentally but part of the purpose of the divine dispensation that Christ came after the prophets. For God does not pursue all things at once, but accommodates Himself to mankind through His great mercy; for if they despised His Son coming after His servants, much less would they have heard Him before. For they who listened not to the inferior commands, how would they have heard the greater?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Pulchre autem interrogat, ut sua se ipsi damnent sententia; sequitur enim quid ergo faciet illis dominus vineae?
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; He rightly puts a question to them, that they may condemn themselves by their own words, as it follows, What then will the Lord of the vineyard do to them?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Basilius</b>: Hoc autem fit, quasi his qui damnantur nihil habentibus opponere evidentiae iuris. Proprium autem est divinae miserationis non infligere poenas silentio, sed praedicere minis, revocando eos ad poenitentiam; unde et hic sequitur veniet, et perdet colonos istos, et dabit vineam aliis.
          <td><b>BASIL</b>; And this happens as it were to men who are condemned, having nothing to answer to the plain evidence of justice. But it is the property of Divine mercy not to inflict punishment in secret, but to foretell it with threatenings, that so it might recall men to repentance; and thus it follows here, He shall come and destroy those husbandmen.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Venturum dominum dicit vineae, quod in filio adsit etiam paterna maiestas; vel quod ultimis temporibus praesentior humanis aspiret affectibus.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; He says, the Lord of the vineyard will come, because in the Son is present also the Father’s majesty; or because in the last times He will be more graciously present by His Spirit in the hearts of men.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Exclusi sunt igitur Iudaeorum primates, quasi dominicae voluntati repugnantes, et sterilem reddentes vineam sibi commissam; est autem datus cultus vineae sacerdotibus novi testamenti. Cum autem virtutem aenigmatis senserunt, recusant illud pati; unde sequitur quo audito, dixerunt illi: absit. Nec tamen evaserunt ob sui pertinaciam et inobedientiam erga fidem Christi.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; The Jewish rulers were shut out then, because they resisted their Lord’s will, and made the vineyard barren which was entrusted to them. But the cultivation of the vineyard was given to the Priests of the New Testament, upon which the Scribes and Pharisees, as soon as they perceived the force of the parable, refuse to permit it, saying as follows, God forbid. They did not however escape any whit the more, because of their obstinacy and disobedience to the faith of Christ.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Aliter autem videtur Matthaeus dicere, dominum scilicet quaesivisse: quid faciet illis cultoribus dominus vineae? Iudaeos vero respondisse: malos male perdet. Non est autem repugnantia: nam utrumque factum est: primo enim ipsi promulgaverunt illam sententiam; postea sentientes quo tendebat parabola, dixerunt absit, ut Lucas hic narrat.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Now Matthew seems to relate the parable differently; that when our Savior asked indeed, What will he do then to the husbandmen? the Jews answered, he will miserably destroy them. But there is no difference between the two circumstances. The Jews at first pronounced that opinion, then perceiving the point of the parable said, God forbid, as Luke here relates.

Erant etiam qui talia respondentibus dicerent absit: quia intelligebant in seipsos hanc parabolam dictam; sequitur enim ille autem aspiciens eos ait: quid est ergo quod scriptum est: lapidem quem reprobaverunt aedificantes, hic factus est in caput anguli?
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or else, in the multitude of which we are speaking there were those who craftily asked our Lord by what authority He acted; there were those also who not craftily, but faithfully, cried aloud, Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. And so there would be some who would say, He will miserably destroy those husbandmen, and let out his vineyard to others. Which are rightly said to have been the words of our Lord Himself, either on account of their truth, or because of the unity of the members with the head; while there would be others also who would say to those who made this answer, God forbid, inasmuch as they understood the parable was spoken against themselves. It follows, And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; As if He said, How shall the prophecy be fulfilled, except that Christ, being rejected and slain by you, is to be preached to the Gentiles, who will believe on Him, that as the corner stone He may thus from both nations build up one temple to Himself?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">

          <td><b>EUSEBIUS</b>. Christ is called a stone on account of His earthly body, cut out with hands, as in the vision of Daniel, because of His birth of the Virgin. But the stone is neither of silver nor gold, because He is not any glorious King, but a man lowly and despised, wherefore the builders rejected Him.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. For the rulers of the people rejected Him, when they said, This man is not of God. But He was so useful and so precious, that He was placed as the head stone of the corner.

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; But holy Scripture compares to a corner the meeting together of the two nations, the Jew and the Gentile, into one faith. For the Savior has compacted both peoples into one new man, reconciling them in one body to the Father.

But the other of their captivity and extermination, which the Stone that was despised by them brought upon them. And He points to this when He says, But upon whomsoever it shall fall, it shall grind him to powder, or winnow him. For so were the Jews winnowed through the whole world, as the stray from the threshing floor. And mark the order of things; for first comes the wickedness committed against Him, then follows the just vengeance of God.

Sive de his dicit quod cadunt super eum, qui illum modo contemnunt; ideo nondum penitus intereunt, sed conquassantur, ut non recti ambulent: super quos autem cadit, veniet illis desuper in iudicio cum poena perditionis; ideo comminuet eos, ut sint tamquam pulvis, quem proicit ventus a facie terrae.

Or, He means by those who fall upon Him, such as only despise Him, and therefore do not yet utterly perish, but are shaken violently so that they cannot walk upright.

And as the vine is married to the trees, so is the body to the soul. Loving this vineyard, the husbandmen is wont to dig it and prune it, lest it grow too luxuriant in the shade of its foliage, and check by unfruitful boastfulness of words the ripening of its natural character. Here must be the vintage of the whole world, for here is the vineyard of the whole world.

But the servant who is sent is said to be treated despitefully or beaten, when the word heard is despised or blasphemed. The heir who is sent that man kills as far as he can, who by sin tramples under foot the Son of God. The wicked husbandmen being destroyed, the vineyard is given to another, when with the gift of grace, which the proud man spurned, the humble are enriched.

But little mindful of this, they rather gather a fresh occasion for their crimes. The commandment of the Law restrained them not, which says, The innocent and righteous men you shall not slay, but the fear of the people checked their wicked purpose. For they set the fear of man before the reverence of God. The reason of this purpose is given, for they perceived that he spoke this parable against them.

For He Himself is the Heir, whose unjust death He said was to be punished They are the wicked husbandmen who sought to kill the Son of God. This also is daily committed in the Church when any one, only in name a brother, is ashamed or afraid, because of the many good men with whom he lives, to break into that unity of the Church’s faith and peace which he abhors. And because the chief priests sought to lay hold of our Lord but could not by themselves, they tried to accomplish it by the hands of the governor; as it follows, And they watched him, &amp;c.

And so they proceed to ask, Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not? For there was a great division among the people, some saying that for the sake of security and quiet, seeing that the Romans fought for all, they ought to pay tribute; while the Pharisees, on the contrary, declared, that the people of God who gave tithes and first fruits, ought not to be subject to the law of man.

For as the penny has the image of the emperor of the world, so he who does the works of the power of darkness, bears the image of Him whose works he does, He says then, Render to Caesar the things which be Caesar’s, that is, cast away the earthly image, that you may be able, by putting on the heavenly image, to render to God the things which be God’s, namely, to love God. Which things Moses says God requires of us.

And from none of them has she received the seed of a hereditary offspring, and so can have no part with her husbands in the resurrection, because she perverts the spiritual meaning of the precept into a carnal. For not any carnal brother is pointed at, who should raise seed to his deceased brother, but that brother who from the dead people of the Jews should claim to himself for wife the wisdom of the divine worship, and from it should raise up seed in the Apostles, who being left as it were unformed in the womb of the synagogue, have according to the election of grace been thought worthy to be preserved by the admixture of a new seed.

Quantum enim ego aestimo, neque in veteri, neque in novo testamento quicquam tale reperitur. Sed omnis eorum error de Scripturae lectione, quam non intelligunt, subrepsit; dicitur enim in Isaia: electi mei bibent; et putant haec et similia futura esse in resurrectione. Paulus autem omnes has benedictiones spiritaliter interpretans, et sciens non esse carnales dicit: benedixisti nos in omni benedictione spirituali.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; But because the Lord says in Matthew, which is here omitted, You do err, not knowing the Scriptures, ask the question, where is it so written, They shall neither marry, nor be given in marriage? for as I conceive there is no such thing to be found either in the Old or New Testament, but the whole of their error had crept in from the reading of the Scriptures without understanding; for it is said in Esaias, My elect shall not have children for a curse. Whence they suppose that the like will happen in the resurrection. But Paul interpreting all these blessings as spiritual, knowing them not to be carnal, says to the Ephesians, You have blessed us in all spiritual blessings.

Nunc vero quoniam dixit: ego sum, ostendit quod viventium est Deus et dominus; et hoc est quod subditur Deus autem non est mortuorum, sed vivorum: omnes enim vivunt ei: quamvis enim exanimes sunt, vivunt tamen apud Deum in spe resurgendi.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Or to the reason above given the Lord added the testimony of Scripture, Now that the dead are raised, Moses also showed at the bush, as the Lord said, I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. As if he said, If the patriarchs have once returned to nothing so as not to live with God in the hope of a resurrection, He would not have said, I am, but, I was, for we are accustomed to speak of things dead and gone thus, I was the Lord or Master of such a thing; but now that He said, I am, He shows that He is the God and Lord of the living. This is what follows, But he its not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him. For though they have departed from life, yet live they with Him in the hope of a resurrection.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">

Ad comprobandam autem resurrectionis veritatem, multo manifestioribus exemplis ex prophetis uti valuit, sed Sadducaei quinque tantum libros Moysi recipiebant, prophetarum vaticinia respuentes.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Or He says this, that after having proved that the souls abide after death, (which the Sadducees denied,) He might next introduce the resurrection also of the bodies, which together with the souls have done good or evil. But that is a true life which the just live to God, even though they are dead in the body. Now to prove the truth of the resurrection, He might have brought much more obvious examples from the Prophets, but the Sadducees received only the five books of Moses, rejecting the oracles of the Prophets.

Non enim sic multitudo subditorum sicut virtus famulantium pandit eius dominium; unde non sic gaudet dici Deus caeli et terrae, sicut cum dicitur Deus Abraham, Deus Isaac et Deus Iacob. Et apud mortales quidem a dominis denominantur famuli; dicimus enim: villicus talis ducis; e contrario autem Deus dicitur Abrahae.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. As the saints claim as their own the common Lord of the world, not as derogating from His dominion, but testifying their affection after the manner of lovers, who do not brook to love with many, but desire to express a certain peculiar and especial attachment; so likewise does God call Himself especially the God of these, not thereby narrowing but enlarging His dominion; for it is not so much the multitude of His subjects that manifests His power, as the virtue of His servants. Therefore He does not so delight in the name of the God of heaven and earth, as in that of in God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Now among men servants are thus denominated by, their masters; for we say, ‘The steward of such a man’, but on the contrary God is called the God of Abraham.

Nec praefertur qui ad dexteram sedet, nec iniuriam patitur qui admittitur: gradus non quaeritur dignitatis, ubi plenitudo est divinitatis.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; They are not blamed here because they acknowledge Him to be David’s Son, for the blind man for so doing was thought worthy to be healed. And the children saying, Hosanna to the Son of David, rendered to God the glory of the highest praise; but they are blamed because they believe Him not to be the Son of God. Hence it is added, And David himself says in the book of Psalms, The Lord said to my Lord. Both the Father is Lord and the Son is Lord, but there are not two Lords, but one Lord, for the Father is in the Son, and the Son is in the Father. He Himself sits at the right hand of the Father, for He is coequal with the Father, inferior to none; for it follows, Sit you at my right hand. He is not honored by sitting at the right hand, nor is He degraded by being sent. Degrees of dignity are not sought for, where is the fullness of divinity.

Duplici autem ratione a vanae gloriae cupidis attendere iubemur: ne vel eorum simulatione ducamur, aestimantes bona esse quae faciunt; vel aemulatione inflammemur, frustra gaudentes in bonis laudari quae simulant. Non solum autem laudes ab hominibus, sed et pecunias quaerunt; sequitur enim qui devorant domos viduarum, simulantes longam orationem.

For two reasons we are bid to beware of those who seek after vain-glory, either lest we be led away by their presences, supposing those things to be good which they do, or be inflamed with jealousy, desiring in vain to be praised for the good deeds which they pretend to. But they seek not only for praise from men, but money; for it follows, Who devour widows’ houses, and for a show make long prayers. For pretending to be righteous and of great merit before God, they do not fail to receive large sums of money from the sick and those whose consciences are disturbed with their sins, as though they would be their protectors in the judgment.

          <td><b>GLOSS</b>. Our Lord having rebuked the covetousness of the Scribes who devoured widows’ houses, commends the almsgiving of a widow; as it is said, And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting into the treasury, &amp;c.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Quia sermone Graeco phylattin, servare dicitur, et gaza lingua Persica divitiae vocantur, gazophylacium locus appellari solet quo divitiae servantur. Erat autem arca foramen habens desuper posita iuxta altare ad dexteram ingredientibus domum domini, in quam mittebant sacerdotes, qui custodiebant hostias, omnem pecuniam quae deferebatur ad templum domini. Dominus autem, sicut operantes in domo sua discutit, ita et dona ferentes respicit; et quem dignum viderit, laudat; quem reprobum, damnat; unde sequitur vidit autem et quamdam viduam pauperculam mittentem aera minuta duo.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; In the Greek language, signifies to keep, and gaza in Persian means riches, hence gazophylacium is used for the name of the place in which money is kept. Now there was a chest with an opening at the top placed near the altar, on the right hand of those entering the house of God, into which the Priests cast all the money, which was given for the Lord’s temple. But our Lord as He overthrows those who trade in His house, so also He remarks those who bring gifts, giving praise to the deserving, but condemning the bad. Hence it follows, And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in there two mites.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Duos obolos offerebat, quos cum sudoribus ad diurnum victum acquisierat; vel quae quotidie per aliena poscit suffragia, Deo donat, ostendens ei suam paupertatem fructiferam. Vincit igitur alios, et iusta censura coronatur a Deo; unde sequitur et ait illis: vere dico vobis, quia vidua haec pauper plusquam omnes misit.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; She offered two oboli, which with the sweat of her brow she had earned for her daily living, or what she daily begs for at the hands of others she gives to God, showing that her poverty is fruitful to her. Therefore does she surpass the others, and by a just award receives a crown from God; as it follows, Of a truth I say to you, that this poor widow has cast in more, &amp;c.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Acceptabile enim est Deo quicquid bono animo obtulerimus, qui cor, et non substantiam pensat, nec perpendit quantum in eius sacrificio, sed ex quanto proferatur; unde sequitur nam omnes hi ex abundanti sibi miserunt in munera Dei; haec autem ex eo quod illi deest, omnem victum quem habuit misit.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; For whatever we offer with an honest heart is well pleasing to God, who has respect to the heart, not the substance, nor does He weigh the amount of that which is given in sacrifice, but of that from which it is taken as it follows, For all these have cast in of their abundance, but she all that she had.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Non enim paucitatem oblati, sed copiam affectus intuitus est Deus. Non est eleemosyna ex pluribus pauca impendere; sed illud viduae, quae totam sibi evacuavit substantiam. Quod si nequis tantum offerre sicut et vidua, offer saltem totum superfluum.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. For God regarded not the scantiness of the offering, but the overflowing of the affection. Almsgiving is not the bestowing a few at things out of many, but it is that of the widow emptying herself of her whole substance. But if you cannot offer as much as the widow, at least give all that remains over.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Mystice autem divites qui in gazophylacium munera mittebant, significant Iudaeos de iustitia legis elatos; vidua pauper Ecclesiae simplicitatem; quae paupercula vocatur, quia vel superbiae spiritum, vel peccata tamquam mundi divitias abiecit; vidua vero, quia vir eius pro ea mortem pertulit. Haec in gazophylacium duo aera minuta mittit, quia in conspectu Dei, apud quem nostri operis oblationes conservantur, munera sua defert, sive dilectionem Dei et proximi, sive fidei et orationis: quae cunctis superborum Iudaeorum operibus praestant: ex abundanti enim in munera Dei immittunt Iudaei, qui de iustitia sua praesumunt: Ecclesia autem omnem victum suum mittit, quia omne quod vivit, Dei esse muneris intelligit.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Now mystically, the rich men who cast their gifts into the treasury signify the Jews puffed up with the righteousness of the law; the poor widow, the simplicity of the Church which is called poor, because it has either cast away the spirit of pride, or its sins, as if they were worldly riches. But the Church is a widow, because her Husband endured death for her. She cast two mites into the treasury, because in God’s sight, in whose keeping are all the offerings of our works, she presents her gifts, whether of love to God and her neighbor, or of faith and prayer. And these excel all the works of the proud Jews, for they of their abundance cast into the offerings of God, in that they presume on their righteousness, but the Church casts in all her living, for every thing that has life she believes to be the gift of God.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Or the widow may be taken to mean any soul bereft as it were of her first husband, the ancient law, and not worthy to be united to the Word of God. Who brings to God instead of a dowry faith and a good conscience, and so seems to offer more than those who are rich in words, and abound in the moral virtues of the Gentiles.

Sed dominus mirantibus templi fabricas, promulgavit quod in eo lapis super lapidem non maneret; dicitur enim et quibusdam dicentibus de templo, quod lapidibus bonis et donis exornatum esset, dixit: haec quae videtis, venient dies in quibus non relinquetur lapis super lapidem qui non destruatur. Decebat enim locum illum, propter cultorum audaciam, omnimodam desolationem pati.
          <td><b>EUSEBIUS</b>. How beautiful was every thing relating to the structure of the temple, history informs us, and there are yet preserved remains of it, enough to instruct us in what was once the character of the buildings. But our Lord proclaimed to those that were wondering at the building of the temple, that there should not be left in it one stone upon another. For it was meet that that place, because of the presumption of its worshippers, should suffer every kind of desolation.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Divina etiam dispensatio procuravit ut civitas ipsa et templum subverteretur, ne quis forte adhuc parvulus in fide, videns illa constare, dum sacrificiorum ritum attonitus stuperet, raperetur intuitu.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; For it was ordained by the dispensation of God that the city itself and the temple should be overthrown, lest perhaps some one yet a child in the faith, while rapt in astonishment at the rites of the sacrifices, should be carried away by the mere sight of the various beauties.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Verum igitur dictum est de templo manufacto, quod esset subvertendum: nihil enim est manufactum quod non aut vetustas conficiat, aut vis subruat, aut ignis exurat. Tamen est et aliud templum, scilicet synagoga, cuius structura vetus, Ecclesia surgente, dissolvitur. Est etiam templum in unoquoque, quod deficiente fide labitur, et maxime si quis falso Christi nomen obtendat, quo interiorem expugnet affectum.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; It was spoken then of the temple made with hands, that it should be overthrown. For there is nothing made with hands which age does not impair, or violence throw down, or fire burn. Yet there is also another temple, that is, the synagogue, whose ancient building falls to pieces as the Church rises. There is also a temple in every one, which falls when faith is lacking, and above all when any one falsely shields himself under the name of Christ, that so he may rebel against his inward inclinations.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Nequaquam autem discipuli adverterant vim dictorum; sed arbitrabantur de consummatione saeculi dictum esse; et ideo quaerebant quo tempore deberent accidere; unde sequitur interrogaverunt autem illum, dicentes: praeceptor, quando haec erunt, et quod signum cum fieri incipient?
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Now His disciples did not at all perceive the force of His words, but supposed they were spoken of the end of the world. Therefore asked they Him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and what sign, &amp;c.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Matthaeus tertiam interrogationem addidit, ut et templi tempora destruendi, et signum adventus et consummatio saeculi a discipulis quaereretur. Interrogatus autem dominus quando templi futura esset destructio, et quod signum esset eius adventus, de signis docet, de tempore non curat intimandum; sequitur enim qui dixit: videte ne seducamini.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Matthew adds a third question, that both the time of the destruction of the temple, and the sign of His coming, and the end of the world, might be inquired into by the disciples. But our Lord being asked when the destruction of the temple should be, and what the sign of His coming, instructs them as to the signs, but does not mind to inform them as to the time. It follows, Take heed that you be not deceived.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Athanasius</b>: Cum enim sint nobis a Deo charismata et dogmata quae sunt super hominem, tradita, scilicet caelestis conversationis forma, virtus contra Daemones, et adoptio, et notitia patris, et verbi et spiritus sancti donum; adversarius noster Diabolus circuit, quaerens nobis surripere insita semina verbi; dominus autem tamquam sua pretiosa dona in nobis sua documenta concludens, monet ne seducamur. Magnum autem quoddam donum tribuit nobis Dei verbum, ut non solum ex apparentibus non decipiamur, sed etiam si qua latentia sint, diiudicemus per spiritus gratiam. Cum enim sit odiosus Diabolus inventor malitiae, hoc quod ipse est occultat, nomen vero cunctis cupitum simulat callide: puta, si quis subicere sibi volens filios alienos, parentibus absentibus fingat eorum vultus, et filios desiderantes seducat. Ergo in unaquaque haeresum Diabolus figuratus dicit: ego sum Christus, et apud me veritas est; unde sequitur multi enim venient in nomine meo, dicentes: quia ego sum; et tempus appropinquabit.
          <td><b>ATHAN</b>. For since we have received, delivered to us by God, graces and doctrines which ere above man, (as, for example, the rule of a heavenly life, power against evil spirits, the adoption and the knowledge of the Father and the Word, the gift of the Holy Spirit,) our adversary the devil goes about seeking to steal from us the seed of the word which has been sown. But the Lord, shutting up in us His teaching as His own precious gift, warns us, lest we be deceived. And one very great gift He gives us, the word of God, that not only we be not led away by what appears, but even if there is ought lying concealed, by the grace of God we may discern it. For seeing that the devil is the hateful inventor of evil, what he himself is he conceals, but craftily assumes a name desirable to all; just as if a man wishing to get into his power some children not His own, should in the absence of the parents counterfeit their looks, and lead away the children who were longing for them. In every heresy then the devil says in disguise, “I am Christ, and with me there is truth.” And so it follows, For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and the time draws near.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Ante suum enim descensum de caelo, provenient aliqui, quibus acquiescere non oportet: voluit enim unigenitum verbum Dei, cum venit ut mundum salvaret, latere, ut crucem sustineret pro nobis; sed secundus eius adventus non erit clanculo, ut ante, sed terribilis et manifestus: descendet enim in gloria Dei patris, ministrantibus Angelis, ut mundum in iustitia iudicet; unde concludit nolite ergo ire post illos.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; For before His descent from heaven, there shall come some to whom we must not give place. For the Only-begotten Son of God, when He came to save the world, wished to be in secret, that He might bear the cross for us. But His second coming shall not be in secret, but terrible and open. For He shall descend in the glory of God the Father, with the Angels attending Him, to judge the world in righteousness. Therefore He concludes, Go you not therefore after them.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Titus</b>: Vel forsitan non dicit pseudochristos ante consummationem venientes, sed eos qui fuere tempore apostolorum.
          <td><b>TITUS BOST</b>. Or perhaps He does not speak of false Christs coming before the end of the world, but of those who existed in the Apostles’ time.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Multi enim imminente Hierosolymorum excidio principes extitere qui se dicerent esse christos, tempusque libertatis appropinquare. Multi etiam in Ecclesia haeresiarchae diem domini instare praedicaverunt; quos apostolus ad Thessalonicenses damnat. Multi etiam in nomine Christi venere Antichristi; quorum primus est Simon magus, cui dicebant: hic est virtus Dei, quae vocatur magna.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; For there were many leaders when the destruction of Jerusalem was at hand, who declared themselves to be Christ, and that the time of deliverance was drawing nigh. Many heresiarchs also in the Church have preached that the day of the Lord is at hand, whom the Apostles condemn. Many Antichrists also came in Christ’s name, of whom the first was Simon Magus, who said, This man is the great power of God.

Behold the variableness of the climate, which must be ascribed to those storms which by no means regard the order of the seasons. For the things which come in fixed order are not signs. For every thing that we receive for the use of life we pervert to the service of sin, but all those things which we have bent to a wicked use, are turned to the instruments of our punishment.

For when the Author of peace was killed, then justly arose among the Jews wars and sedition. But from wars proceed pestilence and famine, the former indeed produced by the air infected with dead bodies, the latter through the lands remaining uncultivated. Josephus also relates the most intolerable distresses to have occurred from famine; and at the time of Claudius Caesar there was a severe famine, as we read in the Acts, and many terrible events happened, A forboding, as Josephus says, the destruction of Jerusalem.

But the kingdom against kingdom, and the pestilence of those whose word creeps as a cancer, and the famine of hearing the word of God, and the shaking of the whole earth, and the separation from the true faith, may be explained also in the heretics, who contending one with another bring victory to the Church.

For so in truth it was, that when the Romans came and were taking the city, many multitudes of the Jewish people perished in the mouth of the sword; as it follows, And they shall fall by the edge of the sword. But still more were cut off by famine. And these things happened at first indeed under Titus and Vespasian, but after them in the time of Hadrian the Roman general, when the land of their birth was forbidden to the Jews Hence it follows, And they shall be led away captive into all nations. For the Jews filled the whole land, reaching even to the ends of the earth, and when their land was inhabited by strangers, they alone could not enter it; as it follows, And Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.

          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Mystice autem abominatio desolationis, adventus Antichristi est: eo quod sacrilegiis infaustis mentium interiora contaminet, sedens iuxta historiam in templo, ut sibi vindicet divinae solium potestatis. Iuxta interpretationem autem spiritualem pulchre inducitur, eo quod in affectibus singulorum vestigium perfidiae suae confirmare desideret, ex Scripturis disputans se esse Christum. Tunc appropinquabit desolatio, quoniam a vera religione plerique lapsi desistent; tunc erit domini dies, quoniam sicut primus adventus domini fuit propter redimenda peccata, ita et secundus erit propter reprimenda delicta, ne plures perfidiae errore labantur. Est et alius Antichristus, idest Diabolus, qui Ierusalem, idest animam pacificam, obsidere nitatur suae legis exercitu. Ergo quando in medio templi est Diabolus, desolatio abominationis est. Cum autem unicuique laboranti, Christi praesentia spiritualis illuxerit, tollitur iniquus ex medio, et incipit regnare iustitia. Est etiam tertius Antichristus, ut Arius et Sabellius et omnes qui nos prava intentione seducunt. Hae autem sunt praegnantes quibus vae dicitur, quae arvinam suae carnis extendant, et quibus intimorum gressus pigrescat animorum, et effetae virtutum, fetaeque vitiorum. Sed nec illae praegnantes condemnationis expertes sunt, quae in bonorum actuum molimine constitutae, necdum aliquos suscepti operis dedere processus. Sunt quae Dei timore concipiunt, sed non omnes pariunt: sunt enim quae abortivum excludunt verbum antequam pariant. Sunt etiam quae in utero Christum habeant, sed nondum formaverunt. Ergo quae parit iustitiam, Christum parit. Nos etiam parvulos nostros ablactare properemus, ne nos quasi imperfectorum parentes, aut iudicii dies aut mortis inveniat. Quod ita fiet, si omnia dicta iustitiae in corde custodias, nec senectutis tempus expectes; sed in prima aetate sapientiam sine corruptela corporis tui cito concipias, cito nutrias. In fine autem Iudaea omnis a nationibus credituris subicietur in ore gladii spiritalis, qui est sermo bis acutus.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Now mystically, the abomination of desolation is the coming of Antichrist, for with ill-omened sacrilege he pollutes the innermost recesses of the heart, sitting as it is literally in the temple, that he may claim to himself the throne of divine power. But according to the spiritual meaning, he is well brought in, because he desires to impress firmly on the affections the footstep of his unbelief, disputing from the Scriptures that he is Christ. Then shall come desolation, for very many falling away shall depart from the true religion. Then shall be the day of the Lord, since as His first coming was to redeem sin, so also His second shall be to subdue iniquity, lest more should be carried away by the error of unbelief. There is also another Antichrist, that is, the Devil, who is trying to besiege Jerusalem, i.e. the peaceful soul, with the hosts of his law. When then the Devil is in the midst of the temple, there is the desolation of abomination. But when upon any one in trouble the spiritual presence of Christ has shone, the unjust one is cast out, and righteousness begins her reign. There is also a third Antichrist, as Arius and Sabellius and all who with evil purpose lead us astray. But these are they who are with child, to whom woe is denounced, who enlarge the size of their flesh, and the step of whose inmost soul waxes slow, as those who are worn out in virtue, pregnant with vice. But neither do those with child escape condemnation, who though firm in the resolution of good acts, have not yet yielded any fruits of the work undertaken. These are those which conceive from fear of God, but do not all bring forth. For there are some which thrust forth the word abortive before their delivery. There are others too which have Christ in the womb, but have not yet formed Him. Therefore she who brings forth righteousness, brings forth Christ. Let us also hasten to nourish our children, lest the day of judgment or death find us as it were the parents of an imperfect offspring. And this you will do if you keep all the words of righteousness in your heart, and wait not the time of old age, but in your earliest years, without corruption of your body, quickly conceive wisdom, quickly nourish it. But at the end shall all Judea be made subject to the nations which shall believe, by the mouth of the spiritual sword, which is the two-edged word.

For at that time when the end of this perishing life shall be accomplished, and, as the Apostle says, The fashion of this world passes away, then shall succeed a new world in which instead of sensible light, Christ Himself shall shine as a sunbeam, and as the King of the new world, and so mighty and glorious will be His light, that the sun which now dazzles so brightly, and the moon and all the stars, shall be hidden by the coming of a far greater light.

          <td><b>EUSEBIUS</b>. What things shall befall the world after the darkening of the orbs of light, and whence shall arise the straitening of nations, He next explains as follows, And of the earth distress of nations, by reason of the confusion of the roaring of the sea. Wherein He seems to teach, that the beginning of the universal change will be owing to the failing of the watery substance. For this being first absorbed or congealed, so that no longer is heard the roaring of the sea, nor do the waves reach the shore because of the exceeding drought, the other parts of the world, ceasing to obtain the usual vapor which came forth from the watery matter, shall undergo a revolution. Accordingly since the appearance of Christ must put down the prodigies which resist God, namely, those of Antichrist, the beginnings of wrath shall take their rise from droughts, such as that neither storm nor roaring of the sea be any more heard. And this event shall be succeeded by the distress of the men who survive; as it follows, Men’s hearts being dried up for fear, and looking after those things which shall come upon the whole world. But the things that shall then come upon the world He proceeds to declare, adding, For the powers of heaven shall be shaken.

Sed si ista mala quae nunc patitur genus humanum, certa sunt indicia iam dominum esse venturum, quid est quod dicit apostolus: cum dixerint: pax et securitas? Videamus ergo ne forte melius intelligatur non eo modo impleri quae praedicta sunt his verbis; sed tunc potius esse ventura, quando sic erit tribulatio universo orbi ut ad Ecclesiam pertineat, quae universo orbe tribulabitur, non ad eos qui tribulabunt eam: ipsi enim sunt dicturi: pax et securitas. Nunc autem ista mala quae tamquam summa extremaque creduntur, utrique regno, Christi scilicet et Diaboli, videmus esse communia: pariter quippe his boni affliguntur et mali; interque tanta mala adhuc usquequaque frequentantur luxuriosa convivia.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. But you will say, your punishment compels you to confess that the end is now approaching, seeing the fulfillment of that which was foretold. For it is certain there is no country, no place in our time, which is not affected or troubled. But if those evils which mankind now suffer are sure signs that our Lord is now about to come, what means that which the Apostle says, For when they shall say peace and safety. Let us see then if it be not perhaps better to understand the words of prophecy to be not so fulfilled, but rather that they will come to pass when the tribulation of the whole world shall be such that it shall belong to the Church, which shall be troubled by the whole world, not to those who shall trouble it. For they are those who shall say, Peace and safety. But now these evils which are counted the greatest and most immoderate, we see to be common to both the kingdoms of Christ and the Devil. For the good and the evil are alike afflicted with them, and among these great evils is the yet universal resort to licentious feasts. Is not this the being dried up from fear, or rather the being burnt up from lust?

For the Church is the sun, the moon, and the stars, to whom it was said, Fair as the moon, elect as the sun. And she will then not be seen for the unbounded rage of the persecutors.

For in persecutions, the love of this world generally shuts out the light of the divine Sun; the stars also fall, that is, men who shine in glory fall when the bitterness of persecution waxes sharp and prevails. And this must be until the multitude of the Church be gathered in, for thus are the good tried and the weak made manifest.

But then it shall be with great power and majesty, for far greater will His power and might appear to His saints, to whom He will give great virtue, that they may not be overcome in such a fearful persecution. Or in His body in which He sits at His Father’s right hand He must rightly be supposed to come, and not only in His body, but also in a cloud, for He will come even as He went away, And a cloud received him out of their sight.

In Scriptura enim sacra saepe caput pro mente ponitur: quia sicut capite reguntur membra, ita cogitationes mente disponuntur.

Having in what has gone before spoken against the reprobate, He now turns His words to the consolation of the elect; for it is added, When these things begin to be, look up, and lift up your heads, for your redemption draws nigh; as if he says, When the buffetings of the world multiply, lift up your heads, that is, rejoice your hearts, for when the world closes whose friends you are not, the redemption is near which you seek. For in holy Scripture the head is often put for the mind, for as the members are ruled by the head, so are the thoughts regulated by the mind. To lift up our heads then, is to raise up our minds to the joys of the heavenly country.

          <td><b>GREG</b>. That the world ought to be trampled upon and despised, He proves by a wise comparison, adding, Behold the fig tree and all the trees, when they now put forth fruit, you know that summer is near. As if He says, as from the fruit of the tree the summer is perceived to be near, so from the fall of the world the kingdom of God is known to be at hand. Hereby is it manifested that the world’s fall is our fruit. For hereunto it puts forth buds, that whomever it has fostered in the bud it may consume in slaughter.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Matthew speaks of the fig-tree only, Luke of all the trees. But the fig-tree shadows forth two things, either the ripening of what is hard, or the luxuriance of sin; that is, either that, when the fruit bursts forth in all trees and the fruitful fig-tree abounds, (that is, when every tongue confesses God, even the Jewish people confessing Him,) we ought to hope for our Lord’s coming, in which shall be gathered in as at summer the fruits of the resurrection. Or, when the man of sin shall clothe himself in his light and fickle boasting as it were the leaves of the synagogue, we must then suppose the judgment to be drawing near. For the Lord hastens to reward faith, and to bring an end of sinning.

An dicendum est, non omnia quae supra commemorata sunt, esse intelligenda, ubi ait cum videritis haec fieri, sed aliqua eorum, hoc scilicet excepto quod dictum est, et tunc videbunt filium hominis? Sed Matthaeus aperuit, nullis exceptis esse accipiendum, dicens: ita et vos cum videritis haec omnia: inter quae est quod videbitur filius hominis veniens, ut intelligatur de adventu quo nunc venit in membris suis tamquam in nubibus, vel in Ecclesia tamquam in nube magna.

Or must we say that we are not to understand all the things before mentioned, when He says, When you shall see these things, &amp;c. but only some of them; this for example being excepted, And then shall they see the Son of man. But Matthew would plainly have it taken with no exception, for he says, And so you, when you see all these things, among which is the seeing the coming of the Son of man; in order that it may be understood of that coming whereby He now comes in His members as in clouds, or in the Church as in a great cloud.

Or else, He says, the kingdom of God is at hand, meaning that when these things shall be not yet shall all things come to their last end, but they shall be already tending towards it.

Sed quoniam dupliciter contingit attendere, hinc quidem corporis oculis, illinc vero per intellectivam virtutem, oculus corporis virtutem non attingit: restat igitur dictum esse de opere intellectus, attendite; hoc est, undique circumspicite vos, pervigil habentes ad vestram custodiam animae lumen. Neque autem dixit attendite vestris, aut eis quae circa vos sunt, sed vobis: vos enim estis intellectus et anima; vestrum autem corpus est sensus; circa vos autem opes, artes et reliqua vitae supellex; quibus non monet attendendum, sed animae, cuius praecipua cura habenda. Eadem vero admonitio aegrotantes sanat, et sanos perficit; servatores praesentium, et provisores futurorum; non alienorum censores, sed suorum scrutatores; non dimittentes intellectum servum fieri passionum, sed irrationale animae subicientes rationali.

          <td><b>BASIL</b>; Every animal has within itself certain instincts which it has received from God, for the preservation of its own being. Wherefore Christ has also given us this warning, that what comes to them by nature, may be ours by the aid of reason and prudence: that we may flee from sin as the brute creatures shun deadly food, but that we seek after righteousness, as they wholesome herbs. Therefore said He, Take heed to yourselves, that is, that you may distinguish the noxious from the wholesome. But since there are two ways of taking heed to ourselves, the one with the bodily eyes, the other by the faculties of the soul, and the bodily eye does not reach to virtue; it remains that we speak of the operations of the soul. Take heed, that is, Look around you on all sides, keeping an ever watchful eye to the guardianship of your soul. He says not, Take heed to your own or to the things around, but to yourselves. For you are mind and spirit, your body is only of sense. Around you are riches, arts, and all the appendages of life, you must not mind these, but your soul, of which you must take especial care. The same admonition tends both to the healing of the sick, and the perfecting of those that are well, namely, such as are the guardians of the present, the providers of the future, not judging the actions of others, but strictly searching their own, not suffering the mind to be the slave of their passions but subduing the irrational part of the soul to the rational. But the reason why we should take heed He adds as follows, Lest at any time your hearts be overcharged, &amp;c.

Ex pluribus ergo pauca describentes, dederunt nobis quemdam gustum dulcedinis doctrinae ipsius. Ostendit autem nobis dominus quod oporteat noctu et quiete alloqui Deum, et in die prodesse hominibus; et colligere quidem in nocte, distribuere vero collecta in die; unde subditur noctibus vero exiens morabatur in monte qui vocatur oliveti; non quasi opus habens oratione, sed ad exemplum dandum hoc egit.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Now the Evangelists are silent as to the greater part of Christ’s teaching; for whereas He preached for the space nearly of three years, all the teaching which they have written down would scarcely, one might say, suffice for the discourse of a single day. For out of a great many things extracting a few, they have given only a taste as it were of the sweetness of His teaching. But our Lord here instructs us, that we ought to address God at night and in silence, but in day time to be doing good to men; and to gather indeed at night, but in the day distribute what we have gathered. As it is added, And at night he went out and abode in the mount that is called Olivet. Not that He had need of prayer, but He did this for our example.

        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Pascha quidem, quod Hebraice dicitur phase, non a passione, sed a transitu nominatur; eo quod exterminator videns sanguinem in foribus Israelitarum pertransierit, nec percusserit primogenita eorum. Vel ipse dominus praebens auxilium populo suo desuper ambulavit. Hoc autem inter Pascha et azyma distat, quod Pascha ipse solus dies appellatur in quo agnus occidebatur ad vesperam, hoc est decima quarta luna primi mensis; decima quinta autem luna, quando egressus est de Aegypto, succedebat festivitas azymorum septem diebus usque ad vigesimam primam diem eiusdem mensis; unde Evangelii Scriptura indifferenter unum pro alio ponere solet; unde hic dicitur dies azymorum, qui dicitur Pascha. Significatur autem per mysterium, quod Christus semel pro nobis passus, per totum tempus huius saeculi, quod septem diebus agitur, in azymis sinceritatis et veritatis praecepit esse vivendum.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Now the Passover, which is called in Hebrew “Phase,” is not so named from the Passion, but from the passing over, because the destroying angel, seeing the blood on the doors of the Israelites, passed over them, and touched not their first-born. Or the Lord Himself, giving assistance to His people, walked over them. But herein is the difference between the Passover and the feast of unleavened bread, that by the Passover is meant that day alone on which the lamb was slain towards the evening, that is, on the fourteenth day of the first month, but on the fifteenth, when the Israelites went out of Egypt, followed the feast of unleavened bread for seven days, up to the twenty-first of the same month. Hence the writers of the Gospel substitute one indifferently for the other. As here it is said, The day of unleavened bread, which is called the Passover. But it is signified by a mystery, that Christ having suffered once for us, has commanded us through the whole time of this world which is passed in seven days, to live in the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Principes autem sacerdotum nefarias res tractant in festo; unde sequitur et quaerebant principes sacerdotum et Scribae quomodo Iesum interficerent. Moyses quidem unum praecepit esse principem sacerdotum, et illo defuncto creari alium. Tunc vero, cum inciperent Iudaici ritus dissolvi, multi erant principes sacerdotum annuatim creati. Hi ergo volentes Iesum occidere, non metuunt divina, ne scilicet ex tempore sacro maius incurrant peccati contagium: sed ubique timent humana; unde sequitur timebant vero plebem.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. The Chief Priests set about their impious deed on the feast, as it follows, And the Chief Priests and Scribes, &amp;c. Moses ordained only one Priest, at whose death another was to be appointed. But at that time, when the Jewish customs had begun to fall away, there were many made every year. These then wishing to kill Jesus, are not afraid of God, lest in truth the holy time should aggravate the pollution of their sin, but every where fear man. Hence it follows, For they feared the people.

          <td><b>Beda</b>: Non quidem seditionem metuentes, sed caventes ne auxilio populi de suis manibus tolleretur. Haec autem ante biduum Paschae congregatis eis in atrio Caiphae Matthaeus acta attestatur.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Not indeed that they apprehended sedition, but were afraid lest by the interference of the people He should be taken out of their hands. And these things Matthew reports to have taken place two days before the Passover, when they were assembled in the judgment hall of Caiaphas.

But should any one say, “If on the first day of unleavened bread the disciples of our Savior prepare the Passover, on that day then should we also celebrate the Passover;” we answer, that this was not an admonition, but a history of the fact. It is what took place at the time of the saving Passion; but it is one thing to relate past events, another to sanction and leave them an ordinance to posterity. Moreover, the Savior did not keep His Passover with the Jews at the time that they sacrificed the lamb. For they did this on the Preparation, when our Lord suffered. Therefore they entered not into the hall of Pilate, that they might not be defiled, but might eat the Passover. For from the time that they conspired against the truth, they drove far from them the Word of truth. Nor on the first day of unleavened bread, on which the Passover ought to be sacrificed, did they eat their accustomed Passover, for they were intent upon something else, but on the day after, which was the second of unleavened bread. But our Lord on the first day of unleavened bread, that is, on the fifth day of the week, kept the Passover with His disciples.

Next behold His condescension, in that He chooses not the person of the rich or powerful, but seeks after the poor, and prefers a mean inn to the spacious palaces of nobles. Now the Lord was not ignorant of the name of the man whose mystery He knew, and that he would meet the disciples, but he is mentioned without a name, that he may be counted as ignoble.

And living in this conversation, it becomes us to rejoice in the mysteries of Christ. Now these mysteries Peter and John prepare, that is, action and contemplation, fervid zeal and peaceful meekness. And these preparers a certain man meets, because in what we have just mentioned, lies the condition of man who was created after the image of God. And he carries a pitcher of water, which signifies the grace of the Holy Spirit. But the pitcher is humbleness of heart; for He gives grace to the humble, who know themselves to be but earth and dust.

Qui autem non consequuntur spiritualiter eum, non celebrant Pascha cum Iesu. Ascendamus ergo, ipso domino constituto nobiscum, ad superiorem locum in quo est diversorium, quod demonstratur ab intellectu, qui est in unoquoque homine paterfamilias, discipulis Christi. Haec autem domus superior sit nobis magna, ut capiat Iesum verbum Dei, quod non capitur, nisi a magnis sensu. Et sit domus haec a patrefamilias, idest intellectu, praeparata filio Dei, et sit mundata, nullo modo habens malitiae sordes.

          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>, But I think that the man who meets the disciples as they enter into the city, carrying a pitcher of water, was some servant of a master of a house, carrying water in an earthen vessel either for washing or for drinking. And this I think is Moses conveying the spiritual doctrine in fleshly histories. But they who follow him not, do not celebrate the Passover with Jesus. Let us then ascend with the Lord united to us, to the upper part in which is the guest-chamber, which is shown by the understanding, that is, the goodman of the house, to every one of the disciples of Christ. But this upper room of our house must be large enough to receive Jesus the Word of God, who is not comprehended but by those who are greater in comprehension. And this chamber must be made ready by the goodman of the house, (that is, the understanding,) for the Son of God, and it must be cleaned, wholly purged of the filth of malice. The master of the house also must not be any common person having a known name. Hence He says mystically in Matthew, Go you to such a one.

Or else; When our Lord was celebrating the new Passover, He fitly said, With desire have I desired this Passover, that is, the new mystery of the New Testament which He gave to His disciples, and which many prophets and righteous men desired before Him. He then also Himself thirsting for the common salvation, delivered this mystery, to suffice for the whole world. But the Passover was ordained by Moses to be celebrated in one place, that is, in Jerusalem. Therefore it was not adapted for the whole world, and so was not desired.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Thus then was our Lord the approver of the legal Passover; and as He taught that it related to the figure of His own dispensation, He forbids it henceforth to be represented in the flesh. Therefore He adds, For I say to you, I will not any more eat thereof; until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God. That is, I will no more celebrate the Mosaic Passover, until, being spiritually understood, it is fulfilled in the Church. For the Church is the kingdom of God; as in Luke, The kingdom of God is within you. Again, the ancient Passover, which He desired to bring to an end, is also alluded to in what follows; And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take you, &amp;c.

Let us not then after our meals turn to sleep, but to prayer. For Christ plainly signifies this, that the partaking of food should not be followed by sleep or rest, but by prayer and reading the holy Scripture.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; But it is far more natural, that as before of the typical lamb, so now also of the drink of the Passover, He should say that He would no more taste, until the glory of the kingdom of God being made manifest, the faith of the whole world should appear; that so by means of the spiritual changing of the two greatest commands of the law, namely, the eating and drinking of the Passover you might learn that all the Sacraments of the law were to be transferred to a spiritual observance.

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Nor doubt that this is true; for He plainly says, This is my body; but rather receive the words of your Savior in faith. For since He is the Truth, He lies not. They rave foolishly then who say that the mystical blessing loses its power of sanctifying, if any remains are left till the following day. For the most holy Body of Christ will not be changed, but the power of blessing and the life giving grace is ever abiding in it. For the life-giving power of God the Father is the only-begotten Word, which was made flesh not ceasing to be the Word, but making the flesh life giving. What then? since we have in us the life of God, the Word of God dwelling in us, will our body be life-giving? But it is one thing for us by the habit of participation to have in ourselves the Son of God, another for Himself to have been made flesh, that is, to have made the body which He took from the pure Virgin His own Body. He must needs then be in a certain manner united to our bodies by His holy Body and precious Blood, which we have received for a life giving blessing in the bread and wine. For lest we should be shocked, seeing the Flesh and Blood placed on the holy altars, God, in compassion to our infirmities, pours into the offerings the power of life, changing them into the reality of His own flesh, that the body of life may be found in us, as it were a certain life-giving seed. He adds, Do this in commemoration of me.

Igitur ut leones flammam spirantes, sic ab illa mensa discedimus terribiles facti Diabolo.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Christ did this to bring us to a closer bond of friendship, and to betoken His love toward us, giving Himself to those who desire Him, not only to behold Him, but also to handle Him, to eat Him, to embrace Him with the fullness of their whole heart. Therefore as lions breathing fire do we depart from that table, rendered objects of terror to the devil.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Now Luke mentions two cups; of the one we spoke above, Take this, and divide it among yourselves, which we may say is a type of the Old Testament; but the other after the breaking and giving of bread, He Himself imparts to His disciples. Hence it is added, Likewise also the cup after supper.

Utrumque autem coniunctum eamdem sententiam facit quae illorum est, scilicet Matthaei et Marci.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or because Luke has twice mentioned the cup, first before Christ gave the bread, then after He had given it, on the first occasion he has anticipated, as he frequently does, but on the second that which he has placed in its natural order, he had made no mention of before. But both joined together make the same sense which we find in the others, that is, Matthew and Mark.

Cum autem dicit pro vobis, non significat pro solis apostolis corpus Christi datum et sanguinem effusum fuisse; sed causa totius humanae naturae. Et vetus quidem Pascha ad removendam servitutem Aegypti fiebat, sanguis autem agni ad primogenitorum custodiam: novum vero Pascha ad peccatorum remissionem, sanguis autem Christi ad conservationem eorum qui dedicati sunt Deo.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Our Lord calls the cup the New Testament, as it follows, This cup is the New Testament in my blood, which shall be shed for you, signifying that the New Testament has its beginning in His blood. For in the Old Testament the blood of animals was present when the law was given, but now the blood of the Word of God signifies to us the New Testament. But when He says, for you, He does not mean that for the Apostles only was His Body given, and His Blood poured out, but for the sake of all mankind. And the old Passover was ordained to remove the slavery of Egypt; but the blood of the lamb to protect the first-born. The new Passover was ordained to the remission of sins; but the Blood of Christ to preserve those who are dedicated to God.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Hic enim sanguis operatur in nobis imaginem regiam, nobilitatem animae non permittit marcescere, protinus irrigans animam, magnamque inspirans virtutem. Hic sanguis fugat Daemones, advocat Angelos et dominum Angelorum. Hic sanguis effusus lavit orbem, et adibile fecit caelum. Huius participes sanguinis, sunt supernis virtutibus amicti, regio pallio, magis autem ipso rege induti. Et sicut si mundus accesseris, salubriter accessisti; sic si imbutus conscientia prava, damnose accedis in poenam et supplicia. Nam si qui imperatoriam coinquinant purpuram, pari poena plectuntur cum eis qui divellunt; absurdum non est si et qui obscoena mente corpus Christi recipiunt, pari poena plectuntur cum his qui illud clavis transfoderunt.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. For this Blood molds in us a royal image, it suffers not our nobleness of soul to waste away, moreover it refreshes the soul, and inspires it with great virtue. This Blood puts to flight the devils, summons angels, and the Lord of angels. This Blood poured forth washed the world, and made heaven open. They that partake of it are built up with heavenly virtues, and arrayed in the royal robes of Christ; yes rather clothed upon by the King Himself. And since if you come clean, you come healthfully; so if polluted by an evil conscience, you come to your own destruction, to pain and torment. For if they who defile the imperial purple are smitten with the same punishment as those who tear it asunder, it is not unreasonable that they who with an unclean heart receive Christ should be beaten with the same stripes as they were who pierced Him with nails.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Because the bread strengthens, and the wine produces blood in the flesh, the former is ascribed to the Body of Christ, the latter to His Blood. But because both we ought to abide in Christ, and Christ in us, the wine of the Lord’s cup is mixed with water, for John bears witness, The people are many waters.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. But first the bread is given, next the cup. For in spiritual things labor and action come first, that is, the bread, not only because it is toiled for by the sweat of the brow, but also because while being eaten it is not easy to swallow. Then after labor follows the rejoicing of Divine grace, which is the cup.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; For this reason then the Apostles communicated after supper, because it was necessary that the typical passover should be first completed, and then they should pass on to the Sacrament of the true Passover. But now in honor of so great a Sacrament, the masters of the Church think right that we should first be refreshed with the spiritual banquet, and afterward with the earthly.

Fractio autem panis venerandi passionem significat.
          <td><b>GREEK EX</b>. He that communicates receives the whole Body and Blood of our Lord, even though he receive but a part of the Mysteries. For as one seal imparts the whole of its device to different substances, and yet remains entire after distribution, and as one word penetrates to the hearing of many, so there is no doubt that the Body and Blood of our Lord is received whole in all. But the breaking of the sacred bread signifies the Passion.

For Christ alone is the full image of God, on account of the unity of His Father’s glory expressed in Him. But the righteous man is after the image of God, if for the sake of imitating the likeness of the Divine conversation, He through the knowledge of God despises the world. Therefore also we eat the Body and Blood of Christ, that we may be partakers of eternal life. Whence it follows, That you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; But the twelve thrones are not as it were any resting-places for the bodily posture, but because since Christ judges after the Divine likeness by knowledge of the hearts, not by examination of the actions, rewarding virtue, condemning iniquity; so the Apostles are appointed to a spiritual judgment, for the rewarding of faith, the condemnation of unbelief, repelling error with virtue, inflicting vengeance on the sacrilegious.

Hence it follows, And the Lord said to Simon, Simon, behold Satan has desired you, that he may sift you as wheat. That is, he has longed to tempt you and to shake you, as he who cleanses wheat by winnowing. Wherein He teaches that no man’s faith is tried unless God permits it.

For He who had spoken not in supplication, but by authority, Upon this rock I will build my Church, and I will give you the keys of the kingdom, how should He have need of prayer that He might stay one agitated soul?

Hoc autem intelligendum est non solum de apostolis qui tunc erant, ut roborarentur a Petro; sed et de omnibus qui usque ad finem mundi futuri sunt fidelibus: ne scilicet aliquis credentium diffidat, videns eum qui, cum esset apostolus, denegavit, ac iterum per poenitentiam obtinuit praerogativam, ut esset antistes mundi.
            <p>Admirare igitur exuberantiam divinae patientiae: ne diffidere discipulum faceret, nondum patrato crimine largitus est veniam, ac iterum ipsum in apostolico gradu restituit, dicens confirma fratres tuos.

            <b>THEOPHYL</b>. For albeit you are for a time shaken, yet you hold stored up, a seed of faith; though the spirit has shed its leaves in temptation, yet the root is firm. Satan then seeks to harm you, because he is envious of my love for you, but notwithstanding that I have prayed for you, you shall fall. Hence it follows, And when you are converted, strengthen your brethren. As if He says, After that you have wept and repented your denial of Me, strengthen your brethren, for I have deputed you to be the head of the Apostles. For this befits you who are with Me, the strength and rock of the Church. And this must be understood not only of the Apostles who then were, but of all the faithful who were about to be, even to the end of the world that none of the believers might despair, seeing that Peter though an Apostle denied his Lord, yet afterwards by penitence obtained the high privilege of being the Ruler of the world.
            <p><b>CYRIL</b>; Marvel then at the superabundance of the Divine forbearance: lest He should cause a disciple to despair, before the crime was committed, He granted pardon, and again restored him to his Apostolic rank, saying, Strengthen your brethren.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Because the Lord said He had prayed for Peter’s faith, Peter conscious of present affection and fervent faith, but unconscious of his coming fall, does not believe he could in any way fall from Christ. As it follows, And he said to him, Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. He burns forth indeed with too much love, and promises what is impossible to him. But it be him as soon as he heard from the Truth that he was to be tempted, to be no longer confident. Now the Lord, seeing that Peter spoke boastfully, reveals the nature of his temptation, namely, that he would deny Him; I tell you, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that you thrice deny, &amp;c.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. From hence we draw a great doctrine, that human resolve is not sufficient without the Divine support. For Peter with all his zeal, nevertheless when forsaken of God was overthrown by the enemy.

Unde reor et iussionis modum in eis debere fore diversum: nam timoratus quodam iuvamine indigens, circa eamdem rem erga quam peccavit, iussa debet perferre; alii vero cum totum bonum animae destruxerint, affligi et moneri, et praeceptis subici debent, quousque ratum sit illis Deum iustum iudicem esse, et contremiscant.
          <td><b>BASIL</b>; We must know then, that God sometimes allows the rash to receive a fall, as a remedy to previous self-confidence. But although the rash man seems to have committed the same offense with other men, there is no slight difference. For the one has sinned by reason of certain secret assaults and almost against his will, but the others, having no care either for themselves or God, knowing no distinction between sin and virtuous actions. For the rash needing some assistance, in regard to this very thing in which he has sinned ought to suffer reproof. But the others, having destroyed all the good of their soul, must be afflicted, warned, rebuked, or made subject to punishment, until they acknowledge that God is a just Judge, and tremble.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Cons. Evang</b>: Hoc autem quod hic dicitur de Petri negatione praedicta, omnes quidem Evangelistae commemorant; sed non omnes ex una eademque occasione sermonis ad eam commemorandam veniunt: nam Matthaeus et Marcus eam subnectunt postea quam dominus egressus est ex illa domo ubi manducaverant Pascha; Lucas vero et Ioannes antequam inde esset egressus. Sed facile possemus intelligere aut illos duos ea recapitulando posuisse, aut istos praeoccupando; nisi magis moveret quod tam diversa non tantum verba, sed etiam sententias domini praemittunt, quibus permotus Petrus illam praesumptionem praeferret, vel pro domino vel cum domino moriendi, ut magis cogant intelligi, ter eum expressisse praesumptionem suam diversis locis sermonis Christi, et ter illi a domino responsum, quod eum ante galli cantum ter esset negaturus.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Now what is here said concerning the foregoing denial of Peter is contained in all the Evangelists, but they do not all happen to relate it upon the same occasion in the discourse. Matthew and Mark subjoin it after our Lord had departed from the house where He had eaten the Passover but Luke and John before He went out from thence. But we may easily understand either that the two former used these words, recapitulating them, or the two others anticipating them: only it rather moves us, that not only the words but even the sentences of our Lord, in which Peter being troubled used that boast of dying either for or with our Lord, are given so differently, as rather to compel us to believe that he thrice uttered his boast at different parts of our Lord’s discourse, and that he was thrice answered by our Lord, that before the cock crowed he should deny Him thrice.

But having once made mention of His being taken captive, He next announces the struggle that would ensue against the Jews. Hence it is said, And he said to them, When I sent you without purse, &amp;c. For the Savior had sent the holy Apostles to preach in the cities and towns the kingdom of heaven, bidding them to take no thought of the things of the body, but to place their whole hope of salvation in l km.

In exordiis quidem praesto in cunctis eis aderat, parans eis uberrime affluentiam omnium; unde sequitur at illi dixerunt: nihil. At ubi oportebat et proprias vires ostendere, subtraxit eis aliquantulum gratiam, iubens eis ex se nonnulla peragere; unde sequitur dixit ergo eis: sed nunc qui habet sacculum, quo scilicet portatur pecunia, tollat similiter et peram, qua scilicet portantur cibaria. Et quidem quando nec calceamenta, nec zonam habebant, nec baculum, nec aes, nullius passi sunt penuriam; ut autem marsupium concessit eis, et peram, esurire videntur, et sitire, et nuditatem pati; ac si eis diceret: hactenus cuncta vobis uberrime affluebant; nunc autem volo vos et inopiam experiri: ideoque non addico necessitati pristinae legis, sed mando et loculum habere et peram. Poterat autem et Deus usque in finem eos in tanta constituere copia; sed noluit ob multas causas: primo quidem ut nihil sibi tribuerent, sed recognoscerent totum emanasse divinitus; secundo ut moderari sibi sciant; tertio ne maiora de se opinentur. Horum igitur causa permittens eos incurrere multa inopinatorum, relaxavit prioris legis rigorem, ne gravis et intolerabilis fieret eis vita.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Now as one who teaches to swim, at first indeed placing his hands under his pupils, carefully supports them, but afterward frequently withdrawing his hand, bids them help themselves, nay even lets them sink a little; so likewise did Christ deal with His disciples. At the beginning truly He was present to them, giving them most richly abundance of all things; as it follows, And they said to them, Nothing. But when it was necessary for them to show their own strength, He withdrew from them for a little His grace, bidding them do something of themselves; as it follows, But now he that has a purse, that is, wherein to carry money, let him take it, and likewise his scrip, that is, to carry provisions in. And truly when they had neither shoes, nor girdle, nor staff, nor money, they never suffered the want of any thing. But when He allowed them purse and scrip, they seem to suffer hunger, and thirst, and nakedness. As if He said to them, Hitherto all things have been most richly supplied to you, but now I would have you also experience poverty, therefore I hold you no longer to the former rule, but I command you to get purse and scrip. Now God might even to the end have kept them in plenty, but for many reasons He was unwilling to do so. First that they might impute nothing to themselves, but acknowledge that every thing flowed from God; secondly, that they might learn moderation; thirdly, that they might not think too highly of themselves. For this cause while He permitted them to fall into many unlooked for evils, He relaxed the rigor of the former law, lest it should become grievous and intolerable.

When He sent them to preach, He ordered them to take nothing in the way, ordaining in truth, that He who preaches the Gospel should live by the Gospel. But when the crisis of death was at hand, and the whole nation persecuted both the shepherd and the Hock, He proposes a law adapted to the time, allowing them to take the necessaries of life, until the rage of the persecutors was abated, and the time of preaching the Gospel had returned. Herein He leaves us also an example, that at times when a just reason urges, we may intermit without blame somewhat of the strictness of our determination.

For if it were fitting to be completely armed, not only must a man possess a sword, but shield and helmet. But even though a thousand had arms of this kind, how could the eleven be prepared for all the attacks and lying in wait of people, tyrants, allies, and nations, and how should they not quake at the mere sight of armed men, who had been brought up near lakes and rivers? We must not then suppose that He ordered them to possess swords, but by the swords He points at the secret attack of the Jews. And hence it follows, For I say to you, that this that is written must, be accomplished in me: And he was numbered with the transgressors.

Behold I even your Master am led to a disgraceful death, to be reckoned with the transgressors. For these things which are prophesied of Me have an end, that is, a fulfillment. Wishing then to hint at a violent attack, He made mention of a sword, not altogether revealing it, lest they should be seized with dismay, nor did He entirely provide that they should not be shaken by these sudden attacks, but that afterwards recovering, they might marvel how He gave Himself up to the Passion, a ransom for the salvation of men.

But if any one oppressed with extreme poverty applies himself to religion, let him also sell his cloak and buy a sword. For the terrible attack of battle shall overtake them, so that nothing shall suffice to resist it. He next lays open the cause of these evils, namely, that He suffered the penalty due to the wicked, being crucified with thieves. And when it shall have come at last to this, the word of dispensation will receive its end. But to the persecutors shall happen all that has been foretold by the Prophets. These things then God prophesied concerning what should befall the country of the Jews, but the disciples understood not the depth of His words, thinking they had need of swords against the coming attack of the traitor.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Or the two swords suffice for a testimony that Jesus suffered voluntarily. The one indeed was to teach the Apostles the presumption of their contending for their Lord, and His inherent virtue of healing; the other never taken out of its sheath, to show that they were not even permitted to do all that they could for His defense.

Est etiam gladius passionis ut exuas corpus, et immolatae carnis exuviis ematur tibi sacra corona martyrii. Movet adhuc quod duos gladios discipuli protulerunt: ne forte unum novi, unum veteris testamenti sit, quibus adversus Diaboli armamur insidias.

There is also a spiritual sword, that you may sell your patrimony, and buy the word, by which the nakedness of the soul is clothed. There is also a sword of suffering, so that you may strip your body, and with the spoils of your sacrificed flesh purchase for yourself the sacred crown of martyrdom. Again it moves, seeing that the disciples put forward two swords, whether perhaps one is not of the Old Testament, the other of the New, whereby we are armed against the wiles of the devil. Therefore the Lord says, It is enough, because he wanted nothing who is fortified by the teaching of both Testaments.

Now it is plain that human nature contains nothing worthy of God’s imitation. Accordingly the tokens of respect which we evince to one another, confessing ourselves to be inferior to our neighbors, we have transferred to the humiliation of the Incomparable Nature. And thus He who bore our sicknesses and interceded for us, bent His knee in prayer, by reason of the man which He assumed, giving us an example, that we ought not to exalt ourselves at the time of prayer, but in all things be conformed to humility; for God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.

Cur igitur ita dictum est, consideres. Quantum erat audire quod Deus ineffabilis, qui quemlibet intellectum transcendit, voluit uterum subire virgineum, lac sugere, et humana quaeque pati.

And so having in words commanded to pray, lest they enter into temptation, He does the same likewise in work, saying, Father, if you be willing, remove this cup from me. He said not the words, If you will, as if ignorant whether it was pleasing to the Father. For such knowledge was not more difficult than the knowledge of His Father’s substance, which He alone clearly knew, according to John, As the Father knows me, even so have I known the Father. Nor says He this, as refusing His Passion. For He who rebuked a disciple, who wished to prevent His Passion, so as even after many commendations, to call him Satan, how should He be unwilling to be crucified? Consider then why it was so said. How great a thing was it to hear that the unspeakable God, who passes all understanding, was content to enter the virgin’s womb, to suck her milk, and to undergo every thing human. Since then that was almost incredible which was about to happen, He sent first indeed Prophets to announce it, afterwards He Himself comes clothed in the flesh, so that you could not suppose Him to be a phantom. He permits His flesh to endure all natural infirmities, to hunger, to thirst, to sleep, to labor, to be afflicted, to be tormented; on this account likewise He refuses not death, that He might manifest thereby His true humanity.

Vult autem nobis bona largiri supra id quod petimus vel intelligimus. Ergo perfectam voluntatem patris, quam ipse noverat, petit sortiri effectum, quae eadem est et sua secundum deitatem. Renuit autem impleri humanam voluntatem, quam dicit suam, paterna voluntate minorem.
          <td>DION. ALEX. Or when He says, Let this cup pass from me, it is not, let it not come to Me, for unless it had come it could not pass away. It was therefore when He perceived it already present that He began to be afflicted and sorrowful, and as it was close at hand, He says, let this cup pass, for as that which has passed can neither be said not to have come nor yet to remain, so also the Savior asks first that the temptation slightly assailing Him may pass away. And this is the not entering into temptation which He counsels to pray for. But the most perfect way? of avoiding temptation is manifested, when he says, Nevertheless, not my will, but yours be done. For God is not a tempter to evil, but He wishes to grant us good things above what we either desire or understand. Therefore He seeks that the perfect will of His Father which He Himself had known, should dispose of the event, which is the same will as His own, as respects the Divine nature. But He shrinks to fulfill the human will, which He calls His own, and which is inferior to His Father’s will.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Athanasius</b>: Geminum enim hic velle ostendit: alterum quidem humanum, quod est carnis; alterum vero divinum: humanitas enim ob carnis fragilitatem recusat passionem: sed divinus eius affectus affectanter eam subiit, eo quod non esset possibile eum detineri a morte.
          <td><b>ATHAN</b>. For here He manifests a double will. One indeed human, which is of the flesh, the other divine. For our human nature, because of the weakness of the flesh, refuses the Passion, but His divine will eagerly embraced it, for that it was not possible that He should be holden of death.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius Nyssenus</b>: Apollinaris autem asserit quod Christus non habuit secundum terrenam naturam propriam voluntatem; sed solum in Christo est voluntas Dei, qui de caelo descendit. Dicat ergo: quam voluntatem vult dominus nequaquam evenire? Neque enim deitas aufert propriam voluntatem.
          <td><b>GREG NYSS</b>. Now Apollinaris asserts that Christ had not His own will according to His earthly nature, but that in Christ exists only the will of God who descends from heaven. Let him then say what will is it which God would have by no means to be fulfilled? And the Divine nature does not remove His own will.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Appropinquans etiam passioni salvator, infirmantium in se vocem sumpsit, ut cum hoc imminet quod fieri nolumus, sic per infirmitatem petamus ut non fiat, quatenus per fortitudinem parati simus ut voluntas conditoris nostri, etiam contra nostram voluntatem, fiat.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; When He drew near His Passion, the Savior also took upon Him the words of weak man; as when something threatens us which we do not wish to come to pass, we then through weakness seek that it may not be, to the end that we also may be prepared by fortitude to find the will of our Creator contrary to our own will.

Confidenter tristitiam nomino, quia crucem praedico. Debuit ergo dolorem suscipere, ut vinceret. Neque enim habent fortitudinis laudem qui stuporem magis vulnerum tulerint quam dolorem. Nos ergo voluit erudire, quemadmodum mortem, et quod est amplius, futurae mortis moestitiam vinceremus. Doles ergo, domine, non mea, sed tua vulnera. Infirmatus est enim propter delicta nostra: et fortasse tristis est ideo quia post Adae lapsum, tali transitu nobis erat ex hoc saeculo recedendum ut mori esset necesse. Nec illud distat a vero; sed tristis erat pro persecutoribus suis quos sciebat immanis sacrilegii poenas daturos.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Many are shocked at this place who turn the sorrows of the Savior to an argument of inherent weakness from the beginning, rather than taken upon Him for the time. But I am so far from considering it a thing to be excused, that I never more admire His mercy and majesty; for He would have conferred less upon me had He not taken upon Him my feelings. For He took upon Him my sorrow, that upon me He might bestow His joy. With confidence therefore I name His sadness, because I preach His cross. He must needs then have undergone affliction, that He might conquer. For they have no praise of fortitude whose wounds have produced stupor rather than pain. He wished therefore to instruct us how we should conquer death, and what is far greater, the anguish of coming death. You smarted then, O Lord, not from your own but my wounds; for he was wounded for our transgressions. And perhaps He is sad, because that after Adam s fall tile passage by which we must depart from this world was such that death was necessary. Nor is it far from the truth that He v. as sad for His persecutors, who He knew would suffer punishment for their wicked sacrilege.

Vel simpliciter nos iubet orare, ut tranquilla sit nostra vita, nec immergamur in aliquod molestorum. Diabolicum enim est et superbum, quemquam se in tentationem praecipitare; unde et Iacobus non dixit: inicite vos in tentationes, sed: cum incideritis, omne gaudium aestimate, de invito voluntarium facientes.

Or He simply bids us pray that our life may be quiet, and we be not cast into trouble of any kind. For it is of the devil and presumptuous, for a man to throw himself into temptation. Therefore James said not, “Cast yourselves into temptation,” but, When you are fallen, count it all joy, making a voluntary act out of an involuntary.

        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Deinde Lucas dicit respondens autem Iesus ait: sinite usque huc. Et hoc est quod Matthaeus commemorat: converte gladium tuum in locum suum. Nec moveat quasi contrarium sit quod Lucas hic dicit dominum respondisse sinite usque huc; quasi post istam percussionem ita dictum fuerit ut placuerit ei usque huc factum, sed amplius fieri noluerit; cum in verbis quae Matthaeus posuit, intelligatur potius, totum factum quo usus est gladio Petrus, domino displicuisse. Illud enim verum est quod cum interrogassent dicentes domine, si percutimus in gladio? Tunc respondit sinite usque huc; idest, non vos moveat quod futurum est: permittendi sunt hucusque progredi, hoc est ut me apprehendant, et impleantur quae de me scripta sunt. Non enim diceret respondens autem Iesus, nisi ad interrogationem eorum responderet, non facto Petri. Sed inter moras verborum interrogantium dominum, et illius respondentis, Petrus aviditate defensionis percussit. Sed non potuerunt simul dici quae simul fieri potuerunt. Tunc, sicut dicit Lucas, sanavit eum qui percussus erat; sequitur enim et cum tetigisset auriculam eius, sanavit eum.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Now Luke says, But Jesus answered and said, Suffer; you thus far; which is what Matthew records, Put your sword up into its sheath. Nor will it move you as contrary thereto, that Luke says here that our Lord answered, Suffer you thus far, as if He had so spoken after the blow to show that what was done had pleased Him so far, but He did not wish it to proceed farther, seeing that in these words which Matthew has given, it may rather be implied that the whole circumstance in which Peter used the sword was displeasing to our Lord. For the truth is, that upon their asking, Lord, shall we strike with the sword? He then answered, Suffer you thus far, that is, be not troubled with what is about to happen. They must be permitted to advance so far, that is, to take Me, and so to fulfill the things which were written of Me. For he would not say, And Jesus answering, unless He answered this question, not Peter’s deed. But between the delay of their words of question to our Lord and His answer, Peter in the eagerness of defense struck the blow. And two things cannot be said, though one may be said and another may be done, at the same time. Then, as Luke says, He healed him who was struck, as it follows, And he touched his ear, and healed him.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Numquam enim pietatis suae dominus obliviscitur. Illi iusto mortem inferunt, iste persequentium vulnera sanat.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; For the Lord is never forgetful of His loving kindness. While they are bringing death upon the righteous, He heals the wounds of His persecutors.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Sed cum dominus vulnere cruentum detersit, mysteria divina subiecit, ut servos principis mundi, non naturae conditione, sed culpae, auris vulnus exciperet, qui non audisset verba sapientiae. Aut si Petrus volens percussit aurem, docuit quod aurem in specie habere non deberet, quam in mysterio non haberet. Sed quare Petrus? Quia ipse ligandi et solvendi adeptus est potestatem; et ideo tollit gladio spiritali aurem interiorem male intelligentis. Sed dominus ipse refundit auditum, demonstrans, et ipsos, si convertantur, posse sanari qui in passione domini vulnerati sunt: eo quod omne peccatum, fidei mysteriis abluatur.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; The Lord in wiping away the bloody wounds, conveyed thereby a divine mystery, namely, that the servant of the prince of this world, not by the condition of His nature but by guilt, should receive a wound on the ear, for that he had not heard the words of wisdom. Or, by Peter so willingly striking the ear, he taught that he ought not to have a ear outwardly, who had not one in a mystery. But why did Peter do this? Because he especially obtained the power of binding and loosing, therefore by his spiritual sword he takes away the interior ear of him who understands not. But the Lord Himself restores the hearing, showing that even they, if they would turn, might be saved, who inflicted the wounds in our Lord’s Passion; for that all sin may be washed away in the mysteries of faith.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Vel servus iste populus est Iudaeorum, principibus sacerdotum indebito mancipatus officio: qui in passione domini dexteram auriculam, idest spiritualem legis intelligentiam, perdidit; quae scilicet auris, Petri gladio deciditur; non quod ille sensum intelligendi audientibus tollat, sed divino ablatum iudicio negligentibus pandat. Verum eadem dextera auris in his qui in eodem populo crediderunt, divina dignatione pristino est restituta officio. Sequitur dixit autem Iesus ad eos qui venerant ad se, principes sacerdotum et magistratus templi et seniores: quasi ad latronem existis cum gladiis et fustibus.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Or that servant is the Jewish people sold by the High Priests to an unlawful obligation, who, by the Passion of our Lord, lost their right ear; that is, the spiritual understanding of the law. And this ear indeed is cut off by Peter’s sword, not that he takes away the sense of understanding from those that hear, but manifests it withdrawn by the judgment of God from the careless. But the same right ear in those who among the same people have believed, is restored by the Divine condescension to its former office. It follows, Then said Jesus to them, Are you come out as against a thief with swords and staves? &amp;c.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Accesserunt enim nocte, timentes multitudinis impetum; et ideo dicit: quid vobis opus erat his armis in eum qui vobiscum est semper? Et hoc est quod sequitur: cum quotidie vobiscum fuerim in templo, non extendistis manus in me.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. For they had come at night fearing an outbreak of the multitude, therefore He says, “What need was there of these arms against one who was always with you? as it follows, When I was daily with you.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Ubi non inculpat dominus praesides Iudaeorum, quod non sibi mature paraverant insidias mortis, sed arguit eos qui temere opinabantur eum se invasisse ipso invito; ac si dicat: tunc non cepistis me, quia nolebam; et nec nunc possetis, nisi me sponte vestris subicerem manibus; unde sequitur sed haec est hora vestra; idest, parvum tempus concessum est vobis exercendae in me vestrae saevitiae, patre votis meis favente. Dicit etiam quod haec potestas est tenebris data, idest Diabolo et Iudaeis, insurgendi in Christum, et hoc est quod subditur et potestas tenebrarum.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Whereby He does not blame the chiefs of the Jews that they had not sooner prepared their murderous designs against Him, but convicts them of having presumptuously supposed they had attacked Him against His will; as if He says, “You did not take Me then, because I willed it not, but neither could you now, did I not of My own accord surrender Myself into your hands.” Hence it follows, But this is your hour, that is, a short time is permitted you to exercise your vengeance against Me, but the Father’s will agrees with Mine. He also says, that this power is given to darkness, i.e. the Devil and the Jews, of rising in rebellion against Christ. And shell is added, And the power of darkness.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Quasi dicat: ideo adversum me in tenebris congregamini, quia potestas vestra, qua sic contra lucem mundi armamini, in tenebris est. Quaeritur autem quomodo Iesus principes sacerdotum, magistratus templi et seniores qui ad se venerunt, alloqui dicatur, cum apud alios Evangelistas non ipsos venisse, verum in atrio Caiphae expectantes, ministros misisse perhibeantur. Sed huic contrarietati respondetur, quod illi non per seipsos, sed per eos quos miserunt ad apprehendendum Christum in suae iussionis potestate venerunt.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; As if He says, Therefore are you assembled against Me in darkness, because your power, wherewith you are thus armed against the light of the world, is in wherewith. But it is asked how Jesus is said to be addressing the chief priests, the officers of the temple, and the elders, who came to Him, whereas they are reported not to have gone of themselves, but to have sent their servants while they waited in the hall of Caiaphas? The answer then to this contradiction is, that they came not by themselves, but by those whom they sent to take Christ in the power of their command.

For it is said, Then took they him, &amp;c. When we read of Jesus being holden, let us guard against thinking that He is holden with respect to His divine nature, and unwilling through weakness, for He is held captive and bound according to the truth of His bodily nature.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. It is therefore said, to the house of the High Priest, that nothing whatever might be done without the consent of the chief of the Priests. For thither had they all assembled waiting for Christ. Now the great zeal of Peter is manifested in his not flying when he saw all the others doing so; for it follows, But Peter followed afar off.

          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Bene a longe sequebatur iam proximus negator: neque enim negare potuisset, si Christo proximus adhaesisset. Sed in hoc fit reverendus, quod dominum non reliquit etiam cum timeret: metus naturae est, cura pietatis.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Rightly he followed afar off, soon about to deny, for he could never have denied if he had clung close to Christ. But herein must he be revered, that he forsook not our Lord, even though he was afraid. Fear is the effect of nature, solicitude of tender affection.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; But that when our Lord was going to His Passion, Peter followed afar off represents the Church about to follow indeed, that is, to imitate our Lord’s Passion, but in a far different manner, for the Church suffers for herself, our Lord suffered for the Church.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; And by this time there was a fire burning in the house of the High Priest; as it follows, And when they had kindled afire, &amp;c. Peter came to warm himself, because his Lord being taken prisoner, the heart of his soul had been chilled in him.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Traditae enim erant Petro claves regni caelorum: credenda erat ei populorum innumera multitudo, quae esset involuta peccatis. Erat autem Petrus paulo durior, sicut truncata servi principis sacerdotum declarat auricula. Hic igitur tam durus tamque severus, si donum non peccandi fuisset adeptus, quae venia commissis populis donaretur? Quem divina providentia permisit, quod primo ipse laberetur in peccatum, quo erga peccantes duriorem sententiam proprii casus intuitu temperaret. Et cum se calefacere vellet ad prunas, accessit ad eum puella, de qua sequitur quem cum vidisset ancilla quaedam sedentem ad lumen, et eum fuisset intuita, dixit: et hic cum illo erat.
          <td><b>PSEUDO-AUG</b>. For to Peter were delivered the keys of the kingdom of heaven, to him were entrusted an innumerable multitude of people, who were wrapped up in sin. But Peter was somewhat too vehement, as the cutting off the ear of the High Priest’s servant ant betokens. If he then who was so stern and so severe had obtained the gift of not sinning, what pardon would he have given to the people committed to him? Therefore Divine Providence suffers him first to beholden of sin, that by the consciousness of his own fall he might soften his too harsh judgment towards sinners. When he wished to warm himself at the fire, a maid came to him, of whom it follows, But a certain maid beheld him, &amp;c.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">

Petrus autem proditus negat: malo enim negasse Petrum quam dominum fefellisse; unde sequitur at ille negavit, dicens: mulier, non novi illum.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; What means it, that a maid is the first to betray Peter, whereas surely men ought the more easily to have recognized him, save that that sex should be plainly implicated in our Lord’s murder, in order that it might also be redeemed by His Passion; But Peter when discovered denies, for better that Peter should have denied, than our Lord’s word should have failed. Hence it follows, And he denied, saying, Woman, I know him not.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Quid ais, o Petre? Vox tua repente mutata est: os enim plenum fidei et amoris in odium perfidiamque conversum est: non tibi flagella, nondum sunt admota tormenta; qui te interrogat, nullus est eorum qui auctoritate sua possit formidinem incutere confitenti: mulier te simplici voce interrogat, et forte nec proditura confessum; nec tamen mulier, sed puella ostiaria, vile mancipium.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. What ails you, Peter, your voice is suddenly changed? That mouth full of faith and love, is turned to hatred and unbelief. Not yet awhile is the scourge applied, not yet the instruments of torture. Your interrogator is no one of authority, who might cause alarm to the confessor. The mere voice of a woman asks the question, and she perhaps not about to divulge your confession, nor yet a woman, but a door-keeper, a mean slave.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Sed ideo negavit Petrus, quia promisit incaute: non negat in monte, non in templo, non in sua domo, sed in praetorio Iudaeorum: ibi negat ubi Iesus ligatus est, ubi veritas non est. Negans autem dicit non novi illum: temerarium quippe erat ut diceret quia noverat eum quem mens humana non potest comprehendere: nemo enim novit filium nisi pater. Rursum secunda vice negat Christum; sequitur enim et post pusillum alius videns eum dixit: et tu de illis es.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Peter denied, because he promised rashly. He does not deny on the mount, nor in the temple, nor in his own house, but in the judgment-hall of the Jews. There he denies where Jesus was bound, where truth is not. And denying Him he says, I know him not. It were presumptuous to say that he knew Him whom the human mind can not grasp. For no one knows the Son but the Father. Again, a second time he denies Christ; for it follows, And after a little while another saw him, and said, You were also one of them.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Cons.

Hoc ergo quod hic Lucas dicit et post pusillum, iam egressus erat ianuam Petrus, et primum gallus cantaverat, ut Marcus dicit; iam redierat, ut, quemadmodum dicit Ioannes, ad focum stans iterum negaret; de qua negatione sequitur Petrus vero ait: o homo, non sum.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. And it is supposed that in the second denial he was addressed by two persons, namely, by the maid whom Matthew and Mark mention, and by another whom Luke speaks of. With respect then to what Luke here relates, And after a little while, &amp;c. Peter had already gone out of the gate, and the cock had crowed the first time, as Mark says; and now he had returned, that, as John says, he might again deny standing by the fire. Of which denial it follows, And Peter said, Man, I am not.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Maluit enim se negare quam Christum; aut quia videbatur negare Christi societatem, utique se negavit.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>, For he preferred to deny himself rather than Christ, or because he seemed to deny being of the company of Christ, he truly denied himself.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; In this denial then of Peter we affirm that not only is Christ denied by him who says that He is not Christ, but by him also, who, being a Christian, says he is not.

          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Tertio quoque interrogatur; sequitur enim et intervallo facto quasi horae unius, alius quidam affirmabat dicens: vere et hic cum illo erat.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; He is also asked a third time; for it follows, And about the space of one hour after, another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Quod Matthaeus et Marcus dicunt: post pusillum, quantum esset hoc temporis manifestat hic Lucas dicendo et intervallo facto quasi horae unius: de hoc autem intervallo tacet Ioannes. Item quod Matthaeus et Marcus non singulari, sed plurali numero enuntiant eos qui cum Petro agebant; cum Lucas et Ioannes unum dicant: facile est intelligere, aut pluralem numerum pro singulari usitata locutione usurpasse Matthaeum et Marcum, aut quod unus maxime, tamquam qui eum viderat, affirmabat; ceteri autem secuti eius fidem Petrum simul urgebant. Iam vero illud quod Matthaeus ipsi Petro dictum asseverat: nonne te vidi in horto? Marcus autem et Lucas inter se illos de Petro locutos: aut sententiam intelligimus tenuisse eos qui compellatum dicunt Petrum: tantum enim valet quod de illo coram illo dicebatur, quantum si illis diceretur; aut utroque modo dictum, et alios hunc, alios illum modum commemorasse.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. What Matthew and Mark call after a little while, Luke explains by saying, about the space of one hour after; but with regard to the space of time, John says nothing. Likewise when Matthew and Mark record not in the singular but in the plural number those who conversed with Peter, while Luke and John speak of one, we may easily suppose either that Matthew and Mark used the plural for the singular by a common form of speech, or that one person in particular addressed Peter, as being the one who had seen him, and that others trusting to his credit joined in pressing him. But now as to the words which Matthew asserts were said to Peter himself, Truly you are one of them, for your speech betrays you; as also those which to the same Peter, John declared to have been said, Did not I see you in the garden? whereas Mark and Luke state that they spoke to one another concerning Peter; we either believe that they held the right opinion who say that they were really addressed to Peter; (for what was said concerning him in his presence amounts to the same as if it had been said to him;) or that they were said in both ways, and that some of the Evangelists related them one way, some the other.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Subdit autem nam et Galilaeus es: non quia alia lingua Galilaei atque alia loquerentur Hierosolymitae, qui utrique fuerunt Hebraei; sed quod una quaeque provincia et regio suas habendo proprietates usitatum loquendi sonum vitare non possit. Sequitur et ait Petrus: o homo, nescio quid dicis.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; But he adds, For he is a Galilean; not that the Galileans spoke a different language from the inhabitants of Jerusalem, who indeed were Hebrews, but that each separate province and country having its own peculiarities could not avoid a vernacular tone of speech. It follows, And Peter said, know I know not what you say.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Hoc est, sacrilegia vestra nescio. Sed nos excusamus, ipse non excusavit; non enim satis est involuta responsio confitentis Iesum, sed aperta confessio: et ideo Petrus non de industria respondisse sic inducitur; quia postea recordatus est, et tamen flevit.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; That is, I know not your blasphemies. But we make excuse for him. He did not excuse himself. For an involved answer is not sufficient for our confessing Jesus, but an open confession is required. And therefore Peter is not represented to have answered this deliberately, for he afterwards recollected himself, and wept.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Solet autem sacra Scriptura saepe meritum causarum per meritum designare temporum; unde Petrus, qui media nocte peccavit, ad galli cantum poenituit; sequitur enim et continuo, illo adhuc loquente, gallus cantavit. Quia quod in tenebris oblivionis erravit, verae lucis rememoratione correxit.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Holy Scripture is often wont to mark the character of certain events by the nature of the times in which they take place. Hence Peter who sinned at midnight repented at cock-crow; for it follows, And immediately, while be yet spoke, the cock crew. The error he committed in the darkness of forgetfulness, he corrected by the remembrance of the true light.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Cons. Evang</b>: Galli autem cantum post trinam negationem Petri intelligimus, sicut Marcus expressit.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; This cock must, I think, be understood mystically as some great Teacher, who rouses the listless and sleepy, saying, Awake, you righteous, and sin not.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Admirare autem curam magistri, quia cum vinctus esset, multa utebatur provisione erga discipulum, quem nutu erigens ad lacrymas provocavit; sequitur enim et conversus dominus respexit Petrum.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Marvel now at the case of the Master, who though in He was a prisoner, had exercised much forethought for His disciple, whom by a look He brought to Himself, and provoked to tears; for it follows, And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Quod quomodo accipiendum sit, diligentius considerandum est. Dicit enim Matthaeus: Petrus enim sedebat foris in atrio; quod non diceret, nisi illa cum domino intus agerentur. Similiter et in eo quod dixit Marcus: et cum esset Petrus in atrio deorsum, ostendit non solum in interioribus, sed etiam in superioribus gesta quae dixerat. Quomodo ergo respicit dominus Petrum facie corporali? Quapropter mihi videtur illa respectio divinitus facta: et sicut dictum est: respice, et exaudi me; et: convertere, domine, libera animam meam, ita dictum arbitror conversus dominus respexit Petrum.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. How we should understand this requires some careful consideration; for Matthew says, Peter was sitting without in the hall, which he would not have said unless the transaction relating to our Lord were passing within. Likewise also, where Mark said, And as Peter was beneath in the hall, he shows that the things he had been speaking of took place not only within but in the upper part. How then did our Lord look upon Peter? not with His bodily face, since Peter was without in the hall among those who were warming themselves, while these things were going on in the inner part of the house. Wherefore, that looking upon Peter seems to me to have been done in a divine manner. And as it was said, Look you, and hear me, and Turn and deliver my soul, so I think the expression here used, The Lord turned and looked upon Peter.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Respicere namque eius, misereri est: quia non solum cum agitur poenitentia, verum etiam ut agatur, Dei misericordia necessaria est.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; For to look upon him is to have compassion, seeing that not only while penance is being practiced, but that it may be practiced, the mercy of God is necessary.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Denique quos Iesus respicit, plorant delictum; unde sequitur et recordatus est Petrus verbi domini quod dixerat: quia prius quam gallus cantet, ter me negabis. Et egressus foras Petrus flevit amare. Quare flevit? Quia erravit ut homo: lacrymas eius lego, satisfactionem non lego. Lavant lacrymae delictum, quod voce pudor est confiteri. Negavit primo et secundo, et non flevit, quia adhuc non respexerat dominus; negavit tertio, respexit eum Iesus, et amarissime flevit. Et tu si veniam vis mereri, dilue lacrymis culpam tuam.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Lastly, those whom Jesus looks upon weep for their sins. Hence it follows, And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to him, Before the cock crow, you shall deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly. Why did he weep? Because he sinned as man. I read of his tears, I do not read of his confession. Tears wash away an offense which it is shame to confess in words. The first and second time he denied and wept not, for as yet our Lord had not looked upon him. He denied the third time, Jesus looked upon him, and he wept bitterly. So then if you will obtain pardon, wash away your guilt in tears.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Non autem audebat Petrus palam flere, ne a lacrymis deprehenderetur; sed foras exiens lacrymabatur. Flebat autem non propter poenam; sed quia dilectum negaverat, quod molestius erat ei quolibet supplicio.
          <td><b>CYRIL</b>. Now Peter did not dare to weep openly, lest he should be detected by his tears, but he went out and wept. He wept not because of punishment, but because he denied his beloved Lord, which was more galling than any punishment.

The Safety of all men forfeits His own, that He may gain that of all.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Not as though he was about to gain any benefit from the sight, but seized with curiosity he thought he should see that extraordinary man, of whose wisdom and wonderful works he had heard so much. He also wished to hear from His mouth what He could say. Accordingly he asks Him questions, making a sport of Him, and ridiculing Him. But Jesus, who performed all things prudently, and who, as David testifies, orders His words with discretion, thought it right in such a case to be silent. For a word uttered to one whom it profits nothing becomes the cause of his condemnation. Therefore it follows, But he answered him nothing.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; He was silent and did nothing, for Herod’s unbelief deserved not to see Him, and the Lord shunned display.

Multa autem sunt quae audientis animum produnt; maxime si auditores nostri et semper laudant quod audiunt, et nunquam quod laudant sequuntur.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. From these words we ought to derive a lesson, that whenever our hearers wish as if by praising us to gain knowledge from us, but not to change their own wicked course, we must be altogether silent, lest if from love of ostentation we speak God’s word, both they who were guilty cease not to be so, and we who were not become so. And there are many things which betray the motive of a hearer, but one in particular, when they always praise what they hear, yet never follow what they praise.

Missio autem Christi a Pilato ad Herodem fit amicitiae communis exordium, quasi Pilato non usurpante sibi subditos ditioni Herodis; unde subditur et facti sunt amici Herodes et Pilatus in ipso die: nam antea inimici erant ad invicem.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Nevertheless, observe how the Devil is thwarted by the thing which He does. He heaps up scorn and reproaches against Christ, whereby it is made manifest that the Lord is not seditious. Otherwise He would not have been derided, when so great a danger was afloat, and that too from a people who were held in suspicion, and so given to change. But the sending of Christ by Pilate to Herod, becomes the commencement of a mutual friendship, Pilate not receiving those who were subject to Herod’s authority, as it is added, And they were made friends, &amp;c. Observe the Devil every where uniting together things separate, that he may compass the death of Christ. Let us blush then, if for the sake of our salvation we keep not even our friends in union with us.

            <b>AUG</b>. But John relates that Jesus bore His own cross, from which is understood that He was Himself carrying His cross, when He went froth to that place which is called Calvary; but as they journeyed Simon was forced into the service on the road, and the cross was given him to carry as far as the place.
            <p><b>THEOPHYL</b>. For no one else accepted to bear the cross, because the wood was counted an abomination. Accordingly upon Simon the Cyrenian they imposed as it were to his dishonor the bearing of the cross, which others refused. Here is fulfilled that prophecy of Isaiah, Whose government shall be upon his shoulder. For the government of Christ is His cross; for which the Apostle says, God has exalted him. And as for a mark of dignity, some wear a belt, others a head dress, so our Lord the cross. And if you seek, you will find that Christ does not reign in us save by hardships, whence it comes that the luxurious are the enemies of the cross of Christ.

Non Iudaeus est qui crucem portat, sed alienigena atque peregrinus, nec praecedit, sed sequitur, iuxta hoc quod scriptum est: tollat crucem suam, et sequatur me.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Christ therefore bearing His cross, already as a conqueror carried His trophies. The cross is laid upon His shoulders, because whether Simon or Himself bore it, both Christ bore it in the man, and the man in Christ. Nor do the accounts of the Evangelists differ, since the mystery reconciles them. And it is the rightful order of our advance that Christ should first Himself erect the trophy of His cross, then hand it down to be raised by His martyrs. He is not a Jew who bears the cross, but an alien and a foreigner, nor does he precede but follow, according as it is written, Let him take up his cross, and follow me.

Et prima quidem causa mortis Christi haec est: secunda vero divinae potestatis ostensio, corpus Christi inhabitantis: cum enim antiquitus deificarent homines, communem exitum mortis sortito, quos heroas et divos nominabant: docuit illum solum mortuum verum esse fatendum quem bravia victoriae, morte prostrata, decorant. Tertia ratio est victima pro toto genere hominum mactanda; qua oblata, tota potestas Daemonum periit, et error quilibet est sedatus. Est et alia causa salutiferae mortis: ut discipuli occulta fide conspicerent resurrectionem post mortem; ad quam propriam spem erigere docebantur; ut mortem contemnentes, agonem contra errores inirent alacriter.
          <td><b>EUSEBIUS</b>. But if, on the contrary, after His intercourse with men, He suddenly disappeared, flying away to avoid death, He might be likened by man to a phantom. And just as if any one wished to exhibit some incombustible vessel, which triumphed over the nature of fire, he would put it into the flame, and then directly draw it out from the flame unharmed; so the Word of God, wishing to show that the instrument which He used for the salvation of men was superior to death, exposed His mortal body to death to manifest His nature, then after a little rescued it from death by the force of His divine power. This is indeed the first cause of Christ’s death. But the second is the manifestation of the divine power of Christ inhabiting a body. For seeing that men of old deified those who were destined to a like end with themselves, and whom they called Heroes and Gods, He taught that He alone of the dead must be acknowledged the true God, who having vanquished death is adorned with the rewards of victory, having trodden death under His feet. The third reason is, that a victim must be slain for the whole race of mankind, which being offered, the whole power of the evil spirits was destroyed, and every error put to silence. There is also another cause of the health-giving death, that the disciples with secret faith might behold the resurrection after death. Whereunto they were taught to lift up their own hopes, that despising death they might embark cheerfully in the conflict with error.

Sed et si aegrotavisset corpus eius, et in conspectu omnium solveretur, inconveniens erat eum qui sanaret aliorum languores, habere proprium corpus affectum languoribus. Sed et si absque aliquo morbo seorsum alicubi corpus deposuisset, ac deinde rursus se offerret, non crederetur ei de resurrectione disserenti: oportet enim mortem resurrectionem praecedere. Cur ergo resurrectionem palam quidem praedicaret, clanculo vero moreretur? Nimirum si latenter haec evenissent, quod excogitarent homines incredulitatis calumnias? Quomodo pateret Christi in mortem victoria, nisi coram omnibus eam patiens, per incorruptionem corporis probasset extinctam? Sed dices: decebat saltem gloriosam mortem sibi excogitare, ut evitaret ignominiam crucis. Sed et si hoc fecisset, suspectum se reddidisset, quasi non habens virtutem contra quamlibet mortem. Sicut ergo pugil prosternens illum quem hostes obtulerint, ostenditur excellentior omnibus; sic omnium vita ab hostibus illatam, quam putabant esse diram et infamem et detestabilem, mortem in cruce suscepit, ut hac interempta, dominium mortis totaliter destruatur. Propter quod non caput ei amputatur ut Ioanni; neque sectus est, ut Isaias; ut corpus integrum et indivisibile morti servet, et non fiat occasio volentibus Ecclesiam dividere. Volebat etiam supportare quam incurreramus maledictionem; maledictam mortem, scilicet crucis, suscipiendo, secundum illud Deut. 21: maledictus homo qui pendet in ligno. In cruce etiam expansis manibus moritur, ut altera quidem manu veterem populum, altera eos qui sunt ex gentibus trahat, utrosque sibi coniungens. Moriens etiam in cruce a Daemonibus expiat aerem, et ascensum nobis parat in caelum.
          <td><b>ATHAN</b>. Now our Savior came to accomplish not His own death, but that of man, for He experienced not death who is Life. Therefore not by His own death did He put off the body, but He endured that which was inflicted by men. But although His body had been afflicted, and was loosed in the sight of all men, yet was it not fitting that He who should heal the sicknesses of others should have His own body visited with sickness. But yet if without any disease He had put off His body apart in some remote place, He would not be believed when speaking of His remote place, For death must precede resurrection; why then should He openly proclaim His resurrection, but die in secret? Surely if these things had happened secretly, what calumnies would unbelieving men have invented? How would the victory of Christ over death appear, unless undergoing it in the sight of all men. He had proved it to be swallowed up by the incorruption of His body? But you will say, At least He ought to have devised for Himself a glorious death, to have avoided the death of the cross. But if He had done this, He would have made Himself suspected of not having power over every kind of death. As then the champion by laying prostrate whomsoever the enemy has opposed to him is shown to be superior to all, so the Life of all men took upon Him that death which His enemies inflicted, because it was the most dreadful and shameful, the abominable death upon the cross, that having destroyed it, the dominion of death might be entirely overthrown. Wherefore His head is not cut off as John’s was He was not sawn asunder as Isaiah, that He might preserve His body entire, and indivisible to death, and not become an excuse to those who ho would divide the Church. For He wished to bear the curse of sin which we had incurred, by taking upon Him the accursed death of the cross, as it is said, Cursed is he that hangs upon a tree. He dies also on the cross with outstretched hands, that with one indeed He may draw to Him the ancient people, with the other the Gentiles joining both to Himself. Dying also on the cross He purges the air of evil spirits, and prepares for us an ascent into heaven.

Altitudo est in ea ligni parte quae ab illo quod transversum figitur, sursum versus relinquitur: hoc est ad caput crucifixi, quia bene sperantium superna expectatio est. Iam vero illud ex ligno quod fixum occultatur, unde totum illud exurgit, profunditatem significat gratuitae gratiae.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. For not without reason did He choose this kind of death, in order that He might be the master of breadth and length, and heighth and depth. For breadth lies in that cross piece of wood which is fastened from above. This belongs to good works, because on it the hands are outstretched. Length lies in that which is seen reaching from the former piece to the ground, for there in a certain manner we stand, that is, abide firm or persevere. And this is applied to long-suffering. Heighth is in that piece of wood which is left reaching upwards from that which is fixed across, that is, to the head of the Crucified; for the expectation of those who hope for better things is upward. Again, that part of the wood which is fixed hidden in the ground, signifies the depth of unrestrained grace.

Reges diademata deponentes, assumunt crucem: in purpuris, in diadematibus, in armis, in mensa sacrata, ubique terrarum crux emicat. Non talia sunt humana: viventibus enim illis qui egerunt strenue, arrident propria gesta, his autem pereuntibus pereunt. Sed in Christo totum contrarium: nam ante crucem omnia moesta; ut autem crucifixus est, omnia clariora facta sunt; ut noscas non purum hominem esse crucifixum.

Two thieves also they crucified on the two sides, that He might be a partaker of their reproach; as it follows, And the thieves one on his right hand, the other on his left. But it did not so turn out. For of them nothing is said, but His cross is every where honored. Kings, laying aside their crowns, assume the cross on their purple, on their diadems, on their arms. On the consecrated table, throughout the whole earth, the cross glitters. Such things are not of men. For even in their lifetime those who have acted nobly are mocked by their own actions, and when they perish their actions perish also. But in Christ it is quite different. For before the cross all things were gloomy, after it all things are joyful and glorious, that you may know that not a mere man was crucified.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; But the two robbers crucified with Christ signify those who under the faith of Christ undergo either the pains of martyrdom, or the rules of a still stricter continence.

Because the Lord had said, Pray for them that persecute you, this likewise He did, when He ascended the cross, as it follows, Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them, not that He was not able Himself to pardon them, but that He might teach us to pray for our persecutors, not only in word, but in deed also. But He says, Forgive them, if they should repent. For He is gracious to the penitent, if they are willing after so great wickedness to wash away their guilt by faith.

It must be remarked, however, that He prayed not for those who chose rather to crucify, than to confess Him whom they knew to be the Son of God, but for such as were ignorant what they did, having a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge, as He adds, For they know not what they do.

He ascends such as nature formed us, God being our Creator. Such as the first man had dwelt in paradise, such did the second man enter paradise.

For neither is a physician by healing himself known to be physician by healing himself known to be a physician, unless he also gives proof of his skill towards the sick. So the Lord being the Savior had no need of salvation, nor by descending from the cross did He wish to be acknowledged the Savior, but by dying.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Here the condemned performs the office of judge, and he begins to decide concerning truth who before Pilate confessed his crime only after many tortures. For the judgment of man from whom secret things are hid is of one kind; the judgment of God who searches the heart of another. And in the former case punishment follows after confession, but here confession is made to salvation. But he also pronounces Christ innocent, adding, But this man has done nothing wrong: as if to say, Behold a new injury, that innocence should be condemned with crime. We kill the living, He raised the dead. We have stolen from others, He bids us give up even what is our own. The blessed thief thus taught those that stood by, uttering the words by which he rebuked the other. But when he saw that the ears of those who stood by were stopped up, he turns to Him who knows the hearts; for it follows, And he said to Jesus, Lord, remember me when you come into your kingdom. You behold the Crucified, and you acknowledge Him to be your Lord. You see the form of a condemned criminal, and you proclaim the dignity of a king. Stained with a thousand crimes, you ask the Fountain of righteousness to remember your wickedness, saying, But I discover your hidden kingdom; and you turn away my public iniquities, and accept the faith of a secret intention. Wickedness usurped the disciple of truth, truth did not change the disciple of wickedness.

Tres autem virtutes quas apostolus memorat, subito repletus gratia, et accepit latro, et servavit in cruce. Fidem namque habuit, qui regnaturum Deum credidit, quem secum pariter morientem vidit: spem habuit, qui regni eius aditum postulavit: qui caritatem quoque in morte sua vivaciter tenuit, qui fratrem et collatronem pro simili scelere morientem de iniquitate sua redarguit.

But the three virtues which the Apostle speaks of, the thief suddenly filled with grace both received and preserved on the cross. He had faith, for example, who believed that God would reign whom he saw dying equally with himself. He had hope who asked for an entrance into His kingdom. He preserved charity also zealously in his death, who for his iniquity reproved his brother and fellow-thief, dying for a like clime to his own.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; A most remarkable example is here given of seeking after conversion, seeing that pardon is so speedily granted to the thief.

The thief asked that He should remember him, but our Lord answers, Verily I say to you, This day shall you be with me in Paradise.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Here then might one see the Savior between the thieves weighing in the scales of justice faith, and unbelief. The devil cast Adam out of Paradise. Christ brought the thief into Paradise before the whole world, before the Apostles. By a mere word and by faith alone he entered into Paradise, that no one after his sins might despair of entrance. Mark the rapid change, from the cross to heaven, from condemnation to Paradise, that you may know that the Lord did it all, not with regard to the thief’s good intention, but His own mercy. But if the reward of the good has already taken place, surely a resurrection will be superfluous. For if He introduced the thief into Paradise while his body remained in corruption without, it is clear there is no resurrection of the body. Such are the words of some, But shall the flesh which has partaken of the toil be deprived of the reward? Hear Paul speaking, Then must this corruptible put on incorruption. But if the Lord promised the kingdom of heaven, but introduced the thief into Paradise, He does not yet recompense him the reward. But they say, Under the name of Paradise He signified the kingdom of heaven, using a well-known name in addressing a thief who knew nothing of difficult teaching. Now some do not read it, This day shall you be with me in Paradise, but thus, I say to you on this day, and then follows, You shall be with me in Paradise. But we will add a still more obvious solution. For physicians when they see a man in a desperate state, say, He is already dead. So also the thief, since he no longer fears his falling back to perdition, is said to have entered Paradise.

          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Hoc tamen est verius omnibus, quod quamvis non omnia promissa sortiti sunt et latro et alii sancti, ne sine nobis consummarentur, ut dicitur in epistola ad Hebraeos, sunt tamen in regno caelorum et in Paradiso.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. This however is more true than all, that although they have not obtained all the promises, I mean, the thief and the other saints in order that without us they might not be made perfect, they are notwithstanding in the kingdom of heaven and Paradise.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius Nyssenus</b>: Hoc iterum oportet discutere: quomodo latro censeatur dignus Paradiso, cum sanctis flammea framea prohibeat introitum. Sed attende quod sermo divinus eum versatilem dicit, ut indignis quidem obviet, dignis vero liberum ad vitam patefaciat aditum.
          <td><b>GREG NYSS</b>. Here again, we must examine how the thief should be thought worthy of Paradise, seeing that a flaming sword prevents the entrance of the saints. But observe that the word of God describes it as turning about, so as it should obstruct the unworthy, but open a free entrance to life to the worthy.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius Moralium</b>: Vel illa romphaea flammea versatilis dicitur, pro eo quod fuisset quandoque venire tempus ut etiam removeri debuisset: quando scilicet veniret qui suae incarnationis mysterio Paradisi nobis iter aperiret.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. Or that flaming sword is said to be turning, because that He knew the time would come when it must be removed; when He in truth should come, who by the mystery of His incarnation was to open to us the way of Paradise.

          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Sed et illud solvendum est, quia alii, scilicet Matthaeus et Marcus, duos conviciantes inducunt latrones; iste unum conviciantem, unum repugnantem: fortasse et iste prius conviciatus est, sed repente conversus est. Potuit etiam de uno pluraliter dici, sicut est illud: in caprinis pellibus ambulabant (...) secti sunt, cum solus Elias melotidem habuisse, Isaias sectus esse doceatur. Mystice autem duo latrones duos populos peccatores significant per Baptismum crucifigendos esse cum Christo; quorum dissensio diversitatem pariter credentium significat.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; But it must also be explained how the others, that is, Matthew and Mark, introduced two thieves reviling, while Luke, one reviling, the other resisting him. Perhaps this other at first reviled, but was suddenly converted. It may also have been spoken of one, but in the plural number; as in the Hebrews, They wandered in goat-skins, and they were sawn asunder; whereas Elijah alone is related to have had a goat-skin, and Isaiah to have been sawn asunder. But mystically, the two thieves represent the two sinful people who were to be crucified by baptism with Christ, whose disagreement likewise represents the difference of believers.

          <td><b>Beda</b>: Quicumque enim baptizati sumus in Christo Iesu, in morte ipsius baptizati sumus.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; For as many of us as were baptized in Christ Jesus, were baptized in His death; but we are washed; by baptism, seeing we were sinners. But some, in that they praise God suffering in the flesh, are crowned; others, in that they refuse to have the faith or works of baptism, are deprived of the gift which they have received.

There is another explanation that at the time of His Passion, His Divinity being once united to His humanity, left neither part of His humanity, but of its own accord separated the soul from the body, yet showed itself abiding in each. For through the body in which He suffered death He vanquished the power of death, but through the soul He prepared for the thief an entrance into Paradise.

          <td><b>Augustinus de Cons. Evang</b>: Non est autem contrarium quod Matthaeus, viso terraemotu, dicit admiratum centurionem, cum Lucas dicat hoc eum admiratum fuisse quod emissa illa voce expirasset, ostendens quam potestatem habuit quando moreretur. In eo autem quod Matthaeus dixit non solum viso terraemotu, sed addidit: et his quae fiebant, integrum locum fuisse demonstravit Lucae, ut diceret ipsum domini mortem fuisse miratum. Quod autem Lucas etiam ipse dixit videns autem centurio quod factum erat, in eo genere inclusit omnia quae facta erant in illa hora mirabiliter, tamquam unum mirabile factum commemorans, cuius quasi membra et partes erant omnia illa miracula. Quod autem alius dixit, centurionem dixisse: vere filius Dei erat iste, Lucas autem ait, quod iustus erat, putari potest diversum; sed vel utrumque dictum a centurione debemus intelligere, et aliud illum, aliud istum commemorasse; vel fortasse Lucam exprimere voluisse sententiam centurionis, quomodo dixerit Iesum filium Dei: forte enim non unigenitum aequalem patri centurio intellexerat; sed ideo filium Dei dixerat, quia iustum crediderat, sicut multi iusti dicti sunt filii Dei. Iam vero quia Matthaeus addidit eos qui cum centurione erant, Lucas vero hoc tacuit; non est contrarium, cum alius dicit quod alius tacet: et Matthaeus dixit: timuerunt valde; Lucas autem non dixit: timuit, sed glorificavit Deum: quis non intelligat Deum timendo glorificasse?
          <td><b>AUG</b>. There is no contradiction in that the centurion seeing the earthquake marveled, whereas Luke says that he marveled, that Jesus while uttering the loud voice expired, showing what power He had when He was dying. But in that Matthew not only says, at the sight of the earthquake, but added, and at the things that were done, he has made it clear that there was ample room for Luke to say, that the centurion marveled at the death of the Lord. But because Luke also himself said, Now when the centurion saw what was done, he has included in that general expression all the marvelous things which took place at that hour, as if relating one marvelous event of which all those miracles were the parts and members. Again, because one Evangelist stated that the centurion said, Truly this man was the Son of God, but Luke gives the words, was a just man, they might be supposed to differ. But either we ought to understand that both these were said by the centurion, and that one Evangelist related one, another. Or perhaps, that Luke expresses the opinion of the centurion, in what respect he called Him the Son of God. For perhaps the centurion did not know Him to be the Only-begotten, equal to the Father, but called Him the Son of God, because he believed Him to be just, as many just persons are called the sons of God. But again, because Matthew added, those who were with the centurion, while Luke omits this, there is no contradiction, since one says what another is silent about. And Matthew said, They were greatly afraid; but Luke does not say that he feared, but that he glorified God. Who then does not see that by fearing he glorified God?

          <td><b>GREEK EX</b>. Joseph had been at one time a secret disciple of Christ, but at length bursting through the bonds of fear, and become very zealous, he took down the body of our Lord, basely hanging on the cross; thus gaining a precious Jewel by the meekness of His words. Hence it follows, And, behold, there was a man, named Joseph, a counselor.

          <td><b>Beda</b>: Decurio vocatur, quod sit de ordine curiae, et officia curiae administret, qui etiam curialis a procurando munera civilia solet appellari.

Arimathaea ipsa est Ramatha civitas Helcanae et Samuelis.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; A counselor, or decurio, is so called because he is of the order of the curia or council, and administers the office of the curia. He is also wont to be called curialis, from his management of civil duties. Joseph then is said to have been of high rank in the world, but of still higher estimation before God; as it follows, A good man, and a just, of Arimathea, a city of the Jews, &amp;c. Arimathea is the same as Ramatha, the city of Helcanah and Samuel.

          <td><b>Augustinus de Cons. Evang</b>: Dicit autem Ioannes quod erat discipulus Iesu; unde et hic subditur qui expectabat et ipse regnum Dei. Merito autem movet cur ille qui propter timorem occultus erat discipulus, ausus sit petere corpus eius, quod nullus eorum qui eum palam sequebantur auderet; sequitur enim hic accessit ad Pilatum, et petiit corpus Iesu. Sed intelligendum est istum fiducia dignitatis hoc fecisse, qua praeditus poterat familiariter intrare ad Pilatum.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. Now John says, that Joseph was a disciple of Jesus. Hence it is also here added, Who also himself waited for the kingdom of God. But it naturally causes surprise how he who for fear was a secret disciple should have dared to beg our Lord’s body, which none of those who openly followed Him dared to do; for it is said, This man went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. We must understand then, that he did this from confidence in his rank, by which he might be privileged to enter familiarly into Pilate’s presence. But in performing that last funeral rite, he seems to have cared less for the Jews, although it was his custom in hearing our Lord to avoid their hostility.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; So then being fitted by the righteousness of his works for the burial of our Lord’s body, he was worthy by the dignity of his secular power to obtain it. Hence it follows, And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen. By the simple burial of our Lord, the pride of the rich is condemned who not even in their graves can be without their wealth.

          <td><b>ATHAN</b>. They also act absurdly who embalm the bodies of their dead, and do not bury them, even supposing them to be holy. For what can be more holy or greater than our Lord’s body? And yet this was placed in a tomb until it rose again the third day. For it follows, And he laid it in a hewn sepulcher.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; That is, hewn out of a rock, lest if it had been built of many stones, and the foundations of the tomb being dug up after the resurrection, the body should be said to have been stolen away. It is laid also in a new tomb, wherein never man before was laid, lest when the rest of the bodies remained after the resurrection, it might be suspected that some other had risen again. But because man was created on the sixth day, rightly being crucified on the sixth day our Lord fulfilled the secret of man’s restitution. It follows, And it was the day of the(Greek), which means the preparation, the name by which they called the sixth day, because on that day they prepared the things which were necessary for the Sabbath. But because on the seventh day the Creator rested from His work, the Lord on the Sabbath rested in the grave. Hence it follows, And the Sabbath was dawning. Now we said above, that all His acquaintance stood afar off, and the women which followed Him. These then of His acquaintance, after His body was taken down, returned to their homes, but the women who more tenderly loved Him, following His funeral, desired to see the place where He was laid. For it follows, And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulcher, and how his body was laid, that in truth they might make the offerings of their devotion at the proper time.

          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Neque tamen fidem debitam adhuc habebant, sed quasi puro homini aromata et unguenta parabant more Iudaeorum, qui talia exhibebant defunctis; unde sequitur et revertentes paraverunt aromata et unguenta.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. For they had not yet sufficient faith, but prepared as if for a mere man spices and ointments, after the manner of the Jews, who performed such duties to their dead. Hence it follows, And they returned, and prepared spices.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Sepulto enim domino, quamdiu licebat operari, idest usque ad solis occasum, unguentis praeparandis erant occupatae. Mandatum autem erat ut sabbati silentium, idest quies, a vespera usque ad vesperam servaretur; sequitur enim et sabbato quidem siluerunt secundum mandatum.
          <td>For our Lord being buried, they were occupied as long as it was lawful to work, (that is, until sun-set,) in preparing ointments. But it was commanded to keep silence on the Sabbath, that is, rest from evening to evening. For it follows, And rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Mystice autem iustus Christi corpus sepelit: talis enim est Christi sepultura, quae fraudem iniquitatemque non habeat.

Iustus corpus Christi operit sindone; vesti et tu domini corpus gloria sua, ut et ipse sis iustus; et si mortuum credis, operi tamen divinitatis plenitudine suae; sed et vestitur Ecclesia innocentiae gratia.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Now mystically, the just man buries the body of Christ. For the burial of Christ is such as to have no guile or wickedness in it. But rightly did Matthew call the man rich, or by carrying Him that was rich he knew not the poverty of faith. The just man covers the body of Christ with linen. Do you also clothe the body of Christ with His own glory, that you may be yourself just. And if you believe it to be dead, still cover it with the fullness of His own divinity. But the Church also is clothed with the grace of innocence.

Quae enim communicatio tumulo et Deo? Solus etiam tumulo includitur, quia mors Christi, etsi sit communis secundum naturam, specialis est secundum virtutem. Bene autem Christus in monumento conditur iusti ut iustitiae habitatione requiescat: monumentum enim hoc in duritiae gentilis petra iustus excidit penetrali verbi, ut praetenderet in nationibus virtus Christi. Cui pulcherrime admotus est lapis. Quicumque in se bene humaverit Christum, diligenter custodiat, ne eum perdat, neve perfidiae sit ingressus.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Nor without meaning has one Evangelist spoken of a new tomb, another of the tomb of Joseph. For the grave is prepared by those who are under the law of death; the Conqueror of death has no grave of His own. For what fellowship has God with the grave. He alone is enclosed in this tomb, because the death of Christ, although it was common according to the nature of the body, yet was it peculiar in respect of power. But Christ is rightly buried in the tomb of the just, that He may rest in the habitation of justice. For this monument the just man hews out with the piercing word in the hearts of Gentile hardness, that the power of Christ might extend over the nations. And very rightly is there a stone rolled against the tomb; for whoever has in himself truly buried Christ, must diligently guard, lest he lose Him, or lest there be an entrance for unbelief.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Quod autem dominus sexta die crucifigitur, septima in sepulcro quiescit, significat quod in sexta mundi aetate nos pro domino pati et velut mundo crucifigi necesse est; in septima vero, idest post mortem, corpora quidem in tumulis, animae vero cum domino requiescunt. Usque huc et mulieres sanctae, idest animae humiles dilectione ferventes, passioni Christi diligenter obsequuntur: et si forte valeant imitari, sedula curiositate, quo ordine sit eadem passio completa, perpendunt: qua lecta, audita, recordata, mox ad paranda se opera virtutum, quibus Christus delectetur, convertunt, ut finita praesentis vitae parasceve, in requie beata tempore resurrectionis occurrere Christo valeant cum aromatibus spiritualium actionum
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Now that the Lord is crucified on the sixth day and rests on the seventh, signifies that in the sixth age of the world we must of necessity suffer for Christ, and as it were be crucified to the world. But in the seventh age, that is, after death, our bodies indeed rest in the tombs, but our souls with the Lord. But even at the present time also holy women, (that is, humble souls,) fervent in love, diligently wait upon the Passion of Christ, and if perchance they may be able to imitate Him, with anxious carefulness ponder each step in order, by which this Passion is fulfilled. And having read, heard, and called to mind all these, they next apply themselves to make ready the works of virtue, by which Christ may be pleased, in order that having finished the preparation of this present life, in a blessed rest they may at the time of the resurrection meet Christ with the frankincense of spiritual actions.

Una sabbati, sive prima sabbati, prima est a sabbato, quam diem dominicam propter domini resurrectionem mos Christianus appellat. Quod autem valde diluculo mulieres venere ad monumentum, magnus quaerendi et inveniendi dominum fervor caritatis ostenditur.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Devout women not only on the day of preparation, but also when the sabbath was passed, that is, at sun-set, as soon as the liberty of working returned, bought spices that they might come and anoint the body of Jesus, as Mark testifies. Still as long as night time restrained them, they came not to the sepulcher. And therefore it is said, On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, &amp;c. One of the Sabbath, or the first of the Sabbath, is the first day from the Sabbath; which Christians are wont to call “the Lord s day”, because of our Lord’s resurrection. But by the women coming to the sepulcher very early in the morning, is manifested their great zeal and fervent love of seeking and finding the Lord.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Sed magna oritur hoc loco plerisque dubitatio: siquidem hic valde diluculo, Matthaeus vespere sabbati mulieres ad monumentum venisse dixerunt. Sed Evangelistas de diversis putes dixisse temporibus, ut personas alias mulierum, et alias conicias visiones. Quod autem scriptum est vespere sabbati, quae lucescit in prima sabbati, resurrexisse dominum, sic temperandum est: ut neque mane dominica, quae est prima post sabbatum, neque sabbato resurrectio facta credatur: nam quomodo triduum completur? Non ergo vesperascente die, sed vespere noctis resurrexit. Denique Graecus sero dixit. Sero autem horam significat in occasu diei, et rei cuiuslibet tarditatem; si dicas: sero mihi suggestum est. Est ergo et sero tempus noctis profundum: unde et mulieres ad monumentum accedendi habent facultatem, custodibus quiescentibus. Et ut scias nocte factum, mulieres aliae sciunt, aliae nesciunt: sciunt quae observant noctibus et diebus, nesciunt quae recesserunt. Nescit una Maria Magdalene, secundum Ioannem: nam eadem et ante scire et postea nescire non potuit. Ergo si plures Mariae, plures etiam fortasse Mariae Magdalenae; cum illud nomen personae sit, hoc sumatur a loco.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Now this place has caused great perplexity to many, because while St. Luke says, Very early in the morning, Matthew says that it was in the evening of the sabbath that the women came to the sepulcher. But you may suppose that the Evangelists spoke of different occasions, so as to understand both different parties of women, and different appearances. Because however it was written, that in the evening of the sabbath, as it began to dawn towards the first day of the week, our Lord rose, we must so take it, as that neither on the morning of the Lord’s day, which is the first after the sabbath, nor on the sabbath, the resurrection should be thought to have taken place. For how are the three days fulfilled; Not then as the day grew towards evening, but in the evening of the night He rose. Lastly, in the Greek it is “late;” but late signifies both the hour at the end of the day, and the slowness of any thing; as we say, “I have been lately told.” Late then is also the dead of the night. And thus also the women had the opportunity of coming to the sepulcher when the guards were asleep. And that you may know it was in the night time, some of the women are ignorant of it. They know who watch night and day, they know not who have gone back. According to John, one Mary Magdalene knows not, for the same person could not first know and then afterwards be ignorant. Therefore if there are several Marys, perhaps also there are several Mary Magdalenes, since the former is the name of a person, the second is derived from a place.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or Matthew by the first part of the night, which is the evening, wished to represent the night itself, at the end of which night they came to the sepulcher, and for this reason, because they had been now preparing since the evening, and it was lawful to bring spices because the sabbath was over.

Et sicut in passione eclipsatus est sol, moeroris et angustiae signa promens crucifigentibus filium Dei, ita Angeli vitae ac resurrectionis praecones habitum salutiferi festi candidati designabant.
          <td><b>EUSEBIUS</b>. The messengers of the health-bearing resurrection and their shining garments stand for tokens of pleasantness and rejoicing. For Moses preparing plagues against the Egyptians, perceived an angel in the flame of fire. But not such were those who appeared to the women at the sepulcher, but calm and joyful as became them to be seen in the kingdom and joy of the Lord. And as at the Passion the sun was darkened, holding forth signs of sorrow and woe to the crucifiers of our Lord, so the angels, heralds of life and resurrection, marked by their white garments the character of the health-bearing feast day.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; But how is it that Mark has mentioned one young man sitting in white garments, and Matthew one, but John and Luke relate that there were seen two angels sitting in white garments.

          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Possumus intelligere unum Angelum visum a mulieribus, et secundum Marcum et secundum Matthaeum; ut eas ingressas in monumentum accipiamus, scilicet in aliquod spatium quod erat aliqua maceria communitum ante illum saxei sepulcri locum; atque ibi vidisse Angelum sedentem a dextris, quod dicit Marcus; deinde intus ab eis, dum inspicerent locum in quo iacebat corpus domini, visos duos alios Angelos stantes, sicut dixit Lucas, locutos ad earumdem exhortandum animum et aedificandam fidem; unde sequitur cum timerent autem, et declinarent vultum in terram.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. We may understand that one Angel was seen by the women, as both Mark and Matthew say, so as supposing them to have entered into the sepulcher, that is, into a certain space which was fenced off by a kind of wall in front of the stone sepulcher; and that there they saw an Angel sitting on the right hand, which Mark says, but that afterwards when they looked into the place where our Lord was lying, they saw within two other Angels standing, (as Luke says,) who spoke to encourage their minds, and build up their faith. Hence it follows, And as they were afraid,.

          <td><b>Beda</b>: Sanctae mulieres astantibus sibi Angelis, non in terram cecidisse, sed vultum dicuntur in terram declinasse; nec quempiam sanctorum legimus tempore dominicae resurrectionis vel ipsi domino vel Angelis sibi visis, terrae prostratum adorasse: unde mos obtinuit ecclesiasticus, ut vel in memoriam dominicae, vel in nostrae spem resurrectionis, omnibus dominicis diebus et toto quinquagesimo tempore non flexis genibus, sed declinatis in terram vultibus oremus. Non erat autem in monumento, qui locus est mortuorum, quaerendus ille qui ad vitam resurrexit a mortuis; et ideo subditur dixerunt ad illas, scilicet Angeli ad mulieres: quid quaeritis viventem cum mortuis? Non est hic, sed resurrexit. Die autem tertia, sicut ipse inter discipulos tam viros quam feminas praedixit, resurrectionis suae triumphum celebravit; unde sequitur recordamini qualiter locutus est vobis, cum adhuc in Galilaea esset, dicens: quia oportet filium hominis tradi in manus hominum peccatorum, et crucifigi, et tertia die resurgere. Die namque parasceve hora nona spiritum tradens, vespere sepultus; mane prima sabbati resurrexit.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; The holy women, when the Angels stood beside them, are reported not to have fallen to the ground, but to have bowed their faces to the earth; nor do we read that any of the saints, at the time of our Lord’s resurrection, worshipped with prostration to the ground either our Lord Himself, or the Angels who appeared to them. Hence has arisen the ecclesiastical custom, either in memory of our Lord’s resurrection, or in the hope of our own, of praying on every Lord’s day, and through the whole season of Pentecost, not with bended knees, but with our faces bowed to the earth. But not in the sepulcher, which is the place of the dead, was He to be sought, who rose from the dead to life. And therefore it is added, They said to them, that is, the Angels to the women, Why seek you the living among the dead? He is not here, but is risen. On the third day then, as He Himself foretold to the women, together with the rest of His disciples, He celebrated the triumph of His resurrection. Hence it follows, Remember how he spoke to you when he was yet in Galilee, saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again, &amp;c. For on the day of the preparation at the ninth hour giving up the ghost, buried in the evening, early on the morning of the first day of the week He rose again.

Quapropter ut corpus vere extinctum ostenderetur, ipsa meridie mortem sustinuit, et tertia die illud incorruptibile redhibuit.
          <td><b>ATHAN</b>. He might indeed at once have raised His body from the dead. But some one would have said that He was never dead, or that death plainly had never existed in Him. And perhaps if the resurrection of our Lord had been delayed beyond the third day, the glory of incorruption had been concealed. In order therefore to show His body to be dead, He suffered the interval of one day, and on the third day manifested His body to be without corruption.

For woman who was once the minister of death, is now the first to receive and tell the awful mystery of the resurrection. The female race has obtained therefore both deliverance from reproach, and the withdrawal of the curse.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. Luke is supposed to have mentioned this concerning Peter, recapitulating. For Peter ran to the sepulcher at the same time that John also went, as soon as it had been told to them alone by the women, (especially Mary Magdalene,) that the body was taken away. But the vision of Angels took place afterwards. Luke therefore mentioned Peter only, because to him Mary first told it. It may also strike one, that Luke says that Peter, not entering but stooping down, saw the linen clothes by themselves, and departed wondering, whereas John says, that he himself saw the linen clothes in the same position, and that he entered after Peter. We must understand then that Peter first saw them stooping down, which Luke mentions, John omits, but that he afterwards entered before John came in.

Aromata autem, quae mulieres deferunt, significant odorem virtutum et orationum suavitatem, quibus altari appropinquare debemus. Revolutio autem lapidis insinuat reserationem sacramentorum, quae tegebantur velamine litterae legis, quae in lapide scripta est; cuius ablato tegmine, corpus domini mortuum non invenitur, sed vivum evangelizatur: quia etsi cognovimus secundum carnem Christum, sed iam nunc non novimus. Quomodo autem posito in sepulcro corpore domini, Angeli astitisse leguntur, ita etiam tempore consecrationis mysterii corporis Christi assistere sunt credendi. Nos ergo, exemplo devotarum mulierum, quoties mysteriis caelestibus appropinquamus, propter angelicam praesentiam, seu propter reverentiam sacrae oblationis, cum omni humilitate vultum declinemus in terram, nos cinerem et terram esse recolentes.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; According to the mystical meaning, by the women coming early in the morning to the sepulcher, we have an example given us, that having cast away the darkness of our vices, we should come to the Body of the Lord. For that sepulcher also bore the figure of the Altar of the Lord, wherein herein the mysteries of Christ’s Body, not in silk or purple cloth, but in pure white linen, like that in which Joseph wrapped it, ought to be consecrated, that as He offered up to death for us the true substance of His earthly nature, so we also in commemoration of Him should place on the Altar the flax, pure from the plant of the earth, and white, and in many ways refined by a kind of crushing to death. But the spices which the women bring, signify the odor of virtue, and the sweetness of prayers by which we ought to approach the Altar. The rolling back of the stone alludes to the unclosing of the Sacraments which were concealed by the veil of the letter of the law which was written on stone, the covering of which being taken away, the dead body of the Lord is not found, but the living body is preached; for although we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now henceforth know we Him no more. But as when the Body of our Lord lay in the sepulcher, Angels are said to have stood by, so also at the time of consecration are they to be believed to stand by the mysteries of Christ. Let us then after the example of the devout women, whenever we approach the heavenly mysteries because of the presence of the Angels, or from reverence to the Sacred Offering, with all humility, bow our faces to the earth, recollecting that we are but dust and ashes.

But the stadium which, as the Greeks say, was invented by Hercules to measure the distances of roads, is the eighth part of a mile; therefore sixty stades are equal to seven miles and fifty paces. And this was the length of journey which they were walking, who were certain about our Lord’s death and burial, but doubtful concerning His resurrection. For the resurrection which took place after the seventh day of the week, no one doubts is implied in the number eight. The disciples therefore as the, walk and converse about the Lord had completed the sixth mile of their journey, for they were grieving that He who had lived without blame, had come at length even to death, which He underwent on the sixth day. They had completed also the seventh mile, for they doubted not that He rested in the grave.

        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Graecus</b>: Conferebant quidem inter se, quasi non amplius exspectantes Christum viventem; sed dolorosi, quasi perempto salvatore; unde sequitur et respondens unus cui nomen Cleopha, dixit ei: tu solus peregrinus es in Ierusalem, et non cognovisti quae facta sunt in illa his diebus?
          <td><b>GREEK EX</b>. They were in truth discoursing among themselves, no longer expecting to see Christ alive, but sorrowing as concerning their Savior slain. Hence it follows, And one of them whose name was Cleophas, answering him said, Are you only a stranger?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Quasi dicat: tu solus peregrinus es, et extra confinia Ierusalem habitas, et expers es eorum quae in medio eius contigerunt, et haec ignoras?
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. As if he said, “Are you a mere stranger, and one dwelling beyond the confines of Jerusalem, and therefore unacquainted with what has happened in the midst of it, that you know not these things;
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Vel hoc dicit, quia peregrinum putabant eum cuius vultum non agnoscebant. Sed revera peregrinus erat eis, a quorum naturae fragilitate, percepta iam resurrectionis gloria, longe distabat, et quorum fide, utpote resurrectioni eius nescia, manebat extraneus. Sed adhuc dominus interrogat; nam sequitur quibus ille dixit: quae? Et ponitur eorum responsio, cum subditur et dixerunt ei: de Iesu Nazareno, qui fuit vir propheta. Prophetam fatentur, filium Dei tacent, vel nondum perfecte credentes, vel soliciti ne inciderent in manus Iudaeorum persequentium, quia nesciebant quis esset, vel quod verum credebant celantes; ad cuius commendationem subditur potens in opere et sermone.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Or he says this, because they thought Him a stranger, whose countenance they did not recognize. But in reality He was a stranger to them, from the infirmity of whose natures, now that He had obtained the glory of the resurrection, He was far removed, and to whose faith, as yet ignorant of His resurrection, He remained foreign. But again the Lord asks; for it follows, And he said to them, What things? And their answer is given, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a Prophet. They confess Him to be a Prophet, but say nothing of the Son of God; either not yet perfectly believing, or fearful of falling into the hands of the persecuting Jews, either knowing not who He was, or concealing the truth which they believed. They add in praise of Him, mighty in deed and word.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Primo quidem est opus, secundo sermo: nullus enim doctrinae sermo approbatur, nisi prius is qui docet, se ostendat auctorem: praecedit enim opus aspectum. Nam nisi mundaveris intellectus speculum per opera, non emicat decor optatus. Adhuc autem subditur coram Deo et omni populo: nam primo complacendum est Deo; deinde curandum, quantum possibile est, de innocentia apud homines, ut praecedente divino cultu vivamus sine scandalo plurimorum.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. First comes deed, then word; for no word of teaching is approved unless first he who teaches shows himself to be a doer thereof. For acting goes before sight; for unless by your works you have cleansed the glass of the understanding, the desired brightness does not appear. But still further it is added, Before God and all the people. For first of all we must please God, and then have regard as far as we can to honesty before men, that placing the honor of God first, we may live without offense to mankind.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Graecus</b>: Deinde assignatur causa tristitiae, traditio et passio Christi, cum sequitur et quomodo tradiderunt eum summi sacerdotes et principes nostri in damnationem mortis, et crucifixerunt eum. Subditur autem desperantium vox, cum dicitur nos autem sperabamus quod ipse esset redempturus Israel. Sperabamus, inquiunt, non speramus, ac si mors domini, similis esset mortibus aliorum.
          <td><b>GREEK EX</b>. They next assign the cause of their sadness, the betrayal and passion of Christ; and add in the voice of despair, But we hoped it had been he who should trace redeemed Israel. We hoped, (he says,) not we hope; as if the death of the Lord were like to the deaths of other men.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Expectabant enim Christum salvaturum et redempturum populum Israel ab ingruentibus malis, et a servitute Romanorum; ipsum quoque credebant terrenum regem fieri, quem putabant promulgatam in se mortis sententiam cavere potuisse.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. For they expected that Christ would redeem Israel from the evils that were rising up among them and the Roman slavery. They trusted also that He was an earthly king, whom they thought would be able to escape the sentence of death passed upon Him.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Merito ergo tristes incedebant: quia et seipsos quodammodo arguebant, quod in illo redemptionem speraverint, quem iam mortuum viderant, nec resurrecturum credebant; et maxime dolebant eum sine causa occisum, quem noverant innocentem.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Reason had they then for sorrow, because in some sort they blamed themselves for having hoped redemption in Him whom now they saw dead, and believed not that He would rise again, and most of all they bewailed Him put to death without a cause, whom they knew to be innocent.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Videntur tamen hi viri non omnino increduli esse, per hoc quod subditur et nunc super haec omnia tertia dies est hodie quod haec facta sunt: in quo videntur habere memoriam eius quod eis dominus dixerat, se tertia die resurrecturum.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. And yet those men seem not to have been altogether without faith, by what follows, And besides all this, to day is the third day since these things were done. Whereby they seem to have a recollection of what the Lord had told them that He would rise again on the third day.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Graecus</b>: Porro relatam a mulieribus resurrectionis famam commemorant, cum subditur sed et mulieres quaedam ex nostris terruerunt nos, quae ante lucem fuerunt ad monumentum, et non invento corpore eius, venerunt dicentes, se etiam visionem Angelorum vidisse, qui dicunt eum vivere. Dicunt quidem hoc quasi non credentes; propter quod referunt se territos, idest stupefactos: non enim quod erat eis relatum firmum aestimabant, aut angelicam illuminationem fuisse; sed stuporis et turbationis causam inde sumebant. Testimonium quoque Petri non certum aestimabant, dum diceret, se non vidisse dominum, sed resurrectionem eius conicere ex eo quod corpus ipsius in sepulcro non iacebat; unde sequitur et abierunt quidam ex nostris ad monumentum, et ita invenerunt sicut mulieres dixerunt, ipsum vero non invenerunt.
          <td><b>GREEK EX</b>. The disciples also mention the report of the resurrection which was brought by the women; adding, Yes, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, &amp;c. They say this indeed as if they did not believe it; wherefore they speak of themselves as frightened or astonished. For they did consider as established what was told them, or that there had been an angelic revelation, but derived from it reason for astonishment and alarm. The testimony of Peter also they did not regard as certain, since he did not say that he had seen our Lord, but conjectured His resurrection from the fact that His body was not lying in the sepulcher. Hence it follows, And certain of them that were with us went, &amp;c.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Cons. Evang</b>: Cum autem Lucas dixerit Petrum accurrisse ad monumentum, et Cleopham dixisse ipse retulerit quod quidam eorum ierant ad monumentum; intelligitur attestari Ioanni, quod duo ierint ad monumentum; sed Petrum primo solum commemoravit, quia illi primitus Maria nuntiaverat.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But since Luke has said that Peter ran to the sepulcher; and has himself related the words of Cleophas, that some of them went to the sepulcher, he is understood to confirm the testimony of John, that two went to the sepulcher. He first mentioned Peter only, because to him first Mary had related the news.

          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Quia praedicti discipuli nimia dubietate laborabant dominus eos redarguit; unde dicitur et ipse dixit ad eos: o stulti. Fere enim eadem dixerant quae et astantes cruci: alios salvos fecit, seipsum non potest salvum facere. Et tardi corde ad credendum in omnibus quae locuti sunt prophetae. Contingit enim credere quae locuti sunt prophetae, particulariter quaedam, et non universaliter omnia: puta, si aliquis credat quae de cruce Christi dicuntur a prophetis, sicut est illud: foderunt manus meas et pedes meos; quae vero spectant ad resurrectionem non credat, sicut est illud: non dabis sanctum tuum videre corruptionem. Decet autem in omnibus fidem adhibere prophetis; tam in gloriosis quae de Christo praedixerunt, quam in ingloriis: quia ex passione malorum est ingressus in gloriam; unde sequitur nonne haec oportuit pati Christum, et ita intrare in gloriam suam? Scilicet secundum humanitatem.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Because the above-mentioned disciples were troubled with too much doubt, the Lord reproves them, saying, O fools, (for they almost used the same words as those who stood by the cross, He saved others, himself he cannot save.) And He proceeds, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken. For it is possible to believe some of these things and not all; as if a man should believe what the Prophets say of the cross of Christ, as in the Psalms, They pierced my hands and my feet; but should not believe what they say of the resurrection, as, You shall not suffer your Holy One to see corruption. But it becomes us in all things to give faith to the Prophets, as well in the glorious things which they predicted of Christ, as the inglorious, since through the suffering of evil things is the entrance into glory. Hence it follows, Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and so to enter into his glory? that is, as respects His humanity.

          <td><b>ISIDORE PELEUS</b>. But although it behooved Christ to suffer, yet they who crucified Him are guilty of inflicting the punishment. For they were not concerned to accomplish what God purposed. Therefore their execution of it was impious, but God’s purpose most wise, who converted their iniquity into a blessing upon mankind, using as it were the viper’s flesh for the working of a health-giving antidote.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Et ideo dominus ostendit consequenter, haec omnia non evenisse simpliciter, sed ex Dei proposito ante praedestinato; unde sequitur et incipiens a Moyse et omnibus prophetis, interpretabatur illis in omnibus Scripturis quae de ipso erant: quasi diceret: postquam estis tardi, ego promptos vos reddam, mysteria Scripturarum vobis exponendo: nam sacrificium Abrahae, cum Isaac dimisso immolatus est aries, hoc praefiguravit. Sed in aliis Scripturis propheticis sparsim iacent mysteria crucis et resurrectionis Christi.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. And therefore our Lord goes on to show that all these things did not happen in a common way, but from the predestined purpose of God. Hence it follows, And beginning at Moses and all the Prophets, he expounded to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself: As if He said, Since you are slow I will render you quick, by explaining to you the mysteries of the Scriptures. For the sacrifice of Abraham, when releasing Isaac he sacrificed the ram, prefigured Christ’s sacrifice. But in the other writings of the Prophets also there are scattered about mysteries of Christ’s cross and the resurrection.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; But if Moses and the Prophets spoke of Christ, and prophesied that through His Passion He would enter into glory, how does that man boast that he is a Christian. who neither searches how these Scriptures relate to Christ, nor desires to attain by suffering to that glory which he hopes to have with Christ.

          <td><b>GREEK EX</b>. But since the Evangelist said before, Their eyes were holden that they should not know him, until the words, of the Lord should move their minds to faith, He fitly affords in addition to their hearing a favorable object to their sight As it follows, And they drew night to the fortress whither they were going, and he feigned as if he was going further.

Sicut autem dicta, ita etiam finguntur facta sine mendacio ad aliquam rem significandam.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Now this relates not to falsehood. For not every thing we feign is a falsehood, but only when we feign that which means nothing. But when our feigning has reference to a certain meaning it is not a falsehood, but a kind of figure of the truth. Otherwise all the things figuratively spoken by wise and holy men, or even by our Lord Himself must be accounted falsehoods. For to the experienced understanding truth consists not in certain words, but as words so also deeds are feigned without falsehood to signify a particular thing.

Sed quia esse extranei a caritate non poterant hi cum quibus caritas gradiebatur, eum ad hospitium quasi peregrinum vocant; unde sequitur et coegerunt illum: ex quo exemplo colligitur quia peregrini ad hospitium non solum invitandi sunt, sed etiam trahendi.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. Because then He was still a stranger to faith in their hearts, He feigned as if he would go further. By the word “fingere” we mean to put together or form, and hence formers or preparers of mud we call “figuli.” He who was the Truth itself did nothing then by deceit, but exhibited Himself in the body such as He came before them in their minds. But because they could not be strangers to charity, with whom charity was walking, they invite Him as if a stranger to partake of their hospitality. Hence it follows, And they compelled him. From which example it is gathered that strangers are not only to be invited to hospitality, but even to be taken by force.

Sed tantum a Christo facta est permissio usque ad sacramentum panis, ut veritate corporis eius participata, removeri intelligatur impedimentum inimici, ut Christus possit agnosci.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. For they walked not with their eyes shut, but there was something within them which did not permit them to know that which they saw, which a mist, darkness, or some kind of moisture, frequently occasions. Not that the Lord was not able to transform His flesh that it should be really a different form from that which they were accustomed to behold; since in truth also before His passion, He was transfigured in the mount, so that His face was bright as the sun. But it was not so now. For we do not unfitly take this obstacle in the sight to have been caused by Satan, that Jesus might not be known. But still it was so permitted by Christ up to the sacrament of the bread, that by partaking of the unity of His body, the obstacle of the enemy might be understood to be removed, so that Christ might be known.

Tenet ergo Christum, ne longius ab eo eat, quisquis catechizatus verbo in omnibus bonis ei qui se catechizat communicat. Etenim isti catechizati erant verbo, cum exponeret eis Scripturas: et quia hospitalitatem sectati sunt, quem in ipsa expositione Scripturarum non cognoverunt, in panis fractione cognoscunt: non enim auditores legis iusti sunt apud Deum, sed factores legis iustificabuntur.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or because the Lord feigned as if He would go farther, when He was accompanying the disciples, expounding to them the sacred Scriptures, who knew not whether it was He, what does He mean to imply but that through the duty of hospitality men may arrive at a knowledge of Him; that when He has departed from mankind far above the heavens, He is still with those who perform this duty to His servants. He therefore holds to Christ, that He should not go far from him, whoever being taught in the word communicates in all good things to him who teaches. For they were taught in the word when He expounded to them the Scriptures. And because they followed hospitality, Him whom they knew not in the expounding of the Scriptures, they know in the breaking of bread. For not the hearers of the law are just before God but the doers of the law shall be justified.

For He had need of the most faithful soul to first receive this sight, that it might be least disturbed by the unexpected appearance. And therefore He is first seen by Peter, that he who first confessed Christ should first deserve to see His resurrection, and also because he had denied Him He wished to see him first, to console him, lest he should despair. But after Peter, He appeared to the rest, at one time fewer in number, at another more, which the two disciples attest; for it follows, And they told what things were done by the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. The report of Christ’s resurrection being published every where by the Apostles, and while the anxiety of the disciples was easily awakened to see Christ, He that was so much desired comes, and is revealed to them that were seeking and expecting Him. Nor in a doubtful manner, but with the clearest evidence, He presents Himself, as it is said, And as they thus spoke, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them.

          <td><b>Augustinus de Cons. Evang</b>: Hanc ostensionem domini post resurrectionem, Ioannes commemorat. Sed quod dicit Ioannes, non cum illis fuisse apostolum Thomam, cum secundum Lucam duo illi regressi in Ierusalem, invenerunt congregatos undecim, proculdubio intelligendum est quod inde Thomas exierit, antequam dominus haec loquentibus appareret. Dat enim Lucas locum in sua narratione quomodo possit intelligi, dum haec loquerentur, prius inde exisse Thomam, et postea dominum intrasse; nisi quis dicat, non illos undecim qui iam tunc apostoli vocabantur, sed discipulos illos undecim fuisse ex multo numero discipulorum. Sed cum adiunxit Lucas et eos qui cum ipsis erant, satis utique declaravit evidentius illos undecim appellatos qui vocabantur apostoli, cum quibus ceteri erant. Sed videamus, cuius mysterii gratia, secundum Matthaeum et Marcum resurgens ita mandaverit: praecedam vos in Galilaeam, ibi me videbitis; quod etsi completum est, tamen post multa completum est; cum sic mandatum sit, ut aut hoc solum, aut hoc primum expectaretur fieri debuisse.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. This manifestation of our Lord after His resurrection, John also relates. But when John says that the Apostle Thomas was not with the rest, while according to Luke, the two disciples on their return to Jerusalem found the eleven gathered together, we must understand undoubtedly that Thomas departed from them, before our Lord appeared to them as they spoke these things. For Luke gives occasion in his narrative, that it may be understood that Thomas first went out from them when the rest were saying these things, and that our Lord entered afterwards. Unless some one should say that the eleven were not those who were then called Apostles, but that these were eleven disciples out of the large number of disciples. But since Luke has added, And those that were with them, he has surely made it sufficiently evident that those called the eleven were the same as those who were called Apostles, with whom the rest were. But let us see what mystery it was for the sake of which, according to Matthew and Mark, our Lord when He rose again gave the following command, I will go before ore you into Galilee, there shall you see me. Which although it was accomplished, yet it was not till after many other things had happened, whereas it was so commanded, that it might be expected that it would have taken place alone, or at least before other things.

          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Unde hoc convenientius arbitror, quod dominus quidem mandaverit discipulis ut in Galilaea eum viderent; sed illis ob metum intra conclave residentibus primum se obtulisse.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Therefore I think it most natural that our Lord indeed instructed His disciples, that they should see Him in Galilee, but that He first presents Himself as they remained still in the assembly through fear.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; But afterwards when their hearts were strengthened, the eleven set out for Galilee. Or there is no difficulty in supposing that they should be reported to have been fewer in the assembly, and a larger number on the mountain.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Eusebius</b>: Duo enim Evangelistae, scilicet Lucas et Ioannes, solis undecim hunc scribunt apparuisse in Ierusalem; ceteri vero duo in Galilaeam properare, non solum undecim, sed etiam universis discipulis et fratribus dixerunt Angelum et salvatorem iussisse; de quibus Paulus meminit dicens: deinde apparuit plusquam quingentis fratribus simul. Est autem verior solutio, quod prius quidem in Ierusalem latitantibus, semel aut bis visus est ad eorum consolationem; in Galilaea vero non in conclavi, aut semel aut bis, sed cum multa potestate ostensionem sui fecit, praebens se eis viventem post passionem in signis multis, ut Lucas testatur in actibus.
          <td><b>EUSEBIUS</b>. For the two Evangelists, that is, Luke and John, write that He appeared to the eleven alone in Jerusalem, but those two disciples told not only the eleven, but all the disciples and brethren, that both the angel and the Savior had commanded them to hasten to Galilee; of whom also Paul made mention, saying, Afterwards he appeared to more than five hundred brethren at once. But the truer explanation is, that at first indeed while they remained in secret at Jerusalem, He appeared once or twice for their comfort, but that in Galilee not in the assembly, or once or twice, but with great power, He made a manifestation of Himself, strewing Himself living to them after His Passion with many signs, as Luke testifies in the Acts.

Secundum autem illud quod Galilaea interpretatur revelatio, non iam in forma servi intelligendum est, sed in qua est aequalis patri, quam promisit electis suis; illa erit revelatio tamquam vera Galilaea, cum videbimus eum sicut est. Ipsa etiam erit beatior transmigratio ex isto saeculo in illam aeternitatem, unde ad nos veniens non recessit, et quo nos praecedens non deserit.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But that which was said by the Angel, that is the Lord, must be taken prophetically, for by the word Galilee according to its meaning of transmigration, it is to be understood that they were about to pass over from the people of Israel to the Gentiles, to whom the Apostles preaching would not entrust the Gospel, unless the Lord Himself should prepare His way in the hearts of men. And this is what is meant by, He shall go before you into Galilee, there shall you see him. But according to the interpretation of Galilee, by which it means “manifestation,” we must understand that He will be revealed no more in the form of a servant, but in that form in which He is equal to the Father, which He has promised to His elect. That manifestation will be as it were the true Galilee, when we shall see Him as He is. This will also be that far more blessed transmigration from the world to eternity, from whence though coming to us He did not depart, and to which going before us He has not deserted us.

          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Primo igitur dominus in medio discipulorum stans, solito pacis affatu eorum turbinem sedat, ostendens quod ipse idem est magister eorum, qui hoc verbo gaudebat, quo etiam eos munivit cum ad praedicandum misit; unde sequitur et dixit eis: pax vobis: ego sum, nolite timere.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. The Lord then standing in the midst of the disciples, first with His accustomed salutation of “peace,” allays their restlessness, showing that He is the same Master who delighted in the word wherewith He also fortified them, when He sent them to preach. Hence it follows, And he said to them, Peace be to you; I am he, fear not.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Cyrillus</b>: Pudeat ergo nos pacis munus deserere, quam nobis hinc discedens Christus reliquit. Pax et res et nomen dulce, quam et Dei esse accepimus, iuxta illud: pax Dei, et eius esse Deum, iuxta illud: Deus pacis, et ipsam esse Deum, iuxta illud: ipse est pax nostra. Pax bonum commendatum ab omnibus, observatum autem a paucis. Quae autem est causa? Fortassis ambitio dominii aut facultatum, aut livor, aut odium, aut contemptus, aut aliquid huiusmodi ex his quae Dei ignaros videmus incurrere. Dei quippe praecipue pax est, quae confoederat omnia; cuius nihil est adeo proprium sicut unitas naturae, et pacificus status. Transumitur vero Angelis et divinis potestatibus, quae ad Deum et ad invicem pacifice se habent; diffunditur vero per totam creaturam, cuius est decor; tranquillitas in nobis autem manet secundum animam quidem per investigationem virtutum et communicationem, secundum corpus vero in membrorum et elementorum commensurationem: quorum alterum pulchritudo, alterum sanitas appellatur.
          <td><b>GREG. NAZ</b>. Let us then reverence the gift of peace, which Christ when He departed hence left to us. Peace both in name and reality is sweet, which also we have heard to be of God, as it is said, The peace of God; and that God is of it, as He is our peace. Peace is a blessing commended by all, but observed by few. What then is the cause? Perhaps the desire of dominion or riches, or the envy or hatred of our neighbor, or some one of those vices into which we see men fall who know not God. For peace is peculiarly of God, who binds all things together in one, to whom nothing so much belongs as the unity of nature, and a peaceful condition. It is borrowed indeed by angels and divine powers, which are peacefully disposed towards God and one another. It is diffused through the whole creation, whose glory is tranquillity. But in us it abides in our souls indeed by the following and imparting of the virtues, in our bodies by the harmony of our members and organs, of which the one is called beauty, the other health.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Discipuli autem noverant Christum verum hominem, cum quo tanto tempore fuerant conversati; sed postquam mortuus est, non credunt tertia die potuisse veram carnem de sepulcro resurgere. Putant ergo se videre spiritum, quem emisit in passione; unde sequitur conturbati vero et conterriti, existimabant se spiritum videre. Error ille apostolorum secta est Manichaeorum.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; The disciples had known Christ to be really man, having been so long a time with Him; but after that He was dead, they do not believe that the real flesh could rise again from the grave on the third day. They think then that they see the spirit which He gave up at His passion. Therefore it follows, But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit. This mistake of the Apostles was the heresy of the Manicheans.

          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Adductis autem virtutum exemplis, Petrum et Ioannem non credimus potuisse dubitare. Cur ergo Lucas inducit fuisse turbatos? Primo omnium quia paucorum opinionem sententia maioris partis includit; deinde, quia, etsi Petrus de resurrectione crediderat, turbari tamen potuit, quod se dominus cum corpore, vectibus obseratis improvisus infunderet.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; But persuaded by the example of their virtues, we can not believe that Peter and John could have doubted. Why then does Luke relate them to have been affrighted. First of all because the declaration of the greater part includes the opinion of the few. Secondly, because although Peter believed in the resurrection, yet he might be amazed when the doors being closed Jesus suddenly presents Himself with his body.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Verum, quia per verbum pacis non est sedatus turbo in animabus discipulorum, aliunde indicat eis se filium Dei esse, qui mentis cognoscebat arcana; unde sequitur et dixit eis: quid turbati estis, et cogitationes ascendunt in corda vestra?
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Because by the word of peace the agitation in the minds of the Apostles was not allayed, He shows by another token that He is the Son of God, in that He knew the secrets of their hearts; for it follows, And he said to them, Why are you troubled, and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Quales utique cogitationes, nisi falsae et perniciosae? Perdidit enim Christus fructum passionis, si non esset veritas resurrectionis; tamquam si bonus agricola diceret: quod ibi plantavi, inveniam, idest fidem, quae in cor descendit, quia desuper est. Cogitationes autem istae non desuper descenderunt, sed de imo in cor, sicut herba mala, ascenderunt.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; What thoughts indeed but such as were false and dangerous. For Christ had lost the fruit of His passion, had He not been the Truth of the resurrection; just as if a good husbandmen should say, What I have planted there, I shall find, that is, the faith which descends into the heart, because it is from above. But those thoughts did not descend from above, but ascended from below into the heart like worthless plants.

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Here then was a most evident sign that He whom they now see was none other but the same whom they had seen dead on the cross, and lain in the sepulcher, who knew every thing that was in man.

          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; Let us then consider how it happens that the Apostles according to John believed and rejoiced, according to Luke are reproved as unbelieving. John indeed seems to me, as being an Apostle, to have treated of greater and higher things; Luke of those which relate and are close akin to human. The one follows an historic course, the other is content with an abridgment, because it could not be doubted of him, who gives his testimony concerning those things at which he was himself present. And therefore we deem both true. For although at first Luke says that they did not believe, yet he explains that they afterwards did believe.

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; Now our Lord testifying that death was overcome, and human nature had now in Christ put on incorruption, first shows them His hands and His feet, and the print of the nails; as it follows, Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. But He adds also another proof, namely, the handling of His hands and feet, when He says, Handle me and see, for a spirit has not flesh and bones as you see me have. As if to say, You think me a spirit, that is to say, a ghost, as many of the dead are wont to be seen about their graves. But know you that a spirit has neither flesh nor bones, but I have flesh and bones.

But according to John, He also showed them His side which had been pierced with the spear, that by manifesting the scar of His wounds He might heal the wound of their doubtfulness. But from this place the Gentiles are fond of raising up a calumny, as if He was not able to cure the wound inflicted on Him. To whom we must answer, that it is not probable that He who is proved to have done the greater should be unable to do the less. But for the sake of His sure purpose, He who destroyed death would not blot out the signs of death. First indeed, that He might thereby build up His disciples in the faith of His resurrection. Secondly, that supplicating the Father for us, He might always show forth what kind of death He endured for many. Thirdly, that He might point out to those redeemed by His death, by setting before them the signs of that death, how mercifully they have been succored. Lastly, that He might declare in the judgment how justly the wicked are condemned.

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; The Lord had shown His disciples His hands and His feet, that He might certify to them that the same body which had suffered rose again. But to confirm them still more, He asked for something to eat.

          <td><b>Gregorius Nyssenus</b>: Et iussu quidem legis Pascha cum amaricantibus edebatur; quia adhuc amaritudo manebat, post resurrectionem vero cibus favo mellis dulcoratur; unde sequitur at illi obtulerunt ei partem piscis assi, et favum mellis.
          <td><b>GREG NYSS</b>. By the command of the law indeed the Passover was eaten with bitter herbs, because the bitterness of bondage still remained, but after the resurrection the food is sweetened with a honeycomb; as it follows, And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and a honeycomb.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Ad insinuandum ergo resurrectionis suae veritatem, non solum tangi a discipulis, sed etiam convesci cum illis dignatur, ne arbitrentur eum non solide, sed imaginabiliter sibi apparere; unde sequitur et cum manducasset coram eis, sumens reliquias, dedit eis. Manducavit quidem potestate, non ex necessitate: aliter absorbet aquam terra sitiens, aliter sol calens; illa indigentia, iste potentia.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; To convey therefore the truth of His resurrection, He condescends not only to be touched by His disciples, but to eat with them, that they might not suspect that His appearance was not actual, but only imaginary. Hence it follows, And when he had eaten before them, he took the remnant, and gave to them. He ate indeed by His power, not from necessity. The thirsty earth absorbs water in one way, the burning sun in another way, the one from want, the other from power.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Graecus</b>: Si damus dominum vere comedisse, demus et omnes homines post resurrectionem uti ciborum fomentis. Sed quae ex quadam dispensatione fiunt a salvatore, non sunt regula et norma naturae; quoniam in quibusdam aliis dispensavit. Resuscitabit enim nostra corpora incorrupta, qui tamen dereliquit proprii corporis foramina, quae clavi foraverant, et lateris cicatricem, ut ostendat quod mansit post resurrectionem natura corporis, nec est in aliam mutatus substantiam.
          <td><b>GREEK EX</b>. But some one will say, If we allow that our Lord ate after His resurrection, let us also grant that all men will after the resurrection take the nourishment of food. But these things which for a certain purpose are done by our Savior, are not the rule and measure of nature, since in other things He has purposed differently. For He will raise our bodies, not defective but perfect and incorrupt, who yet left on His own body the prints which the nails had made, and the wound in His side, in order to show that the nature of His body remained the same after the resurrection, and that He was not changed into another substance.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Manducavit ergo post resurrectionem, non quasi cibo indigens, nec quasi in resurrectione quam expectamus, cibis egere significans; sed ut eo modo naturam corporis resurgentis astrueret. Mystice autem piscis assus, quem Christus comedit, significat Christum passum: ipse enim latere dignatus in aquis generis humani, capi voluit laqueo mortis nostrae; et quasi tribulatione assatus est tempore passionis suae: sed favus mellis nobis extitit in resurrectione. In favo quidem mellis utramque naturam exprimere voluit personae suae. Favus quippe mellis in cera est; mel vero in cera, est divinitas in humanitate.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; He ate therefore after the resurrection, not as needing food, nor as signifying that the resurrection which we are expecting will need food; but that He might thereby build up the nature of a rising body. But mystically, the broiled fish of which Christ ate signifies the sufferings of Christ. For He having condescended to lie in the waters of the human race, was willing to be taken by the hook of our death, and was as it were burnt up by anguish at the time of His Passion. But the honeycomb was present to us at the resurrection. By the honeycomb He wished to represent to us the two natures of His person. For the honeycomb is of wax, but the honey in the wax is the Divine nature in the human.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Videntur autem et comesta aliud habere mysterium: quod enim manducavit partem piscis assi, significavit quod naturam nostram in huius vitae mari natantem, assans eam igne propriae deitatis, et exsiccans eius humiditatem, quam a profundis undis contraxerat, escam fecit divinam; et eam quae prius erat abominabilis, praeparavit Deo cibum suavem; quod significat favus mellis. Vel per piscem assum significat vitam activam consumentem nostram humilitatem laborum prunis; contemplationem vero significat per favum mellis, propter dulcedinem eloquiorum Dei.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. The things eaten seem also to contain another mystery. For in that He ate part of a broiled fish, He signifies that having burnt by the fire of His own divinity our nature swimming in the sea of this life, and dried up the moisture which it had contracted from the waves, He made it divine food; and that which was before abominable He prepared to be a sweet offering to God, which the honeycomb signifies. Or by the broiled fish He signifies the active life, drying up the moisture with the coals of labor, but by the honeycomb, the contemplative life on account of the sweetness of the oracles of God.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Postquam autem visus est, tactus est et manducavit, ne in aliquo sensus humanos ludificasse videretur, misit manus ad Scripturas; unde sequitur et dixit ad illos: haec sunt verba quae locutus sum ad vos cum adhuc essem vobiscum; idest, cum adhuc essem in carne mortali, in qua estis et vos: tunc quidem in eadem carne resuscitatus erat, sed cum illis in eadem mortalitate non erat: et subdit quoniam necesse est impleri omnia quae scripta sunt in lege Moysi et prophetis et Psalmis de me.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; But after that He was seen, touched, and had eaten, lest He should seem to have mocked the human senses in any one respect, He had recourse to the Scriptures. And he said to them, These are the words which I spoke to you, when I was yet with you, that is, when I was as yet in the mortal flesh, in which you also are. He indeed was then raised again in the same flesh, but was not in the same mortality with them. And He adds, That all things must be fulfilled which were written in the Law of Moses, and in the Prophets, and in the Psalms, concerning me.

          <td><b>Augustinus de Cons.

Neque enim si magicis artibus fecit ut coleretur et mortuus, magus erat antequam natus, cui prophetando venturo gens una deputata est.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Let those then who dream that Christ could have done such things by magical arts, and by the same art have consecrated His name to the nations to be converted to Him, consider whether He could by magical arts fill the Prophets with the Divine Spirit before He was born. For neither supposing that He caused Himself to be worshipped when dead, was He a magician before He was born, to whom one nation was as assigned to prophesy His coming.

          <td><b>Eusebius</b>: Dictum enim erat: postula a me, et dabo tibi gentes hereditatem tuam. Oportebat autem conversus ex gentibus expiari a quolibet contagio et macula per ipsius virtutem, quasi contaminatos ab errore Daemonum idololatriae, et quasi nuper conversos a vita execrabili et impudica: et ideo dicit, quod oportet praedicari prius quidem poenitentiam, consequenter remissionem peccatorum in omnes gentes: eis enim qui prius quidem veram ostenderunt malorum poenitentiam, salubri gratia veniam commissorum donavit, pro quibus et mortem subiit.
          <td><b>EUSEBIUS</b>. For it was said, Ask of me, and I will give you the heathen for your inheritance. But it was necessary that those who were converted from the Gentiles should be purged from a certain stain and defilement through His virtue, being as it were corrupted by the evil of the worship of devils, and as lately converted from an abominable and unchaste life. And therefore He says that it behoves that first repentance should be preached, but next, remission of sins, to all nations. For to those who first showed. repentance for their sins, by His saving grace He granted pardon of their transgression, for whom also He endured death.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: In hoc vero quod dicit poenitentiam et remissionem peccatorum, etiam de Baptismate meminit, in quo per depositionem priorum scelerum subsequitur venia peccatorum. Sed quo pacto intelligetur in solo Christi nomine Baptisma fieri, cum alibi mandet hoc fieri in nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti? Et primo quidem dicimus, quod non intelligitur quod in solo Christi nomine fiat Baptisma, sed quod Christi Baptismate aliquis baptizetur, idest spiritualiter, non Iudaice, nec tali quali Ioannes baptizabat ad solam poenitentiam, sed ad spiritus almi participationem; sicut et Christus in Iordane baptizatus ostendit spiritum sanctum in specie columbina. Porro Baptisma in Christi nomine, idest morte Christi, intelligas: sicut enim ipse post mortem triduo resurrexit, sic et nos ter in aquam mergimur, et consequenter emergimur, incorruptibilitatis spiritus arrham recipientes. Hoc etiam Christi nomen continet in se et patrem quasi unctorem, et spiritum quasi unctionem, et filium quasi unctum, scilicet secundum humanam naturam. Non autem decebat amplius bipartitum esse humanum genus in Iudaeos et gentiles: et ideo, ut omnes in unum uniret, mandavit incipere sermonem a Ierusalem et ad gentes terminari; unde sequitur incipientibus ab Ierusalem.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. But herein that He says, Repentance and remission of sins, He also makes mention of baptism, in which by the putting off of our past sins there follows pardon of iniquity. But how must we understand baptism to be performed in the name of Christ alone, whereas in another place He commands it to be in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost. First indeed we say that it is not meant that baptism is administered in Christ’s name alone, but that a person is baptized with the baptism of Christ, that is, spiritually, not Judaically, nor with the baptism, wherewith John baptized to repentance only but to the participation of the blessed Spirit; as Christ also when baptized in Jordan manifested the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove. Moreover you must understand baptism in Christ’s name to be in His death. For as He after death rose again on the third day, so we also are three times dipped in the water, and fitly brought out again, receiving thereby an earnest of the immortality of the Spirit. This name of Christ also contains in itself both the Father as the Anointer and the Spirit as the Anointing, and the Son as the Anointed, that is, in His human nature. But it was fitting that the race of man should no longer be divided into Jews and Gentiles, and therefore that He might unite all in one, He commanded that their preaching should begin at Jerusalem but be finished with the Gentiles. Hence it follows, Beginning at Jerusalem.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Non solum quia credita sunt illis eloquia Dei, et eorum est adoptio filiorum et gloria; verum etiam ut gentes variis erroribus implicatae, hoc maxime indicio divinae pietatis ad spem veniae provocentur, quod eis qui filium Dei crucifixerunt, venia concedatur.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Not only because to them were entrusted the oracles of God, and theirs is the adoption and the glory, but also that the Gentiles entangled in various errors might by this sign of Divine mercy be chiefly invited to come to hope, seeing that to them even who crucified the Son of God pardon is granted.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Insuper ne dicerent aliqui, quod omissis notis iverunt se ostentaturos ad extraneos, ideo prius apud ipsos occisores pandunt resurrectionis signa in eadem civitate in qua prorupit temerarius ausus. Ubi enim crucifixores credere videntur, resurrectio plurimum demonstratur.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Further, lest any should say that abandoning their acquaintances they went to show themselves, (or as it were to vaunt themselves with a kind of pomp,) to strangers therefore first among the very murderers themselves are the signs of the resurrection displayed, in that very city wherein the frantic outrage burst forth. For where the crucifiers themselves are seen to believe, there the resurrection is most of all demonstrated.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Eusebius</b>: Quod si ea quae Christus praedixit, iam sortiuntur effectum, et verbum eius vivax et efficax per universum mundum oculata fide perspicitur, tempus est non incredulos esse erga eum qui protulit verbum. Eum enim necesse est divinam vitam ducere cuius opera vivida verbis consona ostenduntur; quae quidem ministerio apostolorum impleta sunt; unde subdit vos autem estis testes horum, mortis scilicet et resurrectionis.
          <td><b>EUSEBIUS</b>. But if those things which Christ foretold are already receiving their accomplishment, and His word is perceived by a seeing faith to be living and effectual throughout the whole world; it is time for men not to be unbelieving towards Him who uttered that word. For it is necessary that He should live a divine life, whose living works are shown to be agreeable to His words; and these indeed have been fulfilled by the ministry of the Apostles. Hence He adds, But you are witnesses of these things, &amp;c. that is, of My death and resurrection.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Consequenter ne turbati cogitarent: quomodo nos homines idiotae testimonium perhibebimus gentibus et Iudaeis, qui te occiderunt? Subiungit et ego mittam promissum patris mei in vos; quod scilicet per Ioelem promiserat dicens: effundam spiritum meum super omnem carnem.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Afterwards, lest they should be troubled at the thought, How shall we private individuals give our testimony to the Jews and Gentiles who have killed Thee? He subjoins, And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you, &amp;c. which indeed He had promised by the mouth of the prophet Joel, I will pour my Spirit upon all flesh.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But as a general does not permit his soldiers who are about to meet a large number, to go out until they are armed, so also the Lord does not permit His disciples to go forth to the conflict before tile descent of the Spirit. And hence He adds, But tarry you in the city of Jerusalem, until you be endued with power from on high.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">

          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Cur autem non Christo praesente, vel eo discedente statim spiritus venit? Decebat enim eos fieri cupidos rei, et demum recipere gratiam: tunc enim magis ad Deum erigimur, cum incumbit necessitas. Oportebat enim interim nostram comparere naturam in caelo, et foedera consummari, ac deinde spiritum advenire et gaudia celebrari serena. Attende etiam quantam eis necessitatem imposuit Hierosolymis esse, in eo quod illic spiritum promisit largiri. Ne enim rursus post eius resurrectionem aufugerent, hac expectatione quasi quodam vinculo omnes simul eos ibi detinuit. Dicit autem donec induamini virtute ex alto; nec expressit quando, ut sint iugiter vigiles. Quid ergo miraris, si diem nobis novissimum non pandit, cum diem hunc propinquum pandere noluit?
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But why did not the Spirit come while Christ was present, or immediately on His departure? Because it was fitting that they should become desirous of grace, and then at length receive it. For we are then most awakened towards God, when difficulties press upon us. It was necessary in the mean time that our nature should appear in Heaven, and the covenants be completed, and that then the Spirit should come, and pure joys be experienced. Mark also what a necessity He imposed upon them of being at Jerusalem, in that He promised that the Spirit should there be given them. For lest they should again flee away after His resurrection by this expectation, as it were a chain, He kept them all there together. But He says, until you be endued from on high. He did not express the time when, in order that they may be constantly watchful. But why then marvel that He does not reveal to us our last day, when He would not even make known this day which was close at hand.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius Reg. Pastor.</b>: Admonendi sunt ergo quos a praedicationis officio vel imperfectio vel aetas prohibet, et tamen praecipitatio impellit, ne dum sibi tantum onus officii praecipitatione arrogant, viam sibi subsequentis meliorationis abscindant. Ipsa enim veritas, quae repente quos vellet roborare potuisset; ut exemplum sequentibus daret, ne imperfecti praedicare praesumerent; postquam plene discipulos de virtute praedicationis instruxit, mandavit eis ut in civitate sederent, donec induerentur virtute ex alto. In civitate quippe sedemus, si intra mentium nostrarum nos claustra constringimus, ne loquendo exterius evagemur; ut cum virtute divina perfecte induimur, tunc quasi a nobismetipsis foras etiam alios instruentes exeamus.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. They then are to be warned, whom age or imperfection hinders from the office of preaching, and yet rashness impels, lest while they hastily arrogate to themselves so responsible an office, they should cut themselves off from the way of future amendment. For the Truth Itself which could suddenly strengthen those whom it wished, in order to give an example to those that follow, that imperfect men should not presume to preach, after having fully instructed the disciples concerning the virtue of preaching, commanded them to abide in the city, until they were endued with power from on high. For we abide in a city, when we keep ourselves close within the gates of our minds, lest by speaking we wander beyond them; that when we are perfectly endued with divine power, we may then as it were go out beyond ourselves to instruct others.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Consideremus autem quomodo secundum Ioannem acceperint spiritum sanctum; hic autem in civitate iubentur sedere, quoadusque induantur virtute ex alto. Sed spiritum sanctum vel illis undecim quasi perfectioribus insufflavit, et reliquis postea tribuendum promittit; vel eisdem ibi insufflavit, hic spopondit. Nec videtur esse contrarium, cum divisiones sint gratiarum. Ergo aliam insufflavit ibi operationem, hic aliam pollicetur: ibi enim remittendorum gratia tributa est peccatorum; quod videtur esse augustius: et ideo insufflatur a Christo, ut credas de Deo spiritum sanctum Christi, et credas de Deo spiritum: Deus enim solus peccata dimittit. Lucas autem linguarum gratiam describit effusam.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>; But let us consider how according to John they received the Holy Spirit, while here they are ordered to stay in the city until they should be endued with power from on high. Either He breathed the Holy Spirit into the eleven as being more perfect, and promised to give it to the rest afterwards; or to the same persons He breathed in the one place He promised in the other. Nor does there seem to be any contradiction, since there are diversities of graces. Therefore one operation He breathed into them there, another He promised here. For there the grace of remitting sins was given, which seems to be more confined, and therefore is breathed into them by Christ, that you may believe the Holy Spirit to be of Christ, to be from God. For God alone forgives sins. But Luke describes the pouring, forth of the grace of speaking with tongues.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Vel dicit: accipite spiritum sanctum, ut eos idoneos faceret ad receptionem: aut quod futurum est, ut praesens indicavit.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Or He said, Receive you the Holy Spirit, that He might make them fit to receive it, or indicated as present that which was to come.

          <td><b>Beda</b>: Praetermissis omnibus quae per quadraginta dies agi a domino cum discipulis potuerunt, primo diei resurrectionis eius coniungit tacite novissimum diem quo ascendit in caelum, dicens eduxit autem eos foras in Bethaniam. Primo quidem propter nomen civitatis, quae domus obedientiae dicitur: qui enim propter inobedientiam perversorum descendit, propter obedientiam conversorum ascendit. Deinde propter situm eiusmodi villae, quae in latere montis olivarum posita esse narratur: quia videlicet obedientis Ecclesiae domus in ipsius summi montis, idest in Christi, latere, fidei, spei dilectionisque suae fundamenta locavit. Eos autem benedicit, quibus praecepta docendi tradiderat; unde sequitur et elevatis manibus suis benedixit eis.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Having omitted all those things which may have taken place during forty-three days between our Lord and His disciples, St. Luke silently joins to the first day of the resurrection, the last day when He ascended into heaven, saying, And he led them out as far as to Bethany. First, indeed, because of the name of the place, which signifies “the house of obedience.” For He who descended because of the disobedience of the wicked, ascended because of the obedience of the converted. Next, because of the situation of the same village, which is said to be placed on the side of the mount of Olives; because He has placed the foundations, as it were, of the house of the obedient Church, of faith, hope, and love, in the side of that highest mountain, namely, Christ. But He blessed them to whom He had delivered the precepts of His teaching; hence it follows, And he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Forsan vim conservativam influens eis usque ad adventum spiritus; et fortassis instruens nos, ut quoties recedimus, benedictionibus subditos Dei commendemus.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Perhaps pouring into them a power of preservation, until the coming of the Spirit; and perhaps instructing them, that as often as we go away, we should commend to God by our blessing those who are placed under us.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Origenes</b>: Quod autem elevatis manibus benedixit eos, significat quod deceat benedicentem cuiquam ornatum esse variis operibus et arduis respectu aliorum: sic enim manus tolluntur in altum.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; But that He blessed them with uplifted hands, signifies that it becomes him who blesses any one to be furnished with various works and labors in behalf of others. For in this way are the hands raised up on high.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Attende autem, quod dominus bravia repromissa aspectui subicit. Promiserat quidem corporum resurrectionem: a mortuis resurrexit, et per quadraginta dies discipulos certificat. Promittitur etiam, quod in nubibus rapiemur in aera; et hoc ipse patefecit per opera; sequitur enim et factum est dum benediceret illis, recessit ab eis, et ferebatur in caelum.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But observe, that the Lord submits to our sight the promised rewards. He had promised the resurrection of the body; He rose from the dead, and conferred with His disciples for forty days. It is also promised that we shall be caught up in the clouds through the air; this also He made manifest by His works. For it follows, And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted, &amp;c.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Et Elias quidem videbatur quasi assumi in caelum; sed salvator ipse praecursor omnium ascendit in caelum, appariturus divino conspectui in sacro suo corpore: et iam nostra natura in Christo honoratur a qualibet virtute angelica.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. And Elias indeed was seen, as it were, to be taken up into heaven, but the Savior, the forerunner of all, Himself ascended into heaven to appear in the Divine sight in His sacred body; and already is our nature honored in Christ by a certain Angelic power.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Sed dices: quid interest mea? Quia et tu in nubibus suscipieris similiter: nam corpus tuum connaturale est illi corpori. Erit igitur et corpus tuum tam agile ut possit transire per aera; nam sicut caput, sic et corpus; sicut principium, sic et finis. Aspice autem quomodo honoratus es per hoc principium. Infima pars rationalis creaturae homo erat; sed pedes effecti sunt caput, sublimati in regiam sedem in suo capite.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But you will say, How does this concern me? Because you also shall be taken up in like manner into the clouds. For your body is of like nature to His body, therefore shall your body be so light, that it can pass through the air. For as is the head, so also is the body; as the beginning, so also the end. See then how you are honored by this beginning. Man was the lowest part of the rational creation, but the feet have been made the head, being lifted up aloft into the royal throne in their head.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Ascendente autem in caelum domino, discipuli adorantes ubi steterunt novissime pedes eius, confestim Hierosolymam redeunt, ubi promissionem patris sunt expectare praecepti; sequitur enim et ipsi adorantes regressi sunt in Ierusalem cum gaudio magno. Gaudia magna agunt, quia Deum ac dominum suum post triumphum resurrectionis etiam caelos penetrasse laetantur.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; When the Lord ascended into heaven, the disciples adoring Him where His feet lately stood, immediately return to Jerusalem, where they were commanded to wait for the promise of the Father, for it follows, And they worshipped him, and returned, &amp;c. Great indeed was their joy, for they rejoice that their God and Lord after the triumph of His resurrection had also passed into the heavens.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Graecus</b>: Et erant vigilantes: non degentes in propriis Laribus, sed expectantes supernam gratiam conversantur in templo, inter cetera etiam loci honestatem adicientes; unde dicitur et erant semper in templo.
          <td><b>GREEK EX</b>. And they were watching, praying, and fasting, because indeed they were not living in their own homes, but were abiding in the temple, expecting the grace from on high; among other things also learning from the very place piety and honesty. Hence it is said, And were continually in the temple.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Nondum aderat spiritus, et iam spiritualiter conversantur: prius erant reclusi, iam stant in medio principum sacerdotum, nec aliquo distrahuntur mundano, sed omnibus contemptis iugiter Deum laudant; sequitur enim laudantes et benedicentes Deum.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. The Spirit had not yet come, and yet their conversation is spiritual. Before they were shut up; now they stand in the midst of the chief priests; distracted by no worldly object, but despising all things, they praise God continually; as it follows, Praising and blessing God.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Et attende, quod Lucas inter quatuor animalia caeli designatus accipitur per vitulum; cuius victima, qui in sacerdotium eligebantur, initiari sunt iussi, eo quod ipse sacerdotium Christi ceteris amplius exponendum suscepit; et Evangelium suum, quod a ministerio templi per sacerdotium Zachariae coepit, in templi devotione complevit: et apostolos ibi ministros novi sacerdotii futuros, non in victimarum sanguine, sed in laude Dei et in benedictione conclusit: ut in loco orationis et inter laudum devotiones promissum spiritus sancti adventum paratis cordibus expectent.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; And observe that among the four beasts in heaven, Luke is said to be represented by the calf, for by the sacrifice of a calf, they were ordered to be initiated who were chosen to the priesthood; and Luke has undertaken to explain more fully than the rest the priesthood of Christ; and his Gospel, which he commenced with the ministry of the temple in the priesthood of Zacharias, he has finished with the devotion in the temple. And he has placed the Apostles there, about to be the ministers of a new priesthood, not in the blood of sacrifices, but in the praises of God and in blessing, that in the place of prayer and amidst the praises of their devotion, they might wait with prepared hearts for the promise of the Spirit.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Quos nos imitantes, in sacra vita semper degamus, laudantes et benedicentes Deum, cui est gloria et benedictio et virtus in saecula. Amen.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Whom imitating, may we ever dwell in a holy life, praising and blessing God; to Whom be glory and blessing and power, for ever and ever. Amen.
