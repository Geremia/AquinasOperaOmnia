            death, lest it happen that someone depart this life without
            viaticum. It was appropriate for this to be instituted out of
            reverence for so great a sacrament, chiefly for three reasons.
            First, on account of the very holiness of the sacrament, so that the
            mouth of the Christian, by whom it is consumed, be not filled up
            with prior food, but be kept, as it were, new and pure for its
            reception. Second, on account of the devotion that is required on
            the part of the recipient, and the attention that might be impeded
            by food already taken in, with the fumes rising from the stomach to
            the head. Third, on account of the danger of vomiting or other
            things like that.</font

            are preserved from the Lord who instituted this sacrament in the
            manner of essentials to the sacrament, and thus the Church must
            retain these things. But the Lord observed an order of consuming
            that was fitting for the
            <i>institution</i>
            of the sacrament, hence the Church need not preserve it, because it
            is not necessarily the case that that which befits the beginning or
            generation of some thing remain suited to it when it has attained
            perfect being; and in like manner, it need not be the case that what
            is suited to a sacrament as regards its institution remain suited to
            it as regards its [subsequent] use.</font

            them, because they were wanting to mingle this [regular] food with

            other food on Holy Thursday in representation of the Lord's supper;
            but now that ordinance is abrogated by common custom; or it [i.e.,

            diminishes sobriety in no way; nay, by causing strength, it rather
            promotes nature. But the reason why the Eucharist should be consumed
            only by people who are fasting, is in order that they may consume
            [the Body of Christ] with reverence and sobriety. Therefore it is

            discretion and sobriety, which qualities are especially required for
            [the worthy reception of] this sacrament, therefore consuming the
            Body of Christ after other food, even if the consumption of some
            food does not interfere with reason, was universally prohibited -
            especially seeing that no harm befalls if, after partaking of such
            food, one abstains from the reception of this sacrament, since, in a
            case of true necessity, one

            is that by which someone is said to be fasting prior to the
            consumption of food that day, even if he will eat several times
            afterwards; and since this is called "fasting" [simply] from the
            lack of food taken beforehand, any consumption of food takes away
            this kind of <a name="fasting" id="fasting">fasting</a>.

              >
              <font size="3"
                >But the fasting of the Church is that by which someone is said
                to be fasting according to the manner instituted by the Church
                for the affliction of the flesh; and this fasting remains even
                after a singular instance of dining, nor is it dissolved except
                by a second consumption of those things that are customarily
                taken as food and refreshment; and therefore those things that
                are customarily taken [not as food, but] for the sake of other
                foods - either things to help in digesting food, such as
                electuaries, or to help the food to pass through to the body's
                members, as wine or water is drunk for this purpose - such
                things do not dissolve the fast even though they in some way
                nourish. Accordingly, for the proper consumption of the Lord's
                Body the fasting of the church is not required, because this
                sacrament is celebrated even outside of the prescribed days of
                fasting, but what
                <i>is</i>
                required is the fasting of nature, out of reverence for the

                and wine taken beforehand count as impediments to receiving the
                Eucharist.</font

            to consumption of external food, although it has for its goal the
            transference of food into the stomach, and beyond that, the
            nourishment it affords; and therefore things that are carried
            inside, without the consumption of food from outside, do not seem to
            dissolve the fasting of nature, nor to impede the reception of the
            Eucharist, e.g., the swallowing of saliva; and it is considered to
            be so, likewise, with whatever remains between the teeth, and even
            the results of heartburn - although on account of reverence one can
            [in such circumstances] abstain without danger, unless necessity

            post celebrationem suas speciales orationes habent ad gratiarum
            actionem; et ideo oportet esse aliquod intervallum inter sumptionem
            Eucharistiae et aliorum ciborum. Sed quia non requiritur magnum
            intervallum, et quod parum deest, nihil deesse videtur, ut dicitur
            in 2 Phys., ideo possemus sub hoc sensu concedere quod statim potest

            >To the third it should be said that according to the Church's
            custom, on account of reverence for so great a sacrament, after its
            consumption a man ought to spend time in thanksgiving; hence in the
            Mass, too, a prayer of thanksgiving after communion is said, and the
            priests after the celebration have their special prayers for the
            purpose of thanksgiving; and so it is necessary that there be some
            interval between the consumption of the Eucharist and that of other
            food. But because a great interval is not required, and that which
            is lacking a little seems to be lacking in nothing, as is said in
            <i>Physics</i>
            2, therefore it could be conceded in this sense that after the
            consumption of the Eucharist one may immediately consume other
            food.</font

            phrased according to the custom of the primitive Church, when, on
            account of a dearth of ministers, solemn Masses were more rarely
            celebrated, and [so] with greater preparation. Hence Dionysius in
            his letter tells of Carpo that he never celebrated Mass unless he
            had received some divine revelation beforehand; and therefore this
            is now abrogated through contrary custom.</font

            consumption, causes its proper effect; and hence it is necessary
            that in that consumption [as such] the heart of man persist
            <i>actually</i>
            in devotion; but after reception it suffices that devotion is
            maintained
            <i>habitually</i>, since it cannot always be in act; and hence the
            things that can impede this act [of devotion] are prohibited rather
            <i>prior</i>
            to the consumption of the sacrament than afterwards.</font
