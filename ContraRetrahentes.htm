            Christianae religionis propositum in hoc praecipue videtur
            consistere, ut a terrenis homines revocet et spiritualibus faciat
            esse intentos. Hinc est quod auctor fidei et consummator Iesus, in
            hunc mundum veniens, saecularium rerum contemptum et facto et verbo
            suis fidelibus demonstravit.

            THE religion of Christ appears to aim chiefly it diverting the
            attention of mankind from material things, in order to concentrate
            their thoughts on the spiritual. Therefore Jesus, “the Author and
            finisher of our faith,” at His coming into this world, proposed to
            His faithful followers the contempt of earthly things. He taught
            this lesson both by His life and by His words.

            Facto siquidem: quia, sicut dicit Augustinus de catechizandis
            rudibus: omnia bona terrena contempsit homo factus dominus Iesus, ut
            contemnenda monstraret; et omnia terrena mala sustinuit quae
            sustinenda praecipiebat, ut neque in illis quaereretur felicitas,
            neque in istis infelicitas timeretur. Natus enim de matre quae,
            quamvis a viro intacta conceperit semperque intacta permanserit,
            tamen fabro desponsata erat, omnemque typhum carnalis nobilitatis
            extinxit; natus in civitate Bethleem quae inter omnes Iudaeae
            civitates erat exigua, noluit quemquam de terrenae civitatis
            sublimitate gloriari; pauper factus est cuius sunt omnia, ne
            quisquam cum in eum crederet de terrenis divitiis auderet extolli;
            noluit rex ab hominibus fieri, quia humilitatis ostendebat viam;
            esurivit qui omnes pascit, sitivit per quem omnis potus creatur, ab
            itinere fatigatus est qui se ipsum nobis viam fecit in caelum,
            crucifixus est qui cruciatus nostros finivit, mortuus est qui
            mortuos suscitavit.

            He taught it by His life. To quote St. Augustine (<i
              >De catechizandis rudibus</i
            >), “the Lord Jesus, when He became man, despised the good things of
            earth, in order to show that they are contemptible. He likewise
            endured all those earthly trials which He has commanded us to bear,
            so that, from the chances of this world, we may neither expect
            happiness, nor fear unhappiness. He rejected all appearance of noble
            birth; for, although at the time of his conception the virginity of
            His Mother was intact and although she remained for ever inviolate,
            yet was she espoused to a carpenter. He did not will that any should
            glory in the splendour of an earthly city; therefore was He born in
            Bethlehem, the least of the cities of Judah. He to whom all things
            belong, and by whom all things are made, became poor that so none of
            those who would believe in Him might dare to be lifted up by earthly
            wealth. He came to point out the way of humility; therefore He
            refused to be chosen King by men. He who gives food to all, Himself
            hungered. He by whom all manner of drink was created, was thirsty.
            He who has made Himself our road to Heaven, was weary and wayworn.
            He who set an end to our sufferings, Himself was crucified. He died,
            who raised the dead.”

            Hoc idem etiam verbis ostendit. Nam in suae praedicationis exordio
            non aliqua regna terrena, sicut in veteri testamento, sed regnum
            caelorum poenitentibus repromisit. Discipulis primam beatitudinem in
            spiritus paupertate constituit, in qua etiam perfectionis iter esse
            monstravit, dicens quaerenti iuveni: si vis perfectus esse, vade, et
            vende omnia quae habes, et da pauperibus; et veni, sequere me.

            The same lesson He inculcated by His words. For, at the very
            beginning of His preaching, He promised to those who repented, not
            an earthly Kingdom, such as in the Old Testament they had looked
            for, but the Kingdom of Heaven. Not only did He teach His disciples
            that the first Beatitude consists in poverty of spirit, but He
            further pointed out that it is in this same poverty that all
            perfection consists. To the young man seeking the Kingdom of Heaven
            He said (Mt 19: 21), “If you would be perfect, go sell all that you
            have, give it to the poor, and follow Me.”

            Hanc viam eius discipuli sunt secuti, tanquam temporaliter nihil
            habentes, sed spirituali virtute omnia possidentes. Habentes enim

            pium tamque salubre studium Diabolus, humanae salutis aemulus, per
            homines carnales inimicos crucis Christi, terrena sapientes, ab
            antiquis temporibus impedire non cessat. Dicit enim Augustinus in
            Lib. de agone Christiano: masculi et feminae, et omnis aetas et
            omnis huius saeculi dignitas, ad spem vitae aeternae commutata est.
            Alii neglectis temporalibus bonis, convolant ad divina: alii cedunt
            eorum virtutibus qui hoc faciunt et laudant quod imitari non audent.
            Pauci autem adhuc murmurant, et inani livore torquentur, aut qui sua
            quaerunt in Ecclesia, quamvis Catholici videantur; aut ex ipso
            Christi nomine gloriam quaerentes haeretici.

            His disciples followed in this road of poverty. Owning nothing
            temporally, by spiritual virtue they possessed all things; and
            having only what to eat and what to put on, they were content. But
            Satan, in his jealousy of our salvation, has never, since the
            earliest ages, ceased from hindering men in the holy and salutary
            exercise of poverty. For this purpose he has made use of carnal men,
            enemies of the Cross of Christ, and savouring of the things of this
            world. St. Augustine, in his work <i>De Agone Christiano</i>, says:
            “Men and women of all ages and every rank are attracted to the
            beauty of eternal life. Some, to the neglect of their temporal
            interests, give themselves wholly to divine things. Others yield the
            palm to the virtue of those that act in this wise, and praise the
            deeds which they themselves lack courage to imitate. But some few
            there are who, at the sight of such deeds, murmur and fret in
            impotent rage. These can scarcely be called Catholics; they are
            rather self-seekers, trying to serve their own interests by means of
            the Church; or else they are heretics, striving to glorify
            themselves in the name of Christ.”

            Ex horum siquidem numero insurrexerunt ab olim diversis quidem
            locis, sed pari vesania, Iovinianus Romae, Vigilantius in Gallia,
            quae antea errorum monstris caruerat; quorum primus virginitati
            matrimonium, secundus paupertati divitum statum praesumpserunt
            aequare, Manichaeica perfidia evangelica et apostolica consilia,
            quantum in ipsis est, reddentes inania. Si enim divitiae paupertati
            et virginitati matrimonium comparatur ex aequo, frustra vel dominus
            de paupertate servanda, vel eius apostolus de virginitate
            custodienda dedit consilium. Unde insignis doctor Hieronymus
            utrumque eorum efficaciter confutavit.

            Among this number, in former years, two men arose, in different
            places indeed, but infected by the same folly. Jovinian appeared in
            Rome, and Vigilantius in Gaul—both of which places had hitherto been
            free from the pestilence of error. Jovinian dared to set matrimony
            on a level with virginity. Vigilantius asserted that wealth was as
            meritorious as poverty. By this manifest perfidy, they stultified,
            as far as they were able, the evangelical and apostolic counsels.
            For, if wealth is equal to poverty, and matrimony to virginity, it
            was futile for our Lord to have given us the counsel to observe
            poverty, or for the Apostle to have recommended us to preserve
            virginity. By this argument, the great doctor St. Jerome has
            effectually refuted both the false teachers whom we have named.

            But, just as one of the heads of the beast mentioned in the
            Apocalypse was, “as it were, slain to death, and his death-wound was
            healed,” so in Gaul followers of Valentian have reappeared who, by
            means of ingenuity and cunning, deter men from the observance of the
            counsels. Their first axiom is that no one ought, by entering the
            religious life, to undertake to practice the counsels, unless he is
            already exercised in the observance of the commandments. This
            regulation would exclude from the way of perfection all children,
            all sinners and all recent converts to the Faith.

            Addunt insuper, quod consiliorum viam nullus debet assumere nisi

            ignorat; dum carnalium hominum consilia, quorum maior est numerus,
            facilius a spiritualibus homines retrahunt quam inducant. Conantur
            insuper impedire obligationem hominum ad religionis ingressum, per

            Their next dictum is that no one should undertake the observance of
            the counsels without first seeking advice form many persons. We see
            at once that this rule would be a great obstacle in the way of those
            who desire to embrace perfection, since the advice of carnal men
            (who form the majority of mankind) tends rather to deter souls from
            spirituality than to draw them to it. Further, these followers of
            Vigilantius try to hinder men from laying themselves under an
            obligation to embrace religious life, though such an obligation
            strengthens the soul to embrace a life of perfection. Finally, they
            do not hesitate to take every means to diminish in men’s hearts the
            love of poverty.

            Horum autem conatum nefarium praefiguravit Pharao, qui, ut legitur

            These criminal efforts are prefigured in the words of Pharaoh, who,
            as we read in Exodus (5:4), when chiding Moses and Aaron for trying
            to lead the people of God out of Egypt, said to them, “Why do you,
            Moses and Aaron, draw off the people from their work? Origen in his
            Gloss comments on this passage as follows: “Today likewise should
            Moses and Aaron, that is to say, a prophetic and priestly word, call
            a soul to serve God and, leaving the world and renouncing all
            possessions, to devote itself to the law of God and the hearing of
            His word, you will hear the friends of Pharaoh saying: ‘See how men
            are seduced, and young man led astray.’” Origen adds in another
            place: “These were the words of Pharaoh; and in like manner do his
            friends speak today.” Such are the maxims whereby they seek to
            hinder those who aim at perfection. But, to quote the proverb of
            Solomon, “There is no counsel against the Lord.” Trusting,
            therefore, in the help of spiritual arms, which are the power of
            God, we will endeavour to refute the opinions which we, have quoted,
            and to overthrow the presumption of those who exalt themselves
            against the Divine Wisdom.

            THE followers of Vigilantius strive, by sundry arguments, to prove
            that none should undertake to follow the Counsels, unless they are
            already exercised in obedience to the Commandments. First, they
            remind us that Our Saviour when He gave the Counsel of poverty, told
            the young man that if he desired to enter into life, he must keep
            the Commandments, and only when the youth professed to have kept the
            Commandments, did Christ give him the Counsel concerning poverty.
            This shows, they say, that obedience to the Commandments ought to
            precede observance of the Counsels. Again they bring forward, in
            defence of their opinion, the words of Jesus Christ (Mt 28:20), “
            teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded
            you.” They also quote the following commentary of Bede upon this
            Text: “The order herein commanded to be observed is equitable. For,
            first, a hearer must be taught; he must then be initiated into the
            mysteries of the Faith; and, finally, he must be instructed in the
            keeping of the Commandments.” From these words the conclusion is
            drawn that obedience to the Commandments must go before the practice
            of the Counsels.

            Adhuc, in Psalmo legitur: a mandatis tuis intellexi: ubi dicit
            Glossa: non mandata ipsa dico me intellexisse, sed a mandatis: quia
            ea faciendo venit iste ad latitudinem sapientiae. Ex quo etiam idem
            quod prius volunt concludere. Item inducunt quod alibi, in Psal.
            super illud: sicut ablactatus super matre sua, dicit Glossa: sicut
            quinque tempora notantur in procreatione carnali et alitione; ita et
            in spirituali. Prius enim concipimur in utero; deinde ibidem alimur,
            donec in lucem edamur; deinde manibus matris gestamur et lacte
            nutrimur quousque ablactati ad mensam patris accedamus. Et postea
            subdit: haec quinque tempora observat Ecclesia. In quarta enim feria
            quartae hebdomadae quasi Ecclesiae infantia concipitur, tunc enim
            per exorcismum et catechismum rudimentis Christianitatis imbuuntur;
            deinde quasi in utero Ecclesiae aluntur usque ad sabbatum sanctum,
            in quo per Baptismum ad lucem generantur; deinde quasi manibus
            Ecclesiae gestantur et lacte nutriuntur usque ad Pentecosten, quo
            tempore nulla difficilia indicuntur: non ieiunatur, non media nocte
            surgitur; postea spiritu Paraclito confirmati, quasi ablactati

            ordinem pervertunt, ut haeretici et schismatici, se ante tempus a
            lacte separantes, unde extinguuntur. Cum igitur observatio
            consiliorum sit difficilior quam observatio mandatorum; videtur
            perversus esse ordo, et ad haeresim vel schisma pertinere quod
            aliquis accedat ad observandum consilia, prius in praeceptis
            observandis non exercitatus.

            They further allege in favour of their views the verse of Psalm 118,
            “By your commandments I have had understanding.” They cite too the
            words of the Gloss, “I do not say that I have understood your
            Commandments themselves, but that by them I have had understanding;
            for, by keeping the Commandments, David attained to sublime wisdom.”
            The verse of Ps. 30 is also, quoted in the same sense, “As a weaned
            child to his mother,” with the following commentary upon this text,
            which occurs in the Gloss, “As in physical so also in spiritual
            procreation and nourishment five periods occur. First we are
            conceived in the womb; we are nourished therein until we see the
            light; we are then carried in the arms of our mother and suckled
            with her milk until, being weaned, we are seated at the table of our
            father.” The Gloss then adds: “Holy Church likewise observes these
            five periods.” For the child of the Church is, so to speak,
            conceived on the Wednesday of the fourth week [of Lent]. He is, by
            exorcism and catechism, initiated in the rudiments of the Christian
            Faith. He is nourished in the womb of the Church until, on Holy
            Saturday, he is by baptism born into spiritual light. Then, until
            Pentecost, he may be said to be carried in the arm of the Church and
            fostered at her breast; for during this season nothing laborious is
            enjoined, neither rising by night nor fasting. But after he has been
            confirmed by the Holy Spirit, the Christian is weaned, and begins to
            fast and to observe other toilsome practices. But (say the followers
            of Vigilantius) many reverse this order. Such are heretics and
            schismatics, who prematurely forsake their mother’s milk, and
            therefore come to nought. As it is more difficult to practise the
            Counsels than to keep the Commandments, it is reversing the right
            order of things for a man who is not exercised in obedience to the
            Commandments to undertake to observe the Counsels. Such an error may
            end in heresy or schism.

            They strive, further, to strengthen this argument by the order
            observed by our Saviour in the miracles whereby He fed the
            multitudes. For, first, as we read in Mat xiv, He fed five thousand
            men with five loaves and two fishes; and then in Mat 15 we see that
            He fed four thousand men with seven loaves and seven little fish. By
            the five thousand men are meant those who, living a secular life,
            know how to make good use of material possessions; but the four
            thousand fed by seven loaves, signify those who renounce the world
            completely, and are nourished on evangelical perfection and
            spiritual grace. Hence we are to learn that men must first be
            sustained by obedience to the commandments, and afterwards led to
            the perfection of the Counsels.

            Another argument, brought forward by those who follow Vigilantius,
            is contained in the words of St. Jerome on the beginning of the
            Gospel of St. Matthew. “The Holy Gospel,” he says, “is composed of
            four elements, namely, precepts, commandments, testimonies,
            examples. Justice appears in the precepts, charity in the
            commandments, faith in the testimonies, perfection in the examples.”
            From this passage they conclude that it is from the justice of the
            precepts that we are to attain to the perfection of the examples,
            which perfection would seem to consist in the Counsels.

            Inducunt etiam quod Gregorius dicit in 6 Moral.: post Liae amplexus
            ad Rachelem Iacob pervenit: quia perfectus quisque ante activae

            copulatur. Status autem religionis, qui consiliorum observantiam
            profitetur, pertinet ad vitam contemplativam; praecepta autem
            dirigunt nos ad vitam activam: quia Matth. XIX, ubi enumerantur
            praecepta legis, dicit Glossa: ecce vita activa; ubi autem postea
            subiicitur, si vis perfectus esse etc., dicit ecce vita
            contemplativa. Non videtur ergo esse transeundum ad religionis
            statum, nisi prius aliquis fuerit in vita activa exercitatus per
            observantiam praeceptorum.
          </td>
          <td>
            They further bring forward the following passage of St. Gregory (<i
              >VI Moral.</i
            >): “It was after the embrace of Lia that Jacob came to Rachel; for
            the perfect man is first engaged in the fruitfulness of active life
            and afterwards attains to the repose of contemplation:” Now the
            religious state, which professes the practice of the Counsels,
            belongs to the contemplative life. But the Commandments lead us to
            the active life. The Gloss says, concerning the passage in Matthew
            12, where the Commandments of the Law are enumerated: “Behold the
            active life.” But when it comments on those words of our Lord in the
            same chapter, “If you would be perfect” etc., the Gloss adds:
            “Behold the contemplative life.” Therefore, it is not fitting that a
            man should embrace the religious life, unless, by keeping the
            Commandments, he has first been exercised in the active life.

            Assumunt etiam quod Gregorius dicit super Ezech.: nemo repente fit
            summus, sed in bona conversatione a minimis quis inchoat, ut ad

            magna autem videntur esse consilia, quae pertinent ad perfectionem
            vitae. Dicit enim Augustinus in Lib. de sermone domini in monte:
            illa quae praecepta sunt in lege, dicuntur minima; quae autem
            Christus dicturus est, sunt maxima. Nullus ergo debet ad consiliorum
            observantiam accedere, nisi prius in minoribus, hoc est in
            praeceptis, exercitatus. Item. Gregorius dicit, et habetur in
            decretis dist. XLVIII scimus quod aedificati parietes non prius
            tignorum pondus accipiunt, nisi a novitatis suae humore siccentur;
            ne si ante pondera quam solidentur, accipiant, cunctam simul ad
            terram fabricam deponant. Ibidem etiam habetur ex dictis Gregorii:
            casum appetit qui ad summi loci fastigia postpositis gradibus per
            abrupta quaerit ascensum. Unde concludunt, periculosum esse quod

          <td>
            Another argument, adduced by the disciples of Vigilantius in the
            defence of their cause, is contained in the commentary of St.
            Gregory on Ezekiel: “ No one becomes perfect at once. In true
            conversion a man must begin with the least things, in order that he
            may attain to great things.” Now the Commandments of the Decalogue
            would appear to be the lesser things, but the Counsels, which
            pertain to perfection, the greater. For St. Augustine, in his book
            <i>De sermone Domini in Monte</i>, says: “The things commanded by
            the Law are lesser; those which Christ was to command, were
            greater.” Let no man, therefore, proceed to the observance of the
            greater things, namely, the practice of the Counsels, unless he is
            first exercised in the lesser, that is to say, in keeping the
            Commandments. Again, St. Gregory says (<i
              >Decretis, dist. 48, cap. Sicut</i
            >): “While walls are still new and damp, we know that they cannot
            bear weight; and if a roof be placed upon them before they be dry,
            the whole building will fall to the ground.” Again, among the
            sayings of St. Gregory, we find the following: “He courts a fall
            who, despising steps, attempts to climb a height by a steep ascent.”
            Whence they conclude that it is dangerous for anyone to presume to
            attain to the high perfection of the counsels, unless he be first
            exercised in lesser things that is to say in the Commandments.

            Those who hold this opinion, further observe that the Commandments,
            even in the order of nature, precede the counsels, for they are more
            common and more in harmony with nature. The Commandments can be kept
            together with the Counsels, but the Counsels cannot be practised
            apart from the Commandments. Hence it cannot be well ordered to
            aspire to the Counsels, unless the observance of the Commandments
            has gone first. Those who are of this opinion further add that if it
            were right that the Counsels should take precedence over the
            Commandments, those who did not practise the Counsels could not be
            saved, for they would not be keeping the Commandments.

            SINCE this question regards morals, our first consideration must be
            whether what has been said, is congruous with good works. We must
            prove, first of all that the doctrine of the followers of
            Vigilantius is directly opposed to such works. For there are three
            classes of mankind who have had no practice in keeping the
            Commandments. The first class is composed of children who have not
            had time to be exercised in keeping them. The second class includes
            recent converts to the Faith who, before their conversion, had no
            opportunity of observing the Commandments, “for all that is not of
            faith is sin” (Rom 14:23), and “without faith, it is impossible to
            please God” (Heb 11:6). The third class of men who have not been in
            the habit of keeping the Commandments are those who have led a
            sinful life.

            infantiae annis sub regulari tradiderunt disciplina, utrum liceat

            tradendi, non solum ecclesiasticis statutis quampluribus, sed etiam

            nobiles et religiosi concurrere, suosque ei filios omnipotenti

            coepit existere; placidus vero puerilis adhuc indolis annos gerebat.

            If it were necessary that the observance of the Commandments should
            precede the practice of the Counsels and the entrance into the
            religious life, it would not be right, nor would the Church suffer
            parents to place their young children in religious houses, there to
            be educated in the exercise of the Counsels before they have kept
            the Commandments. But we know that such is her custom, a usage
            supported by grave authority, and confirmed by many passages of
            Scripture. St. Gregory says (<i>XX, quaestione I, cap. Addidistis</i
            >): “Is it lawful for a father or mother who have placed an infant
            son or daughter in a monastery to be there educated in regular
            discipline, to withdraw such a child when it has attained the age of
            puberty, and to give it in marriage? This question we will not
            discuss.” The question as to how far the obligation to regular
            observance is perpetually binding is not of great importance; for,
            if the practice of keeping the Commandments were a necessary
            introduction to the observance of the Counsels, no one could be
            educated in the regular observance of the Counsels who was not
            exercised in obedience to the Commandments. But the custom of
            dedicating children to the religious life is proved, not merely by
            many ecclesiastical statutes, but by the examples of the Saints. St.
            Gregory relates (<i>II Dialog.</i>) that “noble and religious men of
            the City of Rome flocked to blessed Benedict, to offer him their
            children to be trained for Almighty God. Then Euticius and Patricius
            Tertullus gave him their promising sons, Maurus and Placidus, of
            whom Maurus, the younger, being distinguished by his virtues, became
            assistant to the master, while Placidus was still, in disposition, a
            child.” And, as St. Gregory narrates in the same book, Blessed
            Benedict himself, while still a child, being desirous to please none
            but God, turned his back on worldly learning and, leaving his
            parents’ house, sought the usages of holy conversation.

            Hic etiam mos ab ipsis apostolis sumpsisse invenitur exordium. Dicit
            enim Dionysius in fine Ecclesiast. Hierarch.: sursum acti infantes
            ad habitum sanctum habebunt consuetudinem, ab omni remoti errore et
            immundae vitae expertes. Hoc divinis nostris ducibus ad mentem
            venit, et visum est suscipere infantes. Et quamvis ibi loquatur
            Dionysius de susceptione infantium ad Christianam religionem in
            Baptismo assumendam, tamen ratio ibi inducta etiam in proposito
            competit: quia utrobique pueros expedit nutriri in his quae
            postmodum sunt observaturi, ut ad haec eorum habitus firmetur. Et ut
            ulterius procedatur, ipsius domini hoc auctoritate firmatur. Legitur
            enim Matth. XIX, 13, quod oblati sunt Christo parvuli, ut manus eis
            imponeret, et oraret: discipuli autem increpabant eos. Iesus autem
            ait eis: sinite parvulos venire ad me et nolite eos prohibere,
            talium enim est regnum caelorum. Ubi dicit Chrysostomus quis
            mereatur appropinquare Christo, si repellitur ab eo simplex
            infantia? Nam si sancti futuri sunt, quid vetatis filios ad patrem
            venire? Si autem peccatores futuri sunt, ut quid sententiam
            condemnationis profertis antequam culpam videatis? Manifestum est
            autem quod maxime appropinquat homo Christo per viam consiliorum,
            secundum illud Matth. XIX, 21: vende omnia quae habes, et da
            pauperibus, et sequere me. Non sunt igitur pueri retrahendi, ne per
            observantiam consiliorum Christo appropinquent. Sed, sicut Origenes
            ibidem dicit, quidam priusquam discant rationem iustitiae de pueris,
            reprehendunt eos qui per simplicem doctrinam pueros et infantes,
            minus adhuc eruditos offerunt Christo. Dominus autem hortatur
            discipulos suos condescendere utilitatibus puerorum; haec igitur
            debemus attendere ne aestimatione excellentioris sapientiae
            contemnamus quasi magni pusillos Ecclesiae, prohibentes pueros
            venire ad Iesum.

            This custom took its rise from the Apostles themselves. Dionysius,
            in the end of his book
            <i>Eccles. Hierarch.</i>, says, “children, brought up to sublime
            things and kept from sin and error, will acquire the habit of holy
            living. This was the opinion of our blessed masters, and it seemed
            good to them to receive children.” Dionysius, it is true, is here
            only alluding to the admission of children to Baptism, but his
            argument bears out our assertion, viz. that it is expedient to
            educate children in the principles which they are hereafter to
            practise, in order that they may acquire the habit of them. We must
            add, further that this rule is authorised by our Lord Himself. For
            we read in St. Matt. xix. 13, “Then were little children presented
            to Him, that He should impose hands upon them and pray. And the
            disciples rebuked them. But Jesus said to them: ‘Allow the little
            children, and do not forbid them to come to me, for of such is the
            Kingdom of Heaven.” St. Chrysostom, commenting on these words, says,
            “Who shall deserve to draw near to Christ, if innocent childhood is
            driven from Him? If these children are to be saints, why should they
            not approach their Father? If they are to be sinners, why should you
            pronounce sentence of condemnation upon them before their crimes are
            committed?” Now we know that it is by the way of the Counsels that
            man approaches most closely to Christ, for He said to the young man,
            “ Sell all that you have, give to the poor and follow me” (Mt
            19:21). Therefore children are by no means to be hindered from
            drawing near to Him by the way of the Counsels. But, as Origen says,
            on the same passage: “Some there are who, before they have learnt
            the doctrine of justice, rebuke those who, by simple teaching, offer
            to Christ infants and children, that is to say the unlearned. Our
            Lord exhorted His disciples, who were then grown men, to condescend
            to the service of children and to be, so to speak, children with
            children that so they might gain children, for ‘of such,’ He said,
            ‘is the Kingdom of Heaven.’ And He Himself, when He was in the form
            of God, became a child. We ought to bear this in mind, lest, in our
            esteem for our own superior wisdom, we should despise the little
            ones of the Church, forbidding the children to go to Jesus.”

            Et ut adhuc ad priora nos extendamus, de Ioanne Baptista legitur

            desertis usque ad diem ostensionis suae ad Israel. Ubi dicit Beda:
            praedicator poenitentiae futurus, ut liberius auditores suos a mundi
            illecebris erudiendo subtollat, primaevam in desertis transigit

            sensus ingeruntur, assuetus, quandam confusionem ac errorem
            incurreret erga veri boni discretionem; et ideo ad tantum divinarum

            desiderium suum a principio usque ad finem divinis aspectibus

            We may remember, again, how in Luke 1:80 it is written of St. John
            the Baptist, “And the child grew and was strengthened in spirit, and
            was in the desert until the day of his manifestation to Israel.”
            Bede comments on this text in the following words: “He who was to be
            the preacher of penance passed his early years in the desert. He
            acted thus in order more easily to draw his hearers, by means of his
            instructions, from the vanities of the world. He would not, as St.
            Gregory of Nyssa says, allow himself to become accustomed to the
            allurements of the senses, lest he should be misled or perplexed in
            his judgment concerning the true good. And, because he was pure, and
            because, from the beginning of his life to the end, he offered to
            the divine regard desires free from every passion, therefore he was
            raised to such a height of grace that he received gifts surpassing
            those of the prophets.” Therefore, not only is it lawful but even
            most expedient in order to obtain greater grace that some men,
            leaving the world, even in their childhood, should live in the
            solitude of the religious life.

            est circa iuvenum disciplinam, quos oportet erudire secundum quod
            convenit ad unamquamque civilitatem.

            We read in Lamentations 3:27, “It is good for a man, when he has
            borne the yoke from his youth.” The reason given for these words
            being, “he shall sit solitary and hold his peace, because he has
            taken it up upon himself.” By this we are given to understand that
            they who bear the yoke of religious life from their youth upwards,
            arise above themselves and are rendered more fit for religious
            observance, which consists in silence and freedom from worldly care
            and disturbance. In the Book of Proverbs 22:6 the words occur, “A
            young man according to his way, even when he is old he will not
            depart from it.” Hence St. Anselm in his book
            <i>De Similitudinibus</i> compares those who have been brought up in
            monasteries to angels, while those who have been converted from an
            imperfect life he likens to men. This mode of thinking is not only
            confirmed by the authority of Holy Scripture, it is shared even by
            philosophers; for Aristotle in his Second Book of
            <i>Ethics</i> says, “It is by no means a matter of small moment
            whether from our youth we are accustomed to such or such a manner of
            life, but, on the contrary, it is of supreme importance that certain
            men should, from childhood, be instructed in those things which they
            must observe during the course of their life.” Again, in the Eighth
            book of his <i>Politics</i>, the same philosopher writes: “The chief
            concern of a legislator ought to be for the education of the young
            who should be trained in every good quality.”

            We see likewise how this opinion is practically borne out by
            society, for men are, from their very childhood, brought up to those
            professions and offices for which they are destined. Those who are
            intended for clerics must, from their tender years, be educated in
            the clerical life; soldiers, as Vegetius says in book
            <i>De re militari</i>, must, in early years, be subject to military
            discipline; and, carpenters must, from childhood, learn their
            handicraft. Why then should the only exception to this rule be made
            with regard to the religious life? Why should not the young be
            formed to it from their youth? Surely the more arduous a profession
            may be, the more necessary it is that men should be early trained to
            it. Hence we see that the argument that it is necessary to be
            practised in keeping the Commandments before we observe the
            Counsels, does not hold good with regard to children.

            Nunc videre oportet, utrum hoc locum habere possit in illis qui sunt

            me, ut evangelizarem illum in gentibus; continuo non acquievi carni

            vacare.

            VERY few words will suffice to show the absurdity of refusing the
            religious habit to recent converts on the ground that they are not
            exercised in the observance of the Commandments. The first followers
            of Christ, who formed His college, and who gave an example of
            perfection, far surpassing that of any religious order, were
            received by our Lord immediately after their conversion. St. Paul,
            who was the last by conversion, but the foremost in preaching,
            embraced evangelical perfection as soon as he was converted to the
            faith. This we know by his own words to the Galatians: “But when it
            pleased Him, who separated me from my mother’s womb, and exalted me
            by his grace, to reveal his Son in me that I might preach Him among
            the Gentiles, immediately I did not condescended to flesh and blood”
            (Gal 1:15). Christ teaches us the same lesson by His own example. We
            read in St. Matthew 4:1 that after His baptism, He “was led by the
            Spirit into the desert.” “Thus,” says the Gloss, “did He teach those
            that have been baptised to leave the world after their baptism to
            devote themselves to God in solitude.”

            This teaching is confirmed by the praiseworthy practice of many who,
            being once converted from unbelief, immediately assume the religious
            habit. Who would be so ill-advised as to counsel these men rather to
            stay in the world than to withdraw into the Religious life, there to
            endeavour to preserve the Baptismal Grace which they have received?
            What right-minded man would dissuade them from putting on Christ by
            perfect imitation, when by baptism they have already been clothed
            with Him? The argument that no one ought to be admitted to the
            religious life who has not kept the Commandments is thus an
            absurdity in the case of recent converts to the Faith.

            Denique videamus, an in tertio genere hominum, scilicet de peccatis
            poenitentium, nondum in praeceptis exercitatorum, conveniens esse
            possit quod dicunt. Ubi primo assumendum videtur quod in Evangelio
            legitur de conversione Matthaei, quem dominus de telonei lucris ad
            sui sequelam vocavit: et quamvis non statim sit in apostolatum
            assumptus, statim tamen ad consiliorum perfectionem assumpsit.
            Dicitur enim Luc. V, 28, quod relictis omnibus, surgens secutus est
            eum; et sicut Ambrosius ibidem dicit, propria dereliquit qui
            rapiebat aliena. Ex quo manifeste ostenditur quod statim poenitentes
            post quamcumque immanitatem peccatorum, viam consiliorum possunt
            accipere. Quinimmo, ut verius dicatur, eis maxime competit
            perfectiorem viam consiliorum assumere. Gregorius enim in quadam
            homilia exponens illud quod habetur Luc. III, 8: facite dignos
            fructus poenitentiae, dicit: quisquis illicita nulla commisit, huic
            conceditur ut licitis utatur; at si quis in culpam lapsus est, tanto
            a se licita debet abscidere, quanto se meminit illicita perpetrasse.
            Et postmodum subdit: per hoc etiam cuiuslibet conscientia
            convenitur, ut tanto maiora quaerat bonorum operum lucra per
            poenitentiam, quanto graviora sibi intulit damna per culpam. Quia
            igitur in statu religionis homines etiam a licitis abstinent, et
            perfectorum operum lucra quaerunt; manifestum est quod a peccatis
            recedentes, non in observantia praeceptorum sed in eorum potius
            transgressione exercitati, debent viam consiliorum assumere,
            religionem intrando, quae est perfectae poenitentiae status. Unde,
            ut habetur 33, quaest. 2, Stephanus Papa Astulphum quendam, qui
            gravia peccata patraverat, admonet dicens: placeat tibi consilium
            nostrum. Ingredere monasterium, humiliare sub manu abbatis, et
            fratrum multorum precibus adiutus observa cuncta simplici animo quae
            tibi fuerint imperata: et postea subdit: sin autem poenitentiam
            publicam permanens in domo tua vel in hoc mundo vis agere, quod
            peius tibi et durius et gravius esse non dubites, ita ut agere
            debeas exhortamur. Et subiungit quaedam gravissima, quibus tamen
            omnibus utilius et melius esse dicit religionis ingressum.

            FINALLY, let us see whether penitent sinners, who are not yet
            exercised in observing the Commandments, are to be excluded from
            religious life. The example of St. Matthew is germane to our
            question. Our Lord called him from the profits of a custom
            collection to be His follower; and Matthew, although not at once
            admitted to the number of the Apostles, immediately embraced the
            perfection of the counsels, for, “leaving all things he rose up and
            followed him” (Luke v. 28). “He who had robbed others abandoned his
            own possessions,” says St. Ambrose. From this example, it is
            abundantly evident that penitents may, even after most heinous sins,
            enter on the observance of the Counsels. In fact, we may go further,
            and say that it is fitting that such repentant sinners should
            embrace a life of perfection; for, as St. Gregory says in his
            comment on the words of Luke iii., “Bring forth therefore fruits
            worthy of penance”: “He who has committed no unlawful act may
            rightfully be granted the enjoyment of lawful things. But he who has
            fallen into sin, ought to deprive himself of lawful goods, in
            proportion as he is conscious of having committed unlawful deeds.”
            Again, he says: “It is fitting that if a man has impoverished
            himself by sin, he should so much the more eagerly seek by penance
            the riches of good works.” Since then in the religious life men
            abstain even from lawful things, and seek the treasure of
            perfection, it is reasonable that they who abandon sin (whereby they
            have been exercised, not in the practice, but in the transgression
            of the Commandments) should walk in the way of the Counsels, by
            entering religion, which is the state of true penance. Again we
            find, in <i>quaest. XXXIII. cap. II. Admonere</i>, that Pope
            Stephen, addressing a certain Astulphus, who had been guilty of
            great sins, says: “May our advice be pleasing to you. Go into a
            monastery: humble yourself to the Abbot; and, helped by the prayers
            of many brethren, perform in simplicity of heart whatever may be
            enjoined upon you.” “But,” he continues: “if you prefer to remain in
            your house or in the world and there to do public penance (which
            will be far more onerous and painful for you), we will tell you how
            you are to act.” The Pope then imposes severe penances upon him,
            telling him at the same time that it would be better and more
            advantageous for him to go into religion.

            convertentes requiretis eum: quia videlicet post peccata, quibus

            Thus we see that those who are practised, not in keeping the
            Commandments but in sinning against them, are advised to embrace
            religious life. Such penitent, sinners are, however, deterred from
            so doing by the admirable wisdom of certain advisers, whose counsel
            St. Paul thus refutes: “I speak a human thing because of the
            infirmity of your flesh, for, as you have yielded your members to
            serve uncleanness and iniquity unto iniquity, so now yield your
            members to serve justice unto sanctification” (Rom 6:19). “I speak a
            human thing,” comments the Gloss, “because you owe more service to
            justice than to sin.” And Baruch (4:28) says, “As it was your mind
            to go astray from God; so, when you return again, you shall seek him
            ten times as much.” For after sinning and thus forsaking God and
            disobeying His commands, a man ought to strive after the highest
            virtue, and not be content with half measures.

            This teaching is borne out by the example of numerous saints. For
            many of both sexes, after leading lives of crime, have embraced the
            practice of the Counsels, and although they had formed no habit of
            keeping the Commandments, have devoted themselves to the observance
            of the strictest religious rule. Their conduct is approved even by
            philosophers. In the Second book of
            <i>Ethics</i> Aristotle writes: “When we withdraw from great sin, we
            shall come to the uniform line, even as they do who plane away the
            knots from wood.” For those who are knotted by sin, must be brought

            Ad hunc autem errorem radicitus extirpandum, oportet eius radicem

            dominus dicit Matth. XXII, 37, quod primum et maximum mandatum legis
            est: diliges dominum Deum tuum ex toto corde tuo. Secundum autem
            simile est huic: diliges proximum tuum sicut te ipsum. In his autem
            duobus praeceptis essentialiter consistit vitae Christianae
            perfectio. Unde apostolus dicit ad Col. III 14: super omnia
            caritatem habete, quae est vinculum perfectionis. Ubi dicit Glosa
            quod: cetera praecepta perfectum faciunt, in quantum scilicet ad
            caritatem ordinantur, caritas autem omnia ligat. Et inde est quod
            cum dominus Matth. V, 48, praecepta de proximi dilectione dedisset,
            subiunxit: estote ergo perfecti sicut et pater vester caelestis
            perfectus est.

            IN order to refute this error, once and for all, we must examine the
            fallacy on which it is based. Now the premises on which the
            followers of Vigilantius construct their argument are erroneous, and
            for this reason. They assume that perfection consists, chiefly, in
            the observance of the Counsels; and that the Commandments, compared
            to the Counsels, are as the imperfect compared to the perfect.
            Therefore, they say, we must go from Commandments to Counsels, as
            from imperfection to perfection. But this proposition is false. We
            know from the very words of our Lord (Mt 22:37) that the first and
            chief commandment of the Law is the love of God and of our
            fellow-men. “The first commandment is, you shall love the Lord your
            God with your whole heart, and with your whole soul, and with your
            whole mind. And the second is like it: you shall love your neighbour
            as yourself.” The perfection of Christian life consists essentially,
            in obeying these two precepts, Hence the Apostle says to the
            Colossians (3:14), “ But above all these things, have charity, which
            is the bond of perfection.” On this passage the Gloss observes that
            charity makes other things perfect, in so far, that is to say, as
            they are ordered in charity. For charity binds all things together.
            Again, when our Lord had been giving the precepts of brotherly love
            (Mt 5:48), He added, “Be therefore perfect as also your Heavenly
            Father is perfect.”

            St. Jerome says, commenting on the words in St. Matthew 19:27,
            “Behold, we have left all things and have followed you”: “Whereas it
            does not suffice to have left all things, he (Peter) adds ‘and have
            followed you.’ For the Apostles followed the Lord not so much in
            bodily presence, as in affections of the heart.” Again, St. Ambrose,
            alluding to the words, “follow me” (Luke 5), says: “Christ commands
            him (Levi) to follow Him, not with his feet, but with the desires of
            his mind.” It is thus abundantly evident that the perfection of the
            Christian life consists in charity towards God. And there is a very
            solid reason for this conclusion. The perfection of anything
            consists, as we know, in its attainment of its end. Now the end of
            the Christian life is that charity, to which all things must be

            commandment,” or, as the Gloss says, in its comment on this text,
            “is the perfection of the precept, that is to say, of all precepts,

            We must distinguish between an end and the means to an end. In
            considering the means to an end, we must fix some certain measure by
            which the means may be proportioned to the end. But in what regards
            the end itself, there is no question of measure, but each one
            prosecutes his end to the best of his ability. A physician tempers
            his remedies, lest they should be in excess. He has no fear of
            excess in the health which he wishes to restore by those remedies,
            but he desires that such health should be as perfect as possible. In
            like manner, the commandment to love God, which is the end of the
            Christian life, knows no limits. No one can say that this degree or
            that of the love of God is enjoined by this precept, or that where
            the love of God exceeds the Commandment it becomes a Counsel. Every
            man is bound to love God as much as he can. This truth is embodied
            in the very words of the precept: “Love the Lord your God with your
            whole heart.” Every one must obey this commandment according to his
            ability, some with greater and some with less perfection. He totally
            fails to observe it who does not, in his affections, prefer God
            before all things. He who loves Him as His last End, above all other
            things, fulfils the precept more or less perfectly, according as he
            is more or less impeded by his affection for created things. St.
            Augustine says (<i>LXXXIII Quaest.</i>): “The poison of charity is
            the hope of acquiring or retaining temporal things. That is to say,
            if such things are looked on as a last end. The food of charity is
            the lessening of cupidity. Its perfection consists in the extinction
            of earthly desire.”

            But there is another perfect manner of observing this precept, which
            cannot be achieved in this life. For, as St. Augustine says in
            <i>De perfectione justitiae</i>, “In that fulness of charity which
            will reign it our heavenly country, the precept of charity ‘Love the
            Lord your God with your whole heart’ etc. will be perfectly obeyed.”
            “Why,” he continues, should not this perfection be anticipated by
            man, although, in this life he may not attain to it? He does not run
            aright, who does no know where he is running to. But how can he
            know, if he is not taught by any precepts Therefore, to this, as to
            their end, are directed the commandments of love of God and of our
            neighbour, together with all other counsels and commands. Hence St.
            Augustine says in <i>Ench.</i>: “God gives us certain commandments,
            such as: ‘Do not commit adultery’, while other things, such as ‘It
            is good for a man not to touch a woman,’ are not enjoined on us by
            precept, but set before us as a spiritual counsel. Such things are
            rightly done when they are referred to the love of God and to the
            love of our neighbour, for His sake.”

            Nevertheless, the manner in which the precept of Charity is to be
            fulfilled by certain precepts of the Law is different to that in
            which it is to be accomplished by the Counsels. For some things are
            so designed to a particular end that the end cannot be attained
            without them. Such is the case with food and the maintenance of
            life. Other things, again, serve to attain an end with peculiar
            certainty and completeness. Thus, though food is necessary for the
            continuance of physical life? medicine serves for the more easy and
            certain preservation of health. Now some of the commandments are
            given for the first of these two reasons, namely as a necessary
            means of attaining to charity. For instance, no one can fulfil the
            precept of charity who worships false gods, and thus withdraws from
            the love of God, or who commits murder or theft, which are contrary
            to the love of our neighbour. But the Counsels are given to us in
            order that we may fulfil the precept of charity, in the second way
            of which we have spoken. Hence the Apostle, “king of the Counsel of
            virginity, expressly says that its object is to enable us to love
            God. “He who is without a wife is solicitous for the things that
            belong to the Lord, how he may please God. But he who is with a wife
            is solicitous for the things of the world, how he may please his
            wife” (1 Cor 7:32).

            De consilio vero paupertatis ipse salvator dicit, quod ad sui

            Again, we see from St. Matthew 19 that our Lord gave the Counsel of
            poverty as a means whereby He was to be followed; and following Him,
            as we have shown, consists in charity. Now charity is lessened by
            cupidity, but cupidity and love of money is diminished, or wholly
            eradicated, by the renunciation of earthly possessions. St.
            Augustine, in his Epistle to Paulinus and Therasia, says that “our
            love for the goods that we have acquired is much stronger than our
            desires for those that we do not possess. It is one thing, indeed,
            to have no will to gain those things that are lacking to us, but
            quite another to divest ourselves of those that we already possess.”
            Both these Counsels are also intended to facilitate charity towards
            our neighbour. All that our Lord lays down in St. Matthew 5 about
            brotherly love ought to be the abiding disposition of the soul. And
            it is clear that His precepts on this head will be most easily
            obeyed by the man who is not hampered by self-interest. He who has
            no will to possess anything will be better prepared to part with his
            coat and his cloak, than he who desires possessions.

            Quia vero caritas non solum finis est, sed etiam radix omnium

            de necessitate ad caritatem ordinantur. Qui enim continentiam aut
            paupertatem servare proposuit propter Christum, longius ab adulterio
            et furto recessit. Adduntur etiam in religionis statu multae

            observatio adminiculatur ad aliorum observantiam praeceptorum; non
            tamen ordinatur ad ea sicut ad finem: non enim aliquis virginitatem

            sed ut in Dei dilectione proficiat: maiora enim non ordinantur ad
            minora sicut ad finem. Sic igitur patet quod consilia ad vitae
            perfectionem pertinent, non quia in eis principaliter consistat
            perfectio, sed quia sunt via quaedam vel instrumenta ad perfectionem
            caritatis habendam. Unde Augustinus dicit in Lib. de moribus
            Ecclesiae, de vita religiosorum loquens: concupiscentiae domandae et
            dilectioni fratrum retinendae, invigilat omnis intentio. Et ibidem
            dicit: caritas praecipue custoditur, caritati virtus, caritati
            sermo, caritati habitus, caritati vultus aptatur.

            Since charity is not only the end, but also the foundation of all
            virtues and of all the precepts given us for the attainment of
            virtue, it follows that as by means of the Counsels man advances
            towards more perfect love of God and of his neighbour, so likewise
            the more perfect observance of the Counsels is furthered by
            obedience to those Commandments which are necessary to charity. He
            who has the intention of practising continence or poverty for the
            love of Christ is a long way from committing adultery or theft. The
            various exercises of the religious life, such as watching, fasting
            and retirement from worldly affairs, tend furthermore to preserve
            man from vice, and to facilitate his practice of perfect virtue.
            Thus the observance of the Counsels leads to the observance of the
            other Commandments. Of course, we do not mean that keeping the
            Commandments is the end proposed by those who practise the Counsels.
            No one, for instance, embraces virginity in order that he may
            abstain from adultery, or leads a life of poverty as a safeguard
            against theft; but the Counsels are practised as a means of
            advancing in the love of God and of our neighbour. For greater
            things are not made for lesser ones as their end. From all this it
            becomes clear that the Counsels pertain to perfection of life, not
            because perfection necessarily consists in their observance, but
            because they are the way or means to perfection. St. Augustine bears
            this out in <i>De moribus ecclesiae</i>, where he says of the life
            of religious: “Let all our endeavour be to restrain concupiscence,
            and to preserve brotherly love.” Again, in the same work, he writes,
            “Charity is there (in religious life) chiefly cultivated: virtue,
            words, manner, countenance, all are agreeable to charity.”

            Again, in the

            things, and on this account we renounced kinsfolk, country, honours,
            riches and all manner of earthly joy. To gain these virtues we
            undertake fasting, watching, labour and nakedness, and for these we
            practise reading and all other virtues. For we desire to prepare our
            hearts and to keep them pare from defiling thoughts, and by these
            means to rise to the perfection of charity.” Hence we learn that
            obedience to the Commandments may be either perfect or imperfect,
            according as we practise a more or less perfect means of keeping
            them. For we may, as we have shown, practise by means of the
            Counsels perfect obedience to the Commandments; or we may, by living
            in the world without the Counsels, keep them imperfectly.

            Therefore, to teach that a man must first be exercised in keeping
            the Commandments before he passes to the Counsels, is tantamount to
            saying that he must first obey the Commandments imperfectly, rather
            than at once strive to keep them perfectly. This is, of course, an
            absurdity, whether we consider the Commandments themselves or the

            divine precept of charity: “Love the Lord your God with your whole
            heart”? Or need we fear lest we should learn to love God so quickly
            that we shall love Him beyond due measure? “Bless the Lord (says
            Sirach xliii. 30), exalt Him as much so you can, for He is above all
            praise.” And St. Paul says, “So run that you may obtain” (1 Cor. ix.
            24). Again, “Let us hasten, therefore, to enter into that rest”
            (Heb. iv. 11). For with whatever energy a man enters on the road of
            perfection, he will still have much progress to make before he
            arrives at final perfection in his Heavenly home. The argument is
            equally absurd if we consider the means used for attaining to
            perfection. Who would tell a man who aspired to virginity or
            continence that it would be best for him first to live chastely in
            wedlock? Or who would tell a man who wished to practise poverty
            first to live justly in the enjoyment of riches, as if wealth were a
            preparation for poverty rather than an impediment to it? The young
            man who did not accept from our Lord the Counsel of poverty (Mt 19)
            went away sad, because of his possessions.

            We have up to now been observing the connection between the Counsels
            and the precepts of charity, but our arguments hold equally good
            with regard to the other precepts of the Law. For, if the practice
            of the Counsels and the exercises of the Religious life are a
            safeguard against breaking the Commandments, is it not clear that
            some men may need them in order, by their means, to avoid the
            occasions of sin? Should we advise a young man to live among women
            and bad companions, in order that by practising chastity in the
            world he might afterwards observe it in the cloister? Is this virtue
            easier in the world than in the religious life? The same reasoning

            Those who hold the opposite opinion resemble generals, who would
            like to expose their raw recruits to the heat of battle. Those who
            live in the world and keep the Commandments can make greater
            progress in virtue if they become religious. For we must remember
            that if, on the one hand, a secular life spent in obedience to the
            Commandments is a good preparation for the practice of the Counsels,
            yet, on the other hand, a life in the world presents a great
            obstacle to the observance of the Counsels. Hence St. Gregory says
            in the beginning of his
            <i>Morals</i>: “When my conscience was urging me to leave the world,
            many secular cares began to press upon me, as if I were to be
            detained in the world, not from love of its beauty, but by that
            which was more serious, viz. anxiety of mind. But at length,
            escaping eagerly from all such cares, I sought the monastery gate.”

            enim primo inducunt de adolescente cui dominus consilium
            perfectionis dedit, ut puta iam in mandatis exercitato quia dixerat:
            haec omnia servavi a iuventute mea manifestum est, secundum
            Hieronymum, efficaciam non habere: dicit enim super Matth.: mentitur

            et vende omnia quae habes, et da pauperibus, tristis recessit? Et,
            sicut Origenes super Matth. narrat, scriptum est in Evangelio
            secundum Hebraeos, quod cum dominus dixisset ei: vade, et vende
            omnia quae habes, coepit dives scalpere caput suum, et dixit ad eum
            dominus: quomodo dicis, feci legem et prophetas? Scriptum est in
            lege: diliges proximum tuum sicut te ipsum: et ecce multi fratres
            tui filii Abrahae amicti sunt stercore, morientes prae fame; et
            domus tua plena est multis bonis; et non egreditur aliquid omnino ex
            ea ad eos. Itaque dominus redarguens eum, dicit: si vis perfectus
            esse et cetera. Impossibile est enim implere mandatum quod dicit:
            diliges proximum tuum sicut te ipsum, et esse divitem, et maxime
            tantas habere possessiones. Sed haec intelligenda sunt quantum ad
            perfectum modum observantiae huius praecepti. Nihil autem prohibet

            eum non fuisse mentitum, sicut Chrysostomus et alii expositores
            dicunt. Nec tamen quia exercitato aliqualiter in observantia
            mandatorum dominus perfectionis consilium dedit, ideo necessaria
            forma praescribitur ut solis talibus aditus ad consilia pateat: quia
            etiam Matthaeum non exercitatum in praeceptis, sed potius in
            peccatis conversatum, ad consilia sequenda vocavit; ut sic nec
            peccatoribus, nec innocentibus perfectionis viam praecluderet.

            THE arguments adduced in the foregoing chapters facilitate the
            complete refutation of our adversaries’ opinion. Their first
            contention, namely that our Lord gave the Counsel of poverty to one
            who had already practised the keeping of the Commandments, is
            pulverised by St. Jerome. This father, commenting on the words in
            St. Matthew 19, “All these things have I kept from my youth,” says:
            “This young man spoke untruly. For, if he had by his deeds fulfilled
            the command, ‘Love your neighbour as yourself, why should he have
            gone away sad when Christ said to him: ‘Go, sell what you have and
            give to the poor’?” Origen also, writing on the Gospel of St.
            Matthew, says, “ It is related in the Hebrew version of the Gospel
            that when the Lord said to him (the rich young man), ‘Go, sell what
            you have,’ the youth began to hesitate. Then Jesus said to him, ‘How
            then can you say that you have observed the Law and the prophets? It
            is written in the Law: ‘You shall love your neighbour as yourself’;
            and see how many of your brethren, the sons of Abraham, are clothed
            in dung and perish with hunger. Your house is filled with plenty,
            but none of it goes forth to your brethren.’ Then, rebuking him, the
            Lord said: ‘If you would be perfect’ etc. For it is impossible to
            fulfil the commandment to love our neighbour as ourselves if we are
            rich and abounding in possessions.” This remark refers, of course,
            to the perfect observance of the precept of charity; and there is no
            reason why the rich young man may not have kept the Commandments
            imperfectly, and thus not have spoken untruly in his answer to the
            Lore. This is the opinion of St. Chrysostom and of other writers.
            But the fact that Christ gave the Counsel of poverty to one who was,
            even to a certain extent, practised in obedience to the
            Commandments, is no proof that such obedience is a necessary
            preliminary, or the sole preparation, for the exercise of the
            Counsels. St. Matthew was called from habits of sin to the practice
            of the Counsels, thereby showing us that the way of perfection is
            open both to sinners and to innocent souls.

            Their fourth argument, founded on the Gloss on the verse in Psalm
            130, “As a weaned child” etc., to which reference has already been
            made, we will carefully discuss. For, although in itself frivolous,
            it is considered by our adversaries to be very weighty. If we
            examine this passage in the Gloss, we shall see that it refers to
            the spiritual nourishment of recent converts to the Faith. It sets
            forth that “after Baptism we are instructed in good works and
            nourished by the milk of simple teaching until, being somewhat
            grown, we are admitted to our Father’s table.” This means to say
            that we progress from the more simple doctrine “The Word was made
            Flesh,” to the Word of the Father is in the beginning with God.” Now
            these words of the Gloss, evidently refer to the order to be
            observed in instruction.

            Our opponents next adduce, as an argument, that the Church observes
            five seasons in the spiritual generation of her converts. They are
            first initiated, by exorcism and catechism, into the rudiments of
            the Faith. Then they are nourished in the womb of the Church until
            Holy Saturday when, by Baptism, they are born into light. After
            Baptism until Pentecost they are carried in the arms of the Church
            and nourished with her milk; for during that season neither fasting
            nor rising at night nor any other penitential practice is observed.
            After Pentecost, when they have been confirmed by the Holy Spirit,
            catechumens are, so to speak, weaned, and begin to fast and perform
            other laborious exercises. Now this example of the five seasons
            appears to support our adversaries’ argument, but it is fallacious
            in three respects. [First, because there is a difference between
            what is willingly assumed, and what is imposed by necessity.]

            conversi ad fidem sponte propria voluerint manum mittere ad altiora,

            spiritus in Baptismo suscepti statim se arctiori vitae subiiciunt.
            De poenitentibus autem est alia ratio: quia eis a principio

            necessitate eis Ecclesia non imponit, nec tamen prohibet, si ea

            There is a difference between the case of recent converts to the
            Faith who, like babes, require to be nourished, and that of penitent
            sinners who, like sick men, need to be healed. Those newly converted
            to the Faith need not necessarily, in the beginning, have difficult
            tasks laid upon them; they may be first exercised in easier things,
            and then be led on to those that are more laborious. Such men
            resemble children who are fed first on milk, and afterwards on
            stronger food; and it is to those who the Gloss refers. But if
            recent converts should, of their own accord, stretch forth their
            hands to higher things, who shall dare withhold them? In the smile
            used by the Gloss, we see that just as after the solemn Baptism on
            Easter Eve, the Church, for the sake of the sick, grants a certain
            rest from laborious works, so likewise after the solemn Baptism
            which precedes Pentecost, she immediately enjoins fasting, thus
            signifying that some who have in fervour of spirit been received to
            Baptism, subject themselves at once to a stricter life. But with
            penitent sinners the case is otherwise. Severe penance is imposed on
            them at first. This, by degrees, is mitigated; for they are like
            sick persons who, in the beginning of their illness are restricted
            to a strict diet which, when convalescence has set in, is somewhat
            relaxed. Thus, the Church imposes on innocent souls, from the very
            beginning, the burden of the Commandments, which must of necessity
            be kept. She does not lay the Counsels upon them as a necessity, but
            she does not forbid them to undertake their observance, if they have
            the will so to do. Stricter obligations are, however, imposed upon
            penitents, according to the statutes of the Canons of the Early
            Church.

            The second fallacy into which our opponents fall, in the application
            of their argument, is that of saying that in every office or
            profession, transition is made from what is easier to what is more
            difficult. Now it is not necessary that everyone who undertakes an
            important post, should first have served in an inferior capacity.
            Neither is it essential that a man, desiring to practise a trade,
            should already have worked at another trade; but he must ascend from
            the less to the more difficult branches of the trade in which he
            wishes to become proficient. In like manner, it is not essential
            that they who wish to become religious should already have kept the
            Commandments in the world. What is necessary is that, when they
            enter religious life, the easier observances should be imposed upon
            them at first. Again, those who wish to become clerics need not
            first have led the life of laymen, nor need they who wish to live
            continently, have observed continence in married life.

            The third error into which our adversaries fall, arises from the
            fact that there is a twofold difficulty in the work of practising
            the Counsels. The first difficulty arises from the greatness of the
            work itself, which, because it needs the perfection of virtue, is
            not imposed upon the imperfect. The second difficulty lies in the
            restraints imposed. And the more imperfect the persons, the more
            restraint they need. Thus children need closer watching while they
            are under the custody of their tutors, than when they have arrived
            at perfection, Now the religious life, as we have seen, is a certain
            course of discipline restraining men from sin and leading them on to
            perfection. Therefore, they who are the most imperfect, not being
            practised in the observance of the Commandments, stand in the
            greatest need of the safeguards of religious life, which render it
            more easy for them to abstain from sin than if they lived freely in
            the world. The words in the Gloss, “But many, such as heretics and
            schismatics, pervert this order,” are clearly shown, by the context,
            to refer to order of doctrine. For the Gloss continues: “This man
            says indeed that he has kept the Commandments, thus laying himself
            under a curse as if he were humble, not merely in other matters, but
            also in knowledge. For he says, I thought humbly, being at first
            nourished by milk, which is the ‘Word was made flesh,’ in order that
            I might grow to the Bread of Angels, that is, ‘the Word which in the
            beginning was with God.’” And thus he returns to what he said at
            first. By this passage we see that words, intended as a means, have
            been used as an example.

            The next argument brought forward against us is so frivolous that it
            requires no answer. It concerns the five thousand men whom Christ
            fed with five loaves and the four thousand among whom seven loaves
            were distributed. It is not necessary that the order of things
            typified should correspond with the order of their types, for we
            often see that later things are prefigured by earlier ones, and
            <i>e converso</i>. Neither can any valid argument be drawn from
            symbolical things of this nature, as St. Augustine says in his
            <i>Epistle against the Donatists</i>. Dionysius likewise writes in
            his <i>Epistle to Titus</i> that allegorical theology is not
            argumentative. We will, notwithstanding, observe that by this order
            of miracles is typified the order of precepts and counsels, in so
            far as regards the whole human race. The Counsels were given not in
            the old Law but in the new; for, the Law brought nothing to
            perfection. The Gloss points this out by saying that the five loaves
            signify the legal precepts, and that the seven loaves are symbolical
            of evangelical perfection. But this is no reason why the same men
            should be exercised first in the precepts of the Law, and then in
            the Counsels in the religious life; for we do not read that the same
            individuals were first among the seven thousand, and that they then
            formed part of the four thousand who were miraculously fed by Jesus
            Christ.

            things of which the Gospel is composed, is not relevant to the
            question we are discussing. For the perfection proposed as an
            example does not refer to the Counsels, but to virtuous acts or the
            perfect way of keeping the Commandments as Christ kept them. Hence
            the Gloss goes on to quote other examples, e.g., “Learn of Me, for I
            am meek” etc., and elsewhere, “Be perfect as your Heavenly Father is

            We must examine with greater care the seventh argument, as it is one
            that our opponents are fond of using. It concerns the order to be
            observed between the active and the contemplative life. It is
            perfectly true that the active ought to precede the contemplative
            life, but the meaning of the active life is not always understood.
            It is sometimes thought that the active life consists merely in the
            management of temporal affairs; and therefore, as religious possess
            nothing, either individually or in common, they are believed to be
            incapable of sharing in the active life. St. Gregory, in the second
            part of
            <i>the second homily on Ezekiel</i>, points out that this view is a
            mistaken one. “The active life,” he says, “consists in giving bread
            the hungry, instructing the ignorant, correcting those who err,
            recalling the proud to humility, caring for the sick, distributing
            to each one what is needful to him, and in seeing how each one may
            be maintained by those things that an entrusted to us.” Thus we see
            that the active life regards not merely temporal matters, but also
            the guidance and correction of others in spiritual concerns, and
            that for such duties those men are the best fitted who own no
            worldly possessions. Consequently, when our Lord appointed the
            Apostles to be the teachers of the whole earth, He stripped them of
            their property (Matt. 10).

            Est autem quaerendum ulterius utrum exercitium moralium virtutum

            contemplativam: cui etiam Augustinus attestatur 12 de Trin.; ubi
            rationem inferiorem, quae temporalia dispensat sive ad se sive ad
            alium pertinentia, deputat actioni; superiorem vero rationem, quae

            habito, in promptu est ratio quare vita activa praecedat
            contemplativam: quia nisi homo per virtutes morales habeat animam a
            passionibus depuratam, quod pertinet ad vitam activam, non est
            idoneus ad divinam veritatem contemplandam, secundum illud Matth. V,
            8: beati mundo corde, quoniam ipsi Deum videbunt, et hic imperfecta,
            et in futuro contemplatione perfecta. Sic igitur exercitium vitae
            activae non solum est in saecularibus, sed etiam in religiosis.
          </td>
          <td>
            We may further enquire whether the exercise of the moral virtues
            pertains to the active life. Aristotle (<i>X Ethic.</i>) answers
            this question in the affirmative, and adds that the intellectual
            virtues belong to the contemplative life. St. Augustine confirms
            this opinion in <i>XII De Trinit.</i>, where he ascribes the
            inferior reason, which is exercised about temporal matters
            concerning either ourselves or others, to action, and the superior
            reason, which is occupied with eternal interests, to contemplation.
            In accordance with this view, it is quite reasonable to hold that
            the active must precede the contemplative life. For, unless a man
            has, by the exercise of the moral virtues, freed his soul from
            passion (which it is the business of the active life to do), he will
            not be fit for the contemplation of divine truth. “Blessed are the
            clean of heart,” says Christ, “for they shall see God” (Mt 5:8).
            They shall see Him here by imperfect contemplation, and hereafter by
            what is perfect. Thus the exercise of the active life pertains not
            only to laymen, but to religious also.

            Three reasons go to prove that this is the case. First, because by
            the exercise of the moral virtues the passions are restrained.
            Secondly, because religious can show mercy to others by teaching and
            correcting, or by visiting the sick and comforting the sorrowful, be
            they seculars or religious of their own monastery. Thus they can
            verify the words of St. James (1:27), “Religion clean and undefiled
            before God and the Father is this: to visit the fatherless and the
            widow in their tribulation, and to keep one’s self unspotted from
            this world.” The third reason why religious share with seculars in
            the active life is because, at their entry into religion, they
            distributed their worldly possessions to the poor. It is not,
            therefore, because the precepts belong only to the active life that
            the Gloss says that the Commandments are the duty of the active, and
            the Counsels of the contemplative life. St. Gregory writes: “To live
            a contemplative life is to bear in mind with all diligence, charity
            to God and to our neighbour, which are the great precepts of the
            Law. The Counsels dispose the soul more particularly to the
            contemplative life. For without them, the mere observance of the
            Precepts will not suffice for contemplation, which requires greater
            perfection.” No one need remain in the world for the sake of leading
            an active life; for in religion he can have quite as much exercise
            in the active life as is necessary to dispose him for the
            contemplative.

            The eighth argument, viz. that “no one arrives at once at the
            highest point,” is not much to the purpose, although great stress is
            laid upon it. For we may consider the highest and the lowest either
            as referring to the same condition and to the same man, or to
            different conditions and different men. If we consider these degrees
            as referring to the same condition and the same man, it is quite

            virtuous man is, during the whole course of his life, making
            progress towards perfection. But if these degrees are considered
            with regard to different conditions, there is no reason why a man
            should not fill the highest post without having served in an
            inferior capacity. It is not necessary for a cleric to have lived as
            a layman; for some men are admitted in their boyhood into the ranks
            of the clergy. Neither is the saying that no one reaches the highest
            point at once true, if we consider it as referring to different
            people; for one man may start from a degree of holiness far higher
            than that to which another will attain throughout the whole course
            of his life. St. Gregory says (<i>Dialog. 11</i>): “in order that
            all his contemporaries and all succeeding generations might know to
            what a height of perfection the child Benedict had arrived, when he
            received the grace of conversion.”

            The ninth argument, viz. that “damp walls cannot bear a roof,” and
            the tenth that “he courts a fall who tries to climb a steep ascent
            without steps,” are both irrelevant to our subject. The authorities
            from whom these passages are drawn use these examples in speaking of
            the dignity of the episcopal state, which requires mature virtue and
            is, therefore, not to be conferred on those who are imperfect. But
            the Counsels are aids to perfection and safeguards from sin. Hence
            we may speak of them as serving to dry the moisture from newly
            erected walls, and as sure steps whereby the summit of perfection
            may be reached.

            The eleventh argument used against us deals with the natural
            priority of the Commandments to the Counsels. Reference to what we
            have already said will show how much weight such an argument
            carries. If we speak of the final precepts, viz. the love of God and
            of our neighbour, it is clear that the Counsels are directed towards
            these precepts as to their end. The relation between the Counsels
            and these precepts is that which exists between things ordained for
            a certain end, and the end for which they are ordained. Now an end
            is the first thing, if we consider it with reference to the
            intention; but it is the last if we consider it with regard to the
            prosecution or consummation. If then the Counsels were so ordained
            with reference to the Commandments that unless the Counsels were
            practised the Commandments could not be observed, it would follow
            that man is bound to observe the Counsels before loving God or his
            neighbour. Such, of course, is not the case. But if the relations
            between the Counsels and the Precepts be in such wise that by means
            of the Counsels, the Precepts can be more easily and more perfectly
            kept, it follows that by means of the Counsels we can attain to the
            perfect love of God and of our neighbour. Hence we see that,
            although in intention this precept precedes the counsels, yet in
            prosecution the counsels precede this precept.

            If we consider the relations between the Counsels and the other
            Precepts which are given as means to the love of God and our
            neighbour, we shall see that these relations are of a twofold
            nature. For, as the Counsels cannot be observed without the
            Precepts, and as the Precepts are kept by many without the Counsels,
            the Counsels can be compared to the Precepts if they be considered
            generally. Thus the relations between the Counsels and the Precepts
            would be that of particular to general. The particular will precede
            the general, not necessarily in order of time, but in order of
            nature. Therefore it is not essential to be exercised in obedience
            to the Precepts before passing to the observance of the Counsels.
            But another relation may be observed between the Counsels and the
            Precepts, which can be observed without the counsels. In this
            relation the counsels may be compared to the precepts as a perfect
            to an imperfect species, e.g. as a rational to an irrational animal.
            In this relation, the Counsels precede the precepts in the order of
            nature, for in every genus the perfect is naturally first. As
            Boethius says, “nature begins from the perfect.” It does not matter
            that in this relation the precepts precede the counsels in point of
            time, for a thing of an imperfect species may, in point of time, be
            prior to the thing of a perfect species to which it passes. What is
            essential is that an imperfect thing should pass to a perfect one of
            its own species.

            means of the Counsels the Precepts can be more perfectly obeyed.

            WE will proceed to consider whether it is necessary for one who
            desires to become a religious to take the advice of many
            counsellors. It is urged that advice should be sought from many
            persons before taking a difficult step affecting one’s whole life;
            and, as nothing can be conceived more difficult than to renounce
            oneself, leave the world, and spend one’s whole life in religion, it
            must be necessary to take much advice and to spend a long time in
            reflection. This argument is based on the definition of a vow. A vow
            is said to be the promise of a better good, made with grave
            deliberation. The stringency of the vow depends upon the
            deliberation. No vow is so binding as the religious vows, which
            nothing can annul. Therefore, the religious vows require the gravest
            deliberation.

            Those who hold this opinion seek to confirm it by these words, “Do

            are of God” (1 John 4:1). This text applies to entrance into
            religion. St. Benedict, in his Rule, and Pope Innocent, in his
            Decretal, quote it in this sense. But the “ trying,” of which St.
            John speaks, requires careful examination, and this examination
            (they conclude) is best made in consultation with many. Therefore,
            he who desires to enter religion should take counsel of many.

            intrare.

            Those who think thus, further add that counsel is most needed before
            taking a step wherein there is the greatest danger of being
            deceived. There is great danger of deception on entering religious
            life, since “Satan transforms himself into an angel of light” (2
            Cor. ix. 14) and, under an appearance of good, misleads the unwary.
            Therefore it is only after grave deliberation that a man should
            enter on the religious life. Again, it is alleged that peculiarly
            diligent examination is required before undertaking anything that
            may come to a bad end. Now as we see in the case of apostates and
            despairing souls, entrance into religious life has often ended
            badly. Consequently, this step requires grave consideration. A last
            argument remains, and it is considered a very weighty one. In the
            Acts of the Apostles (v. 39) the following words occur: “If this
            counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought,” Now the
            counsel of entering religion has often come to nought by apostasy.
            Therefore, it was not from God. Hence much deliberation with many
            people is necessary before taking such a step.

            Deinde sequitur de Iacobo et Ioanne, qui vocati a domino statim
            relictis retibus et patre secuti sunt eum. Et, sicut Hilarius dicit
            super Matth.: eis artem et patriam domum relinquentibus, docemur

            IN order to demonstrate the fallacy of the foregoing arguments, we
            will first consider the case of St. Peter and St. Andrew, who, as
            soon as our Lord called them, “leaving their nets, followed him”
            (Matt. 4). St. Chrysostom pronounces the following eulogium of them:
            “They were in the midst of their business; but, at His bidding, they
            made no delay, they did not return home saying: ‘let us consult our
            friends, but, leaving all things, they followed, Him, as Elisha
            followed Elijah. A similar unhesitating and instant obedience does
            Christ require of us.” Then, we have the example of St. James and
            St. John who, being called by God, immediately left their nets and
            their father and followed Him. St. Hilary, in his Commentary on St.
            Matthew’s Gospel, says: “ we are taught by their example in
            abandoning their trade and their father’s house, to follow Jesus and
            to be withheld neither by worldly anxieties nor by the ties of
            domestic life.”

            hoc communicare. Humana etiam pericula, quae ei a principibus
            accidere poterant, parvipendit, dum rationes officii sui imperfectas
            reliquit, ut Remigius dicit ibidem. Ex quo evidenter accipitur quod
            nihil humanum nos debet retardare a servitio Dei. Rursus Matth.
            VIII, 21, et Luc. IX, 59, legitur, quod quidam discipulus Christi
            dixit ad eum: domine, permitte me ire primum et sepelire patrem
            meum; cui dominus respondit: sequere me, et dimitte mortuos sepelire
            mortuos suos. Quod exponens Chrysostomus super Matth. dicit: hoc
            dixit non iubens contemnere honorem qui est ad parentes; sed
            monstrans quoniam nihil caelestibus negotiis nobis magis necessarium
            esse oportet; et quoniam cum toto studio his iungi debemus, et neque
            parum tardare, etiam si valde inevitabilia et incitantia fuerint
            quae attrahunt. Quid enim magis necessarium quam sepelire patrem?
            Quid etiam facilius? Neque enim multum tempus consumendum erat. Sed
            Diabolus instat attentius volens aliquem aditum invenire; et si
            modicam sumat negligentiam, magnam operatur pusillanimitatem.
            Propter quod sapiens admonet dicens: ne differas de die in diem.
            Nihil igitur aliud inde docemur, nisi quod nec minimum temporis
            frustra ducere decet, et si mille cogentia sint, immo praeferre
            spiritualia cunctis, et admodum necessariis. Et Augustinus dicit in
            Lib. de verbis domini: honorandus est pater, sed obediendum est Deo.
            Ego, inquit, ad Evangelium te voco, ad aliud opus mihi necessarius
            es. Maius est hoc quam quod vis facere: sunt alii qui sepeliant
            mortuos suos; non licet anteriora posterioribus subdere. Amate
            parentes, et praeponite Deum parentibus. Si ergo propter rem tam
            necessariam dominus etiam modici temporis inducias petentem
            redarguit; qua fronte diutinam deliberationem quidam asserunt
            praemittendam esse Christi consiliis?

            Again, we read of St. Matthew (Mt 9) that, at the call of the Lord
            he “arose and followed Him.” St. Chrysostom comments: “See the
            obedience of this man thus called. He neither refuses to obey, nor
            begs that he may go home to acquaint his kinsfolk of his departure.”
            And Remigius also observes of St. Matthew that he made no account of
            the dangers which he might incur from the anger of the magistrates,
            when he left their business unfinished. Thus, it becomes plain that
            nothing human ought to deter us from the service of God. We read in
            the Gospel of St. Matthew (8:21), and again in that of Luke (9:59)
            that “one of His disciples said to Him: ‘Lord, let me first go and
            bury my father.’ But Jesus said to him: ‘Follow me, and let the dead
            bury their dead.’” St. Chrysostom, writing on these words, says:
            “Christ spoke thus, not as contemning the love which we owe to our
            parents, but to show us that nothing ought to seem more necessary to
            us than the affairs of the Kingdom of Heaven. He would teach us that
            with our whole heart, we ought to attach ourselves to them, letting
            nothing, however important or attractive, to be an obstacle in our
            way. What would seem more necessary than to bury one’s father? What
            more easy? It would not have taken much time. But the devil is
            always on the alert to find some unguarded door, and if he perceive
            a slight negligence, he will cause it to become great cowardice.
            Therefore the wise man says: Defer not, from day to day. By these
            words he warns us not to waste a moment of time and, although
            numberless affairs may be pressing upon us, to prefer spiritual
            interests to all other things, even to such as are necessary.” St.
            Augustine says in <i>De verbis Domini</i>: “Your father is to be
            honoured, yes, but God must be obeyed. Christ says, ‘I call you to
            preach the Gospel. You are necessary to me for my task. My work is
            greater than is that which you desire to perform. There are others
            who can bury the dead. The first thing must not give place to the
            last. Love your parents, but prefer God to them.’” If then our Lord
            refused to grant His disciple a short time in which to perform so
            necessary a duty, how great is the presumption of those who teach
            that lengthy deliberation is necessary before embracing the
            Counsels?

            Luke (9:61) tells us that “ another said: I will follow you, Lord,
            but let me first take my leave of those who are at my house.” St.
            Cyril, the great Greek doctor, comments: “This man’s promise is
            admirable and worthy of imitation. But by his desire of going to
            take leave of those who were in his house, he showed that he was
            somewhat wavering in his attachment to the Lord, although in his
            mind he had determined to follow him. The fact of his wishing to
            take counsel of his kinsfolk, who would not approve of his
            intention, shows that he was somewhat unstable; and therefore Christ
            rebuked him saying: ‘No man putting his hand to the plough and
            looking back, is fit for the Kingdom of God.’ He had put his hand to
            the plough by his eagerness to follow our Lord, but he looked back,
            seeking an occasion of delay by visiting his home and conversing
            with his kinsmen. Not thus did the holy Apostles act, who at once
            left their boats and their father, and followed Christ. Neither did
            St. Paul condescend to flesh and blood. Such ought to be the conduct
            of those who desire to follow our Lord.”

            St. Augustine, in <i>De verbis Domini</i>, has this passage: “The
            Orient calls you; will you wait for the West?” Now by the
            <i>Orient</i> is meant Christ, as we know from the words in Zach.
            6:12: “Behold a man, the Orient is his name.” By the <i>West</i> is
            signified man declining to the grave and liable to fall into the
            darkness of sin and ignorance. He, therefore, does an injury to
            Christ, in whom are contained all the treasures and the wisdom of
            God” (Col 2:3), who, having heard His call, thinks it necessary to
            take counsel with mortal man. Our opponents try to evade this
            argument by an equivocation. They say that the passages quoted by us
            only refer to the audible call of the Lord, and, of course, in that
            case no delay must be made nor human counsel asked. But if a man is
            interiorly called to enter religion, he needs long deliberation and
            many advisers, in order to find out whether his vocation is from
            God. This is begging the question; for we are to take the words of
            Christ, written in Scripture, as coming from His own mouth. For He
            Himself says: “What I say to you, I say unto all, Watch” (Mark
            13:37). And in the Epistle of St. Paul to the Romans 15:4, we find
            “For whatever was written, was written for our instruction.” As St.
            Chrysostom says: “If these things had only been said for them, they
            would not have been written, but they were said for them, and
            written for us.” And St. Paul brings forward the authority of the
            Old Testament in his Epistle to the Hebrews (xii. 5), “And you have
            forgotten the consolation which speaks to you as children: My son,
            do not neglect the discipline of the Lord.” From which it is clear
            that the words of Holy Scripture were spoken not only to those who
            heard them, but to future generations.

            Specialiter autem videamus, an consilium quod dominus dedit
            adolescenti, Matth. XIX, 21: si vis perfectus esse, vade, et vende
            omnia quae habes, et da pauperibus: utrum illi soli sit datum, vel
            etiam universis: quod considerare possumus ex his quae sequuntur.
            Cum enim Petrus ei dixisset: ecce nos reliquimus omnia et secuti
            sumus te: universaliter praemium omnibus statuit, dicens: omnis qui
            reliquerit domum vel fratres etc. propter nomen meum, centuplum
            accipiet, et vitam aeternam possidebit. Non minus ergo sequendum est
            hoc consilium ab unoquoque, quam si unicuique singulariter ex ipsius
            ore dominico proferretur. Unde Hieronymus dicit ad Paulinum
            presbyterum: tu audita sententia salvatoris: si vis perfectus esse
            etc., verba vertis in opera et nudam crucem nudus sequeris. Quamvis
            autem adolescenti loquens, singulariter ad ipsum verba protulerit,
            alibi tamen idem consilium universaliter protulit dicens: si quis
            vult post me venire, abneget semetipsum, et tollat crucem suam, et
            sequatur me: ubi dicit Chrysostomus: commune hoc dogma orbi terrarum
            proponit dicens: si quis vult, id est si mulier, si vir, si rex, si
            liber, si servus. Abnegatio autem sui ipsius, secundum Basilium, est
            totalis praeteritorum oblivio, et recessus a propriis voluntatibus.
            Et sic patet quod in hac negatione sui ipsius intelligitur etiam
            depositio divitiarum, quae per voluntatem propriam possidentur. Sic
            igitur consilium adolescenti a domino datum, sic est accipiendum ac
            si omnibus ex ore domini proponeretur.

            We, will especially examine whether the counsel given by Christ to
            the young man (Matt. 19:21): “If you would be perfect, go, sell all
            that you have, and give to the poor” was addressed to that youth
            only, or to all men. We can best consider this passage by referring
            to its context, where Peter says: “See, we have left all things and
            have followed You.” And our Lord promises the reward to all men
            saying, “Everyone who has left house or brethren etc. for my name’s
            sake... shall receive a hundredfold and shall possess life
            everlasting.” Thus we see that this counsel is no less to be
            followed by all men than if it had been given to each individually.
            Hence St. Jerome, writing to the presbyter Paulinus, says: “You have
            heard our Saviour’s words: ‘If you would be perfect, go, sell what
            you have and give to the poor, and come, follow me.’ Put these words
            then into practice. Strip yourself of all, and thus, following the
            Cross of poverty, you will more speedily and more easily ascend
            Jacob’s ladder.” And, although our Lord addressed the counsel of
            poverty individually to the rich young man, He nevertheless gave the
            same advice to all mankind (Mt 16:24): “If anyone will come after
            Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.” St.
            Chrysostom, commenting on this text, says, “He addresses this
            teaching to the whole world, saying, ‘If anyone’—be it man or woman,
            king, free man, or serf.” Now self-denial, according to St. Basil,
            means complete forgetfulness of past things and the abnegation of
            our own will. In it, therefore, is included the disposal of the
            property which we possess of our own will. Therefore the counsel
            given to the young man is to be understood as given to all.

            Sed in responsione praemissa adhuc aliud considerari oportet. Iam

            Scripturis, idem habet auctoritatis pondus, ac si verba ab ipso
            salvatoris ore proferrentur. Est autem et alius modus quo Deus
            interius homini loquitur; secundum illud Ps.: audiam quid loquatur
            in me dominus Deus: quae quidem locutio cuilibet exteriori locutioni
            praeponitur. Dicit enim Gregorius in Homil. Pentecostes: ipse
            conditor, non ad eruditionem hominis loquitur, si eidem homini per
            unctionem spiritus non loquatur. Certe Cain priusquam fratricidium
            opere perpetraret, audivit: peccasti, quiesce. Sed quia culpis suis
            exigentibus voce est admonitus, non unctione, audire verba Dei
            potuit, sed servare contempsit. Si igitur voci conditoris exterius
            prolatae statim obediendum esset, ut dicunt, multo magis interiori
            locutioni, qua spiritus sanctus mentem immutat, resistere nullus
            debet, sed absque dubitatione obedire. Unde Isai. l, 5, dicitur ex
            ore prophetae, vel potius ipsius Christi: dominus Deus aperuit mihi
            aurem, scilicet interius inspirando; ego autem non contradico,
            retrorsum non abii, quasi posteriorum oblitus ad anteriora me
            extendens, ut dicitur ad Philip. III. Dicit etiam apostolus ad Rom.
            VIII 14: qui spiritu Dei aguntur, hi filii Dei sunt: ubi dicit
            Glossa Augustini: non quia nihil agant, sed quia impetu gratiae
            aguntur. Non autem agitur impetu spiritus sancti qui resistit vel
            tardat.

            But another point remains to be considered. We have already said
            that the words of our Lord quoted in Holy Scripture, carry the same
            weight as if spoken by His own lips. But there is another way
            whereby God speaks interiorly to men, viz. the way alluded to in Ps.
            84:9: “I will hear what the Lord God will speak in me.” Now this
            interior voice is to be preferred to any external speech. St.
            Gregory says (<i>Homil. Pentecostes</i>), “The Creator does not
            speak to the understanding of a man, unless He speak to that same
            man by the unction of the Holy Spirit. Before Cain slew his brother
            he heard a voice saying, “You have sinned; stop.” But as, on account
            of his sin, he was admonished by a voice alone, and not by the
            unction of the Spirit, he was indeed able to hear the word of God,
            but refused to obey it.” If then we are bound to obey immediately
            the audible voice of our Creator, how much more ought we not,
            unhesitatingly and unresistingly, to obey the interior whisper,
            whereby the Holy Spirit changes the heart of man. Hence, in Is 50:5,
            it is said by the mouth of the Prophet, or rather of Christ Himself:
            “The Lord God has opened my ear (i.e. by interior inspiration), and
            I do not resist. I have not gone back.” “Forgetting the things that
            are behind, and stretching forth myself to those that are before,”
            as we read in the Epistle to the Philippians (3:13). St. Paul,
            again, says (Rom 8:14), “Whoever are led by the Spirit of God, they
            are the sons of God.” The Gloss of St. Augustine has the following
            comment: “Such men do not perform anything, but act under the
            impulse of grace.” But he who resists or hesitates, does not act by
            the impulse of the Holy Spirit.

            It is then the distinguishing mark of the sons of to be carried
            forward by grace to better things, without waiting for counsel. This
            impulse of grace is alluded to in the Prophet Isaiah (59:59), “When
            he comes as a violent stream, which the spirit of the Lord drives
            on.” St. Paul teaches us that this impulse of grace is to be obeyed:
            “Walk in the Spirit” (Gal 5:16), and again (5:25), “If you are led
            by the Spirit, you are not under the law.” St. Stephen thus
            reproached certain men, “You always resist the Holy Spirit (Acts
            7:51). St. Paul says (1 Thes 5:19), “Do not extinguish the Spirit.”
            On which words, the Gloss comments: “If the Holy Spirit should at
            any time reveal something to a certain man, do not forbid him to
            make known what he has heard.” Now, the Holy Spirit gives His
            revelations not only by teaching man what he ought to speak, but by
            suggesting to him what he ought to do (John 14). When, therefore, a
            man is inspired by this Holy Spirit to enter religious life, it is
            his duty to follow the inspiration at once, without waiting to take
            counsel of human advisers. This is shown us by the words of the
            Prophet Ezekiel (1:20), “Wherever the spirit went, they went, and
            the wheels rose along with them.”

            Nec solum hoc Scripturae auctoritatibus, sed etiam sanctorum
            exemplis manifestatur. Narrat enim Augustinus in 8 Conf. de duobus

            sancto, ait amico suo: ego Deo servire studui, et ex hac hora in hoc

            se socio adhaerere, et ambo iam aedificabantur relinquendo omnia et
            Christum sequendo. In quo etiam libro Augustinus se ipsum
            reprehendit de hoc quod tardabat suam conversionem, ubi dicit: non
            erat quid responderem veritate convictus, nisi tantum verba lenta et
            somnolenta, modo, ecce modo, sine paululum. Sed modo et modo non
            habebat modum, et sine paululum in longum ibat. Et in eodem libro

            et carnalium, adhuc audiebam, et cunctabundus pendebam. Non est ergo
            laudabile, sed magis vituperabile, post vocationem interiorem vel
            exteriorem, vel verbo vel Scripturis factam differre, et quasi in
            dubiis consilium quaerere.

            We have further authority for our teaching, not merely in passages
            of Scripture, but in the examples of the Saints. St. Augustine, in
            the Eighth Book of his Confessions, tells us of two soldiers, one of
            whom, having read the life of St. Anthony, was so filled with Divine
            love, that he said to his, comrade: “I have determined to serve God,
            I begin at this hour and in this spot. If it is irksome for you to
            imitate me, at least do not withstand me.” But his comrade answered
            that he would stand by him in a combat which would bring so great
            reward.” Thus (O Lord) did both these servants of yours build up a
            tower at a befitting cost, by leaving all things and following you.”
            In the same book, St. Augustine reproaches himself with having
            delayed his conversion: “When I was convinced of the truth, I could
            not reply except in slow and drowsy words: ‘I am coming now; let me
            be a while longer.’ But my promised time had no limit, and my
            ‘little while’ was long protracted.” Again in the same book he says,
            “I was filled with shame for listening to the babble of worldly and
            carnal concerns, and hung wavering.” Thus, we see that, far from
            being praiseworthy, it is most reprehensible to hesitate or take
            counsel, as if we were in doubt, when we have heard an interior or
            exterior call, be it some word or some passage in Scripture.

            Hoc etiam ad interioris inspirationis efficaciam pertinet ut homines
            inspirati subito ad maiora provehantur: quod significatur per hoc
            quod congregatis in unum discipulis, ut legitur Act. II, repente
            spiritus sanctus super eos veniens eos fecit magnalia Dei loqui: ubi
            dicit Glossa: nescit tarda molimina spiritus sancti gratia. Et

            quod habetur Ioh. VI 45: omnis qui audivit (a patre) et didicit,
            venit ad me. Valde (inquit) remota est a sensibus carnis haec
            schola, in qua pater auditur, et docet, ut veniatur ad filium: nec
            agit hoc cum carnis aure, sed cordis; et postea subdit: itaque
            gratia quae occulte humanis cordibus divina largitate tribuitur, a
            nullo corde duro respuitur: ideo quippe tribuitur ut cordis duritia
            penitus auferatur. Hanc etiam efficaciam inspirationis internae
            Gregorius in homilia Pentecostes commendat dicens: o qualis est
            artifex iste spiritus. Nulla ad discendum mora agitur in omne quod
            voluerit; mox ut tetigerit mentem docet; solumque tetigisse docuisse
            est. Nam humanum animum subito ut illustrat immutat; abnegat hoc
            repente quod erat, exhibet repente quod non erat. Virtutem igitur
            spiritus sancti vel ignorat vel ei resistere nititur qui a spiritu
            sancto motum diuturnitate consilii detinere contendit.

            Interior inspiration has efficacy to enable those to whom it is
            given to accomplish great deeds. We read in the Acts of the Apostles
            that when the disciples were gathered together, the Holy Spirit came
            upon them and made them speak of the wonders of God. The Gloss says
            on this passage: “The grace of the Holy Spirit of God knows no
            obstacles.” Again, the Book of Sirach (11:23) has these words: “It
            is easy in the eyes of God suddenly to make a poor man rich.” St.
            Augustine speaks of the efficacy of internal inspiration in his book
            <i>De praedestinatione Sanctorum</i>. He quotes the words recorded
            in St. John (6), “Everyone who has heard of the Father and has
            learned, comes to Me.” On these words he says, “This school where
            the Father is heard and teaches, in order that men may come to the
            Son, is far removed from the senses; for in it we hear not with ears
            of flesh, but with the hearing of the heart.” Again he says: “The
            grace which, by the Divine munificence, is secretly bestowed is not
            rejected by any hard heart; for it is given in order that hardness
            may be entirely taken away.” St. Gregory, in his
            <i>Homilia Pentecostes</i>, treats of the efficacy of interior
            inspiration: “Oh, how cunning a workman is this Spirit. He makes no
            delay in teaching what He wishes. As soon as He touches the heart,
            He teaches it. His touch is teaching. He changes the human mind as
            soon as He enlightens it; and the man taught by Him at once forsakes
            what he was, in order to show what he was not.” He who hesitates to
            obey the impulse of the Holy Spirit for the sake of taking counsel
            either knows not this impulse, or else resists it.

            what is the principle of movement in the soul corresponding to God
            in the universe, we shall see that reason cannot be the principle of
            reason; that principle must be something better. But what, save God,
            can be better than knowledge and understanding?” He continues, in
            another place: “Those who are moved by God do not need to be
            counselled; for they have a principle surpassing counsel and
            understanding.” Shame then on him who, calling himself a Catholic,
            would send men inspired by God, to take advice of human counsellors,
            of whom even a heathen philosopher tells us they have no need.

            But, let us further examine for what cause, those called by God to
            religious life can require counsel. First, it is sacrilegious to
            doubt whether the life counselled by Christ is the most perfect.
            Again, none but a soul enslaved by human love would hesitate as to
            whether it is right to abandon the intention of entering religious
            life for fear of grieving friends or incurring temporal loss. St.
            Jerome writes in his epistle to Heliodorus: “Even should your infant
            son hang round your neck, or your mother, with unkempt hair and
            dishevelled dress, show you the breasts that suckled you, or your
            father cast himself along your threshold, pass on. Shed no tear;
            tread your father underfoot and hasten to the standard of the Cross.
            In this case, cruelty is the only piety.” Elsewhere he adds, “My
            enemy, with drawn sword, is about to slay me, and shall I think of
            my mother’s tears? Shall I forsake the combat for love of my father,
            when I ought not to leave Christ even to bury my parents? In several
            places he writes in the same strain.

            But perhaps some may think it necessary to take counsel, lest they
            should not be able to fulfil what is implied in entering religious
            life. The same doubt occurred to St. Augustine, as he tells us in
            the Eighth Book of his Confessions. He feared to undertake to
            observe the counsel of continence; and, speaking of himself, he uses
            these words: “On the side to which I turned my face, and where I
            feared to go, I saw the chaste dignity of continence. She was serene
            and cheerful, without wantonness. She beckoned me to approach her
            fearlessly, holding out to embrace me and uphold me, her gentle
            hands full of numberless good examples. With her were many youths
            and maidens, staid widows and venerable virgins.” He adds later on:
            “And she smiled at me, mocking, as if to say, ‘What these have done,
            can you not likewise do? Have these acted by their own might, and
            not by the power of their God? The Lord their God has given me to
            them. Why then do you stand on your own, without a foothold? Cast
            yourself on Him. Fear not. He will not draw away to let you fall.
            Cast yourself on Him with confidence. He will receive you and heal
            you.”

            There are, nevertheless, two points on which those may take counsel
            who have the intention of entering religious life. Of these, one is
            the mode of becoming a religious; and the other is the existence of
            any obstacle to religious life, such as matrimony or the state of
            slavery. But advice should not be sought from kinsfolk. The book of
            Proverbs (25:9) says indeed, “Treat your cause with your friend, and
            discover not the secret to a stranger.” But, in the matter of
            entering religion, relations are not friends, but rather enemies. “A
            man’s enemies are those of his own household,” says Micah (7:6), and
            our Lord quotes his words (Mt 10:36). Therefore, with regard to this
            matter, the advice of our kinsmen is to be particularly avoided.

            St. Jerome, in his epistle to Heliodorus, thus enumerates the
            obstacles which family ties may raise to entrance into religious
            life. “Your widowed sister will encircle you with her arms. The
            domestic slaves, among whom you grew up, will cry to you, ‘To whose
            service do you leave us?’ The aged nurse and the foster-father, who
            in fondness has been a second father to you, after your own, will
            call out: ‘Stay a little; we shall soon be dead; wait and bury us.’”
            St. Gregory likewise says (<i>III Moral.</i>): “Our crafty enemy,
            seeing himself banished from the hearts of good men, seeks out those
            by whom they are loved. He speaks by means of their caressing words,
            knowing that they are more loved than others. He hopes that as the
            violence of love overcomes their heart, he may easily destroy the
            fortifications of their virtue by means of the sword of persuasion.”
            For this reason it was that the Blessed Benedict, as St. Gregory
            tells us (<i>II Dialog.</i>), secretly fled from his nurse, and
            sought retirement in a desert place, but opened his mind to the monk
            Romanus, who kept his secret, and gave him assistance. Carnal men,
            to whom the wisdom of God is folly, are therefore not to be
            consulted. The following advice is given us in the Book of Sirach
            (37:12), “Do not consult a man without religion concerning holiness,
            nor with an unjust man concerning justice.” The same inspired writer
            adds: “Give no heed to these in any matter of counsel. But be
            continually with a holy man,” from whom. counsel may be sought if
            any should be needed.

            IT is easy to answer the objections which may be raised against our
            arguments. It is true, in the first place that advice should be
            sought in difficult and serious undertakings, when the way is not
            clear. When, however, the right path has been shown us by some
            higher counsellor, it is unwise to open the question again and to
            seek further advice.

            Quod vero secundo propositum est, quod votum animi deliberatione
            firmatur, ad propositum non facit. Haec enim deliberatio in
            interiori consistit proposito, quo aliquis eligit maius bonum cui se
            obligare intendit vovendo. Omne autem quod ex electione agitur, ex
            deliberatione sive consilio agitur; quia electio est appetitus
            praeconsiliati, ut dicitur in 3 Ethic. Et sicut a spiritu sancto,
            qui est spiritus fortitudinis et pietatis, hoc propositum homini

            The second argument adduced, that a vow is confirmed by the
            deliberation of the mind, is irrelevant to the matter in hand. For
            the deliberation spoken of consists in that choice, whereby a man
            elects the greater good to which he intends to devote himself. Now
            all that is done from choice, is done by deliberation or counsel;
            for choice is the desire for a thing commended to us, as Aristotle
            says (<i>III Ethic.</i>). The same Holy Spirit who is the spirit of
            strength and piety, and who moves men to a determination of
            embracing the religious life, is likewise the spirit of counsel and
            of knowledge, and directs their interior deliberation.

            The third objection brought against us is equally irrelevant. “Try
            the spirits whether they be of God,” (1 John 4:1) we are told. But
            probation is only necessary where certainty does not exist. The
            Gloss comments on the words of St. John, which we have quoted:
            “Things that are certain need no discussion.” Nevertheless, those
            whose duty it is to admit others into religious life may be
            uncertain of the motive which may lead a candidate to present
            himself. For he may be inspired by desire for spiritual perfection;
            or he may be influenced by curiosity, or by a wish to do some harm.
            Again, uncertainty may exist as to the fitness of postulants for
            religious life. Therefore, the Church ordains, and religious rules
            require, that candidates should pass through a period of probation.
            But the postulants themselves cannot be in doubt as to the motive
            which leads them to seek the religious habit. Therefore, they do not
            need deliberation, especially if they are not doubtful about their
            health, which the year of probation is intended to put to a test.

            Quod vero quarto proponitur, quod Satanas transfigurat se in Angelum
            lucis et multotiens bona suggerit intentione fallendi, verum est;
            sed sicut Glosa dicit ibidem: quando Diabolus sensus corporis
            fallit, mentem vero non movet a vera rectaque sententia, qua quisque
            vitam fidelem gerit, nullum est in religione periculum: vel cum se
            bonum fingens ea vel facit vel dicit quae bonis Angelis congruunt,
            etiam si credatur bonus, non est error periculosus aut morbidus. Cum
            vero per haec aliena ad sua incipit ducere, ne quis post eum eat
            opus est magna vigilantia. Detur ergo quod Diabolus aliquem incitet
            ad religionem intrandum; hoc opus bonum est, et bonis Angelis
            congruum: unde non est periculum si quis in hoc ei consentiat; sed
            vigilandum erit, ut ei resistatur cum ad superbiam vel ad alia vitia
            inceperit ducere. Frequenter enim contingit quod Deus utitur malitia
            Daemonum in bonum sanctorum - quibus (Diabolus) praeparat coronas
            invitus -, et sic eis a sanctis illuditur. Sciendum tamen, quod si
            cui a Diabolo suggeratur vel etiam ab homine religionis introitus,
            per quem aliquis accedit ad Christum sequendum; talis suggestio
            efficaciam non habet, nisi interius attrahatur a Deo. Dicit enim
            Augustinus in libro de praedestinatione sanctorum quod omnes sunt
            docibiles Dei, non quia omnes ad Christum veniant, sed quia nemo
            aliter venit: et sic religionis propositum a quocumque suggeratur, a
            Deo est.

            The statement that “Satan transforms himself into an angel of light”
            and inspires good desires with the intention of deceiving us, is
            very true. But, as the Gloss says, when the devil deceives the
            bodily senses, he does not withdraw the mind from a praiseworthy and
            holy intention; for whoever leads a faithful life is in no danger.
            Even should Satan, pretending to be good, do or say things befitting
            the holy angels, and should he delude a man into believing him, the
            error would not be dangerous or harmful. But, when, by means of his
            pretence of good, he begins to draw men away to his own work, they
            need the greatest watchfulness, lest they should be led astray by
            him. Granted, then that the devil instigates someone to enter
            religious life, this undertaking is a good one, worthy of the holy
            angels, and a man who consents to it will run no risk. But he must
            be on his guard to resist temptations to pride or other vices. God
            makes use of the malice of the devil for the profit of the just, for
            whom, if they overcome, He prepares crowns; and thus the evil
            spirits are duped by the saints. But it must be understood that a
            suggestion to enter religious life proceeding either from man or
            from Satan has no efficacy, unless it be accompanied by the interior
            attraction of God. St. Augustine in his book
            <i>De praedestinatione Sanctorum</i> says “that all the saints are
            taught by God, not because all come to Christ, but because no one
            comes to him by any other means. Thus the desire to enter religion,
            from whomever such a suggestion may proceed, comes from God.”

            The fifth argument, namely that advice is needed before going into
            religion, because the undertaking may end badly, needs some
            discrimination. The bad end of any undertaking may be the fault
            either of the enterprise itself, or of him who makes the attempt. If
            the undertaking itself is dangerous and frequently productive of ill
            effects, great deliberation would be needed before attempting it; or
            it might be better to abandon it entirely. But if danger from the
            enterprise accrue but to very few, much deliberation would not be
            required about the step itself. Great care and vigilance, however,
            would be necessary on the part of him who undertakes it, lest he
            should by any chance fall into danger. Otherwise he would make his
            enterprise a pretext for neglecting all human efforts. This is
            enforced by the words of Sirach (11:4). “He who observes the wind
            shall not sow; and he who considers the clouds shall never reap,”
            and those other words of Proverbs (26:13), “The slothful man says,
            ‘There is a lion in the way and a lioness on the roads.’” On this
            text the Gloss observes: “There are many who, when hey hear words of
            exhortation, say that they would never want to enter the way of
            justice, but are held back by Satan from making progress.”

            gratiae contumeliam fecerit. Non esset etiam passim ad iustitiae
            opera procedendum, quia scriptum est Eccli. XXVI 27: eum qui

            It sometimes happens, however, that an undertaking, certainly good
            in itself, may come to an unfortunate termination. This failure is
            due to instability of purpose on the part of the person engaged in
            the affair. But the fact that some men who have become religious
            have changed for the worse, and have apostatised is no reason for
            delaying to enter religious life, on the plea of requiring longer
            deliberation. The same pretext might be used as an excuse for not
            embracing the Faith or approaching the Sacraments, for as we are
            told by St. Peter (2 Pet 2: 21), “It would have been better for them
            not to have known the way of justice, than after they had known it
            to turn back.” St. Paul also says (Heb. 10:29), “He deserves worse
            punishments who has esteemed the blood of the Testament unclean, and
            has offered an affront to the spirit of grace.” Neither would he
            return to works of justice, since we find it written (Sirach
            26:27[19]), “He who passes over from justice to sin, God has
            prepared him for the sword.”

            The sixth argument used against our proposition is one that must be
            carefully examined, both on account of the frequency with which it
            is adduced, and on account of the heresy which lurks under its
            cover. We are told that “a work that is of God cannot come to
            nought.” Two heresies have sprung up in our time through
            misunderstanding these words. The first error is that since the body
            becomes corrupted, it cannot be the work of God. The second is that
            any grace or charity received from God cannot be lost. We might as
            well say that because Satan sinned, he was not created by God; or
            that because Judas fell away from the Apostolic College, his calling
            was not from God; or that because Simon Magus lapsed into heresy
            after Baptism, it was not the will of God that Philip should have
            baptised him.

            We may add one other argument, as weighty as the preceding, which is
            commonly used by our adversaries: If a man, they say, goes into
            religion and leaves his monastery, his vocation was not from God,
            nor did the advice given him by his counsellors proceed from Heaven.
            In refutation of this opinion, we may quote the words wherewith St.
            Augustine (<i>I Contra Julianum</i>) replies to those who held that
            no root of evil can exist in that which is the gift of God. St.
            Augustine argues: “ Manicheus will conquer, unless both he and you
            be resisted. Therefore, the truth of the Catholic Faith overcomes
            Manicheus, because it overcomes you.” In order, then that our
            opponents may be worsted, together with the Manicheans, let us say
            that the counsel of God is never brought to nought. To quote the
            words of Isaiah (46:10): “My counsel shall stand, and all my will
            shall be done.” Now in God’s unchangeable counsel, He sometimes, as
            St. Augustine says, in <i>De Perseverantia</i>, gives temporal
            justice to those to whom He does not give the gift of perseverance;
            just as He gives temporal existence to corruptible things, on which
            He does not bestow eternal life. And thus the Manicheans are
            answered. For corruptible things are created by the immutable
            counsel of God, in order that they may enjoy temporal existence. Our
            opponents are likewise silenced, since, in the eternal wisdom of
            God, He gives the resolution of entering the religious life to those
            on whom He does not bestow the grace of perseverance.

            aliqui voto se ad ingressum religionis astringunt. Et primo quidem
            aliqui sunt qui nituntur cuilibet voto derogare, dicentes, melius
            esse quod absque voto aliquis virtutum opera exequatur, quam quod ad
            ea observanda voto se obliget, inducentes id quod prosper dicit in
            II libro de vita contemplativa: sic abstinere, vel ieiunare debemus,
            ut non nos necessitati ieiunandi subdamus; ne iam non devoti sed
            inviti rem voluntariam faciamus. Qui autem vovet se ieiunaturum,
            necessitati ieiunandi se subiicit; et eadem ratio est in aliis
            operibus virtuosis. Non igitur videtur esse laudabile quod aliquis
            voveat vel ieiunare vel religionem intrare, vel quodcumque aliud
            opus virtutis explere. Addunt etiam ad hoc rationem: quia quanto
            aliquid est magis necessarium, fit minus meritorium. Cum autem
            aliquis iam vovit vel religionem intrare vel quodcumque aliud bonum
            opus explere, necessitas ei incumbit ut impleat quod promisit.
            Laudabilius igitur esset et magis meritorium, si aliquis absque voto
            faciat aliqua opera virtuosa, quam si ea expleat voto praemisso.

            WE must next examine the views held by those who endeavour to
            prevent men from binding themselves by vow to become religious. Some
            there are who seek to detract from the merit of any vows, contending
            that it is better to perform good works without being bound by any
            obligation. They support their opinion by the following words of
            Prosper (<i>II De vita contemplativa</i>): “We ought to fast and
            abstain, not as being bound thereto by necessity, lest, if we do
            these works unwillingly, we should be acting not through devotion,
            but from constraint.” Now he who makes a vow to fast, subjects
            himself to the necessity of fasting; and this is the case with all
            other good works. Therefore, it would not seem expedient to make a
            vow to fast, or to enter religion, or to perform any other pious
            action. Those who hold this view maintain, likewise that a good work
            loses in merit in proportion to the necessity for its performance.
            Now as a man who has vowed to enter religion, or to perform any
            other virtuous action, is bound to fulfil what he has promised to
            God, it is better and more praiseworthy if he executes such a good
            work without the obligation of a vow, rather than do it because he
            had taken a vow. Those who argue thus, endeavour likewise, in an
            especial manner, to prove that people should not be persuaded to
            enter religion on account of the obligation laid upon them by any
            vow or oath.

            They support their opinion by the statute of the Council of Toledo,
            where (<i>Dist. XLV, cap. De Judaeis</i>) we find these words: “Not
            unwilling, but willing souls, will be saved. For justice must be
            preserved intact. Man, of his own choice, obeyed the will of the
            serpent and perished. Therefore, each man must be saved by the
            response of his own soul in believing, when the grace of God calls
            him to do so. Therefore men are to be converted, not by force, but
            by their own free will and choice. Now these words apply far more
            forcibly to entrance into religious life, which is less necessary to
            salvation than is faith in the Christian religion. But those who
            enter religion on account of a vow or an oath do so not freely, but
            under constraint. Therefore such an obligation is not to be
            commended. The decree of Pope Urban (<i
              >XIX, quaest. II, cap. Duae sunt</i
            >) is considered au argument in support of this opinion. The Pope
            says that they who enter religious life are led by a private law,
            which is the law of the Holy Spirit. “Where the Spirit of the Lord
            is, there is liberty” (2 Cor. 3:17). Now necessity, which constrains
            men by the obligation of a vow or oath, is opposed to liberty.
            Therefore, it is not seemly that men should be obliged to embrace
            religious life, on account of any oath or vow.

            Another argument is drawn from the fall of those, who, having
            entered religion under the constraint of some obligation, have not
            persevered therein, but have returned to the world and abandoned
            themselves, in despair, to vice of every kind. In them is fulfilled
            what our Lord said to the Pharisees (Mt 23:15): “You go round about
            the sea and the land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, you

            It is further maintained that some men who were under vow to go into
            religion, have not fulfilled their obligation, and have nevertheless
            become good bishops or archdeacons. Had they kept their vow, these
            good results would not have been obtained. It is also urged that men
            must not be persuaded to embrace the religious state for the sake of
            any temporal advantages, such as gifts. The decree of Pope Boniface
            (<i>I, quest. II, cap. Quam pio</i>) is quoted in confirmation of
            this proposition, for the Pope says: “Nowhere do we read that the
            disciples of the Lord or their followers were converted to the
            worship of God by gifts.”

            It is further alleged that it leads men into unfaithfulness to be
            bound, while still inexperienced, to the laborious obligations of
            religious life, such as the long morning office, trying vigils,
            fasts and disciplines. They are led like cattle to the
            slaughterhouse; and, as they do not fulfil what they have vowed to
            perform, these religious exercises are for them snares which
            entangle them in eternal death. Such obligations, it is urged, are
            unlawful, as being contrary to the statute of Innocent IV, which
            provides a year of probation for candidates to religious life, and
            forbids anyone to be bound before the age of fourteen years. This
            decree is in harmony with the rule of St. Benedict, which also,
            appoints a year of probation for those who enter the order. It is
            declared, furthermore, to be peculiarly unlawful for youths under
            the age of puberty to be bound to go into religion, for how can a
            youth accept obligations which may lawfully be made void by another?
            If any youths of tender years have bound themselves to become
            religious, they may be withheld from so doing by their parents or
            guardians. This is laid down in
            <i>XX quaest. 2</i>, where it is declared that “if a maiden, under
            the age of twelve years has taken the veil, her engagements may be
            annulled at the will of her parents or guardians.” Thus it is
            unlawful to bind, either by oath or vow, children under the age of
            puberty to the religious life.

            It is further laid down that none, under this age, can be bound to
            religious life, even though he or she should be capable of fraud.
            St. Bernard, in the preparation of regulars and of those who embrace
            the religious state, comments on the decree
            <i>Postulasti</i> of Pope Innocent III: “If you desire to know what
            to expect of them when they are under the age of thirteen or
            fourteen years, you may be in doubt, for they are capable of craft,
            and may make up in cunning what they lack in age.” This has been
            proved in marriage, as we see in
            <i>Extra de Despon. impub. cap. A nobis</i>, and <i>cap. Tuae</i>,
            and, as they have been able to bind themselves to the devil, they
            may also be able to bind themselves to God. But the Pope replies
            that children under fourteen may, after they have been received,
            serve in the Church, but they may not be bound under obligations. He
            who is capable of fraud, the Pope continues in his reply to Hugh, is
            bound to good, and if he has become a monk he is under the
            obligations of the monastic life, since he was able to bind himself
            to the devil. Innocent III was of the same opinion, for in this same
            decretal he replies that entrance into religious life is a solemn
            engagement, “if age is supplied by malice.” This is also laid down
            in the old decretal, but it is of small import in our days.

            ought not to be bound by oath; neither, by the same reasoning, can
            they be bound by vow to enter religious life. They say further that,
            as the word religion signifies either re-binding or re-electing,
            according to St. Augustine (<i>X</i> <i>De Civit. Dei</i>),
            therefore children, who are not bound and have made no choice,
            cannot be re-bound, nor can they repeat their choice. From an these
            arguments they conclude that children who embrace, or are
            constrained to embrace religious life, are much to be pitied for
            their folly.

            voluntas hominis magis fuerit obstinata in malo: unde et obstinatio
            ponitur peccatum in spiritum sanctum. Manifestum est autem quod
            voluntas firmatur ad aliquid faciendum per iuramentum: unde et
            Psalmista dicebat: iuravi et statui custodire iudicia iustitiae
            tuae. Confirmatur etiam similiter voto, cum votum sit promissio
            quaedam. Qui autem promittit aliquid se facturum, firmat propositum
            suum ad illud implendum. Laudabilius igitur est virtutis opus, et
            magis meritorium, si fiat voluntate firmata per votum. Hoc etiam
            apparet ex consuetudine vitae humanae.

            We must first remember that although the praiseworthiness of an
            action depends radically on the will, the work itself becomes
            outwardly more praiseworthy in proportion to the excellence of the
            will. Now one condition of a good will is that it be firm and
            stable. Proverbs (13: 4) reproaches the slothful in these words:
            “The sluggard wills and wills not.” Therefore an exterior work
            becomes praiseworthy and meritorious, in proportion to the stability
            of the will in good. Hence St. Paul, writing to the Corinthians (1
            Cor 15:58), says: “Be steadfast and immoveable.” And Aristotle
            teaches that for the perfection of virtue, stability and constancy
            in operation are necessary. Lawyers also define justice as firmness
            and steadfastness of will. On the other hand, we know that the
            heinousness of sin depends upon the obstinacy in evil shown by the
            sinner. In fact, this obstinacy is itself called a sin against the
            Holy Spirit. Now it is clear that the will to do anything is
            strengthened by an oath. “ I have sworn,” says the Psalmist, “and am
            determined to keep the judgments of your Justice” (Ps 118:106). The
            will is likewise confirmed by a vow, since a vow is a promise, and
            he who promises to do a thing strengthens his determination to do
            it. Therefore, as we see in our experience of human life, a virtuous
            action is more meritorious and more praiseworthy, if it is performed
            when the will is strengthened by a vow.

            So inconstant is the human will that it has become customary not to
            believe what men say they will do for one another, unless they
            confirm their words by promise, and further ratify those promises by
            lawful safeguards. Now we owe more to ourselves, especially in the
            affairs of our spiritual wellbeing, than we owe to other people.
            This we are taught by the words of Sirach 30:24 [23], “Have pity on
            your own soul, pleasing God.” Now by reason of the inconstancy of
            his will, a man may neglect to perform something that he intended
            for the temporal advantage of his neighbour; he therefore provides
            against this possible omission by confirming his promise by some
            oath or pledge. How much more fittingly then may he not bind,
            himself by oath or vow to carry out some good resolution which he
            has made? Hence St. Augustine says, in his epistle to Paulina and
            Armentarius, “Having made a vow, you have bound yourself, and cannot
            act otherwise.” And he further adds: “Never regret your vow, but
            rather rejoice that it is now no longer lawful for you to do what,
            to your detriment, you were able to do before.”

            cognoscent Aegyptii dominum in die illa, et colent eum in hostiis et
            muneribus, et vota vovebunt domino et solvent. Ieiunium igitur
            laudabilius erit et magis meritorium, si fiat ex voto. Hinc est quod
            in Psalmo vel consulitur vel mandatur: vovete, et reddite domino Deo
            vestro: quod frustra mandaretur vel consuleretur, nisi opus bonum ex
            voto facere melius esset.

            It is further to be remembered that a work of lesser intrinsic worth
            is rendered more meritorious, if it is inspired by some motive of
            superior virtue. Thus, abstinence is more meritorious if it is
            practised from charity, and the merit is further increased if the
            motive be <i>latria</i>, which is of greater value than abstinence.
            Now a vow is an act of <i>latria</i>. It is a promise made to God,
            concerning those things which relate to His worship. Hence Isaiah
            says (19:21), “The Egyptians shall know the Lord in that day, and
            shall worship Him with sacrifices and offerings, and they shall make
            vows to the Lord, and perform them.” Thus we see that fasting will
            be more meritorious and more praiseworthy, if it is performed under
            vow. A counsel or command concerning this matter is given us in the
            words of Ps 75:12: “Vow, and pay to the Lord your God!” This command
            or exhortation would be futile, were not a good work done under vow
            more meritorious than one done without such an obligation.

            justifiable or not for a man to bind himself to enter the religious
            life. If it be true that it is a virtuous action to embrace the
            religious state, and that virtuous actions become more meritorious
            if they be done in fulfilment of a vow, those men must be acting in
            a praiseworthy manner when, being unable to become religious at
            once, bind themselves by vow to do so at a future time. This
            argument must be patent to all. save to those who, with Vigilantius,
            hold that the secular state is equal in merit to the religious life,
            or who have the still grosser folly to outdo the heresy of
            Vigilantius by presuming to assert that the religious state, which
            enjoys the approbation of the Church, is not a state of salvation.

            The foregoing remarks only apply to adults. We must now consider the
            question as to whether children, be they boys or girls, may lawfully
            bind themselves by vow to become religious. A distinction must be
            made between two kinds of vows: simple vows, and solemn vows. A
            simple vow consists in a mere promise. A solemn vow is a promise
            accompanied by some exterior manifestation, whereby a man actually
            offers himself to God. Thus the reception of Holy Order, the
            profession of a definite religious life made in the hands of a
            prelate, or the reception of the habit of professed religious, which
            is considered equivalent to religious profession, all solemnize a
            vow. Simple and solemn vows have different effects upon matrimony. A
            solemn vow is an obstacle to marriage, and annuls a contract of
            marriage already made. A simple vow does not annul a marriage, but
            is an impediment in the way of any contract of marriage after the
            vow is made.

            Simple and solemn vows have, likewise different effects upon
            religious life. A solemn vow, made either by explicit or implicit
            profession, causes a man to become a monk or a brother in some
            religious order. A simple vow does not make a him a monk, for it
            leaves him with the ownership of his property, and does not annul
            his marriage, should he marry after taking such a vow. Now as a
            simple vow consists solely in a promise made to God, proceeding from
            the interior deliberation of the mind, such a vow possesses an
            efficacy of which no human law can deprive it. There are,
            nevertheless, two conditions under which a simple vow may be
            invalidated. First, if such due deliberation as would ratify a
            promise, have been wanting; thus a vow taken by a mad or delirious
            man would not be binding, as is laid down in
            <i>extra de regul. et transeuntibus ad relig. Sicut tenor</i>.
            Neither would any obligation attach to the vow of a child as yet
            incapable of fraud, or who had not attained to the use of reason,
            which in children is developed at such different ages that no
            certain rule can be laid down concerning it.

            The other condition which would invalidate a simple vow is, in the
            event of a person vowing something to which he has not the power to
            give. Thus, if a slave makes a vow to go into religion, he
            (supposing him to have attained the use of reason) would be
            certainly bound to keep his vow, if his master permitted him to do
            so. But if his master would not ratify the vow, the slave could,
            without sin, revoke it. This is laid down in the
            <i>Decreta, dist. 44, Si servus</i>, where it is said that “if a
            slave have, unknown to his master, been ordained, the master is
            entitled within a year of the ordination to prove that the slave is
            his property and to take him back.” And since a boy or girl is,
            during childhood, in the power of the father, the father may, if he
            so will, acknowledge the vow made by a child as an effect of divine
            inspiration. We read in the Book of Numbers (30:4), “If a woman vows
            anything, and binds herself by an oath, being in her father’s house,
            and but yet a girl in age: if her father knew the vow that she has
            promised, and the oath wherewith she has bound her soul, and held
            his peace, she shall be bound by the vow: whatsoever she promised
            and swore, she shall fulfil in deed. But if her father, as soon as
            he heard it, overruled it, both her vows and her oaths shall be
            void; neither shall she be bound to what she promised, because her
            father has overruled it.” From this passage it appears that boys or
            girls, under the age of puberty, are bound, as far as in them lies,
            to keep vows that they have made, unless their reason is defective.
            Nevertheless, as they are under the authority of their father, he
            can annul their vows. This is also made clear by the context of the
            passage in Numbers, which we have quoted, which speaks of the right
            of a husband to annul a vow made by his wife.

            professionem tacitam vel expressam, habet quasdam exteriores
            solemnitates, quae ordinationi subduntur Ecclesiae, sicut et
            solemnitas ordinis sacri; secundum Ecclesiae determinationem
            exigitur ad huiusmodi votum, completum pubertatis tempus: idest in
            puero quatuordecim annorum, et in puella duodecim; ita quod
            professio ante hoc tempus facta, quantumcumque aliquis sit doli
            capax, non facit profitentem esse monachum, vel cuiusque ordinis

            III aliter sensisse dicatur.

            We cannot positively determine the age at which individuals reach
            the use of reason; but the period at which the subjection of one
            person to another ceases, can be distinctly defined. This time is
            for a girl the age of twelve years: for a boy the age of fourteen.
            This age is generally reckoned the time of puberty, as we see in
            <i>XX quaest. 2, cap. Puella, cap. Si in qualibet</i>. Thus with
            regard to a simple vow to enter religion, a person may be bound, in
            so far as it depends upon himself, by such a vow even before he has
            arrived at the age of puberty, provided that he is capable of fraud,
            and has attained the use of reason, so that he understands what he
            is doing. But this vow may be revoked by a father or a guardian who
            holds the place of a father. A solemn vow, on the other hand, made
            either explicitly or implicitly, requires certain exterior rites
            ordained by the Church. The Church exacts that both for the
            reception of Holy Orders, and for the making of a solemn vow, the
            candidate must have attained the age of puberty, which for a boy is
            fourteen years and for a girl twelve. Therefore a profession made by
            anyone under this age, even though the person is capable of fraud,
            does not render him a monk or brother of any religious order. This
            is the commonly accepted teaching of the Church, though Innocent III
            is said to have spoken otherwise.

            The words of Prosper, “We ought to fast, not out of necessity,”
            refer to a forced fast, in contradistinction to a voluntary one.
            This is proved by the context, “lest we should, by not fasting
            voluntarily, show ourselves unwilling rather than devout.” These
            words do not refer to the necessity imposed by a vow, for by a vow
            devotion, is increased. This appears from the very etymology of the
            word.

            The second argument, viz. that which is done out of necessity is
            less meritorious than that which is done freely, must be understood
            of the necessity imposed on a man against his own will. But when a
            man lays upon himself the necessity of doing good, his action is
            thereby rendered more praiseworthy, since he who performs it is “a
            servant of justice,” which St. Paul exhorts us all to become (Rom
            6:18). Hence St. Augustine, in his epistle to Paulina and
            Armentarius, exclaims, “Blessed necessity which constrains us to
            better things.”

            non infertur homini vis, sed ex eis voluntas hominis confirmatur in

            The third argument, which refers to the conversion of the Jews of
            their own free will, does not appear relevant to our subject. For
            the will may be confirmed in good without any violation of its
            liberty; otherwise neither God nor the blessed in Heaven would enjoy
            free will. But coercion, proceeding either from violence or fear, is
            repugnant to liberty. Therefore, the Canon
            <i>De Judaeis</i> expressly condemns it, saying, “The holy Synod
            henceforth forbids violence to be used towards anyone to make them
            believe.” But neither a vow nor an oath do violence to a man; they
            merely serve to confirm his will in good. Therefore, neither a vow
            nor an oath render a man unwilling, but rather cause him to will
            more strongly, and to begin, in so far as may lie in his power, to
            execute what he has bound himself to. No one in his senses will say
            that it is unlawful to persuade Jews to bind themselves by vow or
            oath to be baptized.

            The fourth contention of our opponents is that sometimes those who
            have bound themselves by oath or vow to go into religion lapse, and
            falling into despair, abandon themselves to all manner of iniquity;
            and thus they become the children of hell, twofold more than they
            who led them to become religious. This objection is answered by St.
            Paul, “Shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?”
            (Rom 3:3). From which words we are to conclude that the fact that
            some men abuse grace is not detrimental to the perseverance of
            others in good. The Gloss says on this passage that the refusal of
            certain Jews to believe in no wise hinders others of their nation
            from accepting what God has promised to His faithful. In the same
            way, the fact that certain men, after taking a vow or an oath to
            embrace the religious life, change their minds and become worse than
            they were before, is no hindrance to others who, having taken a vow,
            persevere in its accomplishment. Therefore, they who persuade men to
            make a vow to become religious do not, so far as they are concerned,
            make them children of hell, but rather children of the Kingdom;
            since the number of those who persevere is greater than that of
            those who fall away.

            nisi forte, quod absit, pravis exemplis eos ad peccandum inducerent,
            ut patet per expositionem Hieronymi et Chrysostomi. Videtur tamen
            huic rationi suffragari quod apostolus dicit I ad Tim. V, 11:
            adolescentiores viduas devita: et rationem assignat cum subdit:
            damnationem habentes quod primam fidem irritam fecerunt, qua

            duntaxat, non secundum imperium, quia multo tolerabilius est digamam
            esse quam scortum, secundum habere virum quam plures adulteros. Non
            ergo apostolus prohibet simpliciter adolescentes viduas continentiam
            vovere, cum I ad Cor. VII 8 dicat quod melius est eis si sic in
            viduitate permanserint; sed eas prohibet recipi ad stipendia
            Ecclesiae, quae in lascivia vivunt: unde dicit: adolescentes viduas
            devita quae cum luxuriatae fuerint in Christo, nubere volunt.

            It is nevertheless possible (though God forbid it!) that they may,
            as appears by the exposition of St. Jerome and St. Chrysostom, by
            their bad example lead those whom they influence into sin. Our
            argument seems to be supported by the words of St. Paul (1 Tim
            5:11), “But the younger widows avoid,” an exhortation for which he
            gives the following reason: “Having damnation, because they have
            made void their first faith,” whereby, that is, they pledged
            themselves before God to continence. But, as St. Jerome says in his
            epistle <i>De monogamia ad Agerunchiam</i>, on account of those who
            have committed fornication against Christ their Spouse, the Apostle
            desires them to marry again, preferring a second marriage to
            fornication. For it is much better to be a wife for a second time,
            than to have commerce with a debauchee or with many adulterers. But
            St. Paul does not, on this account, forbid young widows to make a
            simple vow of continency—In fact, he rather commends such a
            practice, saying, “it is good for them if they so continue,” i.e. in
            their widowhood (1 Cor 7:8)—but he forbids widows who are living in
            wantonness to be assisted by the alms of the Church. “But the
            younger widow avoid, for when they have grown wanton in Christ they
            will marry” (1 Tim 5:11).

            As for the sixth argument, namely that some men who have made vows
            to go into religion have, nevertheless, remained in the world and
            become good bishops, it is patently contrary to fact. In the decree
            of Innocent, which treats of vows and their accomplishments, we find
            the following passage, “You state in your letters to us that you
            made a solemn vow in the church of Grenoble to assume the religious
            habit, and that you further promised, in the hands of the Bishop of
            the same church, to fulfil this vow within the period of two months
            on your return from the Apostolic See. Nevertheless, heedless that
            the time for accomplishing your promise has expired, although
            unfaithful to a vow, you have been called to the government of the
            Church of Geneva. We counsel you then that if you desire to give
            peace to your conscience, you should renounce the see, and should
            pay to the Most High your vows.” Hence it is plain that a man who
            has vowed to go into religion cannot, with a good conscience, retain
            a bishopric or an archdeaconate; and should he retain it, he would
            not be a good bishop or archdeacon, but a traitor to his vow.

            The next contention, viz. that men should not be bribed to enter
            religion, is answered by the very chapter quoted in support of it.
            For it declares that “unless someone has the intention of feeding
            the poor, no one of any profession whatsoever is to be refused
            maintenance.” Hence it appears that the practice of burses for poor
            scholars, and of supporting them during their studies in order that
            they may be more fit to enter religion, is by no means to be
            condemned. Neither is it unlawful to bestow some material benefit
            upon a man, in order that he may be encouraged, by such a favour, to
            do better; but it would be unlawful to enter into a compact or
            agreement with him. Hence in the same chapter, it is laid down that
            all compacts and agreements must be avoided. Were it unlawful to
            encourage persons to spiritual good by means of material assistance,
            the custom, prevalent in certain churches, of giving a largesse to
            those who assist at the divine office, would be unjustifiable.

            The eighth argument, viz. that it leads to unfaithfulness to
            persuade young persons to adopt such painful practices as fasting,
            watching, and the like, contains a fallacy which may easily be
            detected. For those who are received to the religious life, or who
            are bound by vow to enter it, are, from the very outset, shown its
            hardships. It does not lead men to unfaithfulness if, in order to
            persuade them to embrace a life whose sufferings are manifest, we,
            after the example of Christ, hold out to them the prospect of
            spiritual consolations. “Take my yoke upon you,” said our Lord, “and
            learn of Me, for I am meek and humble of heart, and you shall find
            rest for your soul” (Mt 11:29). In these words, physical labour is
            symbolised by the “yoke,” and spiritual consolation by the “rest”
            promised to those that bear it. Hence St. Augustine, in
            <i>De verbis Domini</i>, says, “They who bravely submit to the yoke
            of the Lord, undergo such dangers and difficulties that they appear
            to be called, not from labour to rest, but from rest to labour. But
            the Holy Spirit who is with them by the abundance of heavenly
            delights and the hope of future blessedness, sweetens all present
            bitterness and lightens all present loads.” Therefore, they who
            judge that men deceive themselves by undertaking hardships for
            Christ’s sake, merely show that they have had no experience of
            heavenly delights.

            For the fact that an engagement may be broken does not make such an
            engagement sinful. It would be equally reasonable to say that
            whatever minors, that is persons under twenty-five years of age, may
            do to the detriment of their own interest is unlawful, because
            anything that they lose can be completely restored to them. Hence
            children commit no sin by taking a vow to go into religion, or by
            assuming the religious habit without their parents’ permission, even
            though such vows can be annulled. Were they to commit sin by taking
            such vows, the fact would be noted by the Canons, which grant
            faculties to parents to dissolve the vows of children.

            Finally, the profane conclusion whereby these objections end, and
            which accuses children of folly, is an affront to pious ears. Who
            would presume to blame the holy child St. Benedict because, in his
            desire to please God alone, he left his father’s house, and sought
            for holy conversation and a solitary dwelling? Who but a heretic
            would blaspheme against St. John the Baptist, of whom we are told
            (Luke 1:80) that “the child grew and was strengthened in spirit, and
            he was in the desert until the day of his manifestation to Israel”?
            Such presumptuous words show that they who speak them are carnal
            men, who reckon as folly what is of the spirit of God. St. Ambrose
            says, in his commentary on the Gospel of Luke, “The Holy Spirit is
            not limited to age, nor extinguished by death, nor shut out by the
            womb.” St. Gregory, in his
            <i>Homilia Pentecostes</i>, likewise says, “He fills the
            harp-playing youth, and makes of him a Psalmist; He fills the
            herdsman who was uprooting a fig tree, and makes of him a Prophet:
            He fills the abstemious youth, and makes of him a venerable judge:
            He fills the fisherman, and makes of him a preacher: He fills the
            persecutor, and makes of him a teacher of the nations; He fills the
            publican, and makes of him an Evangelist.” I will further quote the
            words of St. Paul (1 Cor 3:18), “If any man among you seems to be
            wise in this world, let him become a fool that he may become wise.”
            For he who is a fool in the wisdom of this world (which is folly in
            the sight of God) is no fool in the wisdom of God. The book of
            Proverbs (1:22), speaking to children, says, “O children, how long
            will you love childishness? Give heed to my reproof. I will utter my
            words [Vul: spirit] to you.”

            WE must now examine how the adversaries of the religious life seek
            to withhold men from embracing it by decrying the perfection of this
            state, and especially the perfection of those religious whose
            possessions are not in common. In order to uphold their opinion they
            quote the following words from Prosper in his book,
            <i>De vita contemplativa</i> (<i>XII. quaest. I</i>), “We should
            possess the goods of the Church and, for the love of poverty, spurn
            our own possessions. The property of the Church is not private, but
            common. Therefore, anyone who has relinquished or sold his own
            belongings despises private property; but, when he is set over a
            Church, he becomes the administrator of all the possessions of that
            Church. St. Paulinus, as is well known, sold his large property and
            gave the effects to the poor; but, when he became Bishop, far from
            despising the possessions of his Church, he administered them with
            the utmost fidelity. This fact is sufficient evidence that we ought
            to relinquish our private belongings, on account of the imperfection
            attaching to them, but that it is quite possible (without any
            detriment to poverty), to possess ecclesiastical property, which is
            common.” Hence, our adversaries draw the conclusion that it is
            imperfect not to hold common property.

            They maintain their opinion by quoting the example of several
            Saints. Thus Gregory, with his money, built one monastery within the
            walls of Rome and six in Sicily. St. Benedict, that perfect guide of
            religious, accepted large donations for his monastery; and many
            other men, who have been zealous for evangelical perfection, have
            acted like manner. These great men, who were zealous seekers after
            evangelical perfection, would certainly not have pursued such a
            course, had the possession of goods in common been in any degree
            inconsistent with Apostolic and Evangelical perfection. Our
            opponents draw from this argument the further conclusion that those
            who possess nothing are not, therefore, the most perfect; and they
            add that the Apostles, whom our Lord commanded to possess nothing
            and to take nothing with them on their way, did nevertheless hold
            certain possessions in time of necessity. Hence, commenting on the
            words of Luke, “But now, he who has a purse let him take it, and
            likewise a bag,” the Gloss says that “now, when the hour of death
            was at hand, and the whole nation were in pursuit of the shepherd
            and the flock, Christ gave a rule befitting the occasion, allowing
            them to take what was necessary for the support of life.”

            It is also argued that Christ Himself instituted the order of His
            disciples, whose successors, the bishops, and clerics, have
            property. Religious orders, on the other hand, whose members live in
            poverty without possessions, were formed by men. Now what Christ has
            instituted must be most perfect. Therefore it is more perfect to
            hold goods in common than to live without property. Our opponents
            likewise (incredible though it may appear) contend that the
            perfection taught by Christ has been in abeyance from the Apostolic
            times until now; and that it is in our days that certain orders have
            begun to live without possessing anything in common. The conclusion
            drawn from this proposition is that the absence of common property

            bibant et induantur; quod facere non possent, si nihil haberent. Ex
            his igitur derogare nituntur perfectioni possessiones non habentium
            in communi.

            Another argument, brought forward by the enemies of the religious
            life, is that those who, after the time of the Apostles, held no
            goods in common, lived as did the Fathers of the desert, by the work
            of their hands. Therefore, they say, those who neither possess
            common property, nor live by their manual labour do not practise
            Evangelical perfection. They likewise hold that the counsel of
            renouncing wealth was given as a means whereby to free our minds
            from worldly care, as we learn from Luke 12:22, “Be not solicitous
            for your life, what you shall eat,” and from St. Paul’s first
            Epistle to the Corinthians (7:32), “But I would have you be without
            solicitude.” Now they who have not sufficient property to provide
            them with the necessities of life are more disturbed by anxiety than
            those who hold certain possessions in common. Therefore the absence
            of common property is an obstacle to Evangelical perfection. It is
            further maintained that religious who possess nothing are compelled
            to busy themselves in the affairs of those who supply their
            necessities, and that this solicitude about temporal matters
            militates against Evangelical perfection. Therefore they who possess
            nothing are beset by impediments in the way of perfection. Finally,
            the adversaries of religious poverty say that it is impossible for
            anyone to possess nothing in common; for all must have food and
            clothing, which they could not obtain if they had no property. These
            are the arguments brought against the perfection of those who own no
            common property.

            se contemnat, pauper in cella, dives in conscientia. Et ut ab

            matrem, pauperiorem patriam, egens fit pecuniis: et hoc tibi exponat
            praesepe, ut legitur in quodam synodali sermone Ephesini Concilii.
            Et post pauca subditur: respice pauperrimum habitaculum eius qui
            ditat caelum. Vide praesepe sedentis super Cherubim: vide pannis
            obsitum eum qui pelagus harenae vinxit, vide deorsum paupertatem,
            divitias eius sursum considerans. Si autem non propter se, sed
            propter nos egenus factus est, secundum apostolum, nunquid non
            poterat matrem multas possessiones habentem eligere, atque in domo
            propria nasci, si nihil ad perfectionem Christianae vitae pertineret
            terrenas possessiones non habere, quinimmo propria domo carere?

            WE must remember that the enemies of poverty impugn, not only the
            teaching, but the life of our Lord. Christ has taught us both by
            word and example to observe poverty in all things. St. Paul tells us
            (2 Cor 8:9), “that being rich, He became poor for our sakes.” The
            Gloss, commenting on these words, says that “He took poverty upon
            Himself, although He did not lose His riches. Interiorly He was
            rich, exteriorly He was poor. He concealed the treasure of His
            Godhead, and revealed the poverty of His Manhood.” Hence those who
            follow Christ in poverty acquire great dignity, as we shall
            presently show. “Therefore (the Gloss concludes) let no one despise
            Him who, though poor in His dwelling, was rich in conscience. If we
            consider His life, from His first entry into the world, we shall see
            that He chose a poor maiden for His Mother, and willed to be needy
            and in want, and to have for His birthplace the poorest of poor
            cities. The stable is a monument of His poverty, as we are reminded
            in a certain address delivered at one of the synods of the Council
            of Ephesus.” “See (we quote part of this address) the most humble
            dwelling of Him who enriches Heaven. A crib suffices Him who sits
            above the Cherubim; and He who has joined the sea to the dry land is
            Himself swathed in swaddling bands. Mark His poverty here below;
            consider the abundance of His riches above.” But if Christ, as St.
            Paul says, had not become poor for our sakes, not for His own, could
            He not have chosen a wealthy mother and might He not have been born
            in His own house? If the abnegation of earthly possessions is of no
            account in Christian perfection, why should our Lord have deprived
            Himself even of a home? Therefore, let the enemies of poverty blush
            and be silent, while the glory of this virtue radiates from the crib
            of Christ.

            But, lest we may imagine that in his more mature years our Lord
            abandoned the poverty which He bore in childhood, let us consider
            His own words. “The Son of man,” He said, “has nowhere to lay His
            head (Mt 8:20). St. Jerome makes the following comment on this text:
            “Christ spoke thus, as if to say, ‘Why should you desire to follow
            me for the sake of gaining worldly pomp and riches, since my poverty
            is so extreme that I have no dwelling of mine own, and since the
            roof under which I sleep belongs not to me?” And St. Chrysostom,
            writing on the same subject, says, “Observe how our Lord exemplifies
            in His deeds the poverty which He taught by His words. He had
            neither table nor lantern nor house nor any such thing,” And this
            poverty which He preached both by word and deed belongs to
            perfection. Thus we see that the entire abnegation of all earthly
            possessions forms part of the perfection of the Christian life.

            We find a further proof of the poverty practised by our Lord in the
            words which He spoke to St. Peter concerning the tribute money, “Go
            to the sea, and cast in a hook: and the fish which shall first come
            up, take; and when you open its mouth you shall find a coin; take it
            and give it to them for me and for you” (Mt 17:26). In his
            exposition of this text, St. Jerome says: “These words, understood
            simply, edify the hearer, showing as they do that the Lord was so
            poor that He had not nothing with which to pay tribute for Himself

            But, someone may object, how then could Judas carry money in his
            purse? We answer that our Lord considered it criminal to use the
            money intended for the poor for His own purposes and that, in this,
            He has left us an example. But it is clear, and cannot be called in
            question by any Christian, that Christ practised the most sublime
            perfection in the tenor of His life, and therefore He taught the
            perfection of poverty. “If you would be perfect, go, sell all that
            you have and give to the poor, and come, follow me.” These words,
            according to St. Jerome, contain the highest rule of perfection.
            Therefore it is the perfection of poverty for men, after the example
            of Christ, to be destitute of all possessions and only to reserve
            something for the poor, especially for those dependent upon them,
            Thus our Lord took care of His disciples who had made themselves
            poor for His sake, reserving for their sustenance something from the
            things which were given Him.

            But among all that Christ did and suffered during His mortal life,
            the example of His most holy Cross is, above all other things,
            proposed to Christians for their imitation. He Himself says, “If
            anyone would come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his
            cross and follow me” (Mt 16:24). St. Paul also, speaking as though
            crucified with Christ, and exulting only in His Cross, says (Gal
            6:17), “I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus in my body,” being a
            diligent follower of the example of the Cross. Now among all that is
            conspicuous in the Cross, poverty is everywhere apparent. So utter,
            indeed, was the destitution of our Lord upon the Cross that He
            suffered even bodily nakedness and exclaims in the person of the
            Psalmist (21:19), “ They parted my garments among them, and upon my
            vesture they cast lots.” Now men imitate this nakedness of the Cross
            by voluntary poverty, especially when they renounce the revenues of
            their possessions. Thus St. Jerome, writing to the priest Paulinus,
            says, “Now that you have heard the counsel of our Saviour: ‘If you
            would be perfect, go, sell all that you have and give to the poor
            and come, follow Me,’ put His words into practice and, stripped of
            all things, follow the nakedness of the Cross. So shall you more
            easily and more speedily scale Jacob’s ladder.” A little further on,
            he adds, “It is no great thing for a man to wear a sad and pallid
            countenance, to make a display of fasting, and to wear a beggarly
            cloak if, at the same time, he draws a princely income from his
            property.” Hence we see how truly those are enemies of the Cross of
            Christ who impugn poverty and, savouring earthly things, deem that
            material possessions tend to Christian perfection, and that the
            abnegation of such possessions detracts from such perfection.

            Now that we have considered certain points in the life of Christ, in
            His birth, in His manhood, and in His death upon the Cross, let us
            proceed to reflect upon His teaching. In the instruction which He
            gave both to His disciples and to the multitudes, He began with
            poverty as a foundation, “Blessed are the poor in spirit” (Mt 5:3).
            St Jerome explains these words as follows: “By the poor in spirit
            are to be understood they who, by the grace of the Holy Spirit, have
            the will to be poor.” As St. Ambrose says, on the Gospel of Luke,
            “Both Evangelists mention the beatitude of poverty in the first
            place. And indeed poverty is the first in order of virtues, and the
            mother and producer of all others. For he who spurns earthly riches
            shall merit such as are eternal, neither can he deserve to receive
            the reward of the Kingdom of Heaven, who is possessed by the spirit
            of covetousness.”

            St. Basil further shows us in these words what is specially meant by
            poverty of spirit: “Blessed is he who is poor as a true disciple of
            Christ, who bore poverty for us. For the Lord Himself accomplished
            every work that leads to perfection, giving Himself as an example to
            those who will learn of Him,” Now we never read that Christ owned
            any possessions. Therefore poverty is no hindrance to the perfection
            of those who desire to renounce what they possess, for the love of
            Christ; on the contrary such poverty greatly increases their
            perfection. Hence, when our Lord was sending forth His twelve chosen
            Apostles to preach, and when He had given them the power to perform
            miracles, He impressed upon them, as their first rule of life, the
            exercise of poverty, saying, “Do not possess gold nor silver, nor
            money in your purses, nor bag for your journey” (Mt 10:9). Thus, as
            Eusebius of Caesaraea says, “He forbade them the present use of
            gold, silver or brass, and also solicitude for their future needs.
            For he know that they who were to be healed by the Apostles and
            delivered by them from the violence of their passions would share
            their goods with them.” Eusebius further adds that “our Lord judged
            it fitting that they who were attracted by heavenly riches should
            despise earthly junk and should possess neither gold, nor silver nor
            any other property valued by men, but should esteem the heavenly
            treasures they were endowed with, as worth more then all such
            things. Therefore He made them soldiers of the Kingdom of Heaven,
            and told them to cherish poverty.”

            “No soldier of God who desires to please Him entangles himself in
            the affairs of this life.” St. Jerome, commenting on the Gospel of
            St. Matthew, says, “He who, in the foregoing words, had forbidden
            the Apostles to possess riches, now almost prohibits them from
            providing themselves with the necessities of life, in order that
            they, the teachers of true religion, who were trained to believe
            that all things were ordered by the Providence of God, should show
            that they themselves took no thought for the morrow.” Again, St.
            Chrysostom, writing on the Gospel of St. Matthew, observes, “Our
            Lord, by this precept, first frees his disciples from bondage to
            riches; secondly, He delivers them from all solicitude, in order
            that they may give their entire attention to the word of God;
            thirdly, He teaches them His virtue. Thus then the precepts of the
            Gospel point out to us what manner of man he ought to be who
            preaches the Kingdom of God. He ought to be one who seeks not the
            support of material assistance, but, relying entirely on his Faith,
            reflects that the less he strives after these material things, the
            more God can supply him with them.” St. Ambrose speaks, in his
            commentary on the Gospel of St. Luke, has this to say: “It is
            evident that if the Apostles had accepted property, they would have
            been not less, but far more open to suspicion than if they had owned
            gold and silver; for it would have been thought that they preached
            for the sake of what they could gain. They would likewise have been
            far more occupied with anxiety about the cultivation of their
            fields. For land or vineyards are a far greater source of material
            profit than are moveable chattels.”

            Est autem ulterius considerandum qualiter praemissa domini praecepta
            fuerint ab apostolis observata, quia, ut Augustinus dicit in Lib.
            contra mendacium, divinae Scripturae non solum praecepta Dei
            retinent, sed etiam vitam moresque iustorum, ut si forte occultum
            est quemadmodum accipiendum sit quod praecipitur, in factis iustorum
            intelligatur. Quod autem nihil temporalium possiderent, aut etiam in
            via deferrent ante tempus passionis, aperte ostenditur ex hoc quod
            legitur Luc. XXII, 35; ubi dominus discipulis dixit: quando misi vos
            sine sacculo et pera et calceamentis, nunquid aliquid defuit vobis?

            relaxationem quantum ad personas apostolorum, ad solum tempus
            imminentis persecutionis esse referendam, apparet ex verbis Bedae,

            tempori regulam decrevit, permittens ut tollant victui necessaria,

            But we must finally consider in what manner these precepts of our
            Lord were observed by the Apostles. For, as St. Augustine says in
            his book
            <i>Contra mendacium</i>: “Holy Scripture contains not only the
            divine precepts, but also the life and conduct of the just; in order
            that if, by any chance, we may be uncertain how some commandment is
            to be understood, we may be enlightened by studying the example of
            holy men.” Now we know that before the Passion the Apostles
            possessed nothing and carried no provision on their journeys. Luke
            (22: 35) reports that our Lord said to them, “When I sent you
            without purse, or bag or shoes, did you want anything? They said,
            ‘nothing’.” Immediately afterwards, however, “Then said He unto
            them, ‘But now he who has a purse, let him take it, and likewise a
            bag.” It might appear as if Christ, in these words, entirely
            rescinded His former precept; but the dispensation was only a
            temporary one, granted on account of impending persecution.
            Venerable Bede says, “He does not govern His disciples by the same
            rule in the time of persecution and in the time of peace. When He
            sent them to preach, He forbad them to take anything with them on
            the way; for it was His ordinance that those who preach the Gospel
            should live by the Gospel. When, however, the danger of death was
            imminent, and the whole nation was persecuting the Shepherd and the
            flock, He gave His disciples a rule befitting the time, allowing
            them to provide themselves with the necessities of life, until such
            time as the fury of their persecutors should be appeased, and a
            convenient season for preaching the Gospel should return. Hereby He
            also teaches us that for certain just causes, we may, without sin,
            somewhat relax the severity of our customary exercises.” We also see
            that absolute renunciation of earthly possessions forms part of the
            rigour of evangelical discipline.

            Quid autem super hoc apostoli post passionem servaverint et
            servandum tradiderint, aperte in actibus apostolorum docetur:
            legitur enim Act. IV, 32, quod multitudinis credentium erat cor unum
            et anima una: nec quisquam eorum quae possidebat, aliquid suum esse
            dicebat; sed erant illis omnia communia. Et ne aliquis dicat, eos

            abundantiorem perfectionem pertineat apparet per Augustinum in III

            eorumque pretium indigentibus distribuendum ante apostolorum pedes
            ponerent. Et postea subdit: non enim hoc ullas Ecclesias gentium
            fecisse scriptum est; quia non tam prope inventi erant qui simulacra
            manufacta deos habebant.

            If we enquire as to the manner in which, after the Passion, the
            Apostles observed this precept, and how they taught their successors
            to keep it, we shall find information in the fourth Chapter of the
            Acts of the Apostles, where we read, “And the multitude of believers
            had but one heart and one soul: neither did any one say that any of
            the things he possessed was his own, but all things were common to
            them.” It cannot be held that they possessed common property, such
            as lands or vineyards or anything of the kind, for in the same
            chapter of the Acts we read, “For as many as were owners of lands or
            houses, sold them, and brought he price of the things they sold, and
            laid it down at the feet of the Apostles.” It is thus made clear
            that the rule of the evangelical life was that the necessities of
            life were possessed in common, and that property was absolutely
            resigned by its owners. St. Augustine points out in
            <i>De doctrina christiana</i>
            that this practice is conducive to the highest perfection. “The
            believers among the Jewish nation,” he says; “who formed the first
            Church, that of Jerusalem, proved most abundantly how advantageous
            it was for them to have grown up under the school master, viz., the
            Law. For they were so evidently under the influence of the Holy
            Spirit that they sold all their possessions, and laid the price at
            the feet of the Apostles to be distributed among the poor. We do not
            (he continues) find the same fact noted of any Church of the
            Gentiles; for they who had worshipped false gods, made by hands,
            were not found so open to the Holy Spirit.”

            Videtur tamen huius rei aliam rationem assignare Melchiades Papa,

            Pope Melchiades, however, assigns a different reason for the same
            fact. In
            <i>XII, quaest. 1</i>
            he says, “The Apostles, foreseeing that the future Church would be
            founded among the Gentiles, did not acquire much property from the
            Jews, but only money for the sustenance of the needy. Now however,
            amidst much storm and stress, the Church gradually acquired a
            footing in the world, and it came to pass that not only entire
            nations, but even the Roman emperors, the rulers of the whole earth,
            flocked to profess the Faith of Christ and to receive Baptism.
            Constantine, that most religious prince, was the first to give
            permission not only for his subjects to become Christians, but also
            for Churches to be erected; and he ordained that certain land should
            be given up to this purpose.” In the following chapter, Pope Urban
            says, “The High Priests and Levites and others and the rest of the
            faithful saw that it would be more profitable if the bishops were to
            make over to the churches which they governed the lands and other
            property which was customarily sold. By means of the charges on
            these estates, the Bishops would be able, both at the present time
            and in the future, to provide more abundantly and conveniently for
            the needs of the faithful, living a common life, than they could
            have done by the sums realised from the sale of the property.
            Therefore they began to assign to the mother churches the landed
            property which they had hitherto sold; and they lived on the income
            derived from it.”

            perfectioni congruus fuit apud primos credentes, non solum in Iudaea
            sub apostolis, sed etiam apud Aegyptum sub Marco Evangelista, ut

            Hence we see that it is better to have land in common, rather than
            chattels which can be sold to procure the necessities of life. Land
            was sold in the primitive Church, not because the Apostles esteemed
            that to be the best course, but because they foresaw that the Church
            would have no permanence among the Jews, partly on account of their
            infidelity, and partly because of the ruin which was to overwhelm
            their nation. The apparent inconsistency of these arrangements
            disappears, when we attentively consider the state of the case. For,
            in the early days of the Church, all her members were as holy as the
            most perfect of her children in later days. Therefore the Church
            had, in the order both of nature and of grace, to lay her
            foundations among the perfect; and consequently the Apostles
            ordained a mode of life consonant with perfection. St. Jerome, in
            his book
            <i>De illustribus viris</i>, says, “It seems as if at first the
            Church of believers had been of the standard that monks now
            endeavour and strive to reach. Nothing was the private property of
            anyone; among them were no rich nor poor; patrimonies were divided
            among the needy; and men devoted themselves to prayer, to perfect
            doctrine, and to continence.” This perfect mode of life was
            practised among the primitive believers not only in Judaea under the
            Apostle, but also in Egypt under St. Mark the Evangelist. This we
            learn from St. Jerome and also from Book II of the
            <i>Ecclesiastical History</i>.

            quae offerebantur acciperet, ille sollicitus suae paupertatis
            custos, fortem sententiam tenebat dicens: monachus qui in terra
            possessionem quaerit, monachus non est; quod non potest intelligi de
            inquisitione possessionum per modum proprietatis habendarum: non
            enim praemissum est, quod ei possessiones offerrentur nisi pro
            monasterii usu. Neque tamen eius sententia sic intelligenda est,
            quasi possessiones communes habentes, omnino monachorum perfectione
            deficiant, sed hoc dicebat propter periculum paupertatis amittendae,
            quod imminet plerisque monachorum communes possessiones habentium.
            Dicit enim Hieronymus in epitaphio Nepotiani ad Heliodorum
            episcopum: sunt ditiores monachi quam fuerant saeculares; possident
            opes sub Christo paupere, quas sub locuplete Diabolo non habuerant;
            suspirat eos Ecclesia divites, quos tenuit mundus ante mendicos. Et
            ideo signanter Gregorius de s. Isaac subdit: sic quippe metuebat
            paupertatis suae securitatem perdere, sicut avari divites solent
            perituras divitias custodire. Unde ad eius sanctitatem dominus
            ostendendam eum clarificavit; subdit enim Gregorius de eo ibi:
            itaque prophetiae spiritu magnisque miraculis cunctis longe lateque
            habitantibus vita eius inclaruit. Manifestum est igitur ad cumulum
            perfectionis pertinere quod aliqui possessiones non habeant nec
            proprias nec communes.

            In process of time, however, many were to enter the Church who would
            not live up to this standard of perfection. This was not to the case
            before the dispersion of the Jews, but afterwards, when the Church
            was disseminated among the Gentiles. When this state of things came
            to pass, the prelates of the Churches judged that landed property
            might advantageously be bestowed upon the churches, and this not as
            before, for the sake of the perfect, but on account of the weaker
            brethren who could not attain to the perfection of the earlier
            Christians. But there were, nevertheless, both at that time and
            later, certain men who were zealous for primitive perfection and
            who, like the monks of Egypt, gathered themselves into congregations
            and renounced all possessions. St. Gregory (<i>III Dial.</i>)
            mentions a certain holy Isaac who, coming from Syria into Italy,
            practised in the West the perfection which he had learned in the
            East. His disciples would frequently humbly beseech him to accept,
            for the use of the monastery, the property offered to him; but,
            anxious to preserve his property inviolate, he made the decisive
            reply that “a monk seeking earthly possessions is no monk.” This
            saying cannot be understood to refer to private property, since we
            are told that what was offered to Isaac, was pressed on him for the
            use of his monastery. Neither is it to be inferred that all monks
            who hold possessions in common are deficient in religious
            perfection. The words of Isaac were instigated by his fear of his
            failing in the virtue of poverty, a danger which threatens many
            religious who own property in common. For, as St. Jerome says in his
            epitaph on Nepotian to the Bishop Hehodorus, “Some men are richer as
            religious than they were as laymen. Now that they belong to Christ
            the Poor, they own wealth which they never possessed when they
            belonged to Satan the opulent; and the Church mourns over the riches
            of those whom the world formerly regarded as beggars.” Hence St.
            Gregory, speaking of St. Isaac, says, “He feared to lose the
            treasure of his poverty, just as a miser fears to lose his hoard of
            perishable wealth, and the Lord, to manifest his holiness, has
            glorified him.” For, as St. Gregory tells us farther on, “he became
            known far and wide for his spirit of prophecy and his great gift of
            miracles.” Hence it is evident that the absence of any possessions,
            either common or private, is for some men the path to sublime
            perfection.

            Adhuc potest hoc evidenter ostendi, si ratio consiliorum ad

            et possessionum cura impedit animum a rebus divinis. Dicitur enim
            Matth. XIII, 22: qui seminatus est in spinis, hic est qui verbum
            audit; et solicitudo saeculi istius et fallacia divitiarum suffocat
            verbum, et sine fructu efficitur: quod exponens Hieronymus dicit:
            blandae sunt divitiae, aliud agentes et aliud pollicentes. Lubrica
            est earum possessio; dum huc illucque circumferuntur, et instabili
            gradu vel habentes deserunt, vel non habentes reficiunt.

            We shall understand this more clearly, if we examine the motive
            underlying the counsels pertaining to evangelical perfection. These
            counsels are given in order that by their means men may be delivered
            from earthly solicitude, and thus be more free to serve God. St.
            Paul tells us as much, when he gives the council concerning
            virginity, “He who is without a wife is solicitous for the things
            that belong to the Lord, how he may please God. But he who is with a
            wife is solicitous for the things of the world, how he may please
            his wife, and he is divided” (1 Cor 7:32). Hence we we that the more
            any course of action delivers us from worldly anxiety, so much the
            more does it pertain to evangelical perfection. Now it is clear that
            the possession of wealth and property distracts the soul from divine
            things, for, to use our Lord’s, simile, “He who received the seed
            among thorns is he who hears the word, and the care of this world
            and the deceitfulness of riches chokes up the word and he becomes
            fruitless” (Mt 13:18). St. Jerome’s commentary on these words runs
            as follows: “Riches ate flatterers, promising one thing and doing
            another. Their possession is most uncertain: for when they are
            carried here and there and seem likely to endure, they desert their
            owners or rejoice those who previously possessed them not.”

            Hoc etiam evidenter ostenditur Luc. XIV, 18: ubi unus de his qui
            sunt vocati ad coenam se excusavit dicens: villam emi, et necesse
            habeo ire, et videre illam. Et, sicut Gregorius dicit, quid per
            villam nisi terrena substantia designatur? Exit ergo videre illam
            qui sola exteriora cogitat. In fine autem parabolae subditur:
            pauperes et debiles introduc huc: quod exponens Ambrosius, dicit,
            quod rarius delinquit cui deest illecebra peccandi, et citius ad

            patet quod possessiones et quascumque divitias omnino non habere,
            magis ad evangelicam perfectionem pertineat. Item Augustinus dicit
            in Lib. de verbis domini: minimi Christi sunt illi qui omnia sua
            dimiserunt, et secuti sunt eum, et quidquid habuerunt, pauperibus

            ab oneribus mundi liberatos, velut pennatos, sursum humeros
            tollerent. Hi sunt minimi, quia humiles. Appende minimos istos, et
            grave pondus invenies. Nullus autem sani capitis dicet, ad mundi
            onera non pertinere communium possessionum curam.

            The same thing is taught us in the parable of the supper (Luke
            14:18), where one of the invited guests is represented as excusing
            himself from attendance by the words, “I have bought a farm, and I
            must go out and see it.” “What,” asks St, Gregory, “are we to
            understand by this farm except material possessions? That man then
            goes out to we his farm who thinks of nothing but exterior things.”
            At the end of the parable the master of the supper says to his
            servants, “Bring in here the poor and the feeble.” Commenting on
            which, St. Ambrose observes that “he who lacks the enjoyments of
            sin, sins more rarely; and he who has no worldly pleasures is more
            easily converted to God.” Thus we see that the entire absence of
            property and wealth of any kind leads to evangelical perfection. St.
            Augustine likewise says in his book
            <i>De verbis Domini</i>, “The little ones of Christ are those who
            have renounced all things and have followed Him, All that they had,
            they have given to the poor, in order to serve God free from any
            earthly tie. Being thus delivered from the burdens of the world,
            they soar upwards as if on wings. They are little because they are
            humble; but weigh them, and you will find them very heavy.” Now no
            sane person can say that the care of common property is not a
            worldly care. Therefore, it adds to their perfection when men serve
            God freed from such shackles.

            Hence we see that those who teach that the renunciation of common
            property for the love of Christ does not pertain to perfection, are
            inculcating a most dangerous error, and spreading an opinion
            completely at variance with Christian doctrine. The Gloss on the
            verse of Psalm 6, “Let them be turned back, and shamed very
            speedily,” says, “This fate does not befall the sinner in this world
            where, on the contrary, the workers of iniquity mock and put to the
            blush the little ones of Christ who have renounced all things for
            his sake.” Rather do the following words of Psalm 13:6 seem to apply
            to them: “You have confounded the counsel of the poor man, but the
            Lord is his hope.” The Gloss thus comments on this verse, “The needy
            is a member of Christ; and you have acted thus towards him because
            the Lord is his hope.” That very reason which ought to make you
            revere him only causes you so much the more to despise him. For what
            else do these men do save endeavour to contemn those who follow in
            its perfection the counsel of Christian poverty? And why do they
            despise them, except because their hope is established not in
            possessions, but in God?

            habitura, sicut Augustinus dicit super Ioannem. Unde si qua sit

            AFTER what has been already premised, it will be easy to answer the
            objections of those who maintain an opinion contrary to ours, and
            who hold that it is expedient to own property in common. It is
            certainly well to do so, for the sake of those who are not capable
            of that height of perfection practised by the faithful of the early
            Church, among whom, however, the imperfect were not wholly
            neglected. Thus, although they who followed sublime perfection did
            not own any property, yet even our Lord, to whom the angels
            ministered, kept a purse for the necessities of others, and because
            His Church was to possess funds, as St. Augustine says in his
            commentary on St. John’s Gospel. Therefore, if there is any
            congregation of which every member aspires to the highest
            perfection, it is expedient for such a congregation to own no
            possessions.

            weakness of the monks of his time, mitigated in certain particulars
            the rigour of the monastic life as it was ordained by earlier
            Fathers. The same remark applies to St. Gregory, who built
            monasteries, according to the rule drawn up by St. Benedict.

            they should resemble the Apostles in “having nothing yet possessing
            all things,” He made it clear that all who should hereafter follow
            this rule would be obeying His ordinance. Those who follow the
            saints who have founded various orders are, in reality, imitating
            not those holy founders, but Christ, whose precepts they preach. Our
            adversaries are either deceived on another point, or else they try
            to mislead us. Christ did not establish an order of bishops, or
            other clerics who were to own property, either in common or
            individually. He established such an order, indeed, but established
            it in perfect poverty. Later on, however, possessions were accepted
            by the Church in order, as we have seen, to be distributed by her.

            As for the fifth assertion, viz. that Christian perfection has been
            in abeyance from the time of the Apostles until our own days, it is
            certain, on the contrary that far from being in abeyance, Christian
            perfection has flourished vigorously, both in Egypt and in other
            parts of the world. No man can set limits to God, or say that He is
            to draw all men to Himself at the same time, or in the same place;
            rather, according to the wisdom whereby He disposes all things
            sweetly, He provides at divers seasons the aids to man’s salvation
            peculiarly befitting those times. Has Christian teaching failed from
            the days of the masters and the doctors, Athanasius, Basil, Ambrose,
            Augustine, and the rest, until our times, in which men are even
            better instructed than they formerly were in Christian doctrine? Is
            it, according to the views of out opponents, unlawful to set again
            in motion any good work which for a while has been interrupted? If
            such be the case, it would be unlawful to suffer martyrdom or to
            work miracles, since both these good works have, for a time, been in
            abeyance.

            otium non solum per laborem manuum tollitur, sed multo melius per
            sacrae Scripturae studium, quod otium habet magnum negotium, sicut
            Augustinus dicit: unde super illud: defecerunt oculi mei etc., dicit
            Glossa: non est otiosus qui verbo Dei tantum studet; nec pluris est
            qui extra operatur, quam qui studium cognoscendae divinitatis
            exercet. Ipsa etiam sapientia maximum opus est.

            The sixth argument, viz. that those who possessed no common property
            used to live by the work of their hands, is a calumny against others
            as well against religious; for the Apostle who preached the Gospel
            maintained himself by manual labour. Is it a sin, then, for Bishops,
            Archdeacons and all who are officially bound to preach the Gospel
            not to live by the work of their hands? If they are not bound thus
            to maintain themselves, because St. Paul laboured not out of
            necessity, but as a work of supererogation, why should that work be
            enforced upon religious, which was only supererogatory with the holy
            Fathers? No one can fulfil all works of supererogation; for one
            thing is superfluous in one man, and another in another man. But,
            granted that it is not supererogatory, but necessary that they who
            own no common property should live by the work of their hands, that
            necessity only extends to such labour as may prevent idleness. But
            idleness is prevented, not only by manual labour, but far more by
            the study of Holy Scripture; such idleness performs a great work, as
            St. Augustine says. And the Gloss on the words of Ps 48, “My eyes
            have failed” etc., says, “He is not idle who only studies the word
            of God; neither does he accomplish more who performs external work
            than he who exercises himself in the knowledge of divinity. For
            wisdom is of all works the greatest.”

            Idleness is also prevented by the warfare which we wage against the
            enemies of the Faith, according to St. Paul’s injunction: “Labour
            like a good soldier of Jesus Christ (2 Tim 2:3). This the Gloss
            interprets to mean the preaching of the Gospel against the enemies
            of the Faith. This I acknowledge to be a necessary work, for those
            who have not otherwise a means of subsistence. For it is lawful for
            all preachers of the Gospel, even Monks, to live by the Gospel and
            by their ministry at the Altar. St. Augustine in
            <i>De opere monachorum</i> asks whether it is permissible for Monks
            to have any common property, save what they gain by their own
            labour. Is it not ridiculous to say that religious may receive large
            possessions as alms, and yet may not accept donations to provide for
            their simple daily needs? Therefore no necessity constrains those
            who do not possess common property to labour with their hands. We
            have, however, elsewhere spoken more fully on this point.

            be busied are such as concern the spiritual welfare of their
            benefactors, or their consolation when they are in trouble. Such
            solicitude is a work of charity by no means incompatible with
            religion. For, as St. James says, “Religion pure and undefiled
            before God and the Father is this, to visit the orphan and the widow
            in their tribulation” (1:27).

            necessities by those who have the management of such things.
