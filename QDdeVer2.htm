          <td>1. That which is had by an addition to another cannot be found in a most simple being, and God is most simple. Therefore, since knowledge is had by an addition to the essence—for life adds something to the act of existence and knowledge adds something to life—it seems that knowledge is not in God.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed dicebat, quod scientia in Deo supra essentiam non addit; sed nomine scientiae alia perfectio ostenditur in ipso quam nomine essentiae.- Sed contra, perfectio est nomen rei. Sed omnino una res est in Deo scientia et essentia. Ergo eadem perfectio ostenditur nomine scientiae et essentiae.
          <td>2. The answer was given that knowledge does not add anything to God’s essence, since <i>knowledge</i> merely indicates a perfection God has that is not indicated by <i>essence.—</i> On the contrary, <i>perfection</i> is the name of a thing. But in God, essence and knowledge are absolutely one thing. The same perfection, therefore, is indicated by both words, <i>essence</i> and <i>knowledge.</i>
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, nullum nomen potest dici de Deo quod non significat totam perfectionem ipsius: quia si non significat totam, nihil ipsius significat, cum in Deo non inveniatur pars; et sic ei attribui non potest. Sed nomen scientiae non repraesentat totam perfectionem divinam, quia Deus est supra omne nomen quod nominatur, ut dicitur in Lib. de causis. Ergo scientia Deo attribui non potest.
          <td>3. No noun can be used of God which does not signify the entire divine perfection; for if it does not signify His entire perfection, it signifies nothing about Him, since parts are not found in God and cannot be attributed to Him. Now, <i>knowledge</i> does not represent His entire perfection, for God “is above all names which name Him,” as is stated in <i>The Causes.</i> Therefore, knowledge cannot be attributed to Him.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, scientia est habitus conclusionis, intellectus vero habitus principiorum, ut patet per philosophum in VI Ethic. Sed Deus non cognoscit aliquid per modum conclusionis: quia sic discurreret a principiis in conclusiones eius intellectus: quod etiam ab Angelis Dionysius removet VII cap. de divinis nominibus; ergo scientia non est in Deo.
          <td>4. Moreover, science is the habit of conclusions, and understanding, the habit of principles—as is clear from what the Philosopher says. But God does not know anything as a conclusion: for this would mean that His intellect would proceed from premises to conclusions, though, as Dionysius has shown, this is not true even for the angels. Hence, science is not in God.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, omne quod scitur, scitur per aliquid magis notum. Sed Deo non est aliquid magis et minus notum. Ergo in Deo scientia esse non potest.
          <td>5. Whatever is known scientifically is known through something more known. For God, however, there is not anything more known or less known. Therefore, scientific knowledge cannot be in God.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, Algazel dicit, quod scientia est sigillatio scibilis in intellectu scientis. Sed sigillatio omnino a Deo removetur; tum quia importat receptionem, tum quia importat compositionem. Ergo Deo scientia attribui non potest.
          <td>6. Algazel says that knowledge is an impression of the known in the intellect of the knower. But an impression is entirely alien to God, for it implies receptivity and composition. Therefore, knowledge cannot be attributed to God.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, nihil quod sonat in imperfectionem, Deo potest attribui. Sed scientia sonat in imperfectionem: quia significatur ut habitus vel actus primus, et considerare ut actus secundus, ut dicitur in II de anima. Actus autem primus est imperfectus respectu secundi, cum sit in potentia respectu eiusdem. Ergo scientia in Deo inveniri non potest.
          <td>7. Nothing implying imperfection can be attributed to God. But knowledge implies imperfection, for it is regarded as a habit or first act—the operation of considering being regarded as second act, as is stated in <i>The Soul</i> . But a first act is imperfect with respect to the second since it is in potency to the second. Therefore, knowledge cannot be in God.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed dicebat, quod in Deo non est scientia nisi actu.- Sed contra, scientia Dei est causa rerum. Sed scientia, si Deo attribuitur, ab aeterno in eo fuit. Si ergo scientia in Deo non fuit nisi in actu, ab aeterno res produxit in esse; quod est falsum.
          <td>8. The answer was that there is only actual knowledge in God.—On the contrary, God’s knowledge is the cause of things. Therefore, if knowledge is attributed to God, it existed eternally in Him; and if only actual knowledge is in God, He produced things from all eternity. This is false.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, in quocumque invenitur aliquid respondens ei quod nos concipimus ex nomine scientiae in intellectu, scimus de eo non solum quia est, sed etiam quid est, quia scientia aliquid est. Sed de Deo non possumus scire quid est, sed quia est tantum, ut Damascenus dicit. Ergo conceptioni intellectus quam exprimit nomen scientiae, nihil respondet in Deo; ergo scientia non est in eo.
          <td>9. Whenever there is anything which corresponds to the concept we have of the word <i>knowledge,</i> of it we know not only that it is but also what it is, for knowledge is a distinct reality. But, as Damascene says,” we cannot know what God is, but only that He is. Therefore, in God there is nothing corresponding to our concept expressed by <i>knowledge.</i> Knowledge, therefore, does not exist in God.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, Augustinus dicit, quod Deus, qui subterfugit omnem formam, intellectui pervius esse non potest. Sed scientia est quaedam forma, quam intellectus concipit. Ergo hanc formam Deus subterfugit; non ergo scientia est in Deo.
          <td>10. Augustine states that God is not accessible to the intellect since He eludes every form. But knowledge is a form which the intellect conceives. Hence, God also eludes this form, and so there cannot be knowledge in God.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, intelligere est simplicius quam scire, et dignius. Sed, sicut dicitur in Lib. de causis, cum dicimus Deum intelligentem, vel intelligentiam, non nominamus eum nomine proprio, sed nomine causati sui primi. Ergo multo fortius nomen scientiae Deo competere non potest.
          <td>11. To understand is more simple and of greater dignity than to know. But as stated in <i>The Causes</i> , when we say that God understands or is an intelligence, we are not naming Him with a proper noun but “with the name of His first effect.” Much less, then, can we use <i>knowledge</i> of God.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, qualitas maiorem compositionem importat quam quantitas, quia qualitas non inhaeret substantiae nisi mediante quantitate. Sed Deo non attribuimus aliquid quod sit in genere quantitatis, propter suam simplicitatem; omne enim quantum habet partes. Ergo, cum scientia sit in genere qualitatis, nullo modo debet ei attribui.
          <td>12. Quality implies a greater composition than quantity does, for quality inheres in a substance by means of quantity. We do not attribute anything of the genus of quantity to God because of His simplicity, for everything quantified has parts. Hence, since knowledge is in the genus of quality, it cannot be attributed to God.

          <td>Est quod dicitur Rom. XI, 33: o altitudo divitiarum sapientiae, et scientiae Dei et cetera.
          <td>11. The Epistle to the Romans (11:33) says: “O the depth of the riches of the wisdom and of the knowledge of God!”
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, secundum Anselmum in Monologio, omne quod simpliciter in omni melius est esse, quam non esse, Deo est attribuendum. Sed scientia est huiusmodi; ergo est Deo attribuenda.
          <td>2. According to Anselm, we must attribute to God everything which in each thing it is better absolutely to have than not to have. Since knowledge is a perfection of this kind, it must be attributed to God.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, ad scientiam non requiruntur nisi tria: scilicet potentia activa cognoscentis, qua de rebus iudicat, res cognita, et unio utriusque. Sed in Deo est summa potentia activa, et sua essentia est summe cognoscibilis, et per consequens est ibi unio utriusque. Ergo Deus est summe sciens. Probatio mediae. Ut dicitur in Lib. de intelligentiis, prima substantia est lux. Sed lux maxime habet virtutem activam, quod patet ex hoc quod seipsam diffundit et multiplicat; est etiam maxime cognoscibilis, unde et alia manifestat. Ergo substantia prima, quae Deus est, et habet potentiam activam ad cognoscendum, et est cognoscibilis.
          <td>3. Only three things are required for knowledge: an active power in the knower by which he judges about things, a thing known, and the union of both. But in God there is the most active power possible and an essence that is most knowable; consequently, there is a union of both. God, therefore, knows in the highest degree. Our proof of the minor premise is drawn from the fact mentioned in <i>The Intelligences,</i> namely: “The first substance is light.” But light has active power most of all, as is shown from its diffusion and multiplication. It is, besides, highly knowable and, because of this, also makes other things known. Therefore, the first substance, God, has an active power to know and is Himself also knowable.

        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicendum, quod ab omnibus scientia Deo attribuitur; diversimode tamen. Quidam enim suo intellectu modum creatae scientiae transcendere non valentes, crediderunt quod scientia sit in Deo quasi aliqua dispositio addita essentiae eius, sicut et in nobis est; quod est omnino erroneum et absurdum. Hoc enim posito, Deus summe simplex non esset; esset enim in eo compositio substantiae et accidentis; nec iterum ipse Deus esset suum esse: quia, ut dicit Boetius in libro de hebdomadibus, quod est, participare aliquo potest, sed ipsum esse nullo modo aliquo participat. Si ergo Deus participaret scientiam quasi dispositionem adiunctam, ipse non esset suum esse, et ita ab alio esse haberet, quod esset sibi causa essendi; et sic non esset Deus.
          <td>All attribute knowledge to God, but in different ways. Some, not being able by their own intellectual power to go beyond the manner of created knowledge, have believed that knowledge is in God like some sort of disposition added to His essence, as is the case with us. This is quite absurd and erroneous. For, if it were true, God would not be absolutely simple. There would be in Him a composition of substance and accident, and, further, God would not be His own act of existence; for, as Boethius says: “What exists can share in something else, but existence itself in no way shares in anything else.” If God shared in knowledge as if it were a state added to His essence, He would not be His own act of existence, and, thus, He would have His origin from another who would be the cause of His existence. In short, He would not be God.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et ideo alii dixerunt, quod per hoc quod Deo scientiam attribuimus, vel aliquid huiusmodi, nihil in eo ponimus; sed significamus eum esse causam scientiae in rebus creatis: ut ex hoc dicatur Deus sciens, quia scientiam creaturis infundit. Sed quamvis haec possit esse aliqua ratio veritatis huius propositionis, qua dicitur: Deus est sciens, quia scientiam causat, ut Origenes et Augustinus dicere videntur; non tamen potest esse tota ratio veritatis, propter duo. Primo, quia eadem ratione de Deo praedicari posset quidquid in rebus causat, ut diceretur moveri, quia causat motum in rebus; quod tamen non dicitur. Secundo, quia ea quae dicuntur de causatis et causis, non ex hoc causis inesse dicuntur scilicet propter causata; sed magis causatis insunt propter hoc quod inveniuntur in causis: sicut ex hoc quod ignis est calidus, caliditatem aeri influit, et non e converso. Et similiter Deus ex hoc quod naturam scientificam habet, scientiam nobis infundit, et non e converso.
          <td>For this reason others have asserted that, when we attribute knowledge or something of the same sort to God, we postulate nothing positive in Him but merely designate Him as the cause of knowledge in created things. In other words, God is said to be a knower merely because He communicates knowledge to creatures. Although a partial reason for the truth of the proposition “God is a knower” may be that He causes truth (and Origen and Augustine seem to say this), it is not the whole truth for two reasons. First, by the same reasoning we should have to predicate of God whatever He causes in creatures, and so we should have to say that He moves since He causes motion in things. This, of course, cannot be said. Second, those attributes which are predicated of both causes and effects are not said to be in the causes because of the effects. Rather, they are said to be in the effects because they are found in the causes. For example, because fire is hot, it induces heat into the air. The converse is not true. Similarly, because the nature of God is to have knowledge, He communicates knowledge to us, and not the other way about.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et ideo alii dixerunt, quod scientia et alia huiusmodi attribuuntur Deo per quamdam similitudinem proportionis, sicut attribuitur ei ira vel misericordia, aut huiusmodi ceterae passiones. Dicitur enim Deus iratus, in quantum facit effectum similem irato; quia punit, quod est effectus irae in nobis, quamvis in Deo passio irae esse non possit. Similiter dicunt, quod Deus dicitur sciens, quia effectum facit similem effectui scientis: sicut enim opera scientis procedunt ex determinatis principiis ad determinatos fines, ita opera naturae, quae divinitus fiunt, ut patet in II Physic. Sed secundum hanc opinionem, scientia attribueretur Deo metaphorice, sicut et ira, et cetera huiusmodi; quod dictis Dionysii et aliorum sanctorum repugnat.
          <td>Still others have said that knowledge and the like are attributed to God in a certain proportionate likeness, as anger, mercy, and similar passions are attributed to Him. For God is said to be angry in so far as He does something similar to what an angry man does, for He punishes. In us, this is the effect of anger. Properly speaking, of course, the passion of anger cannot be in God. In the same way, they say, God is said to be a knower because His effects resemble those of a knowing agent. For example, the works of one who has scientific knowledge proceed from determined principles to determined ends, and so do the divinely originated works of nature—as is clear from the <i>Physics.</i> But, according to this view, knowledge is attributed merely metaphorically to God, as are anger and other like things—an opinion contrary to the words of Dionysius”I and other saints.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et ideo aliter dicendum est, quod scientia Deo attributa, significat aliquid quod in Deo est, et similiter vita et essentia et cetera huiusmodi; nec differunt quantum ad rem significatam, sed solum quantum ad modum intelligendi. Eadem enim res penitus in Deo est essentia, vita, scientia et quidquid huiusmodi de ipso dicitur; sed intellectus noster diversas conceptiones habet intelligens in eo vitam, scientiam, et huiusmodi. Nec tamen istae conceptiones sunt falsae; conceptio enim intellectus nostri secundum hoc vera est, prout repraesentat per quamdam assimilationem rem intellectam; alias enim falsa esset, si nihil subesset in re.
          <td>Consequently, one must give another answer and say that, when knowledge is attributed to God, it signifies something which is in Him. The same is true of life, essence, and the like. These attributes do not differ as regards the reality which is signified, but only in our manner of understanding them. For God’s essence, life, knowledge, and whatever else of this sort that may be predicated of Him are all the same; but in understanding essence, life, and so forth in His regard, our intellect has different concepts for each. This does not mean that these concepts are false; for our intellectual conceptions are true inasmuch as they actually represent the thing known by a certain process of assimilation. Otherwise they would be false, that is, if they corresponded to nothing.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Intellectus autem noster non hoc modo potest repraesentare per assimilationem Deum sicut repraesentat creaturas. Cum enim intelligit aliquam creaturam, concipit formam quamdam, quae est similitudo rei secundum totam perfectionem ipsius, et sic definit res intellectas; sed quia Deus in infinitum nostrum intellectum excedit, non potest forma per intellectum nostrum concepta repraesentare divinam essentiam complete, sed habet aliquam modicam imitationem eius; sicut etiam videmus in rebus quae sunt extra animam, quod quaelibet res imitatur aliquo modo Deum, sed imperfecte; unde et diversae res diversimode Deum imitantur, et secundum diversas formas repraesentant unam simplicem Dei formam, quia in illa forma perfecte unitur quidquid perfectionis distinctim et multipliciter in creaturis invenitur; sicut etiam omnes proprietates numerorum in unitate quodammodo praeexistunt, et omnes potestates ministrorum in regno aliquo uniuntur in potestate regis. Sed si esset aliqua res perfecte repraesentans Deum, non esset nisi una tantum, quia uno modo repraesentaret, et secundum unam formam; et ideo non est nisi unus filius, qui est perfecta imago patris.
          <td>Our intellect, however, cannot represent God in the same way that it represents creatures; for, when it knows a creature, it conceives a certain form which is the likeness of the thing according to its entire perfection; and in this manner defines the things understood. But since God infinitely exceeds the power of our intellect, any form we conceive cannot completely represent the divine essence, but merely has, in some small measure, an imitation of it. Similarly, extra-mental realities imitate it somewhat, but imperfectly. Hence, all different things imitate God in different ways; and, according to different forms, they represent the one simple form of God, since in His form are found perfectly united all the perfections that arc found, distinct and multiple, among creatures. This is like the properties of numbers, which all, in a certain sense, pre-exist in unity, and like all the individual authorities of royal officials, which are all united in the authority of the king. If there were anything that could perfectly represent God, that thing would be unique, for it would represent Him in one way and according to one form. For this reason, there is in God only one Son, who is the perfect image of the Father.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Similiter etiam intellectus noster secundum diversas conceptiones repraesentat divinam perfectionem, quia unaquaeque imperfecta est; si enim perfecta esset, esset una tantum, sicut est unum tantum verbum intellectus divini. Sunt ergo plures conceptiones in intellectu nostro repraesentantes essentiam divinam; unde essentia divina unicuique illarum respondet sicut res suae imagini imperfectae; et sic omnes illae conceptiones intellectus sunt verae, quamvis sint plures de re una (re). Et quia nomina non significant res nisi mediante intellectu, ut dicitur in I Periher.; ideo imponit plura nomina uni rei secundum diversos modos intelligendi, vel secundum diversas rationes, quod idem est; quibus tamen omnibus respondet aliquid in re.
          <td>Accordingly, our intellect represents the divine perfection by means of different conceptions, for each one of them is imperfect. If one were perfect, it would be the only one, just as there is only one Word in the divine intellect. There are, therefore, many conceptions in our intellect that represent the divine essence, and the divine intellect corresponds to each one of these as a thing corresponds to an imperfect image of itself. Thus, even though we have several intellectual conceptions about one thing, they are all true. Moreover, since names do not signify things without the mediation of the intellect, as is pointed out in <i>Interpretation,”</i> the intellect applies several names to one thing according to the different ways in which it understands it, or (what comes to the same thing) according to different formal aspects. To all of these, however, there corresponds something in reality.

          <td>1. Knowledge is not had by an addition to being, except in so far as our intellect grasps someone’s knowledge and essence as distinct; for addition presupposes distinction. In God, knowledge and essence are not really distinct, as is clear from our discussion. They are merely conceived in this way.

          <td>2. One cannot correctly say that knowledge in God signifies a perfection other than His essence. It is merely signified as though it were another perfection, since our intellect applies to Him the names referred to from the different concepts we have of Him.

          <td>Ad tertium dicendum, quod cum nomina sint signa intellectuum: secundum hoc se habet aliquod nomen ad totalitatem alicuius rei significandam, secundum quod se habet intellectus in intelligendo. Intellectus autem noster totum Deum intelligere potest sed non totaliter, totum quidem quia necesse est ut de ipso aut totum intelligatur, aut nihil, cum in eo non sit pars et totum; sed dico, non totaliter, quia non perfecte cognoscit ipsum, secundum quod ipse est in sui natura cognoscibilis; sicut ille qui hanc conclusionem diameter est asimeter costae, cognoscit probabiliter, ex hoc scilicet quod ab omnibus ita dicitur, non cognoscit eam totaliter, quia non pervenit ad perfectum modum cognitionis quo cognoscibilis est: quamvis totam cognoscat, nullam partem eius ignorans. Similiter ergo et nomina quae de Deo dicuntur, ipsum totum, sed non totaliter significant.
          <td>3. Since names represent concepts, a name signifies the totality of a thing in direct proportion to the intellect’s understanding of it. Our intellect can understand the whole of God, but not wholly. With God, one must know the whole or nothing at all, since in Him there is no question of part and whole. I say “not wholly,” however, since the intellect does not know Him perfectly in so far as He is knowable by His very nature. Thus, our knowledge is like that of a man who knows with probability the conclusion, “The diameter is asymmetric to the side,” merely because all men assert it. He does not know this conclusion wholly, since he does not arrive at the perfect manner of knowing with which it is capable of being grasped. Yet he knows the entire conclusion and is ignorant of no part of it. So, too, the names which are applied to God signify the whole God, but not wholly.

          <td>Ad quartum dicendum, quod quia illud quod in Deo est absque omni imperfectione, in creaturis cum aliquo defectu invenitur; propter hoc oportet ut si aliquid in creaturis inventum Deo attribuamus, separemus totum quod ad imperfectionem pertinet, ut solum maneat hoc quod perfectionis est, quia secundum hoc tantum creatura Deum imitatur. Dico igitur, quod scientia quae in nobis invenitur, habet quidem aliquid perfectionis, et aliquid imperfectionis. Ad perfectionem quidem eius pertinet certitudo ipsius, quia quod scitur, certitudinaliter cognoscitur; sed ad imperfectionem pertinet discursus intellectus a principiis in conclusiones, quarum est scientia; hic enim discursus non contingit nisi secundum quod intellectus cognoscens principia, cognoscit conclusiones in potentia tantum; si enim actu cognosceret, non esset ibi discursus; cum motus non sit nisi exitus de potentia ad actum. Dicitur igitur in Deo scientia ratione certitudinis de rebus cognitis, non autem ratione discursus praedicti, qui etiam nec in Angelis invenitur, ut Dionysius dicit.
          <td>4. What is in God without imperfection is found with some defect in creatures. Hence, if we attribute to God something found in creatures, we must entirely remove everything that smacks of imperfection so that only what is perfect will remain; for it is only according to its perfection that a creature imitates God. I point out, therefore, that our scientific knowledge contains both some perfection and some imperfection. Its certitude pertains to its perfection, for what is known scientifically is known with certainty. To its imperfection belongs its progression from principles to the conclusions contained in that science; for this progression happens only because the intellect, in knowing the premises, knows the conclusions only potentially. If it actually knew the conclusions, there would be no need of it to go further, since motion is simply the passage from potency to act. Knowledge is said to be in God, therefore, because of its certitude about things known, but not because of the progression mentioned above, for, as Dionysius says, this is not found even in angels.

          <td>Ad quintum dicendum, quod quamvis Deo non sit aliquid magis et minus notum si consideretur modus cognoscentis, quia eodem intuitu omnia videt, tamen si consideretur modus rei cognitae, Deus cognoscit quaedam esse magis cognoscibilia in seipsis et quaedam minus; sicut inter omnia maxime est cognoscibilis sua essentia, per quam quidem omnia cognoscit, non quidem aliquo discursu, cum simul videndo essentiam suam omnia videat. Unde etiam quantum ad istum ordinem qui potest attendi in divina cognitione ex parte cognitorum, etiam salvatur in Deo ratio scientiae; ipse enim praecipue omnia per causam cognoscit.
          <td>5. If we take into consideration the manner proper to God as a knower, there is nothing more known or less known in God, because He sees all with the same intuition. If we consider the condition of the things known, however, He knows some to be more knowable in themselves and some less knowable; for example, of all the things He knows, the most knowable is His own essence, through which He knows everything—not by a progression, however, since by seeing His essence He simultaneously sees all things. If this order of things known in the divine cognition is considered, the notion of science can also be verified in God, for He knows all things principally in their Cause.

          <td>6. That statement of Algazel is to be understood of our knowledge, which is acquired by the impression upon our souls of the likenesses of things. The opposite is true of God’s cognition, for it is from His intellect that forms flow into creatures. Our knowledge is the impressing of things in our souls; but the forms of things are the impressing of the divine knowledge in things.

          <td>8. Effects proceed from acting causes according to the condition of the causes. Hence, every effect which proceeds by reason of knowledge follows the determination of that knowledge, which limits its conditions. Therefore, the things which have God’s knowledge as their cause proceed only when it has been determined by God that they shall proceed. Consequently, it is not necessary that things actually exist from eternity, even though God’s knowledge is actual from all eternity.

          <td>9. The intellect is said to know what a thing is when it defines that thing, that is, when it conceives some form of the thing which corresponds to it in all respects. From our previous discussion, it is clear that whatever our intellect conceives of God falls short of being a representation of Him. Consequently, the quiddity of God Himself remains forever hidden from us. The most we can know of God during our present life is that He transcends everything that we can conceive of Him—as is clear from Dionysius.

          <td>11. As is said in the <i>Metaphysics</i> : “An intelligible character signified by a noun is a definition. Hence, the name of a thing is proper if its meaning is its definition. Now, since no intelligible character signified by a name defines God Himself, no name we apply to God is proper to Him. It is proper rather to the creature defined by the character signified by the name. These names, though the names of creatures, are attributed to God, however, in so far as a likeness of Him is found in some way in creatures.

Ergo oportet quod in Deo scitum sit distinctum personaliter a sciente. Sed distinctio personarum in divinis non patitur reciprocam locutionem; non enim pater dicitur se genuisse, quia genuit filium. Ergo in Deo concedi non debet quod cognoscat seipsum.
          <td>1. A knower is related to the thing known because of his knowledge. Now, as Boethius says: “The essence accounts for the divine unity, and the relations account for the multiplicity of the Trinity of Persons.”’ In God, therefore, the thing known must be personally distinct from the knower. Furthermore, the distinction of Persons in God will not permit a reciprocal predication—the Father is not said to have generated Himself because He generated the Son. Consequently, we cannot grant that God knows Himself.

          <td>2. In <i>The Causes</i> we read: “Everyone knowing his own essence returns to it by a complete return. But God does not return to His essence, since He never leaves it; and there cannot be a return if there has been no departure. God, therefore, does not know His own essence and does not know Himself.

Nihil autem potest comprehendi nisi finitum, ut patet per Augustinum ex eodem loco. Ergo Deus non intelligit se.
          <td>5. If God knew Himself scientifically, He would understand Himself, since understanding is more simple than scientific knowledge and, for this reason, is the more to be attributed to God. But God does not understand Himself; hence, He does not know Himself scientifically. Proof of the minor premise: Augustine says: “Whatever understands itself comprehends itself. However, only finite being can be comprehended, as Augustine clearly shows in the same passage. Therefore, God does not understand Himself.

Ergo non vult sibi esse notus; ergo non cognoscit se.
          <td>6. Augustine argues as follows: “Our intellect does not wish to be infinite (although it is able so to wish), since it desires to know itself.” Hence, what wishes to know itself does not wish to be infinite. But God wishes to be infinite, since He is infinite; for, if He were something He did not wish to be, He would not be supremely happy. Consequently, He does not wish to be known to Himself and, hence, does not know Himself.

Sed, sicut probatum est in VI Physic., infinitum non potest transiri neque a finito neque ab infinito. Ergo Deus, quamvis sit infinitus, non potest sibi ipsi esse finitus.
          <td>7. The answer was given that, although God is simply infinite and wills to be such, He is not, however, infinite but finite to Himself, and so does not will that He be infinite.—On the contrary, as is pointed out in the <i>Physics</i> , something is said to be infinite if it is untraversable, finite if it is traversable. But, as is proved in the <i>Physics</i> , the infinite cannot be traversed by means of either a finite or another infinite being. Therefore, although God is infinite, He cannot be finite to Himself.

          <td>9. God knows Himself only in so far as He enters into a relation with Himself. Therefore, if He were finite to Himself, He would know Himself in a finite manner; but, since He is infinite, He would be knowing Himself other than He is and, consequently, have false knowledge of Himself.

          <td>11. St. Augustine proves that one Person cannot understand a thing more than another can. He argues as follows: “Whoever knows a thing otherwise than as it is, is deceived, and anyone who is deceived about a thing does not understand it. Hence, whoever understands anything otherwise than as it is does not understand it; for nothing can be understood in any other way than as it is.” Since a thing exists in one manner, it is known in one manner by all. Hence, no one understands a thing more than another does. Therefore, if God were to understand Himself, He would not understand Himself more than others understand Him. Thus, in some respect a creature would be equal to his Creator; this, however, would be absurd.

          <td>Note, therefore, that a thing is perfect in two ways. First, it is perfect with respect to the perfection of its act of existence, which belongs to it according to its own species. But, since the specific act of existence of one thing is distinct from the specific act of existence of another, in every created thing of this kind, the perfection falls short of absolute perfection to the extent that that perfection is found in other species. Consequently, the perfection of each individual thing considered in itself is imperfect, being a part of the perfection of the entire universe, which arises from the sum total of the perfections of all individual things.

Et secundum hunc modum possibile est ut in una re totius universi perfectio existat. Unde haec est ultima perfectio ad quam anima potest pervenire, secundum philosophos, ut in ea describatur totus ordo universi, et causarum eius; in quo etiam finem ultimum hominis posuerunt, quod secundum nos, erit in visione Dei, quia secundum Gregorium, quid est quod non videant qui videntem omnia vident? Perfectio autem unius rei in altero esse non potest secundum determinatum esse quod habebat in re illa; et ideo ad hoc quod nata sit esse in re altera, oportet eam considerari absque his quae nata sunt eam determinare. Et quia formae et perfectiones rerum per materiam determinantur, inde est quod secundum hoc aliqua res est cognoscibilis secundum quod a materia separatur. Unde oportet ut et illud in quo suscipitur talis rei perfectio, sit immateriale; si enim esset materiale, perfectio recepta esset in eo secundum aliquod esse determinatum; et ita non esset in eo secundum quod est cognoscibilis; scilicet ut, existens perfectio unius, est nata esse in altero.
          <td>In order that there might be some remedy for this imperfection, another kind of perfection is to be found in created things. It consists in this, that the perfection belonging to one thing is found in another. This is the perfection of a knower in so far as he knows; for something is known by a knower by reason of the fact that the thing known is, in some fashion, in the possession of the knower. Hence, it is said in <i>The Soul</i> that the soul is, “in some manner, all things,” since its nature is such that it can know all things. In this way it is possible for the perfection of the entire universe to exist in one thing. The ultimate perfection which the soul can attain, therefore, is, according to the philosophers, to have delineated in it the entire order and causes of the universe. This they held to be the ultimate end of man. We, however, hold that it consists in the vision of God; for, as Gregory says: “What is there that they do not see who see Him who sees all things?” Moreover, the perfection of one thing cannot be in another according to the determined act of existence which it has in the thing itself. Hence, if we wish to consider it in so far as it can be in another, we must consider it apart from those things which determine it by their very nature. Now, since forms and perfections of things are made determinate by matter, a thing is knowable in so far as it is separated from matter For this reason, the subject in which these perfections are received must be immaterial; for, if it were material, the perfection would be received in it according to a determinate act of existence. It would, accordingly, not be in the intellect in a state in which it is knowable, that is, in the way in which the perfection of one thing can be in another.

Putaverunt enim quod perfectio rei cognitae in cognoscente esse debeat secundum quod habet esse determinatum in propria natura. Non autem ita recipitur forma rei cognitae in cognoscente; unde et Commentator dicit in III de anima, quod non idem est modus receptionis quo formae recipiuntur in intellectu possibili et in materia prima; quia oportet in intellectu cognoscente recipi aliquid immaterialiter.
          <td>Hence, those ancient philosophers erred who asserted that like is known by like, meaning by this that the soul, which knows all things, is materially constituted of all things: its earth knows the earth, its water knows water, and so forth. They thought that the perfection of the thing known had the same determined act of existence in the knower as it had in its own nature. But the form of the thing known is not received in this way in the knower. As the Commentator remarks, forms are not received in the possible intellect in the same way in which they are received in first matter, for a thing must be received by a knowing intellect in an immaterial way.

Et quia secundum hoc Deus est secundum quod natura sua est sibi; secundum hoc etiam cognoscit secundum quod natura sua est sibi maxime cognoscitivo; unde Avicenna dicit in VIII suae metaphysicae, quod ipse est intellector et apprehensor sui eo quod sua quidditas spoliata, scilicet a materia, est rei quae est ipsemet.
          <td>Since God, being entirely free of all potentiality, is at the extreme of separation from matter, it follows that He is most knowing and most knowable. It follows, too, that the knowability of His nature is directly proportioned to the act of existence which it exercises. Finally, because God is by reason of the fact that He possesses His own nature, it follows that God knows to the extent that He possesses His nature as one most knowing. For this reason Avicenna says: “He Himself knows and apprehends Himself because His own quiddity, being completely stripped (that is, of matter), is that of a thing perfectly identified with Himself.”

A real relation demands two terms.

          <td>Ad secundum dicendum, quod locutio haec qua dicitur, quod sciens se, ad essentiam suam redit, est locutio metaphorica; non enim in intelligendo est motus, ut probatur in VII physicorum. Unde nec, proprie loquendo, est ibi recessus aut reditus; sed pro tanto dicitur ibi esse processus vel motus, in quantum ex uno cognoscibili pervenitur ad aliud; et quidem in nobis fit per quemdam discursum, secundum quem est exitus et reditus in animam nostram, dum cognoscit seipsam. Primo enim actus ab ipsa exiens terminatur ad obiectum; et deinde reflectitur super actum; et demum supra potentiam et essentiam, secundum quod actus cognoscuntur ex obiectis, et potentiae per actus. Sed in divina cognitione non est aliquis discursus, ut prius dictum est, quasi per notum in ignotum deveniat. Nihilominus tamen ex parte cognoscibilium potest quidam circuitus in eius cognitione inveniri; dum scilicet cognoscens essentiam suam res alias intuetur, in quibus suae essentiae similitudinem videt, et sic quodammodo ad suam essentiam redit, non quasi suam essentiam ex rebus aliis cognoscens, sicut in nostra anima accidebat.<br>
          Sed tamen sciendum, quod reditio ad essentiam suam in libro de causis nihil aliud dicitur nisi subsistentia rei in seipsa. Formae enim in se non subsistentes, sunt super aliud effusae et nullatenus ad seipsas collectae; sed formae in se subsistentes ita ad res alias effunduntur, eas perficiendo, vel eis influendo, quod in seipsis per se manent; et secundum hunc modum Deus maxime ad essentiam suam redit, quia omnibus providens, ac per hoc in omnia quodammodo exiens et procedens, in seipso fixus et immixtus ceteris permanet.
          <td>2. The dictum stating that one who knows himself returns to his essence is metaphorical. For, as shown in the <i>Physics</i> , there is no motion in intellection, and hence, properly speaking, no departure or return. Intellection is said to be a progression or movement to the extent that in it one passes from one thing known to another. In us, this takes place by a sort of discourse; and so, when the soul knows itself, there is a departure from the soul and a return to it. For the act, going out from the soul, first terminates in the object. Then one reflects upon the act, and finally upon the power and the essence, in so far as acts are known from their object, and powers by their acts. In divine cognition, however, there is, as was pointed out above, no progression from the known to the unknown. Nevertheless, from the point of view of the thing known, one can find a certain cycle in God’s knowledge; for in knowing His own essence He beholds all other things, and in these things He sees a likeness of His own essence. Hence, in some way He may be said to return to His own essence—not, however, in the sense that He knows His essence only from other things, as is the case with our soul.<br>
          Note, however, that in <i>The Causes</i> the return to one’s own essence is called the very subsistence of a thing in itself; for non-subsistent forms are, as it were, poured out upon something other than themselves, and are not in possession of themselves. But subsistent forms reach out to other things, perfecting them and influencing them—in such a way, however, that they still retain their immanence and self-possession. In this way, God returns to His essence in the highest degree, for He provides for all, and, because of this providence, in a sense He goes forth and out into all things, although in Himself He remains unmoved and uncontaminated by anything else.

          <td>4. A universal is intelligible in direct proportion to its separation from matter. Hence, those things which have not been separated from matter by an act of our intellect but are, in themselves, free from all matter, are most knowable.

Unde si debeat cognosci secundum rationem suae infinitatis, ut scilicet pars post partem cognoscatur, nullo modo poterit comprehendi, quia numquam poterit veniri ad finem, cum finem non habeat. Sed Deus dicitur infinitus negative, quia scilicet eius essentia per aliquid non limitatur. Omnis enim forma in aliquo recepta terminatur secundum modum recipientis; unde, cum esse divinum non sit in aliquo receptum, quia ipse est suum esse, secundum hoc esse suum non est finitum, et pro tanto dicitur eius essentia infinita.<br>
          Et quia in quolibet intellectu creato vis cognoscitiva finita est, cum sit in aliquo recepta; non potest intellectus noster pervenire ad cognoscendum ipsum ita clare sicut cognoscibilis est: et secundum hoc non potest ipsum comprehendere, quia non pervenit ad finem cognitionis in ipso, quod est comprehendere, ut supra dictum est. Sed quia eodem modo quo essentia divina est infinita, et vis cognoscitiva ipsius est infinita; sua cognitio est tantum efficax quanta est eius essentia, et ideo pervenit ad perfectam sui cognitionem; et secundum hoc se comprehendere dicitur, non quia per comprehensionem talem ipsi cognito finis aliquis statuatur; sed propter perfectionem cognitionis cui nihil deest.
          <td>5. God knows, understands, and comprehends Himself, although, absolutely speaking, He is infinite. He is not infinite privatively—as a quantity is infinite, having part after part <i>ad infinitum.</i> If such an infinite had to be known according to the formal character of its infinity, one could never comprehend it; one could never come to its end, for it does not have an end. But God is said to be negatively infinite since His essence is not limited by anything. Now, every form received in a subject is limited according to the capacity of the subject; but since the divine act of existence is not received in a subject, for He is His own act of existence, His act of existence is infinite and, for that very reason, His essence is said to be infinite.<br>
          The knowing power of every created intellect is finite, since it is received in some subject. Consequently, our intellect cannot come to know God as clearly as He is capable of being known. Accordingly, our intellect cannot comprehend Him, for it cannot attain that fullness of knowledge which is the meaning of <i>comprehend,</i> as was mentioned above. But the divine essence and its knowing power possess the same infinity, and God’s knowledge is just as powerful as His essence is great. Consequently, He attains a perfect knowledge of Himself and is thus said to have comprehensive knowledge—not because such comprehension imposes some limits on the thing known, but rather because the knowledge is perfect and there is nothing lacking to it.

          <td>6. Since our intellect is finite in its nature, it cannot comprehend or perfectly understand anything infinite. Augustine’s reasoning proceeded on the assumption of this limited nature. The nature of the divine intellect, however, is different; so the argument does not follow.

Illa tamen ratio infiniti qua dicitur intransibile, est infiniti privative accepti, de quo nihil ad propositum.
          <td>7. If the word God, properly speaking, is given its full meaning, He is finite neither to Himself nor to others. He is said to be finite to Himself merely because He knows Himself as a finite intellect knows a finite thing; for, just as a finite intellect can attain a complete knowledge of a finite thing, so the divine intellect can have a complete knowledge of God Himself. But that characteristic of the infinite by which its end can never be reached is proper to a privative infinite. But this is entirely beside the point.

Sed in illis quae pertinent ad imperfectionem, non sequitur: non enim sequitur si aliquid, Deo comparatum, sit parvum, quod simpliciter sit parvum; quia omnia Deo comparata nihil sunt, et tamen simpliciter non nihil sunt. Unde quod est bonum Deo comparatum, simpliciter bonum est; sed quod est finitum Deo, non sequitur simpliciter finitum esse; quia finitum ad quamdam imperfectionem pertinet; sed bonum ad perfectionem; in utrisque tamen aliquid simpliciter est tale, quod secundum iudicium divinum tale invenitur.
          <td>8. In regard to those perfections which involve quantity, if anything in reference to God has a certain attribute, the consequence is that it has that attribute absolutely. Thus, whatever is great in reference to God is, as a consequence, simply great. But in regard to those terms which involve imperfection, the same thing does not follow. If, for instance, something is small in comparison with God, it is not necessarily, as a consequence, small absolutely. All things are, indeed, nothing in comparison with God, yet they are not absolutely nothing. What is good in the sight of God, therefore, is good absolutely; but it does not follow that what is finite for God is finite absolutely, because <i>finite</i> involves imperfection, but <i>good</i> expresses a perfection. In either case, however, anything which is found in the divine judgment to have a certain Attribute has that attribute absolutely.

Alio modo ut modus referatur ad cognoscentem, et sic adhuc dupliciter potest intelligi: uno modo ut ly finite nihil aliud sit quam perfecte; ut dicatur finite cognoscere, quia pervenit ad finem cognitionis; et sic Deus seipsum finite cognoscit; alio modo ut ly finite pertineat ad efficaciam cognitionis; et secundum hoc se infinite cognoscit, quia eius cognitio est in infinitum efficax.

          <td>9. The statement, “God knows Himself limitedly,” can be understood in two ways. In the first way, <i>limitedly</i> is applied to the thing known, so that God would know Himself to be limited. In this sense the statement is incorrect, for then God’s knowledge would be false. In the second way, <i>limitedly</i> is applied to the knower. Then, two interpretations are possible. Either <i>limitedly</i> means perfectly, so that the knower is said to know limitedly whose knowledge attains its end and, in this sense, God actually does know Himself “limitedly”; or <i>limitedly</i> pertains to the efficacy of cognition—and in this sense God knows Himself, not limitedly, but infinitely, for the extent of the power of His cognition is the infinite itself. However, from the fact that He is finite to himself in the manner described, one cannot conclude that His knowledge of Himself is limited, except in the sense in which this was said to be true.

Alio modo potest referri ad modum cognoscentis; et sic unus alio plus intelligit, secundum quod unus alio perspicacius intelligit, sicut Angelus homine, et Deus Angelo, et hoc propter potentiorem vim intelligendi. Et similiter etiam est distinguenda illa quae ad hoc probandum assumitur, scilicet intelligere rem aliter quam sit; si enim ly aliter sit modus rei cognitae, tunc nullus intelligens intelligit rem aliter quam sit, quia hoc esset intelligere rem esse aliter quam sit; si autem sit modus cognoscentis, sic quilibet intelligens rem materialem, intelligit aliter quam sit; quia res quae habet esse materialiter, immaterialiter solum intelligitur.
          <td>11. The statement that one person can understand more than another may be taken in two ways. In the first, the word <i>more</i> refers primarily to the thing known. In this sense, no one of those who understand understands more than another of the thing understood, provided that it is understood; for whoever attributes more or less to the thing known than is in the nature of the thing is in error and does not, properly speaking, understand. But the word more can also be taken as referring to the manner in which one knows. In this sense, one understands more than another because he understands more clearly—as an angel understands more clearly than a man, and God more than an angel, because of a greater power of understanding. We must similarly distinguish another phrase assumed in this proof, that is, “to know a thing other than as it is.” For, if the word <i>other</i> refers primarily to the thing known, then no one who understands knows a thing other than it is; for this would be to understand it to be in some other way than it is. If the word other, however, refers to the manner by which one knows, then everyone who understands a material thing knows it other than it is, because a thing having a material act of existence is understood only in an immaterial way.

If it knows it through some extrinsic medium, then, since every medium of knowing is a perfection of the knower, because it is his form as knower (as is evident of the species of a stone in the pupil of the eye), it would follow that something extrinsic to God would be one of His perfections. But this is absurd. On the other hand, if He knows a creature through His own essence, since His essence is something distinct from the creature, it will follow that from knowing one thing He will know another. Now, every intellect that knows one thing from another is one which discourses and reasons. Consequently, there is discursive thought in the divine intellect, and, therefore, imperfection.

Omne enim quod naturaliter in alterum tendit, oportet quod hoc habeat ex aliquo dirigente ipsum in finem; alias casu in illud tenderet. In rebus autem naturalibus invenimus naturalem appetitum, quo unaquaeque res in finem suum tendit; unde oportet supra omnes res naturales ponere aliquem intellectum, qui res naturales ad suos fines ordinaverit, et eis naturalem inclinationem sive appetitum indiderit. Sed res non potest ordinari ad finem aliquem, nisi res ipsa cognoscatur simul cum fine ad quem ordinanda est; unde oportet quod in intellectu divino a quo rerum naturae origo provenit et naturalis ordo in rebus, sit naturalium rerum cognitio; et hanc probationem innuit Ps. XCIII, 9, cum dixit: qui finxit oculum, non considerat? Ut Rabbi Moyses dicit quod idem est ac si diceret: qui oculum fecit sic proportionatum ad suum finem, qui est eius actus, scilicet visio, nonne considerat oculi naturam? Sed oportet videre ulterius per quem modum creaturas cognoscit.
          <td>Undoubtedly, it must be granted that God knows not only Himself but also all other things. This can be proved in the following manner. Whatever naturally tends toward another must have this tendency from someone directing it toward its end; otherwise, it would tend toward it merely by chance. Now, in the things of nature we find a natural appetite by which each and every thing tends toward its end. Hence, we must affirm the existence of some intellect above natural things, which has ordained natural things to their end and implanted in them a natural appetite or inclination. But a thing cannot be ordained to any end unless the thing itself is known, together with the end to which it is ordained. Hence, there must be a knowledge of natural things in the divine intellect from which the origin and the order of nature come. The Psalmist suggests this proof when he says: “He that formed the eye, doth he not consider?” (Psalms 93:9); for, as Rabbi Moses points out, it is as if the Psalmist had said: “Does He not consider the nature of the eye—who has made it to be proportioned to its end, which is its act of seeing?”“ But now we must further consider the manner by which He knows creatures.

          <td>It should be understood, therefore, that, since every agent acts to the extent that it is in act, that which is effected by the agent must in some way exist in the agent. This is the reason why every agent causes something similar to itself. Now, whatever is in another is in it according to the manner of the recipient. Hence, if the active principle is material, the effect is in it somehow materially, because it is, as it were, in a material power.

Consequently, active material principles do not know their effects, because these latter do not exist in them in a manner in which they could be known; but in immaterial active principles the effects are present in a manner in which they are knowable, since they are there immaterially. Therefore, every immaterial active principle knows its own effect. This is why it is said in <i>The Causes</i> : “An intelligence knows what is below it in so far as it is its cause.” Therefore, since God is the immaterial active principle of things, it follows that in Him there is knowledge of things.

          <td>Ad primum igitur dicendum, quod intellectum non est perfectio intelligentis secundum illam rem quae cognoscitur (res enim illa est extra intelligentem), sed secundum rei similitudinem qua cognoscitur, quia perfectio est in perfecto; lapis autem non est in anima, sed similitudo lapidis. Sed similitudo rei intellectae est in intellectu dupliciter: quandoque quidem ut aliud ab ipso intelligente; quandoque vero ut ipsa intelligentis essentia; sicut intellectus noster cognoscendo seipsum cognoscit alios intellectus, in quantum ipse est similitudo aliorum intellectuum; sed similitudo lapidis in ipso existens, non est ipsa essentia intellectus, immo recipitur in eo sicut forma quasi in materia. Haec autem forma, quae est aliud ab intellectu, quandoque quidem comparatur ad rem cuius est similitudo, ut causa eius: sicut patet in intellectu practico, cuius forma est causa rei operatae; quandoque autem est effectus rei, sicut patet in intellectu nostro speculativo accipiente cognitionem a rebus.<br>
          Quandocumque ergo intellectus cognoscit rem aliquam per similitudinem quae non est intelligentis essentia, tunc intellectus perficitur aliquo alio a se; sed si illa similitudo sit causa rei, perficietur tantum similitudine, et nullo modo re cuius est similitudo, sicut domus non est perfectio artis, sed magis e converso. Si autem sit effectus rei: tunc res etiam erit quodammodo perfectio intellectus active scilicet, similitudo vero eius formaliter. Cum vero similitudo rei cognitae est ipsa intelligentis essentia, non perficitur per aliud a se, nisi forte active; utpote si eius essentia sit ab alio effecta. Et quia intellectus divinus non habet scientiam causatam a rebus; nec similitudo rei, per quam cognoscit res, est aliud quam sua essentia, nec essentia sua est ab alio causata; nullo modo, ex hoc quod cognoscit res alias, sequitur quod eius intellectus sit ab alio perfectus.
          <td>1. The known is a perfection of the knower, not by its substance (for the thing is outside the knower), but rather by the likeness by which it is known; for a perfection exists in the perfected—and the likeness of the stone, not the stone, exists in the soul. Now, the likeness of the thing known exists in the intellect in two ways: sometimes as something other than the knower himself, at other times as the very essence of the knower. For example, our intellect, by knowing itself, knows other intellects in so far as it is itself a likeness of other intellects; but the likeness of a stone in the intellect is not the very essence of intellect; in fact, this likeness is received somewhat as a form is received in matter. Now, this form, which is other than the intellect, is sometimes the cause of the thing whose likeness it is. We have an evident example of this in the practical intellect, whose form is the cause of the thing done. But sometimes this form is the effect of the thing, as is clearly the case with our speculative intellect when it receives its knowledge from things.<br>
          Therefore, whenever an intellect knows a thing through a likeness which is not the essence of the knower, then the intellect is perfected by something other than itself; but if that likeness should happen to he the cause of the tiling, in that case the intellect will be perfected only by the likeness, and not at all by the thing whose likeness it is. For example, a house is not the perfection of the artistic conception, but rather the contrary. On the other hand, if the likeness is caused by the thing, then the perfection of the intellect will be, as it were, the thing in an active sense, but its likeness in a formal sense. However, when the likeness of the thing known is the very essence of the knower, the intellect is not perfected by something other than itself, except, perhaps, actively, as would be the case if its essence were produced by another. But because the knowledge of the divine intellect is not caused by things and neither the likeness by which it knows the thing nor its own essence is caused by another, it by no means follows from the fact that God knows things other than Himself that His intellect is perfected by something else.

          <td>Ad tertium dicendum, quod Deus hoc modo cognoscit creaturas secundum quod sunt in ipso. Effectus autem in quacumque causa efficiente existens non est aliud ab ipsa, si accipiatur illud quod est per se causa; sicut domus in arte, non est aliud quam ipsa ars; quia secundum hoc effectus est in principio activo, quod principium activum assimilat sibi effectum; hoc autem est ex hoc ipso quo agit; unde si aliquod principium activum agat per suam formam tantum, secundum hoc est effectus eius in eo quod habet formam illam, nec effectus eius in eo erit distinctus a forma sua. Similiter nec in Deo, cum agat per suam essentiam, effectus eius in eo est distinctus ab essentia sua, sed omnino unum; et ideo hoc quo cognoscit effectum, non est aliud quam essentia sua.<br>
          Nec tamen sequitur quod cognoscendo effectum per hoc quod essentiam suam cognoscit, sit aliquis discursus in intellectu eius. Tunc enim solum dicitur intellectus de uno in aliud discurrere, quando diversa apprehensione utrumque apprehendit; sicut intellectus humanus alio actu apprehendit causam et effectum, et ideo effectum per causas cognoscens dicitur de causa discurrere in effectum. Quando vero non alio actu fertur potentia cognoscitiva in medium quo cognoscit, et in rem cognitam, tunc non est aliquis discursus in cognitione; sicut visus cognoscens lapidem per speciem lapidis in ipso existentem vel rem quae resultat in speculo per speculum, non dicitur discurrere; quia idem est ei ferri in similitudinem rei, et in rem quae per talem similitudinem cognoscitur. Hoc autem modo Deus per essentiam suam effectus suos cognoscit, sicut per similitudinem rei cognoscitur res ipsa; et ideo una cognitione se et alia cognoscit, ut etiam Dionysius dicit VII cap. de divinis nominibus sic dicens: non igitur Deus propriam habet sui ipsius cognitionem aliam autem communem existentia omnia comprehendentem; et ideo nullus discursus est in eius intellectu.
          <td>3. The manner in which God knows creatures is by their existence within Himself. An effect existing in any efficient cause whatsoever is not other than that cause if there is question of a thing which is a cause in itself. For example, a house existing in the conception of the artist is not other than that conception itself; for an effect is in an active principle simply inasmuch as the active principle produces an effect similar to itself, and this active principle is the very thing by which the artist acts. Consequently, if some active principle acts only through its form, its effect is in it in so far as it has that form, and its effect will not exist in the principle as something distinct from its form. Similarly, since God acts through His essence, His effect is not in Him as something distinct from His essence; but it is entirely one with it. Therefore, His knowledge of an effect is not distinct from His own essence.<br>
          Nevertheless, from the fact that He knows His effect by knowing His own essence, it does not follow that there is any discursive reasoning in His intellect; for an intellect is said to reason from one thing to another only if it apprehends each by distinct apprehensions. Thus, the human intellect apprehends a cause and an effect by distinct acts; and since it knows an effect through its cause, it is said to reason from the cause to the effect. When, however, the knowing power is directed by the same act to the medium by which it knows and to the thing known, then there is no discursive process in knowing. For example, when sight knows a stone by means of the species of stone in this sense, or when it knows by means of a mirror a thing reflected in the mirror, it is not said to reason discursively; for to be directed to the likeness of a thing is the same as to be directed to the thing which is known through this likeness. It is in this manner that God knows His effects through His essence—just as a thing is known through its likeness. Therefore, with one cognition He knows Himself and other things. Dionysius agrees when he speaks as follows: “God does not have a proper knowledge of Himself and another general knowledge that comprehends all existing things.” Consequently, there is no discourse in God’s intellect.

Et secundum hunc modum oportet esse proportionatum medium ei quod per ipsum cognoscitur; ut, scilicet, sicut se habet medium ad aliquid demonstrandum, ita se habeat quod per ipsum cognoscitur ad hoc quod demonstretur; et sic nihil prohibet essentiam divinam esse medium quo creatura cognoscatur.
          <td>4. A thing is said to be proportionate to another in two ways. In one way, a proportion is noted between the two things. For example, we say that four is proportioned to two since its proportion to two is double. In the second way, they are proportioned as by a proportionality. For example, we say that six and eight are proportionate because, just as six is the double of three, so eight is the double of four; for proportionality is a similarity of proportions. Now, since in every proportion a relation is noted between those things that are said to be proportioned because of some definite excess of one over the other, it is impossible for any infinite to be proportionate to a finite by way of proportion. When, however, things are said to be proportionate by way of proportionality, their relation to each other is not considered. All that is considered is the similarity of the relation of two things to two other things. Thus, nothing prevents an infinite from being proportionate to an infinite; for, just as a particular finite is equal to a certain finite, so an infinite is equal to another infinite. In this way, there should be a medium that is proportionate to that which is known by the medium. Consequently, just as the medium is related to the act of demonstrating, so that which is known through the medium is related to the act of being demonstrated. Thus, nothing prevents the divine essence from being the medium by which a creature is known.

          <td>Ad quintum dicendum, quod aliquid intelligitur dupliciter: uno modo in seipso, quando scilicet ex ipsa re intellecta vel cognita formatur acies intuentis; alio modo videtur aliquid in altero, quo cognito et illud cognoscitur. Deus ergo seipsum tantum cognoscit in seipso, alia vero in seipsis cognoscit, sed cognoscendo suam essentiam; et secundum hoc philosophus dixit, quod Deus tantum seipsum cognoscit; cui etiam consonat Dionysii dictum in VII cap. de divinis nominibus; Deus, inquit, existentia cognoscit, non scientia quae sit existentium, sed quae sit sui ipsius.
          <td>5. A thing is understood intellectually in two ways. First, it is understood in itself, as happens when the regard of the beholder is shaped directly by the thing itself, which is understood or known. Second, a thing is seen in something else; and, when this latter is known, it itself is known. God, therefore, knows only Himself in Himself; but He does not know other things in themselves except by knowing His own essence. This is what the Philosopher meant when he said that God knows only Himself; and the following statement of Dionysius is quite in agreement: “God knows things that come to be, not by a knowledge of such things, but by His knowledge of Himself.”

          <td>Ad sextum dicendum, quod si ratio cognitionis accipiatur ex parte cognoscentis, Deus eadem ratione se cognoscit et alia; quia et idem cognoscens, et idem cognitionis actus, et idem medium est cognoscendi. Si autem accipiatur ratio ex parte rei cognitae, sic non eadem ratione se cognoscit et alia, quia non est eadem habitudo sui et aliorum ad medium quo cognoscit; quia ipse illi medio est idem per essentiam, res autem aliae per assimilationem; tantum et ideo seipsum cognoscit per essentiam, alia vero per similitudinem; idem tamen est quod eius est essentia, et aliorum similitudo.
          <td>6. If the formal aspect under which knowledge occurs is considered here from the point of view of the knower, then God knows Himself and other things under the same formal aspect; for the knower, the act of knowing, and the medium of knowing are all the same. But, if we consider the formal aspect from the point of view of the thing known, then He does not know Himself and other things under the same formal aspect; for the relation of Himself and of other things to the medium by which He knows is not the same; for He is the same as that medium by His essence, while other things are “the same” as the medium merely because of their resemblance to it. Therefore, He knows Himself through His essence, but other things through a likeness. However, that which is His essence and that which is the likeness of other things is the same reality.

          <td>Ad septimum dicendum, quod ex parte cognoscentis, omnino eadem cognitione cognoscit Deus se esse Deum et se esse patrem; sed non est idem quo cognoscit ex parte cogniti; cognoscit enim se esse Deum deitate, et se esse patrem paternitate, quae secundum modum intelligendi non idem est quod deitas, quamvis realiter unum sit.
          <td>7. If we consider the knower, it is entirely true that God knows that He is God and that He is the Father by the same act of knowing. But He does not know both by the same act of knowing if we consider that which is known; for He knows that He is God by the Godhead, and that He is the Father by His paternity. This latter, according to our manner of understanding, is not the same as the Godhead, although they are one in reality.

          <td>8. If we consider only the thing known, that which is the principle of its existence is also the principle of its being known, because a thing is knowable by means of its principles. But if we consider the knower, then that by which a thing is known is a likeness of the thing or of its principles. This likeness is not a principle of the existence of the thing, except in practical knowledge.

          <td>Ad nonum dicendum, quod similitudo aliquorum duorum ad invicem potest dupliciter attendi. Uno modo secundum convenientiam in natura; et talis similitudo non requiritur inter cognoscens et cognitum; immo videmus quandoque quod, quanto talis similitudo est minor, tanto cognitio est perspicacior; sicut minor est similitudo similitudinis quae est in intellectu ad lapidem, quam illius quae est in sensu, cum sit magis a materia remota; et tamen intellectus perspicacius cognoscit quam sensus.<br>
          Alio modo quantum ad repraesentationem; et haec similitudo requiritur cognoscentis ad cognitum. Quamvis igitur sit minima similitudo creaturae ad Deum secundum convenientiam in natura; est tamen maxima similitudo secundum hoc quod expressissime divina essentia repraesentat creaturam; et ideo intellectus divinus optime rem cognoscit.
          <td>9. There are two ways of considering the mutual likeness between two things. First, we can consider them inasmuch as they agree in a common nature. Such a likeness between the knower and the known is not required; indeed, we sometimes see that the smaller the likeness, the sharper the cognition. For example, there is less resemblance between the intellectual likeness of a stone and the stone than there is between the sense likeness and the stone, for the intellectual likeness is farther removed from matter; yet the intellect knows more profoundly than sense.<br>
          Secondly, the likeness between two things can be considered from the point of view of representation. Such a likeness of the knower to the thing known is necessary. Therefore, although there is the least possible likeness between a creature and God in regard to agreement in nature, there is, on the other hand, the greatest possible likeness between them inasmuch as the divine essence most clearly represents the creature. Consequently, the divine intellect knows a thing most perfectly.

          <td>Ad decimum dicendum, quod cum dicitur quod Deus nihil extra se intuetur; intelligendum est sicut in quo intueatur, non sicut quod intueatur; illud enim in quo omnia intuetur, in ipso est.
          <td>10. The statement that God beholds nothing outside Himself should be taken as referring to that <i>in which</i> God beholds, not to that which He beholds; for that in which He beholds all things is Himself.

Similiter etiam est et de Deo; non enim aliquid Deo deperit, si eius creatura ponatur non esse; deperit tamen perfectioni ipsius, si auferatur ab eo potestas producendi creaturam. Non autem cognoscit res solum secundum quod sunt in actu, sed etiam secundum quod sunt in potentia eius.
          <td>11. Although a line loses none of its quantity if an actual point is taken from it, if we take from a line its essential property of terminating in a point, the very substance of the line perishes. The same principle is also true of God; for, while nothing will be detracted from God if a creature of His is supposed as not existing, His perfection will be destroyed if His power of producing a creature is taken from Him. For He knows things, not only inasmuch as they actually exist, but also inasmuch as they are within His power.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad duodecimum dicendum, quod quamvis cognitio non sit nisi entis, non tamen oportet ut illud quod cognoscitur, sit tunc ens in sui natura quando cognoscitur; sicut enim cognoscimus distantia loco, ita cognoscimus distantia tempore, ut patet de praeteritis; et ideo non est inconveniens, si cognitio Dei ponatur aeterna de rebus non aeternis.
          <td>12. Although knowledge has only being for its object, it is not necessary that what is known should be a real being at the time in which it is known; for, just as we know things that are distant in place, we also know things distant in time, as is evident from our knowledge of things past. Hence, it is not inconsistent to affirm a knowledge of God that is about things that are not eternal.

          <td>13. The word <i>perfection,</i> if taken strictly, cannot be used of God, for nothing is perfected unless it is made. <i>Perfection,</i> however, is used more negatively of God than positively. Hence, He is said to be perfect because nothing at all is lacking to Him, not because there is something in Him which was in potency to perfection and is perfected by something else which is its act. Consequently, there is no passive potency in God.

          <td>14. What is understood or sensed moves the sense or intellect only if the sense knowledge or intellectual knowledge is received from things. Divine cognition is not of this kind; hence, the argument does not follow.

Hoc autem est secundum quod facit similitudinem suam in ipso, qua intellectus operatio informatur. Unde patet quod res quae intelligitur, non est causa delectationis in intellectu nisi quando cognitio intellectus a rebus accipitur; quod non est in intellectu divino.
          <td>15. According to the Philosopher, the delight of the intellect arises from its agreeable operation. Hence, he says: “God delights in one simple operation.” Therefore, the object of the intellect is the cause of intellectual delight in so far as it is the cause of an intellectual operation; and it is this in so far as it produces its likeness in the intellect, so that by it the activity of the intellect may be informed. Hence, it is clear that the thing which is understood causes delight in the intellect only when the intellect’s knowledge is received from things. This is not true of the divine intellect.

XIX, vers. 17: nemo bonus nisi solus Deus. Unde quantum creatura accedit ad Deum, tantum habet de esse; quantum vero ab eo recedit, tantum habet de non esse. Et quia non accedit ad Deum nisi secundum quod esse finitum participat, distat autem in infinitum; ideo dicitur quod plus habet de non esse quam de esse; et tamen illud esse quod habet, cum a Deo sit, a Deo cognoscitur.
          <td>16. The term to <i>be,</i> taken simply and absolutely, is understood only of the divine existence. This is also true of the good; and for this reason it is said in Luke (18:19): “None is good but God alone.” Hence, the more closely a creature approaches God, the more it possesses of the act of existence; the further it is from Him, the more it possesses of non-existence. But, since a creature approaches God only in so far as it participates in a finite act of existence, yet its distance from God is always infinite, it is said to have more non-existence than existence. However, since the act of existing which it has is from God, it is known by God.

          <td>18. A thing is compared to God in two ways: first, according to a common measurement, and then a creature, when compared with God, is found to be almost nothing at all; second, according to its dependence upon God, from whom it receives its act of existing. In this latter way, it is compared with God only with respect to its act of existing, and in this way, also, it cad be known by God.

          <td>Ad decimumnonum dicendum, quod verbum illud est intelligendum de intellectu nostro, qui a rebus scientiam accipit; gradatim enim res a sua materialitate ad immaterialitatem intellectus deducitur, scilicet mediante immaterialitate sensus; et ideo oportet ut quod est in intellectu nostro, prius in sensu fuerit; quod in intellectu divino locum non habet.
          <td>19. That axiom is to be understood as applying only to our intellect, which receives its knowledge from things. For a thing is led by gradual steps from its own material conditions to the immateriality of the intellect through the mediation of the immateriality of sense. Consequently, whatever is in our intellect must have previously been in the senses. This, however, does not take place in the divine intellect.

          <td>Ad vicesimum dicendum, quod quamvis agens naturale, ut Avicenna dicit, non sit causa nisi fiendi; cuius signum est quod eo destructo non cessat esse rei, sed fieri solum; agens tamen divinum quod est influens esse rebus, est omnibus rebus causa essendi, quamvis rerum constitutionem non intret; et tamen est similitudo principiorum essentialium, quae intrant rei constitutionem; et ideo non solum cognoscit fieri rei, sed esse eius, et principia essentialia ipsius.
          <td>20. It is true, as Avicenna says, that a natural agent is a cause only of becoming. This is evident from the fact that, when such a cause ceases to exist, a thing does not cease to be, but merely ceases to become. But since the divine agent imparts the act of existence to things, He is the cause of their existence, although He does not enter into their constitution. Yet He has a certain resemblance to the essential principles which enter into the constitution of a thing, and for this reason He knows not only the becoming of a thing, but also its act of existing and its essential principles.

          <td>1. As Boethius says, the object of cognition is “universal as long as it is understood, singular as long as it is sensed.”’ Now, since there is no sensitive knowledge in God, but only intellectual knowledge, God has only universal knowledge of things.

          <td>Praeterea, si Deus cognoscit creaturas, aut cognoscit eas pluribus, aut uno.

          <td>2. If God knows creatures, He knows them either by many or by one species. If He knows them by many, His knowledge as it is in the knower will be multiplied, because that by which one knows is in the knower. If He knows creatures by one species, and it is impossible to have proper and distinct knowledge of many things by means of one species, it would seem that God does not have proper knowledge of things.

          <td>Praeterea, sicut Deus est causa rerum, eo quod eis esse influit; ita ignis est causa calidorum ex hoc quod eis calorem influit.

Sed istud non est habere cognitionem propriam de rebus, sed maxime universalem. Ergo Deus non habet propriam cognitionem de rebus.
          <td>3. God is the cause of things in so far as He imparts the act of existing to them—just as fire is the cause of warm things from the fact that it pours heat into them. Now, if fire could know itself, by knowing its own heat, it would know other things only in so far as they are warm. Consequently, by knowing His own essence, God knows other things only inasmuch as they are beings. That, however, is not proper knowledge of things, but a most universal knowledge of things. Therefore, God does not have proper knowledge of things.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, cognitio propria de re aliqua haberi non potest nisi per speciem, quae nihil plus vel minus contineat quam in re sit; sicut enim viridis color imperfecte cognosceretur per speciem deficientem ab ipso, scilicet nigri, ita imperfecte cognosceretur per speciem superexcedentem, scilicet albi, in quo perfectissime natura coloris invenitur; unde et albedo est mensura omnium colorum, ut dicitur in X Metaph. Sed quantum essentia divina superat creaturam, tantum creatura deficit a Deo. Cum ergo divina essentia nullo modo proprie et complete possit cognosci mediante creatura, nec creatura poterit proprie cognosci mediante essentia divina. Sed Deus non cognoscit creaturam nisi per essentiam suam. Ergo non habet propriam cognitionem de creaturis.
          <td>4. Proper knowledge of a thing can be had only through a species which comprises nothing more or nothing less than is in the thing itself. For, just as the color green would be imperfectly known by means of a species that fell short of it,—for example, the species of black—so also would green be imperfectly known by a species that went beyond it—for example, the species of white. For in white, the nature of color is found to exist most perfectly; therefore, whiteness, as is said in the <i>Metaphysics,</i> is the measure of all colors. Now, in the measure in which God surpasses a creature, in that measure the creature falls short of God. Therefore, since the divine essence can in no way be known properly and completely by means of a creature, neither can a creature be known properly by means of the divine essence. God, however, knows creatures only through His essence. Therefore, He does not have proper knowledge of them.

          <td>5. Any medium that causes proper knowledge of a thing can be used as the middle term of a demonstration whose conclusion will be that thing. The divine essence, however, does not stand in such a relation to a creature; otherwise, creatures would exist whenever the divine essence existed. Consequently, by knowing creatures through His essence, God does not have proper knowledge of things.

Si vero cognoscit creaturam in idea: cum idea sit magis remota a re quam essentialia vel accidentalia rei, minorem cognitionem habebit de re quam illa quae est per essentialia vel accidentalia eius. Sed omnis propria cognitio de re habetur vel per essentialia vel per accidentalia eius; quia etiam accidentia magnam partem conferunt ad cognoscendum quod quid est, ut dicitur in I de anima. Ergo Deus non habet propriam cognitionem de rebus.
          <td>6. If God knows a creature, He knows it either in its own nature or in an idea. If He knows it in its own nature, then the proper nature of a creature is the means by which God knows a creature. But the medium of knowing is a perfection of the knower; hence, the-nature of a creature would be a perfection of the divine intellect. This, of course, is absurd. On the other hand, if God knows a creature in an idea, since the idea is more removed from a thing than are the essentials or accidentals of the thing, God’s knowledge of a thing will be less than that knowledge which is had through its essentials or accidentals. But all proper knowledge of a thing is had through its essential constituents or accidents, because, as is said in <i>The Soul</i> : “Even accidents contribute in a great part to our knowledge of what a things. Consequently, God does not have proper knowledge of things.

          <td>7. Proper knowledge of any particular thing cannot be had through a universal medium. For example, we cannot have proper knowledge of man by means of “animal.” But the divine essence is the most universal medium possible, since it is the universal medium for knowing all things. Therefore, God cannot have proper knowledge of creatures by means of His essence.

Ergo Deus per essentiam suam creaturas cognoscens, non habet propriam cognitionem de eis.
          <td>8. The type of knowledge is determined by its medium of knowing. Therefore, proper knowledge can be had only through a proper medium. The divine essence, however, cannot be the proper medium of knowing a particular creature, because, if it were proper to that one, it would not be the medium of knowing anything else; for what belongs to this creature and to that is common to both and not proper to either. Therefore, God does not have proper knowledge of creatures by knowing through His own essence.

          <td>Per cognitionem enim causae non cognoscitur effectus, (nisi) secundum hoc quod effectus ex ea consequitur. Unde, si sit aliqua causa universalis, cuius actio ad aliquem effectum non determinetur nisi mediante aliqua causa particulari; per cognitionem illius causae communis non habebitur propria cognitio de effectu, sed scietur in communi tantum; sicut actio solis determinatur ad productionem huius plantae mediante vi seminativa, quae est in terra vel in semine; unde si sol cognosceret seipsum, non haberet cognitionem propriam de hac planta, sed communem tantum, nisi cum hoc cognosceret propriam causam eius. Et ideo ad hoc quod habeatur propria et perfecta cognitio de aliquo effectu, oportet quod in cognoscente congregentur omnes cognitiones causarum communium et propriarum; et hoc est quod philosophus dicit in principio Physic.: tunc cognoscere dicimur unumquodque, cum causas cognoscimus primas, et principia prima usque ad elementa, id est usque ad causas proximas, ut Commentator exponit.
          <td>By knowing a cause, we know the effect only inasmuch as the effect follows from the cause. Therefore, if there is some universal cause whose action is not determined to any effect except through the intermediate action of some particular cause, from the knowledge of such a common cause we will not have proper knowledge of the effect but merely a general knowledge of it. For example, the action of the sun is determined to the production of this plant through the intermediate action of a germinating force which is either in the ground or in the seed. Consequently, if the sun could know itself, it would not have a proper knowledge of this plant but only a general knowledge, unless it also knew the proper causes of the plant. Therefore, in order to have proper and perfect knowledge of any effect, the knower must have assembled in himself complete knowledge of the proper and common causes. This is also what the Philosopher says: “We are said to know a thing when we know its first causes and its first principles down to its elements,” that is, down to its proximate causes, as the Commentator explains.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundum hoc autem aliquid in cognitione divina ponimus, secundum quod ipse per essentiam suam est causa eius; sic enim in ipso est ut cognosci possit. Unde, cum ipse sit causa omnium causarum propriarum et communium, ipse per essentiam suam cognoscit omnes causas proprias et communes, quia nihil est in re per quod determinetur eius natura communis, cuius Deus non sit causa; et ideo per quam rationem ponitur cognoscere communem naturam rerum, per eamdem ponetur cognoscere propriam naturam uniuscuiusque, et proprias causas eius. Et hanc rationem assignat Dionysius VII cap. de divinis nominibus, sic dicens: si secundum unam causam Deus omnibus existentibus esse tradidit, secundum eamdem causam sciet omnia; et infra: ipsa enim omnium causa seipsam cognoscens vacat alicubi, si ea quae sunt ab ipsa, et quorum est causa, ignoraverit. Vacare dicit deficere a causalitate alicuius quod in re invenitur; quod sequeretur, si aliquid eorum quae sunt in re, ignoraret.
          <td>Now, we say that something is known to God inasmuch as He is its cause through His essence. In this way a thing is in Him and can be known by Him. Therefore, since He is the cause of all proper and common causes, through His essence He knows all proper and common causes; for there is in a thing, determining its common nature, nothing of which God is not the cause. Consequently, the reason for His knowledge of the common nature of things is the very same as the reason for His knowledge of the proper nature and proper causes of each individual thing. Dionysius gives the same explanation when he writes: “If according to one cause God gives being to all existing things, then He knows all things according to that same cause”“—and further on: “For the cause of all, knowing itself, would be idle somewhere if it did not know those things that are from it and whose cause it is.” <i>Idle</i> here means to fall short of causing something that is found in a thing; and it would follow that God would be idle in this sense were He ignorant of any of the realities that exist in a thing.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et sic patet ex dictis, quod omnia similia quae inducuntur ad manifestandum quod Deus per se omnia cognoscit, sunt deficientia; sicut quod inducitur de puncto, qui si se cognosceret, dicitur quod lineas cognosceret; et de luce, quod cognoscendo se, cognosceret colores; non enim quidquid est in linea, potest reduci in punctum sicut in causam, nec quidquid est in colore, ad lucem; unde punctus cognoscens seipsum, non cognosceret lineam nisi in universali, similiter nec lux colorem; secus autem est de cognitione divina, ut ex dictis patet.
          <td>Thus, it is clear from what has been said that all the examples induced to show that God knows all things in Himself are faulty—like that of the point, which, if it could know itself, would (according to the example) know lines, and that of light, which, by knowing itself, would know colors. For not everything in a line can be reduced to a point as to its cause, nor can everything in color be reduced to light. Consequently, if a point knew itself, it would know the line only in a general way; and light would know color similarly. This is not the case with divine knowledge, as is clear from what has been said in the preceding article.

          <td>Ad primum igitur dicendum, quod verbum illud Boetii est intelligendum de intellectu nostro, non autem de intellectu divino, qui singularia cognoscere potest, ut infra dicetur. Et tamen intellectus noster singularia non cognoscens, propriam cognitionem habet de rebus, cognoscens eas secundum proprias rationes speciei; unde etsi etiam intellectus divinus singularia non cognosceret, nihilominus posset propriam de rebus cognitionem habere.
          <td>1. That statement of Boethius should be understood as referring to our intellect, not to the divine intellect, which can know singulars, as will be explained later.” However, even though our intellect does not know singulars, it has proper knowledge of things by knowing them according to their distinctive specific characters. Consequently, even if the divine intellect did not know singulars, it could nevertheless have proper knowledge of things.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad secundum dicendum, quod Deus cognoscit omnia uno, quod est ratio plurium, scilicet essentia sua, quae est similitudo rerum omnium; et quia essentia sua est propria ratio uniuscuiusque rei, ideo de unoquoque propriam cognitionem habet. Qualiter autem unum possit esse multorum propria ratio et communis, sic considerari potest.<br>
          Essentia enim divina secundum hoc est ratio alicuius rei, quod res illa divinam essentiam imitatur. Nulla autem res imitatur divinam essentiam ad plenum; sic enim non posset esse nisi una imitatio ipsius; nec sua essentia esset per modum istum nisi unius propria ratio, sicut una sola est imago patris perfecte eum imitans, scilicet filius. Sed quia res creata imperfecte imitatur divinam essentiam, contingit esse diversas res diversimode imitantes; in quarum tamen nulla est aliquid quod non deducatur a similitudine divinae essentiae; et ideo illud quod est proprium unicuique rei, habet in divina essentia quid imitetur; et secundum hoc divina essentia est similitudo rei quantum ad proprium ipsius rei, et sic est propria eius ratio: et eadem ratione est propria ratio alterius, et omnium aliorum. Est igitur communis omnium ratio, in quantum ipsa res est una, quam omnia imitantur: sed est propria huius ratio vel illius, secundum quod res eam diversimode imitantur: et sic propriam cognitionem divina essentia facit de unaquaque re, in quantum est propria ratio uniuscuiusque.
          <td>2. God knows all things by one principle, for that principle has the intelligible character of many. This principle is His essence, which is the likeness of all things; and since His essence is the proper intelligible character of each and every thing, He has proper knowledge of all things. How one thing can be both the proper and the common intelligible character of many things may be explained as follows.<br>
          The divine essence is the intelligible character of a thing inasmuch as that thing imitates the divine essence. No created thing, however, fully imitates the divine essence. For, if so, there would be only one such imitation, and the divine essence considered in that way would be the proper intelligible character of only one being, just as there is only one image of the Father which perfectly imitates Him, and that is the Son. However, since a created thing imperfectly imitates the divine essence, it happens that different things imitate it in different ways; yet every one of them has been produced according to a likeness of the divine essence. Thus, whatever is proper to each finds in the divine essence that which it imitates. In this respect, the divine essence is the likeness of a thing, even in regard to what is proper to it. Similarly, it is the proper intelligible character of that thing, and, for the same reason, the proper character of another thing, and also of all other things. Therefore, it is the common character of all things in so far as it is the one thing which all things imitate; but it is the proper character of this or that thing inasmuch as things imitate it in different ways. In this way the divine essence causes proper knowledge of each and every thing, for it is the proper intelligible character of all.

Et praeterea in essentia divina sunt res aliae sicut in causa; alii autem colores non sunt in albedine sicut in causa; et ideo non est simile.
          <td>4. Whiteness surpasses green with respect to one of the two things that belong to the nature of color, namely, light, which is, as it were, the formal element in the composition of color. In this respect, whiteness is the measure of all colors. But there is something else in colors which is, as it were, their material element, namely, the determination of the transparent medium. In this respect, whiteness is not the measure of colors; and thus it is clear that everything contained in the other colors does not exist in the species of whiteness. Consequently, proper knowledge of any of the other colors cannot be had through the species of whiteness. This is not the case with the divine essence. Moreover, in the divine essence, other things exist as in their cause; but other colors do not exist in whiteness as in their cause. Hence, there is no parallel.

Si quis etiam essentiam eius comprehenderet, certius per eam singulorum naturam cognosceret quam per medium demonstrationis conclusio cognoscatur. Nec tamen sequitur quod effectus Dei sint ab aeterno, propter hoc quod essentia eius est aeterna; quia effectus non sunt hoc modo in essentia ut semper in seipsis sint, sed ut quandoque sint; quando, scilicet, divina sapientia determinatur.
          <td>5. Demonstration is a type of argumentation accomplished by a discursive process of the intellect. The divine intellect, which is not discursive, does not know its effects through its essence as if by demonstration, even though it has more certain knowledge of things by means of its essence than one who demonstrates has by means of his demonstration. Besides, if anyone could comprehend God’s essence, through it he would know the nature of each individual thing with greater certainty than a conclusion is known by means of demonstration. Nevertheless, it does not follow from the fact that God’s essence is eternal that His effects are eternal; for His effects are not in His essence in such a way that they should always exist in themselves but merely that they should exist at <i>some time,</i> whenever the divine wisdom has determined.

          <td>6. God knows things in their proper nature if that restriction refers to His knowledge from the point of view of the thing known. However, if we are speaking of His knowledge on the part of the knower, then God knows things in an idea, that is, through an idea which is the likeness of all things existing in reality, both accidental and essential, although the idea itself is neither an accident nor the-essence of the thing. In the same manner, our intellectual likeness of a thing is neither essential nor accidental to the thing itself, but it nevertheless is a likeness of the thing’s essence or accident.

          <td>Ad septimum dicendum, quod essentia divina est universale medium quasi universalis causa. Alio autem modo se habet ad faciendum cognitionem rerum causa universalis, et forma universalis: in forma enim universali est effectus in potentia quasi materiali; sicut differentiae sunt in genere secundum proportionem qua formae sunt in materia, ut Porphyrius dicit: sed effectus sunt in causa in potentia activa; sicut domus est in mente artificis in potentia activa. Et quia unumquodque cognoscitur secundum quod est in actu, et non secundum quod est in potentia, ideo hoc quod differentiae specificantes genus sunt in genere in potentia, non sufficit ad hoc quod per formam generis habeatur propria cognitio de specie; sed ex hoc quod propria alicuius rei sunt in aliqua causa activa, sufficit ut per causam illam habeatur cognitio de illa re: unde per ligna et lapides non cognoscitur domus, sicut cognoscitur per formam suam, quae est in artifice. Et quia in Deo sunt propriae condiciones uniuscuiusque rei sicut in causa activa, ideo, quamvis sit universale medium, potest propriam cognitionem facere de unaquaque re.
          <td>7. The divine essence is a universal medium as though it were a universal cause. The relation of a universal cause to the production of knowledge is quite different from that of a universal form. For in a universal form the effect is, as it were, in material potency, somewhat as differences are in a genus after the analogy of forms in matter, as Porphyry says. However, effects are in a cause in an active potency, just as a house exists in the mind of the architect in active potency. Now, since everything is known in so far as it is in act, and not in so far as it is in potency, the fact that the differences specifying a genus are in it potentially does not suffice for proper knowledge of a species through the generic form. But since what is proper to a thing exists in some active cause, it is sufficient to know that thing through that cause. Consequently, a house is not known by means of its wood and stones as it is known by means of the form of it which is in the architect. Since the proper conditions of each and every thing, are in God as in its active cause, even though His essence is a universal medium, it can give proper knowledge of all things.

Si autem determinet cognitionem ex parte cogniti, sic falsa est: Deus enim cognoscit distinctionem unius rei ab alia, et cognoscit id per quod unum ab alio distinguitur; unde propriam cognitionem habet de unoquoque.
          <td>9. When it is said that “God knows distinct things indistinctly,” the statement is true if <i>indistinctly</i> qualifies the knowing from the point of view of the knower; for with one cognition God knows all things. This is how Dionysius understands the statement. On the other hand, if it qualifies the knowing in regard to what is known, the statement is false; for God knows the distinction of one thing from another, and also that by which one thing is distinguished from another. Therefore, He has proper knowledge of each and every thing.

Ergo non est aliqua ratio quod intellectus singularia non cognoscat, quia cognitionem a rebus accipit.
          <td>2. It was noted, however, that our intellect does not know singulars, not only because it is separated from matter, but also because it abstracts its knowledge from things.—On the contrary, our intellect cannot receive anything from things without the mediation of sense or imagination. Consequently, sense and imagination receive from singular things before our intellect does, yet singulars are known through sense and imagination. Hence, the fact that the intellect receives from things is no reason why it should not know singulars.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed dicebat, quod intellectus accipit a rebus formam penitus depuratam, non autem sensus et imaginatio.- Sed contra, depuratio formae in intellectu receptae non est ratio quare intellectus singularia non cognoscat ratione termini a quo; immo secundum hoc magis deberet cognoscere, quia secundum hoc totam assimilationem suam trahit, quod a re recipit. Relinquitur ergo quod depuratio formae non impedit cognitionem singularis nisi secundum terminum ad quem, qui est puritas quam in intellectu habet. Sed ista puritas formae est tantum propter immunitatem intellectus a materia. Ergo ista est sola ratio quare intellectus noster singularia non cognoscit, quia est a materia separatus; et sic habetur propositum, quod Deus singularia non cognoscat.
          <td>3. It was said, however, that from things the intellect receives a form that is entirely purified; but this is not the case with sense and imagination.—On the contrary, it is not by reason of the purifying of the form considered as a starting point that our intellect does not know singulars. Indeed, from this point of view the intellect ought to know singulars all the more, for the assimilative character of intellection comes from the fact that it has received something from reality. It remains, therefore, that what prevents knowledge of singulars is the purifying of the form considered as an end-result, which is the purity that the form has in the intellect. Now, that purity of the form is had only because of the freedom of the intellect from matter; and that is the only reason why our intellect does not know singulars, namely, be cause it is separated from matter. Thus, our point that God does not know singulars is proved.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, si Deus cognoscit singularia, oportet quod omnia cognoscat, quia eadem est ratio de uno et de omnibus. Sed non cognoscit omnia. Ergo nulla cognoscit. Probatio mediae. Sicut dicit Augustinus in Enchir., melius est multa nescire, quam scire, scilicet vilia. Sed inter singularia multa sunt vilia. Cum ergo omne quod melius est, sit Deo reponendum, videtur quod non omnia singularia cognoscat.
          <td>4. If God knows some singulars, He should know all; for the argument for one is the same as the argument for all. But He does not know all singulars. Therefore, He knows none. The proof of the minor premise is as follows: “Many things,” as Augustine says, meaning despicable things, “it is better not to know than to know.”’ But many singulars are worthless. Since everything which is better should always be attributed to God, it seems that He does not know all singulars.

          <td>5. All knowledge takes place through an assimilation of the knower with what is known. But there is no assimilation between singulars and God, for singulars are changeable and material, and have many other qualities of this sort, whose complete contraries are in God. Therefore, God does not know singulars.

          <td>6. Whatever God knows, He knows perfectly. But perfect knowledge is not had of a thing unless it is known in the same way as it exists. Now, since God does not know a singular in the same way as it exists, for a singular is material, and God knows immaterially, it seems that God cannot know the singular perfectly, and consequently does not know it at all.

          <td>Sed dicebat, quod perfecta cognitio requirit ut cognoscens cognoscat rem eo modo quo est, ut modus accipiatur ex parte cogniti; non autem si accipiatur ex parte cognoscentis.- Sed contra, cognitio fit per applicationem cogniti ad cognoscentem. Ergo oportet quod idem sit modus cogniti et cognoscentis; et sic praedicta distinctio nulla videtur.
          <td>7. But it was said that while perfect knowledge demands that the knower know the thing just as it is, this refers only to what is known, not to the operation of the knower.—On the contrary, knowledge arises from the application of the thing known to the knower. Therefore, the mode of what is known and the mode of the knower should be the same. Thus, the distinction given seems to be invalid.

Si igitur Deus debet cognoscere aliquod singulare, oportet quod forma communis per quam cognoscit, scilicet essentia sua, per aliquid contrahatur. Cum ergo non sit aliquid in ipso per quod contrahi possit, videtur quod ipse singularia non cognoscat.
          <td>8. According to the Philosopher, if one wishes to find something, he must previously have some knowledge of it. What he has through some common form is not sufficient, unless that form is contracted by something. For example, one could not well look for a slave he has lost unless he had previously had some knowledge of the slave, otherwise he would not recognize him even when he found him; nor would it be enough to know that the slave was a man, because this would not mark him off from others. He must, instead, have some knowledge particularized by the points that are proper to the slave. Consequently, if God is to know any singular, the common form by which He knows, His essence, must be contracted by something. But since there is nothing in Him by which it can be contracted, it seems that He does not know singulars.

          <td>9. It was said, however, that that species through which God knows is common in such a way that it nevertheless is proper to each and every thing.—On the contrary, <i>proper</i> and common are opposed to each other. Therefore, it is impossible that the same reality be both a proper and a common form.

Ergo cognitio eius nullo modo determinatur ad aliquod singulare; et sic singularia non cognoscit.
          <td>10. The operation of sight is not determined to any one colored thing because of light, which is the medium of sight; it is determined rather by the object, the colored thing itself. But in God’s knowledge, His essence is the medium by which He knows things; for His essence is, as it were, a medium of knowledge, and, as Dionysius says, like a light by which all things are known. Consequently, His knowledge is in no way determined to any singular; thus, He does not know singulars.

          <td>Praeterea, scientia, cum sit qualitas, est talis forma per cuius variationem mutatur subiectum.

Ergo singularia, quae sunt variabilia, ab eo scita esse non possunt.
          <td>11. Since knowledge is a quality, it is a form whose variations change the subject. But knowledge is changed as its objects are changed; for example, if I know that you are sitting, I lose that knowledge when you get up. Hence, the knower is changed when what he knows changes. But God cannot be changed in any way whatsoever. Therefore, He cannot know singulars, which are subject to change.

Hence, He does not know singulars. The proof of the minor is as follows: There are, as Boethius and the Commentator say, certain things which are difficult for us to know because of a defect in us—for example, the very things which are most knowable in themselves, immaterial substances. On the other hand, there are other things which are not known because of some defect in them—for example, those that have very little existence, such as motion, time, vacuums, and the like. Now, first matter has a very limited act of existence. Hence, God does not know matter since it is of itself unknowable.

Now, a greater conformity is needed between a thing and a likeness which causes that thing than is needed between [that thing and] some other likeness. Therefore, since the deficiency of matter is the reason why our intellects cannot get a likeness sufficient for the knowledge of matter, much more will it be the reason why the divine intellect cannot get a likeness sufficient for the knowledge of matter.

Et hoc modo ponunt Deum singularia cognoscere; non quasi singularem eorum naturam inspiceret, sed per cognitionem universalium causarum. Sed etiam haec positio stare non potest quia ex causis universalibus non consequuntur nisi formae universales, si non sit aliquid per quod formae individuentur. Ex formis autem universalibus congregatis, quotcumque fuerint, non constituitur aliquod singulare; quia adhuc collectio illarum formarum potest intelligi in pluribus esse: et ideo, si aliquis modo supradicto per causas universales eclipsim cognosceret, nihil singulare, sed universale tantum cognosceret. Universalis enim effectus proportionatur causae universali, particularis autem particulari; et sic remanet praedictum inconveniens, quod Deus singularia ignoraret.
          <td>Therefore, others, such as Avicenna and his followers, have said that God knows every singular, but universally, as it were, in knowing all the universal causes from which a singular is produced. An astronomer, for example, knowing all the motions of the heavens and the distances between the celestial bodies, would know every eclipse that will occur even for the next hundred years, yet he would not know any one eclipse as a distinct singular so as to have evidential knowledge that it actually exists or not—which a country bumpkin has when he sees an eclipse. It is in this manner, they say, that God knows singulars: He does not, as it were, see them in their singular nature but through knowledge of universal causes. But neither can this opinion stand; for from universal causes there follow only universal forms, unless something intervenes through which these forms are individuated. But from a number of universal forms gathered together—no matter how great this number may be—no singular can be constituted, because the collection of these forms can still be understood to be in many. Therefore, if one were to know an eclipse by means of universal causes in the manner described above, he would know, not a singular, but only a universal. For a universal cause has as proportionate to it a universal effect, and a particular cause, a particular effect. Hence, there would still remain the inadmissible consequence mentioned earlier, that God should be ignorant of singulars.

Artifex autem secundum hoc cognoscit artificiatum per formam artis quam apud se habet secundum quod ipsum producit: artifex autem non producit nisi formam, quia materiam ad artificialia praeparavit natura; et ideo artifex per artem suam non cognoscit artificiata nisi ratione formae. Omnis autem forma de se universalis est; et ideo aedificator per artem suam cognoscit quidem domum in universali, non autem hanc vel illam, nisi secundum quod per sensum eius notitiam sumit. Sed si forma artis esset productiva materiae, sicut est et formae, per eam cognosceret artificiatum et ratione formae et ratione materiae.

Unde, cum ars divina sit productiva non solum formae, sed materiae, in arte sua non solum existit similitudo formae, sed materiae; et ideo cognoscit res et quantum ad formam et quantum ad materiam; unde non solum universalia sed et singularia cognoscit.
          <td>Therefore, we must simply admit that God knows all singulars, not only in their universal causes, but also each in its proper and singular nature. As proof of this, note that the divine knowledge which God has of things can be compared to the knowledge of an artist, since He is the cause of all things as art is the cause of all works of art. Now, an artist knows a product of his art by means of the form which he has in himself and upon which he models his product. However, he produces his work only with respect to its form—nature has prepared the matter for the works of art. Accordingly, by means of his art, an artist knows his works only under the aspect of the form. Now, every form is of itself universal; and, consequently, by means of his art, a builder knows, indeed, house in general, but not this house or that house, unless he acquires other knowledge of it through his senses. But if the artistic form produced matter as it produces form, then by its means the artist would know his work both under the aspect of its form and under that of its matter. Consequently, since matter is the principle of individuation, he would know it not only in its universal nature but also inasmuch as it is a definite singular. Therefore, since divine art produces not only the form but also the matter, it contains not only the likeness of form but also that of matter. Consequently, God knows things in regard to both their matter and their form; and, therefore, He knows not only universals but also singulars.

          <td>The reason for this will be clear if we consider the difference between the relation to the thing had by its likeness in our intellect and that had by its likeness in the divine intellect. For the likeness in our intellect is received from a thing in so far as the thing acts upon our intellect by previously acting upon our senses. Now, matter, because of the feebleness of its existence (for it is being only potentially), cannot be a principle of action; hence, a thing which acts upon our soul acts only through its form; consequently, the likeness of a thing which is impressed upon our sense and purified by several stages until it reaches the intellect is a likeness only of the form.

          <td>On the other hand, the likeness of things in the divine intellect is one which causes things; for, whether a thing has a vigorous or a feeble share in the act of being, it has this from God alone; and because each thing participates in an act of existence given by God, the likeness of each is found in Him. Consequently, the immaterial likeness in God is a likeness, not only of the form, but also of the matter. Now, in order that a thing be known, its likeness must be in the knower, though it need not be in him in the same manner as it is in reality. Hence, our intellect does not know singulars, because the knowledge of these depends upon matter, and the likeness of matter is not in our intellect. It is not because a likeness of the singular is in our intellect in an immaterial way. The divine intellect, however, can know singulars, since it possesses a likeness of matter, although in an immaterial way.

          <td>14. Although a singular as such cannot be separated from matter, it can be known by means of a likeness separated from matter, namely, the likeness of matter itself. Consequently, even if it be separated from matter physically, it is not separated from matter representatively.

          <td>Ad decimumquintum dicendum, quod actus divinae cognitionis non est aliquid diversum ab eius essentia, cum in eo sit idem intellectus et intelligere, quia sua actio est sua essentia: unde per hoc quod cognoscit aliquid extra se, eius cognitio non potest dici desiliens vel defluens. Et praeterea, nulla actio cognitivae virtutis potest dici desiliens sicut sunt actus virtutum naturalium, qui procedunt ab agente in patiens; quia cognitio non dicit effluxum a cognoscente in cognitum, sicut est in actionibus naturalibus, sed magis dicit existentiam cogniti in cognoscente.
          <td>15. An act of divine knowledge is not something other than God’s essence, for in God intellect and intellectual operation are one and the same, because His action is His essence. His knowledge, therefore, cannot be said to pass outside of Him simply because He knows something other than Himself. Moreover, no action of a cognitive power can be said to pass outside in the way in which acts of physical powers do, which go from the agent into the patient. For knowledge does not mean something flowing from the knower to a thing known, as happens in physical actions. It means, rather, the existence of the thing known in the knower.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad decimumsextum dicendum, quod actus cognitionis divinae nullam dependentiam habet ad cognitum; relatio enim quae importatur, non importat dependentiam ipsius cognitionis ad cognitum, sed magis e converso ipsius cogniti ad cognitionem; sicut e converso relatio quae importatur in nomine scientiae, designat dependentiam nostrae scientiae a scibili. Nec hoc modo se habet actus cognitionis ad obiectum sicut ad potentiam cognoscitivam; substantificatur enim in esse suo per potentiam cognoscitivam, non autem per obiectum; quia actus est in ipsa potentia, sed non in obiecto.
          <td>16. An act of divine knowledge has no dependence upon the thing known; for the relation implied in divine knowledge does not involve dependence of the knowledge upon the things known, but, rather, the dependence of the thing known upon the knowledge. The opposite is true of us, for the relation implied by the word <i>knowledge</i> when used of us is one that indicates a dependence of our knowledge upon its object. Moreover, the relation of an act of knowledge to its object is not the same as its relation to the power of knowing; for it is supported in its act of existence by the knowing power, not by its object, because the act is in the power but not in the object.

          <td>Ad decimumseptimum dicendum, quod hoc modo aliquid cognoscitur, secundum quod est in cognoscente repraesentatum, et non secundum quod est in cognoscente existens. Similitudo enim in vi cognoscitiva existens non est principium cognitionis rei secundum esse quod habet in potentia cognoscitiva, sed secundum relationem quam habet ad rem cognitam. Et inde est quod non per modum quo similitudo rei habet esse in cognoscente, res cognoscitur, sed per modum quo similitudo in intellectu existens est repraesentativa rei; et ideo, quamvis similitudo divini intellectus habeat esse immateriale, quia tamen est similitudo materiae, est etiam principium cognoscendi materialia, et ita singularia.
          <td>17. A thing is known because it is represented in the knower, not because it exists in him; for the likeness existing in a knowing power is a principle by which a thing is known, not under the aspect of the act of being it has in the knowing power, but under the aspect of the relation it has to the thing known. Consequently, a thing is not known according to the mode of existence which the likeness of the thing has in the knower, but rather according to the manner in which the likeness existing in the intellect represents the thing. Therefore, although the likeness in the divine intellect has an immaterial act of existence, nevertheless, since it is a likeness of matter, it is also a principle of knowing material things and, therefore, singulars.

          <td>1. The human intellect knows by abstracting the form from matter. Now, the abstraction of a form from matter does not destroy its particularity, for mathematics, which abstracts from matter, considers particular lines. Consequently, the fact that our intellect is immaterial does not prevent it from knowing singulars.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, singularia non distinguuntur secundum quod conveniunt in natura communi, quia participatione speciei plures homines sunt unus homo.

          <td>2. Singulars are not distinct according to their participation in a common nature, for the fact that many men participate in the species of man makes them one man. Therefore, if our intellect knows only universals, it does not know one singular as distinct from another. Consequently, our intellect would not direct us to those objects of operations in regard to which we are guided by choice; for choice presupposes the distinction of one thing from another.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed dicebat, quod intellectus noster singularia cognoscit, in quantum applicat formam universalem ad aliquod particulare.- Sed contra, intellectus noster non potest applicare unum ad aliud nisi utrumque praecognoscat. Ergo cognitio singularis praecedit applicationem universalis ad singulare; non ergo applicatio praedicta potest esse causa quare intellectus noster singulare cognoscat.
          <td>3. But it was said that our intellect knows singulars inasmuch as it applies the universal form to some particulars.—On the contrary, our intellect cannot apply one thing to another unless it already knows each. Consequently, knowledge of the singular precedes the application of the universal to the singular. Therefore, the above-mentioned application cannot be the reason why our intellect knows the singular.

          <td>4. According to Boethius, whatever a lower power can do a higher power can do. Now, as he says in the same place, the intellect is superior to imagination and the imagination is superior to sense. Therefore, since sense knows the singular, our intellect should also know it.

Similitudo autem cogniti, qua informatur potentia cognoscitiva est principium cognitionis secundum actum sicut calor calefactionis; et ideo oportet ut quaelibet cognitio sit secundum modum formae quae est in cognoscente. Unde, cum similitudo rei quae est in intellectu nostro, accipiatur ut separata a materia, et ab omnibus materialibus conditionibus, quae sunt individuationis principia; relinquitur quod intellectus noster, per se loquendo, singularia non cognoscit, sed universalia tantum. Omnis enim forma, in quantum huiusmodi, universalis est; nisi forte sit forma subsistens, quae, ex hoc ipso quod subsistit, incommunicabilis est.
          <td>All action is determined by the condition of the form of the agent, the principle of action, just as the process of heating is measured by the amount of heat. Now, the likeness of the thing known, by which the knowing power is informed, is the principle of actual knowledge, just as heat is of heating. Hence, all cognition is necessarily determined by the limitations of the form in the knower. Consequently, since the likeness of a thing existing in our intellect is received as separated from matter and all the conditions of matter, which are the principles of individuation, it follows that our intellect, of itself, does not know singulars but only universals. For every form as such is universal, unless it happens to be a subsistent form, which, from the very fact of its being subsistent, is incommunicable.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed per accidens contingit quod intellectus noster singulare cognoscat; ut enim philosophus dicit in III de anima, phantasmata se habent ad intellectum nostrum sicut sensibilia ad sensum, ut colores, qui sunt extra animam, ad visum; unde, sicut species quae est in sensu, abstrahitur a rebus ipsis, et per eam cognitio sensus continuatur ad ipsas res sensibiles; ita intellectus noster abstrahit speciem a phantasmatibus, et per eam eius cognitio quodammodo ad phantasmata continuatur.
          <td>It happens, however, that our intellect knows the singular indirectly. For, as the Philosopher says, phantasms are related to our intellect as sensible objects are related to sense and as colors outside the soul are related to sight. Therefore, just as the species in the sense is abstracted from things themselves and by its means the cognition of the sense is extended to the sensible things themselves, so also our intellect abstracts the species from the phantasms, and, by means of this species, its cognition is extended, in a certain sense, to the phantasms.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed tamen tantum interest; quod similitudo quae est in sensu, abstrahitur a re ut ab obiecto cognoscibili, et ideo per illam similitudinem res ipsa per se directe cognoscitur; similitudo autem quae est in intellectu, non abstrahitur a phantasmate sicut ab obiecto cognoscibili, sed sicut a medio cognitionis, per modum quo sensus noster accipit similitudinem rei quae est in speculo, dum fertur in eam non ut in rem quamdam, sed ut in similitudinem rei. Unde intellectus noster non directe ex specie quam suscipit, fertur ad cognoscendum phantasma, sed ad cognoscendum rem cuius est phantasma. Sed tamen per quamdam reflexionem redit etiam in cognitionem ipsius phantasmatis, dum considerat naturam actus sui, et speciei per quam intuetur, et eius a quo speciem abstrahit, scilicet phantasmatis: sicut per similitudinem quae est in visu a speculo acceptam, directe fertur visus in cognitionem rei speculatae; sed per quamdam reversionem fertur per eamdem in ipsam similitudinem quae est in speculo. Inquantum ergo intellectus noster per similitudinem quam accepit a phantasmate, reflectitur in ipsum phantasma a quo speciem abstraxit, quod est similitudo particularis, habet quamdam cognitionem de singulari secundum continuationem quamdam intellectus ad imaginationem.
          <td>There is, however, this difference: The likeness in sense is abstracted from the thing as from an object of knowledge, and, consequently, the thing itself is directly known by means of this likeness. The likeness in the intellect, however, is not abstracted from the phantasm as from an object of knowledge but as from a medium of knowledge after the manner in which our sense receives the likeness of a thing which is in a mirror; it is directed to it not as to a thing but rather as to a likeness of a thing. Consequently, from the species which it receives, our intellect is not applied directly to knowing the phantasm but rather the thing whose phantasm is presented. Nevertheless, by a certain reflection our intellect also returns to a knowledge of the phantasm itself when it considers the nature of its act, the nature of the species by which it knows, and, finally, the nature of that from which it has abstracted the species, namely, the phantasm. It is like the case of sight, which is brought through a likeness received from a mirror directly to a knowledge of the thing reflected, but by a sort of reflection to the image itself in the mirror. Therefore, inasmuch as our intellect, through the likeness which it receives from the phantasm, turns back upon the phantasm from which it abstracts the species, the phantasm being a particular likeness, our intellect gets some kind of knowledge of the singular because of its dynamic union with the imagination.

        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad primum igitur dicendum, quod duplex est materia a qua fit abstractio; scilicet materia intelligibilis et sensibilis, ut patet in VII Metaph.: et dico intelligibilem, ut quae consideratur in natura continui; sensibilem autem sicut est materia naturalis. Utraque autem dupliciter accipitur; scilicet ut signata, et ut non signata: et dico signatam secundum quod consideratur cum determinatione dimensionum, harum scilicet vel illarum; non signatam autem quae sine determinatione dimensionum consideratur. Secundum hoc igitur sciendum est, quod materia signata est individuationis principium, a qua abstrahit omnis intellectus, secundum quod dicitur abstrahere ab hic et nunc. Intellectus autem naturalis non abstrahit a materia sensibili non signata: considerat enim hominem et carnem et os, in cuius definitione cadit sensibilis materia non signata: sed a materia sensibili totaliter abstrahit intellectus mathematicus, non autem a materia intelligibili non signata. Unde patet quod abstractio, quae est communis omni intellectui, facit formam esse universalem.
          <td>1. There are two kinds of matter from which abstraction is made: intelligible matter and sensible matter—as is clear from the <i>Metaphysics</i> . I call that matter <i>intelligible</i> which is considered in the nature of a continuum, and <i>sensible,</i> that which is physical matter. Each, however, can be taken in two ways: as designated and as not designated. I call matter <i>designated</i> if it is considered together with the determination of its dimensions, that is, with these or those dimensions. I call it <i>not designated,</i> however, if it is considered without the determination of its dimensions. In this connection, it must be noted that designated matter is the principle of individuation, from which every intellect abstracts inasmuch as it is said to abstract from the here and now. The intellect of the natural Philosopher, however, does not abstract from non-designated sensible matter; for it considers man, flesh, and bone, in whose definitions non-designated sensible matter is included. The intellect of the mathematician, however, abstracts entirely from sensible matter, though not from non-designated intelligible matter. Hence, it is clear that abstraction, which is common to all intellects, makes a form universal.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad secundum dicendum, quod secundum philosophum in III de anima, non solum intellectus est movens in nobis, sed etiam phantasia, per quam universalis conceptio intellectus ad particulare operabile applicatur; unde intellectus est quasi movens remotum; sed ratio particularis et phantasia sunt movens proximum.
          <td>2. According to the Philosopher, in us the intellect is not the only motive principle. The imagination is also such, and, by its means, the universal knowledge of the intellect is applied to some particular thing to be done. For this reason, the intellect is, as it were, a remote mover, but particular reason and the imagination are proximate movers.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad tertium dicendum, quod homo praecognoscit singularia per imaginationem et sensum, et ideo potest applicare cognitionem universalem quae est in intellectu, ad particulare: non enim, proprie loquendo, sensus aut intellectus cognoscunt, sed homo per utrumque, ut patet in I de anima.
          <td>3. Man has prior knowledge of singulars through imagination and sense. Consequently, he can apply his universal intellectual knowledge to a particular; for, properly speaking, it is neither the intellect nor the sense that knows, but man that knows through both—as is clear from <i>The Soul</i> .
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad quartum dicendum, quod illud quod potest virtus inferior, potest etiam superior; non tamen eodem modo, sed nobiliori; unde eamdem rem quam cognoscit sensus, cognoscit et intellectus, nobilius tamen, quia immaterialius; et sic non sequitur, quod si sensus singulare cognoscit, quod intellectus cognoscat.
          <td>4. What a lower power can do a higher power can do; not in the same, but in a more noble, way. Consequently, the intellect knows the same thing that sense knows, but in a more noble, because a more immaterial, way. Hence, it does not follow that the intellect knows the singular if the senses know it.

          <td>1. The divine intellect always remains in the same state; but a singular, inasmuch as now it exists and now it does not exist, has different states. Consequently, the divine intellect does not know whether or not a singular now exists.

          <td>2. Those powers of the soul which are indifferent to a thing’s presence or absence—as, for example, the imagination—do not know whether or not a thing exists; this is known only by those powers, such as sense, which do not know absent things as though they were present. Now, the divine intellect is disposed in the same way to things present or absent. Consequently, it does not know whether things exist now or not; it knows merely their natures.

          <td>3. According to the Philosopher, the composition signified when a thing is said to be or not to be is not in things but only in the intellect. Now, there can be no composition in the divine intellect. Therefore, God does not know whether or not a thing exists.

Sed artifex per similitudinem arcae, quam habet in mente sua, non cognoscit an arca sit vel non sit. Ergo nec Deus cognoscit singulare esse vel non esse.
          <td>4. In the Gospel according to St. John (1:3-4) we read: “What was made, in Him was life. Now, in his explanation of this passage, Augustine says that created things are in God in the way in which a trunk is in the mind of the one who makes it. By means of the mental likeness of the trunk, however, a carpenter does not know whether the trunk exists or not. Consequently, neither does God know whether or not a singular now exists.

Cum ergo intellectus definiens non cognoscat an res sit vel non sit, sed naturam rei simpliciter; sensus autem cognoscat: videtur quod iste modus cognitionis sit Deo maxime attribuendus qua cognoscitur rei natura simpliciter, sine hoc quod sciatur esse res vel non esse.

          <td>5. The more noble knowledge is, the more it resembles God’s knowledge. But the knowledge of an intellect comprehending the definitions of things is more noble than sense knowledge; for, when the intellect defines, it penetrates to the interior of a thing, but sense deals with externals. When the intellect defines, however, it does not know whether a thing exists or not, but simply the nature of the thing. Sense, however, does have such knowledge. It seems, therefore, that that type of knowledge by which only the nature of a thing is known, but not whether a thing exists or not, should be attributed to God.

Now, by knowing the essence of a species, the intellect comprehends all the essential properties of that species; for, as the Philosopher says, the definition is the principle of any demonstration that concludes to the proper accidents of a subject Therefore, once the proper essence of any singular were known, all the accidents of that singular would also be known. Our intellect, however, cannot know the essence of a singular, because it abstracts from designated matter, which pertains to the essence of a singular and would be placed in its definition if the singular had one. The divine intellect, however, can comprehend not only the universal essence of a species, but, since it can apprehend matter, it can also comprehend the singular essence of each and every thing. Therefore, it knows all accidents, those common to the entire species or genus, as well as those proper to each individual. Among these latter is time, in which every concrete reality is found and according to which a thing is said to exist now or not. Consequently, God knows whether or not each and every thing exists; and He knows all other propositions that can be formed about universals or individuals.

Sed intellectus divinus per unum, scilicet suam essentiam, cognoscit omnes substantias, et omnia accidentia; et ideo neque discurrit de substantia in accidens, neque componit unum cum altero; sed loco eius quod in intellectu nostro est compositio specierum, in intellectu divino est omnimoda unitas; et secundum hoc complexa incomplexe cognoscit, sicut multa simpliciter et unite, et materialia immaterialiter.
          <td>In this respect, however, the divine intellect differs from ours. In order to know a subject and an accident and to know different accidents, our intellect forms separate concepts, and, consequently, passes from knowledge of a substance to knowledge of one of its accident. Again,— in order to know the inherence of one of its accidents, it joins one species with the other, and, in a certain manner, unites them. In this way, the intellect forms propositions in itself. But by one reality, namely, its own essence, the divine intellect knows all substances and all accidents. Consequently, it neither passes from substance to accident nor joins one with the other; but instead of the joining of species which takes place in our intellect, there is, in the divine intellect, complete unity; because of this, God, without complexity, knows what is complex, just as He knows many things simply and with unity, and material things immaterially.

Unde in contraria habitudine habet se illa cognitio ad res cognitas, et nostra cognitio: nostra enim cognitio, quia est a rebus accepta, naturaliter est posterior rebus; cognitio autem creatoris de creaturis, et artificis de artificiatis naturaliter praecedit res cognitas. Remoto autem priori removetur posterius, sed non e converso; et inde est quod scientia nostra de rebus naturalibus esse non potest nisi res ipsae praeexistant; sed apud intellectum divinum, vel artificis, indifferenter est cognitio rei, sive sit sive non sit.
          <td>God’s knowledge of created things may be compared to that which an artist has of his artistic products and which is their cause. Hence, the relation of God’s knowledge to things known is the opposite of the relation of our knowledge to them. Our knowledge is received from things, and, by its nature, comes after them. But the Creator’s knowledge of creatures, and the artist’s of his products, by its very nature, precedes the things known. Now, when what is antecedent is removed, what is subsequent is likewise removed; but the opposite is not true. Hence, our knowledge of natural things cannot be had unless these things previously exist; but the actual existence or non-existence of a thing is a matter of indifference to the intellect of God or that of an artist.

          <td>We must remark, however, that an artist has two kinds of knowledge about something that can be made: speculative and practical. He has speculative or theoretical knowledge when he knows the intimate nature of a work but does not have the intention of applying the principles to the production of the work. His knowledge is practical, properly speaking, when by his intention he ordains the principles of the work to operation as an end. In this way, as Avicenna says, medicine is divided into theoretical and practical.

          <td>It is clear that the practical knowledge of an artist follows his speculative knowledge, since it is made practical by applying the speculative to a work. But when the practical is absent, the speculative remains. Evidently, then, an artist can have knowledge of some work which he sometimes sets about making and sometimes does not, as when he thinks up the form of some piece of handicraft which he does not intend to make. Moreover, the artist does not always regard this work which he does not take steps to make as something within his power; for sometimes he visualizes a type of device entirely beyond his power of making. He regards it rather in the light of his own purposes, that is, he sees that he could attain such and such an end by means of such and such a device. For, as the Philosopher says, in the order of things to be done, ends are as principles are in the order of things to be studied; hence, as conclusions are known in their principles, products of art are known in the light of their purposes.

Of those which neither have been, are, nor will be—which He has decreed never to make—He has a kind of speculative knowledge. And although one can say that He sees these things as within His power, since there is nothing He cannot do, it is more appropriate to say that He sees them in His goodness, the end of all that is made by Him; for He sees that there are many other ways of communicating His goodness, besides those He has already communicated to existing things, having existence, past, present, or future, because all created things cannot equal His goodness, no matter how much they seem to participate in it.

But, since the divine intellect is infinitely more immaterial than any created intellect, it is infinitely more capable of understanding. Now, a created intellect can know what is potentially infinite. Therefore, the divine intellect can know what is actually infinite.

Sed in materia prima sunt infinitae formae in potentia, eo quod potentia eius passiva est infinita. Ergo et in primo motore, scilicet Deo, sunt infinita in actu.

As the Commentator says, “All proportions and forms which are potentially in first matter exist actually in the first mover.” Augustine agrees when he says that there are seminal principles of things in first matter, but that the causal principles are in God. Now, in first matter there are, potentially, an infinite number of forms, because its passive potency is infinite. Therefore, in God, the first mover, there are actual infinites. But God knows whatever is in Him actually. Hence, God knows infinites.

In arguing against the Academics, who denied that anything was true, Augustine shows that there is not merely a multitude of true things but even an infinite multitude of them, resulting from a kind intellectual reduplication or from the reduplication of a sentence.

Dei, quidam volentes iudicare de intellectu divino secundum modum intellectus nostri, dixerunt, quod Deus non potest cognoscere infinita, sicut nec nos; et ideo, cum ponerent eum cognoscere singularia, et cum hoc ponerent mundum aeternum, sequebatur quod esset revolutio eorumdem secundum numerum in diversis saeculis: quod penitus absurdum est.
          <td>As Augustine says, some, wishing to conceive of the divine intellect in terms of our own intellects, have said that God cannot know infinites, just as we cannot know them; and since they asserted both that God knows singulars and that the world is eternal, it followed that there would be a cycle of numerically the same things in different ages—an opinion which is utterly absurd.

          <td>It must accordingly be said that God knows infinites, as can be shown from the reasons given above. For, since He knows not only things which have been, are, or will be, but also all those which could participate in His goodness—and the number of these is infinite since His goodness is infinite—it follows that He knows infinites. How this takes place must now be considered.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sciendum est igitur, quod secundum virtutem medii cognoscendi, cognitio ad multa vel ad pauca se extendit; sicut similitudo quae recipitur in visu, est determinata secundum particulares conditiones rei, unde non est ductiva in cognitionem nisi unius rei; sed similitudo rei recepta in intellectu, est absoluta a particularibus conditionibus, unde cum sic elevatior, est ductiva in plura. Et quia una forma universalis nata est ab infinitis singularibus participari, inde est quod intellectus quodammodo infinita cognoscit. Sed quia illa similitudo quae est in intellectu, non ducit in cognitionem singularis quantum ad ea quibus singularia ad invicem distinguuntur, sed solum quantum ad naturam communem; inde est quod intellectus noster per speciem quam habet apud se non est cognoscitivus infinitorum nisi in potentia; sed medium illud quo Deus cognoscit, scilicet essentia sua, est infinitorum similitudo, quae ipsam imitari possunt; nec tantum quantum ad id quod commune est eis, sed etiam quantum ad ea quibus ad invicem distinguuntur, ut ex praecedentibus patet; unde divina scientia habet efficaciam ad infinita cognoscendum.
          <td>Note, therefore, that cognition extends itself to many or to few things according to the force of the means of knowing. For example, a likeness received in the sense of sight has the same determinations as the particular conditions of the thing. Hence, it leads us to the knowledge of only one thing. But a likeness received in the intellect is freed from particular conditions; and since it is more elevated, it leads us to the knowledge of a number of things. Indeed, because one universal form, by its very nature, is such that it can be participated in by an infinite number of singulars, the intellect can in some way be said to know infinites. However, since that intellectual likeness does not lead to knowledge of a singular according to its distinctive features but only under the aspect of a common nature, our intellect, through the species which it has within it, knows infinites only potentially. But the medium by which God knows, namely, His own essence, is a likeness of the infinites capable of imitating that essence. It is a likeness not only of that which is common to them, but also of those features by which they are distinguished from one another, as is clear from what was said earlier. Hence, the divine cognition has the power to know infinites.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quomodo autem actu infinita cognoscat, hoc modo considerandum est. Nihil prohibet aliquid esse infinitum uno modo, et alio modo finitum: ut si aliquod corpus esset quidem longitudine infinitum, sed latitudine finitum; et similiter potest esse in formis: ut si aliquod corpus infinitum ponamus esse album, quantitas albedinis extensiva, secundum quam dicitur quanta per accidens, erit infinita; quantitas autem eius per se, scilicet intensiva, nihilominus esset finita; et similiter est de quacumque alia forma corporis infiniti: quia omnis forma recepta in aliqua materia finitur ad modum recipientis, et ita non habet intensionem infinitam. Infinitum autem, sicut repugnat cognitioni, ita et repugnat transitioni: infinitum enim nec cognosci nec transiri potest: nihilominus tamen, si aliquid moveatur super infinitum non per viam infinitatis suae, transiri poterit; sicut quod est infinitum longitudine, et latitudine finitum, potest pertransiri latitudine, sed non longitudine: ita etiam si aliquod infinitum cognoscatur per viam per quam est infinitum, nullo modo perfecte cognosci potest; si autem cognoscatur non per viam infiniti, sic perfecte cognosci poterit: quia enim infiniti ratio congruit quantitati, secundum philosophum in I Phys., omnis autem quantitas de sui ratione habet ordinem partium; sequitur quod tunc infinitum per viam infiniti cognoscatur, quando apprehenditur pars post partem.
          <td>The manner in which God knows actual infinites must now be considered. There is no reason why something cannot be infinite in one respect and finite in another. For example, a body can be infinite in length but finite in width. The same can be true of forms. For example, let us suppose some infinite body that is white. The extensive quantity of the whiteness (in so far as whiteness can be said to have quantity accidentally) will be infinite; but its intensive or essential quantity will nevertheless be finite. The same is true of any other form of an infinite body; for every form received in matter is limited according to the nature of the recipient and so does not have infinite intensity. It is possible neither to know nor to traverse an infinite. Both are repugnant to the idea of infinite. Nevertheless, if something were to be moved across an infinite, not in the direction of its infinity, it could be traversed. For example, what is infinite in length but finite in width could be traversed across its width but not along its length. Similarly, if an infinite were known in the respect in which it is infinite, it could by no means be known perfectly; but, if it were known in a respect which is not that of the infinite, it could be perfectly known. For, since “the character of infinity fits quantity,” as the Philosopher says, and quantity of its very nature has an order of parts, an infinite would be known by way of its infinity if it were known part by part.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Unde si sic debeat intellectus noster cognoscere corpus album infinitum, nullo modo cognoscere poterit perfecte ipsum, neque albedinem eius; si autem cognoscat ipsam naturam albedinis vel corporeitatis, quae invenitur in corpore infinito, sic cognoscet infinitum perfecte quantum ad omnes partes eius, non tamen per viam infiniti; et sic possibile est ut intellectus noster quodammodo infinitum continuum perfecte cognoscat; sed infinita discrete nullo modo, eo quod non potest per unam speciem multa cognoscere; et inde est quod si multa debet considerare, oportet quod unum post alterum cognoscat, et ita quantitatem discretam per viam infiniti cognoscit. Unde si cognosceret infinitam multitudinem in actu, sequeretur quod cognosceret infinitum per viam infiniti; quod est impossibile.
          <td>If our intellect had to know a white body in this manner, it would never be able to know either it or its whiteness perfectly. If, however, it knew the nature of whiteness or of corporeity which is found in an infinite body, then it would know the infinite perfectly with respect to all its parts— not, however, according to its infinity. Thus it is possible for our intellect in some manner to know an infinite continuum perfectly; but it cannot know an infinite number of things taken one by one, since it cannot know many things by means of one species. Hence, if our intellect has to consider a number of things, it has to know them one after another. Consequently, it knows discontinuous quantity only through continuous quantity. Therefore, if it were to know a multitude that is actually infinite, our intellect would be knowing an infinite according to its infinity, but that is impossible.

Unde concedo simpliciter, quod Deus actu cognoscit infinita absolute, nec ipsa infinita adaequant intellectum eius, sicut ipse a se cognitus suum intellectum adaequat: quia essentia in infinitis creatis est finita, quasi intensive sicut albedo in corpore infinito; essentia autem Dei est infinita omnibus modis; et secundum hoc omnia infinita sunt Deo finita, et sunt comprehensibilia ab ipso.
          <td>The divine intellect, however, knows all things through one species, Hence, simultaneously and with one intuition, God has knowledge of all things. Consequently, He does not know a multitude according to the order of its parts, and He can know an infinite multitude, but not according to its infinity; for, if He were to know it according to its infinity so that He would be grasping part after part of the multitude, He would never come to its end and never know it perfectly. I simply concede, therefore, that God actually knows infinites absolutely. These infinites, however, are not equal to His intellect in the way in which He Himself as known equals His intellect; for the essences of created infinites are, as it were, intensively finite as whiteness is in an infinite body. God’s essence, however, is infinite in all respects; and because of this all infinites are finite to Him and can be comprehended by Him.

          <td>Ad primum ergo dicendum, quod secundum hoc dicitur finiri a sciente, quod scitur quod intellectum scientis non excedit, ut aliquid eius sit extra intellectum scientis: sic enim se habet ad intellectum scientis per modum finiti: nec est inconveniens hoc accidere de infinito quod non per viam infiniti scitur.
          <td>1. A thing is said to be made finite by a knower in the sense that it is known to such an extent that it does not exceed the intellect of the knower; in other words, some part of it does not remain outside the knower’s intellect. In this way, the thing known stands as something finite to the intellect. There is no reason why this cannot happen to an infinite which is known in a way other than according to its infinity.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad secundum dicendum, quod scientia simplicis notitiae et visionis nullam differentiam important ex parte scientis, sed solum ex parte rei scitae: dicitur enim scientia visionis in Deo ad similitudinem visus corporalis, qui res extra se positas intuetur; unde secundum scientiam visionis Deus scire non dicitur nisi quae sunt extra ipsum, quae sunt vel praesentia, vel praeterita, vel futura; sed scientia simplicis notitiae, ut supra probatum est, est eorum quae non sunt, nec erunt, nec fuerunt: nec alio modo scit Deus ista et illa:<br>
          unde non est ex parte scientiae visionis quod Deus infinita non videat; sed ex parte ipsorum visibilium quae non sunt; quae si esse ponerentur infinita vel actu vel successione, procul dubio ea Deus cognosceret scientia visionis.
          <td>2. Knowledge of simple intelligence and that of vision imply no difference on the part of the knower but only on the part of the things known. Knowledge of vision is said to be in God because of its resemblance to bodily sight which looks upon things outside of itself. Hence, God is said to know by His knowledge of vision only those things that are outside of Him, whether they are present, past, or future. But, as was proved above, God knows by His knowledge of simple intelligence things that neither are, will be, nor ever have been. There is no other way by which God knows these and those things.<br>
          Hence, the fact that God does not see infinites is not due to His knowledge of vision but rather to the non-existence of the things that would be the objects of His knowledge of vision. For if it were held that these were infinite, either actually or successively, no doubt God would know them by His knowledge of vision.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad tertium dicendum, quod visus proprie est quidam corporalis sensus; unde si nomen visionis ad immaterialem cognitionem transferatur, hoc non erit nisi metaphorice.

          <td>3. Properly speaking, sight is a bodily sense. Hence, if the word <i>vision</i> is transferred to immaterial cognition, its use will be merely metaphorical. In metaphors, however, there is a different basis of truth according to the different points of likeness found in things. Hence, nothing prevents our sometimes calling all divine knowledge vision and at other times reserving the name to that which is about things present, past, and future.

          <td>4. By His essence God Himself is a likeness of all things and a proper likeness of each one of them. Hence, there cannot be said to be many intelligible characters of things in God except in regard to His various relations to various creatures. These relations, however, are merely rational relations. Moreover, as Avicenna says, there is no reason why rational relations cannot be multiplied to infinity.

          <td>1. Seneca’s opinion is to the contrary: “An idea is an exemplar off things coming into being naturally.” But, since there cannot be infinite things naturally, it would seem that they cannot come to be; for what cannot be cannot come to be. Therefore, there will be no idea of infinites in God. But God cannot make anything except through an idea. Therefore, He cannot make infinites.

Sed per accidens multitudo invenitur, quando omnia quae in multitudine continentur, quasi loco unius ponuntur, et indifferenter se habent sive sint unum, sive multa, vel pauciora vel plura; sicut si aedificator facit domum, in cuius factione plures serras consumit successive, multitudo serrarum non requiritur ad factionem domus nisi per accidens ex hoc quod una non potest semper durare; nec differt aliquid ad domum, quotcumque ponantur; unde nec una earum habet dependentiam ad aliam, sicut erat quando multitudo requirebatur per se.
          <td>In the second way, an essential infinite is distinguished from an accidental infinite. This distinction is explained as follows: “The character of the infinite,” as mentioned above, “belongs to quantity.” Now, quantity is predicated first of all of discrete quantity rather than of continuous quantity. Hence, in order to see what is infinite essentially and what is infinite accidentally, we must consider that a multitude is sometimes required essentially and sometimes merely accidentally. Essentially a multitude is required in ordered causes and effects where one has an essential dependence upon another. For example, the soul sets in motion the natural heat by which nerves and muscles are moved, which, in turn, move the hands, which move a stick by which a stone is moved. In this series, each of the later members essentially depends upon every one that precedes. But an accidental multitude is found when all the members of the multitude are posited, as it were, in place of one; and their mutual relation is such that it is a matter of indifference whether they be one or many, or more or fewer. For example, if a builder makes a house in whose construction he wears out many saws successively, a multitude of saws is required for the erection of the house only accidentally, that is, because one saw cannot last forever. It does not matter to the house how many saws are used; hence, one saw does not have that dependence upon another which we find when a multitude is required essentially.

          <td>Secundum ergo hoc de infinito variae opiniones processerunt. Quidam enim antiqui philosophi posuerunt infinitum in actu non solum per accidens, sed per se; volentes quod infinitum esset de necessitate eius quod ponebant principium; unde etiam processum causarum in infinitum ponebant. Sed hanc opinionem philosophus reprobat in II Metaphys., et in III Phys.
          <td>There are many different opinions about the infinite. Some ancient philosophers posited actual infinites, both essential and accidental, thinking that an infinite would necessarily be a result of what they posited as a beginning. For this reason, they also posited an infinite process of causes. The Philosopher refutes this position, however.

          <td>Others, following Aristotle, conceded that an essential infinite cannot be found either in act or in potency, because it is impossible for a thing to depend essentially upon an infinite number of things; for, if this were true, then its own act of existence would never be formally constituted. But they posited an accidental infinite, both in potency and in act. Algazel holds: “There are an infinite number of human souls separated from bodies”—something which he thought followed from his view that the world is eternal. He saw no difficulty since they have no mutual dependence, and so in their multiplicity they constituted merely an accidental infinity.

          <td>Others asserted that there cannot be an actual infinite, either essential or accidental. They admitted a potential infinite, which, as is taught in the <i>Physics,”</i> consists in succession; and this is the position of the Commentator. But for either of two reasons it can happen that an actual infinite cannot exist: either because to be in act is contradictory to the infinite by the very fact that it is infinite; or because of some extrinsic reason—as being lifted up is repugnant to a lead triangle, not because it is a triangle, but because it is lead.

This would mean that two contradictories would coincide in one act of existence. However, whether or not it is intrinsically repugnant for an actual infinite to exist must be discussed elsewhere, since this question arose only incidentally. Answers, however, must be given to the difficulties on both sides.

Hence, although they themselves are immaterial, from them are brought forth things with a material act of existence. If, therefore, as the Philosopher says, it is of the essence of an infinite to exist, not actually and simultaneously, but merely successively, then the infinite natures in the divine mind cannot all be produced in creatures simultaneously but only successively. So, it does not follow that there are actual infinites.

In this respect, it is correct to argue that what a creature cannot do God can do. Second, it can be wanting because that which is said to be impossible for a creature to do contains in itself some intrinsic repugnance. In this respect, it is possible neither for a creature nor for God-as, for instance, that contradictories should exist simultaneously, and that an <i>infinite actually exist</i> falls into this class, if to exist actually is repugnant to the nature of an infinite.

However, no effect of the divine power is its end, nor is its act distinct from it. Hence, the argument does not follow.

For the essence of an infinite does not consist in simultaneous existence; but it is like things which are in a state of becoming, such as a day or a contest, as is said in the <i>Physics</i> . Nor does it follow that God is able to make only things which come into being naturally. It is true that according to the meaning given previously an idea was taken as applying to practical knowledge, which is an idea for this reason that it is determined by the divine will to an act.

Although in creation there is nothing new except in reference to the creature, the word <i>creation</i> implies not only this newness but also something on the part of God; for it signifies a divine action, which is His essence, and connotes an effect in a creature, which is the reception of being from God. So, it does not follow that it is the same to say that God can create something as to say that something can be created by Him. Otherwise, before there was a creature, nothing could be created unless the potency of a creature first existed. This would be positing eternal matter. Therefore, although the potency of a creature does not extend to the existence of actual infinites, this does not exclude ability on the part of God to make actual infinites.

          <td>5. A greater distance lies between a creature and God than lies between a created being and non-being; for a created being surpasses non-being only by reason of the amount of its entity, which is not infinite. But, as is said in the <i>Metaphysics</i> : “There is nothing common to being and non-being except by equivocation, which happens, for example, when that which we call man is called non-man by others.” Hence, there cannot be anything common to God and a creature except by a pure equivocation.

But God and creatures are not related in this manner: one is not placed in the definition of the other, nor is something identical placed in the definition of each, even on the supposition that God could be defined.

But when the same word is used to signify two species of substances according to formal character proper to each, the predication is merely equivocal. This happens, for example, when the word <i>dog</i> is applied to the dog-star, a barking dog, and the dog-fish. It would be a far more equivocal predication if one word were applied to a substance and an accident. Now, our knowledge is an accident and that of God, a substance.

          <td>It is impossible to say that something is predicated univocally of a creature and God because in all univocal predication the nature signified by the name is common to those of whom the univocal predication is made. Hence, from the point of view of the nature signified by the predicate, the subjects of the univocal. predication are equal, even though from the point of view of its real existence one may take precedence over another. For example, all numbers are equal from the point of view of the nature of number, even though, by the nature of things, one number is naturally prior to another. No matter how much a creature imitates God, however, a point cannot be reached where something would belong to it for the same reason it belongs to God. For things which have the same formal characters but are in separate subjects are common to the same subjects in regard to substance or quiddity but distinct in regard to the act of being. But whatever is in God is His own act of being; and just as His essence is the same as His act of being, so is His knowledge the same as His act of being a knower. Hence, since the act of existence proper to one thing cannot be communicated to another, it is impossible that a creature ever attain to the possession of something in the same manner in which God has it, just as it is impossible for it to attain the same act of being as that which God has. The same is true of us. If <i>man</i> and <i>to exist as man</i> did not differ in Socrates, man could not be predicated univocally of him and Plato, whose acts of existing are distinct.

There is a certain agreement between things having a proportion to each other from the fact that they have a determinate distance between each other or some other relation to each other, like the proportion which the number two has to unity in as far as it is the double of unity. Again, the agreement is occasionally noted not between two things which have a proportion between them, but rather between two related proportions—for example, six has something in common with four because six is two times three, just as four is two times two.

          <td>In those terms predicated according to the first type of analogy, there must be some definite relation between the things having something in common analogously. Consequently, nothing can be predicated analogously of God and creature according to this type of analogy; for no creature has such a relation to God that it could determine the divine perfection. But in the other type of analogy, no definite relation is involved between the things which have something in common analogously, so there is no reason why some name cannot be predicated analogously of God and creature in this manner.

Sometimes the name implies something belonging to the thing primarily designated which cannot be common to God and creature even in the manner described above. This would be true, for example, of anything predicated of God metaphorically, as when God is called lion, sun, and the like, because their definition includes matter which cannot be attributed to God. At other times, however, a term predicated of God and creature implies nothing in its principal meaning which would prevent our finding between a creature and God an agreement of the type described above. To this kind belong all attributes which include no defect nor depend on matter for their act of existence, for example, being, the good, and similar things.

          <td>Ad primum igitur dicendum, quod sicut Dionysius dicit in IX cap. de divinis nominibus, Deus nullo modo creaturis similis dicendus est, sed creaturae possunt similes Deo dici aliquo modo. Quod enim ad imitationem alicuius fit, si perfecte illud imitetur, simpliciter potest ei simile dici; sed non e converso, quia homo non dicitur similis suae imagini, sed e converso: si autem imperfecte imitetur, tunc potest dici et simile et dissimile illud quod imitatur ei ad cuius imitationem fit: simile quidem, secundum hoc quod repraesentat; sed non simile, inquantum a perfecta repraesentatione deficit. Et ideo sacra Scriptura Deum creaturis esse similem omnibus modis negat, sed creaturam esse similem Deo quandoque quidem concedit, quandoque autem negat: concedit, cum dicit hominem ad similitudinem Dei factum; sed negat, cum dicit in Psal.: Deus, quis similis erit tibi?
          <td>1. As Dionysius says,” God can in no way be said to be similar to creatures, but creatures can be said to be similar to Him in some sense. For what is made in imitation of something, if it imitates it perfectly, can be said to be like it absolutely. The opposite, however, is not true; for a man is not said to be similar to his image but vice versa. However, if the imitation is imperfect, then it is said to be both like and unlike that which it imitates: like, in so far as it resembles it; unlike, in so far as it falls short of a perfect representation. It is for this reason that Holy Scripture denies that creatures are similar to God in every respect. It does, however, sometimes grant that creatures are similar to God, and sometimes deny this. It grants the similarity when it says that man is made in the likeness of God, but denies it when it says: “O God, who is like to thee?” (Psalms 70:19).
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad secundum dicendum, quod philosophus, in I Topic., ponit duplicem modum similitudinis. Unum qui invenitur in diversis generibus; et hic attenditur secundum proportionem vel proportionalitatem, ut quando alterum se habet ad alterum sicut aliud ad aliud, ut ipse ibidem dicit. Alium modum in his quae sunt eiusdem generis, ut quando idem diversis inest. Similitudo autem non requirit comparationem secundum determinatam habitudinem quae primo modo dicitur, sed solum quae secundo; unde non oportet ut primus modus similitudinis a Deo removeatur respectu creaturae.
          <td>2. The Philosopher” distinguishes two kinds of likenesses. One is found between things in different genera, and is taken according to proportion or proportionality; that is, one thing is related to another as a third thing is related to a fourth, as Aristotle himself says in the same place. The second kind of likeness is found existing between things in the same genus, as when the same thing is found in distinct subjects. Now, likeness of the first kind does not demand a comparison based on a definite relationship as does that of the second kind. Consequently, the possibility of the first type of likeness existing between God and creature should not be excluded.

          <td>Ad tertium dicendum, quod obiectio illa manifeste procedit de similitudine secundi modi, quam concedimus creaturae ad Deum non esse.

        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad quartum dicendum, quod similitudo quae attenditur ex eo quod aliqua duo participant unum, vel ex eo quod unum habet habitudinem determinatam ad aliud, ex qua scilicet ex uno alterum comprehendi possit per intellectum, diminuit distantiam; non autem similitudo quae est secundum convenientiam proportionum. Talis enim similitudo similiter invenitur in multum vel parum distantibus; non enim est maior similitudo proportionalitatis inter duo et unum et sex et tria, quam inter duo et unum, et centum et quinquaginta. Et ideo infinita distantia creaturae ad Deum similitudinem praedictam non tollit.
          <td>4. A likeness that is found because two things share something in common or because one has such a determinate relation to the other that from one the other can be grasped by the intellect—such a likeness diminishes distance. A likeness according to an agreement of proportion does not; for such a likeness is also found between things far or little distant. Indeed, there is no greater likeness of proportionality between two to one and six to three than there is between two to one and one hundred to fifty. Consequently, the infinite distance between a creature and God does not take away the likeness mentioned above.”

          <td>5. There is some agreement between being and non-being according to analogy, for non-being itself is called being analogously, as is made clear in the <i>Metaphysics.</i> Consequently, the distance lying between a creature and God cannot prevent a common ground for analogical statement.

          <td>6. That argument is valid in regard to community of analogy taken according to a definite relation of one thing to another. In that case, one thing must be put in the definition of the other as substance is put in the definition of accident or as one thing is put into the definition of two other things because both are predicated with reference to it, as substance is put into the definition of quantity and quality.

          <td>7. Although two species of substance have more in common than accident and substance have, it is possible that the same word is not applied to the two different species by reason of any consideration of something common between them. In that case, the word will be merely equivocal. But it is possible for a word common to substance and accident to be used because of a consideration of what they have in common. In such a case the word will not be equivocal but analogous.

          <td>8. The word <i>animal</i> is used not to signify the external form which a picture imitates when it depicts a real animal, but to signify its internal nature, in which it is not imitated. Hence, <i>animal</i> is used equivocally of the real animal and of the one painted. But the word <i>knowledge</i> is suitable to both creature and Creator in the respect in which the creature imitates the Creator. Consequently, knowledge is not predicated of the two altogether equivocally.

          <td>1. Nothing but the true can be known, as is said in the <i>Posterior Analytics.</i> But, as said in <i>Interpretation</i> , there is no definite truth in singular future contingents. Hence, God does not have knowledge of individual and contingent futures.

Aut ergo possibile est Socratem non sedere, aut non est possibile. Si non est possibile; ergo impossibile Socratem non sedere, ergo Socratem sedere est necessarium. Datum autem fuerat quod esset contingens. Si autem sit possibile non sedere, hoc posito non debet sequi aliquod inconveniens. Sequitur autem quod scientia Dei fallatur. Ergo non erit impossibile scientiam Dei falli.
          <td>2. That from which the impossible would follow is impossible. But if God knew a singular future contingent, the impossible would follow, namely, that God’s knowledge would be wrong. Hence, it is impossible for Him to know a singular future contingent. Proof of the minor follows. Let us suppose that God knows some singular future contingent event, such as that Socrates is sitting. Now, either it is possible that Socrates is not sitting or it is not possible. If it is not possible, then it is impossible for Socrates not to sit. Hence, for Socrates to sit is necessary, although what was granted was contingent. On the other hand, if it be possible not to sit, and granted he does not, nothing inconsistent follows from this. It would follow, however, that the knowledge of God is erroneous, and hence it would not be impossible for His knowledge to be false.

It was said, however, that the contingent, as it is in God, is necessary.—On the contrary, what is in itself contingent is not necessary with respect to God, except in the way in which it is in God. But inasmuch as it is in Him, it is not distinct from Him. If, therefore, it is known by God only as necessary, He will not know it in the way it exists distinct from Himself.

Ergo nullum contingens scitur a Deo.
          <td>4. According to the Philosopher, when the major of a syllogism expresses necessity and the minor expresses inherence, a conclusion expressing necessity follows. But the following is true: Whatever is known by God must necessarily be. For, if what God knew as existing did not exist, His knowledge would be false. Therefore, if something is known by God to exist, it necessarily exists. But no contingent must necessarily be. Therefore, no contingent is known by God.

It was said, however, that when it is said that whatever is known by God must necessarily be, the necessity implied is not with reference to the creature but to God alone.—On the contrary, when it is said that whatever is known by God must necessarily be, the necessity is attributed to the thing for which the subject of the statement stands. Now, the subject of the statement is that which is known by God, not God Himself as knowing. Therefore, the necessity implied in this statement refers only to the thing known.

          <td>6. The more certain our knowledge is, the less it has to do with contingents; for science is only about necessary truths, since it is more certain than opinion, which may be about contingent things. Now, God’s knowledge is most certain; hence, it can be about necessary matters only.

If something is known by God, it will exist. Since this antecedent, “This is known by God,” is absolutely necessary, the consequent will be absolutely necessary. Hence, whatever is known by God must necessarily exist. That this, namely, “This is known by God,” is absolutely necessary was proved as follows. This is something said about the past. But whatever is said about the past, if true, is necessary; for, since it has been, it cannot not have been. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary.

          <td>10. According to the Philosopher, whoever does not understand one determined thing understands nothing.

          <td>11. Hugh of St. Victor says: “God, who has all things in Himself, knows nothing outside Himself.” Now, whatever is contingent is outside of Him, for in Him there is no potentiality. Hence, He does not know future contingents at all.

But the divine model for the contingent and the necessary can be immutable, just as it is an immaterial model for the material and a simple model for the composite.

Some, wishing to pronounce upon divine knowledge from the viewpoint of our own way of knowing, have said that God does not know future contingents. This opinion cannot stand, for it would eliminate providence over human affairs, which are contingent. Consequently, others have said that God has knowledge of all futures, but that all take place necessarily, otherwise His knowledge of them would be subject to error. But neither can this opinion stand, for it would destroy free choice and there would be no need to ask advice.

On the other hand, we have others in which there can be falsity; for example, imagination, opinion, and judgment. Now, falsity occurs in a cognitive act because something is not in reality as it is apprehended. Hence, if there is any knowing power such that there is never any falsity in it, then the thing to be known by it never falls short of what the knower apprehends about it.

Sed contingens impediri potest antequam sit in esse productum: quia tunc non est nisi in causis suis, quibus potest accidere impedimentum ne perveniant ad effectum; sed postquam iam contingens in esse productum est, iam impediri non potest.

          <td>Now, what is necessary cannot be prevented from happening even before it happens, in view of the fact that its causes are unchangeably ordained to its production. Hence, by means of habits that are always true, what is necessary can be known even when it will happen in the future, just as we know a coming eclipse or the rising of the sun by means of true science. But a contingent can be impeded before it is brought into being; for at that stage it exists only in its causes, which may be prevented from producing their effect. After a contingent has been brought into existence, however, it can no longer be prevented. Hence, such a power or habit can make about a present contingent a judgment in which falsity is never found, as sense does when it judges that Socrates is sitting when he sits.

Tunc autem aliquid cognoscitur ut futurum est, quando inter cognitionem cognoscentis et rei eventum invenitur ordo praeteriti ad futurum. Hic autem ordo non potest inveniri inter cognitionem divinam et quamcumque rem contingentem; sed semper ordo divinae cognitionis ad rem quamcumque est sicut ordo praesentis ad praesens.

          <td>From this it is clear that a contingent can be known as future by no cognition that excludes all falsity and the possibility of falsity; and since there is no falsity or possibility of falsity in the divine knowledge, it would be impossible for God to have knowledge of future contingents if He knew them as future. Now, something is known as future when an order of past and future stands between the event and the knowledge. This order, however, cannot be found between the divine knowledge and any contingent thing whatsoever; but the relation of the divine knowledge to anything whatsoever is like that of present to present. This may be understood by the following example.

Sicut ergo visus noster non fallitur unquam videns contingentia cum sunt praesentia, et tamen ex hoc non removetur quin illa contingenter eveniant; ita Deus infallibiliter videt omnia contingentia, sive quae nobis sunt praesentia, sive quae praeterita, sive quae futura, quia sibi non sunt futura, sed ea inspicit esse tunc quando sunt; unde ex hoc non removetur quin contingenter eveniant.
          <td>If someone were to see many people walking successively down a road during a given period of time, in each part of that time he would see as present some of those who walk past, so that in the whole period of his watching he would see as present all of those who walked past him. Yet he would not simultaneously see them all as present, because the time of his seeing is not completely simultaneous. However, if all his seeing could exist at once, he would simultaneously see all the passers-by as present, even though they themselves would not all pass as simultaneously present. Therefore, since the vision of divine knowledge is measured by eternity, which is all simultaneous and yet includes the whole of time without being absent from any part of it, it follows that God sees whatever happens in time, not as future, but as present. For what is seen by God is, indeed, future to some other thing which it follows in time; to the divine vision, however, which is not in time but outside time, it is not future but present. Therefore, we see what is future as future because it is future with respect to our seeing, since our seeing is itself measured by time; but to the divine vision, which is outside of time, there is no future. For example, what one would see who is within the ranks of passers-by and sees only those who are in line ahead of him is quite different from what he would see were he outside their ranks and saw all of them simultaneously. Therefore, the fact that our sense of sight is never deceived when it sees contingents when they are present does not prevent the contingents themselves from happening contingently. In like manner, God infallibly knows all the contingents, whether they are present, past, or future to us; for they are not future to Him, but He knows that they are when they are; and the fact of His knowing them does not prevent them from happening contingently.

For example, if we were to describe God’s knowledge as it is, we should have to say that God knows that this is, rather than that it will be; for to Him every thing is present and nothing is future. For this reason, Boethius says that His knowledge of future things “is more properly called providence than foresight,” since He sees them all, as it were, from a great distance, in the mirror of eternity. However, it might also be called foresight because of its relation to other things in whose regard what He knows is future.

          <td>2. As was said, a contingent is referred to divine knowledge according to its act of existence in the realm of nature. Moreover, from the moment that it is, it cannot not be when it is; for, “what is must be when it is,” as is said in <i>Interpretation.</i> It does not follow, however, that it is necessary without any qualification or that God’s knowledge is defective—just as my sense of sight is not deceived when I see that Socrates is sitting, although this fact is contingent.

Nevertheless, no necessity arises from the fact that it is going to be, so that one could say that it comes about necessarily; for <i>event</i> applies to something which is to be, because what already is cannot eventuate. But that it has happened is true, and this is necessary.

          <td>4. The necessity referred to in the statement, “Whatever is known by God is necessary,” can concern either the manner of speaking or the thing spoken about. If the necessity is applied to the manner of speaking, then the proposition is composite and true. its meaning will be as follows: It is necessary that whatever is known by God exists, since it is not possible that God would know something to be and it would not be. If the necessity is applied to the thing spoken about. then the proposition is divided and false. Its meaning will be as follows: What is known by God must necessarily exist. But, as is clear from what has been said, things do not happen necessarily simply because God knows them.<br>
          One might object that this distinction is valid only in regard to forms, such as whiteness and blackness, which can succeed one another in a subject, but that since it is impossible for something once known by God later not to be known by Him, this distinction does not apply here. However, we reply that, although God’s knowledge does not change but always remains the same, the condition according to which a thing is referred to His knowledge does not always remain the same with respect to that knowledge. For a thing is related to God’s knowledge as it is in its own present existence, yet present existence does not always belong to it. Hence, we can consider the thing either together with its condition of being present or without it, and, consequently, we can consider it either in the manner in which it is referred to God’s knowledge or in some other manner. In this way, the afore-mentioned distinction is valid.

          <td>6. Neither our science nor God’s knowledge can be about future contingents. This would be even more true if He knew them as future. He knows them, however, as present to Himself and future to others. Therefore, the objection does not stand.

          <td>Ad septimum dicendum, quod circa hoc est diversa opinio. Quidam enim dixerunt, quod hoc antecedens est contingens: hoc est scitum a Deo; eo quod, quamvis sit praeteritum, tamen importat ordinem ad futurum, et ideo non est necessarium; sicut cum dicitur: hoc fuit futurum; istud praeteritum non est necessarium, quia quod fuit futurum, potest non esse futurum, ut in II enim de Gener. et Corruption. dicitur: futurus quis incedere non incedet. Sed hoc nihil est: quia cum dicitur: hoc est futurum, vel fuit futurum; designatur ordo qui est in causis illius rei ad productionem eius. Quamvis autem causae quae sunt ordinatae ad aliquem effectum possint impediri, ut effectus non consequatur ex eis, non tamen potest impediri quin fuerint aliquando ad hoc ordinatae; unde, licet quod est futurum, possit non esse futurum, nunquam tamen potest non fuisse futurum.<br>
          Et ideo alii dicunt, quod hoc antecedens est contingens, quia est compositum ex necessario et contingenti: scientia enim Dei est necessaria, sed scitum ab eo est contingens: quorum utrumque in praedicto antecedente includitur; sicut et hoc est contingens: Socrates est homo albus; vel: Socrates est animal et currit. Sed hoc iterum nihil est: quia veritas propositionis non variatur per necessitatem et contingentiam, ex eo quod materialiter in locutione ponitur, sed solum ex principali compositione in qua fundatur veritas propositionis; unde eadem ratio necessitatis et contingentiae est in utraque istarum: ego cogito hominem esse animal; et: ego cogito Socratem currere. Et ideo, cum actus principalis qui significatur in hoc antecedente, Deus scit Socratem currere, sit necessarius; quantumcumque illud quod materialiter ponitur, sit contingens, ex hoc non impeditur quin antecedens praedictum sit necessarium.<br>
          Et ideo alii concedunt simpliciter, quod sit necessarium; sed dicunt, quod ex antecedente necessario absolute, non oportet quod sequatur consequens necessarium absolute, nisi quando antecedens est causa proxima consequentis. Si enim sit causa remota, potest necessitas effectus impediri per contingentiam causae proximae; sicut quamvis sol sit causa necessaria, tamen floritio arboris, quae est eius effectus, est contingens, quia causa eius proxima est variabilis, scilicet vis generativa plantae. Sed hoc etiam non videtur sufficiens, quia hoc non est propter naturam causae et causati quod ex antecedente necessario sequitur consequens necessarium, sed magis propter ordinem consequentis ad antecedens: quia contrarium consequentis nullo modo potest stare cum antecedente; quod contingeret, si ex antecedente necessario sequeretur consequens contingens; unde hoc accidere est necesse in qualibet conditionali, si vera sit, sive antecedens sit effectus, sive causa proxima, sive remota; et si hoc non inveniatur in conditionali, nullo modo erit vera; unde et haec conditionalis est falsa: si sol movetur, arbor florebit.<br>
          Et ideo aliter dicendum est, quod hoc antecedens est simpliciter necessarium, et consequens est necessarium absolute, eo modo quo ad antecedens sequitur. Aliter enim est de his quae attribuuntur rei secundum se, aliter de his quae attribuuntur ei secundum quod est cognita. Illa enim quae attribuuntur ei secundum se, conveniunt ei secundum modum suum. Sed illa quae attribuuntur ei vel quae consequuntur ad ipsam in quantum est cognita, sunt secundum modum cognoscentis. Unde, si in antecedente significetur aliquid quod pertineat ad cognitionem, oportet quod consequens accipiatur secundum modum cognoscentis, et non secundum modum rei cognitae; ut si dicam: si ego intelligo aliquid, illud est immateriale; non enim oportet ut quod intelligitur, sit immateriale, nisi secundum quod est intellectum: et similiter cum dico: si Deus scit aliquid, illud erit; consequens est sumendum, non secundum dispositionem rei in seipsa, sed secundum modum cognoscentis. Quamvis autem res in seipsa, sit futura, tamen secundum modum cognoscentis est praesens; et ideo magis esset dicendum: si Deus scit aliquid, hoc est; quam: hoc erit; unde idem est iudicium de ista: si Deus scit aliquid, hoc erit; et de hac: si ego video Socratem currere, Socrates currit: quorum utrumque est necessarium dum est.
          <td>7. There have been many opinions about this. Some say that the antecedent, “This is known by God,” is contingent because, although it refers to something in the past, it nevertheless implies a relation to the future, and therefore is not necessary. For example, when it is said, “This was going to happen,” the was does not mark the event as necessary, since what was going to happen could have failed to do so; for, as is said in <i>Generation and Corruption</i> : “He who is about to walk, will not walk.” This argument, however, is invalid; for when one says, “This is future” or “This was future,” one designates the ordination of the causes of that thing to its production. Now, although it is possible that the causes ordained to a certain effect can be impeded in such a way that the effect will not follow from them, it is not possible to prevent their having been at some time ordained to produce this effect. Hence, even if that which is future should be able not to happen in the future, it will never be able at any time not to have been a future.<br>
          For this reason, others say that this antecedent is contingent since it is composed of a necessary and a contingent; for God’s knowledge is necessary, but what is known by Him is contingent, and each of these is included in the antecedent mentioned in the difficulty. For example, the following are contingent: “Socrates is a white man,” or “Socrates is an animal and he runs.” However, this argument, too, is invalid, for the truth of a proposition is not affected by the necessity and contingency of that which is affirmed materially in a proposition. The truth of a proposition is determined only by the principal composition. Hence, the same character of necessity and contingency is found in each of the following: “I think that man is an animal” and “I think that Socrates is running.” Consequently, since the principal act signified in the antecedent, “God knows Socrates is running,” is necessary, no matter how contingent the thing may be which is affirmed materially, this still does not prevent the afore-mentioned antecedent from being necessary.<br>
          Hence, others simply concede that the antecedent is necessary. Yet, they add, from the fact that an antecedent is absolutely necessary, it need not follow that the consequent is absolutely necessary, unless the antecedent is the proximate cause of the consequent. If it is the remote cause, the necessity of the effect can be impeded by the contingency of the proximate cause. For example, even though the sun is a necessary cause, the flowering of a tree, its effect, is contingent; for its proximate cause, the tree’s germinating power, is not constant. This argument, however, does not seem to be sufficient; for it is not due to the nature of the cause and effect that a necessary consequence follows from a necessary antecedent, but rather to the relation that the consequent has to its antecedent. For the contrary of the consequent can by no means stand with the antecedent. And this would happen if a contingent consequent followed from a necessary antecedent. This relationship must be found in any true conditional, whether the antecedent is the effect, the proximate cause, or the remote cause. Moreover, if this relationship is not found in the conditional, the proposition is not true at all. Therefore, this conditional is also false: “If the sun moves, the tree will flower.”<br>
          Hence, the difficulty must be solved differently: the antecedent is necessary without any qualification, and the consequent is absolute necessary in the way in which it follows from the antecedent. For what is attributed to a thing in itself is quite different from what is attributed to a thing in so far as it is known. What is attributed to it in itself belongs to it according to its own manner; but what is attributed to a thing or follows upon it in so far as it is known is according to the manner of the knower. Hence, if, in the antecedent, something is signified which pertains to knowledge, the consequent must be taken according to the manner of the knower, not according to the manner of the thing known. For example, were I to say, “If I understand something, that thing is without matter,” what is understood need be immaterial only in so far as it is understood. Similarly, when I say, “If God knows something, it will be,” the consequent should not be taken according to the mode of being of the thing in itself but according to the mode of the knower. For, although a thing in itself is future, it is present according to the mode of the knower. Consequently, we should rather say, “If God knows something, it is,” than say, “it will be.” We must, therefore, judge in the same way the proposition, “If God knows something, it will be,” and this one, “If I see Socrates running, Socrates is running”; for both are necessary as long as the action is going on.

Sed sic non est inconveniens quod ponatur, quod Deus scit aliquid esse futurum quod non erit; in quantum, scilicet, scit aliquas causas esse inclinatas ad aliquem effectum, qui non producetur; sic enim nunc non loquimur de cognitione futuri, prout a Deo in suis causis videtur, sed prout cognoscitur in seipso; sic enim cognoscitur ut praesens.

Although a contingent does not exercise an act of existence as long as it is a future, as soon as it is present it has both existence and truth, and in this condition stands under the divine vision. God, however, also knows the relation of one thing to another, and in this way He knows that a thing is future in regard to another thing. Consequently, there is no difficulty in affirming that God knows something as future which will not take place, inasmuch as He knows that certain causes are inclined toward a certain effect which will not be produced. But when we talk in this way we are not speaking of that knowledge of the future by which God sees things in their causes, but of that by which He sees a thing in itself.

Therefore.—Proof of the minor is as follows: If a knower at times knows more things, at other times fewer, his knowledge changes. Therefore, a knower who can know more or fewer things than he now knows possesses knowledge subject to change. Now, God can know more than He knows: He knows that there are, or were, or will be things made by Him; however, He could make more which He is never going to make. Consequently, He could know more things than He does. Similarly, He can know fewer than He does, since He could do away with a part of what He is going to make. Therefore, His knowledge can be increased and diminished.

The answer was given that even though more or fewer things could fall under God’s knowledge, His knowledge itself could not change.—On the contrary, just as the possibles are subject to divine power, so are knowable things subject to divine knowledge. Now, if God could make more than He could previously, His power would be increased; and it would be diminished if He could make fewer.

However, the will cannot make itself simultaneously will and not will; nor can the divine will, which is immutable, first wish something and later not wish the same thing at the same time, because then God’s will would be circumscribed by time and would not be entirely simultaneous. If we are speaking of absolute necessity, therefore, it is not necessary for Him to wish what He wishes. Therefore, absolutely speaking, it is possible for Him not to wish it.

Change is found in a second way in the act of knowing when it considers now one thing, now another. But neither can this be found in God’s knowledge, since He sees all through the one species of His essence, and consequently looks upon all things in the same intuition. A third kind of change occurs when, in his contemplation, a person passes from one thing to another. But this, too, cannot be found in God, for discursive reasoning is a passage between two members, and there is no discursive reasoning in knowledge that sees two things if it sees both in one intuition. This is what actually takes place in the divine knowledge, since God sees all things by one intuition.

          <td>From the point of view of the manner of knowing, there can also be changes in knowledge by reason of the fact that one can now know something more clearly and perfectly than he did before. This can arise from two sources. First, it can arise from a difference in the medium by which the cognition takes place. For example, one may first know something through a probable middle term, and later through a middle term that is necessary. This, however, cannot take place in God because His essence, which for Him is the medium of knowing, never changes. Secondly, it can come from the intellectual power which causes a man of greater acumen to know something more penetratingly, even through the same medium, than another man does. This, too, however, cannot take place in God, since the power by which He knows is His own essence, and this does not change.

          <td>5. When it is said, “God can know what He does not know,” one can understand this in two ways—even if we are speaking of His knowledge of vision. First, we can understand it in its composite sense, that is, on the supposition that God has not known what He is said to be able to know. In this sense it is false; for the following two things cannot be true simultaneously, namely, that God should have been ignorant of something, and later know that thing. The proposition can also be taken in a divided sense. In this sense, no supposition or condition of His power is included, and in this sense it is true, as is clear from our discussion.<br>
          Although it may, in some sense, be conceded that God can know what He did not know previously, we cannot concede in any sense that He can know more than He knows; for, since the word <i>more</i> implies a comparison to what has previously existed, it is always understood in a composite sense. For the same reason, we can in no way concede that God’s knowledge can be increased or diminished.

Just as God knows many different things in the same manner, both when they exist and when they do not, so does He know in the same manner different propositions, both when they are true and when they are false, because He knows each to be true at the time when it is true. For example, He knows this proposition, “Socrates is running,” to be true when it is true; similarly, this proposition, “Socrates will run,” and so forth. Hence, although it is not true now that Socrates is running but that he has run, nevertheless, God knows each because He simultaneously intuits each time when each proposition is true. If He knew a proposition by forming it in Himself, however, then He would know a proposition only when it is true, as happens in us. Then His knowledge would change.

Et ideo, cum omnis similitudo attendatur secundum convenientiam alicuius formae, oportet quod quaecumque sunt similia, ita se habeant, quod vel unum sit causa alterius, vel ambo ex una causa causentur. In omni autem scientia est assimilatio scientis ad scitum; unde oportet quod vel scientia sit causa sciti, vel scitum sit causa scientiae, vel utrumque ab una causa causetur. Non potest autem dici quod res scitae a Deo sint causae scientiae in eo; quia res sunt temporales, et scientia Dei sit aeterna, temporale autem non potest esse causa aeterni. Similiter non potest dici quod utrumque ab una causa causetur; quia in Deo nihil potest esse causatum, cum ipse sit quidquid habet. Unde relinquitur quod scientia eius sit causa rerum. Sed e converso scientia nostra causata est a rebus, inquantum, scilicet, eam a rebus accipimus. Sed scientia Angelorum neque est causa rerum, neque ab eis causata; sed utrumque est ab una causa; sicut enim Deus formas naturales influit rebus, ut subsistant, ita similitudines earum infundit mentibus Angelorum ad cognoscendum res.
          <td>An effect cannot be more simple than its cause. Consequently, whatever things in which one nature is found must be reduced to some one thing which is the first subject of that nature, as all hot things are reduced to one and the first hot thing, namely, fire, which, as is said in the <i>Metaphysics,</i> is the cause of heat in others. Now, since every resemblance involves an agreement of forms, whatever things are alike are so related that either one is the cause of the other or both are caused by one cause. Moreover, in all knowledge there is an assimilation of the knower to the known. Hence, either the knowledge is the cause of the thing known, or the thing known is the cause of the knowledge, or both are caused by one cause. It cannot be said, however, that what is known by God is the cause of His knowledge; for things are temporal and His knowledge is eternal, and what is temporal cannot be the cause of anything eternal. Similarly, it cannot be said that both are caused by one cause, because there can be nothing caused in God, seeing that He is whatever He has. Hence, there is left only one possibility: His knowledge is the cause of things. Conversely, our knowledge is caused by things inasmuch as we receive it from things. Angels’ knowledge, however, is not caused by things and is not the cause of things, but both the things which the angels know and their knowledge are from one cause; for in the same way that God communicates universal forms to things, making them subsist, He communicates likenesses of things to the minds of angels so that the angels can know them.

Similiter etiam scientia significatur per hoc quod aliquid est in sciente, non ex hoc quod sit aliquid a sciente; et ideo a scientia nunquam procedit effectus nisi mediante voluntate, quae de sui ratione importat influxum quemdam ad volita; sicut a substantia nunquam exit actio nisi mediante virtute, quamvis in quibusdam sit idem voluntas et scientia, ut in Deo; in quibusdam autem non, ut in aliis. Similiter etiam a Deo, cum sit causa prima omnium, procedunt effectus mediantibus causis secundis;
          <td>It should be observed, however, that knowledge as knowledge does not denote an active cause, no more than does a form as a form. Action consists, as it were, in the procession of something from the agent; but a form as a form has its act of existence by perfecting that in which it is, and by resting in that thing. Consequently, a form is not a principle of acting, except through the mediation of a power. In some cases, it is true, the form itself is the power, but not by reason of being a form. In other cases, the power is other than the substantial form of the thing. For example, the actions of bodies do not take place without the mediation of certain of their qualities. Similarly, knowledge denotes that there is something in the knower, not that something has been caused by the knower. Hence, an effect never arises from knowledge except through the mediation of the will, which, of its very nature, implies a certain influence upon what is willed. For action never proceeds from a substance without the mediation of a power, although in the case of some substances, such as God, will is identical with knowledge. In other substances, namely, all creatures, this is not the case. Similarly, effects proceed from God, the first cause of all things, through the mediation of secondary causes.

Omnis autem effectus non solum sequitur conditionem causae primae, sed etiam mediae; et ideo res scitae a Deo procedunt ab eius scientia per modum voluntatis, et per modum causarum secundarum; nec oportet quod in omnibus modum scientiae sequantur.
          <td>Hence, between His knowledge (the cause of the thing) and the thing caused there is found a twofold medium: one on the part of God, namely, the divine will; another on the part of things themselves in regard to certain effects, namely, the medium of secondary causes through whose mediation things proceed from God’s knowledge. Moreover, every effect follows not only the condition of the first cause but also that of the intermediate cause. Hence, the things known by God proceed from His knowledge as conditioned by His will and as conditioned by secondary causes. Consequently, it is not necessary that these things follow the manner of His knowledge in all respects.

Quod autem dicit, quia futurum est, ideo scitur a Deo, non importatur causa essendi, sed causa inferendi tantum.
          <td>1. Origen’s meaning is that God’s knowledge is not a cause so necessitating the thing known that from the very fact that something is known by God it must necessarily take place. Moreover, his phrase “Because it is to be, it is known by God...” gives the reason for concluding that God knows it, not the cause of the divine knowledge.

          <td>3. An effect follows the necessity of its proximate cause, which can also be a means of demonstrating the effect. An effect need not follow the necessity of the first cause, since an effect can be impeded, if it is contingent, by reason of a secondary cause. This is seen in the effects produced by the motion of the celestial bodies through the mediation of inferior forces on objects subject to generation and corruption. Even though the motion of the heavens remains always the same, these effects are contingent because the natural forces are defective.

Sed quia causa secunda non potest esse necessaria si prima sit contingens, inde est quod ad necessitatem causae secundae sequitur necessitas in effectu.
          <td>5. Although the first cause influences an effect more powerfully than a secondary cause does, the effect does not take place without the operation of the secondary cause. Hence, if it is possible for the secondary cause to fail in its operation, it is possible for the effect not to take place, even though the first cause itself cannot fail. The possibility of the effect’s not taking place would be much greater if the first cause itself could fail. Therefore, since both causes are required for the existence of an effect, a failure of either cause will result in a failure of the effect. Hence, if contingency is affirmed of either cause, the effect will be contingent. But, if only one of the causes is necessary, the effect will not be necessary, since both causes are required for the existence of the effect. But, because a secondary cause cannot be necessary if the first cause is contingent, one can say that the necessity of an effect follows the necessity of the second cause.

Per hoc autem aliquid est unum, quod est in se indivisum, et ab aliis distinctum; unde oportet quod quicumque cognoscit aliquid quod sciat distinctionem eius ab aliis. Prima autem ratio distinctionis est in affirmatione et negatione: et ideo oportet quod quicumque scit affirmationem, cognoscat negationem; et quia privatio nihil aliud est quam negatio subiectum habens, ut dicitur in IV Metaphysicor., et alterum contrariorum semper est privatio, ut dicitur in eodem, et in I Physic., inde est quod ex hoc ipso quod cognoscitur aliquid, cognoscitur eius privatio et eius contrarium. Unde, cum Deus habeat propriam cognitionem de omnibus suis effectibus, unumquodque prout est in sua natura distinctum, cognoscens; oportet quod omnes negationes et privationes oppositas cognoscat, et omnes contrarietates in rebus repertas; unde, cum malum sit privatio boni, oportet quod ex hoc ipso quod scit quodlibet bonum et mensuram cuiuscumque, quod cognoscat quodlibet malum.
          <td>According to the Philosopher, whoever does not understand a thing which is one does not understand anything at all. A thing is one, however, by being undivided in itself and distinct from others. Hence, whoever knows a thing must know its distinction from other things. But the first basis of distinction lies in affirmation and negation. Therefore, whoever knows an affirmation must know its negation. Now, since privation is nothing but a negation having a subject (as is said in the Metaphysics”), and since “one of two contraries is always a privation” (as is said both in the <i>Metaphysics</i> and <i>Physics</i> )—from the very fact that a thing is known, its privation and its contrary are known. Accordingly, since God has a proper knowledge of all His effects, knowing each one of them as it is, distinct in its own nature, He must know all the opposed negations and opposed privations, as well as all the contrarieties found in things. Consequently, since evil is the privation of good, by knowing any good at all and the measure of any thing whatsoever, He knows every evil thing.

Since evil is not opposed to universal but to particular being, it follows from this that God would not know evil. But this position is false, as is evident from what has been said. Hence, what follows from this position is also false, namely, that God does not know privations and evil things. For, according to the Commentator, a privation is known by an intellect only by the absence of a form from the intellect—a condition that cannot exist in an intellect which is always in act. But this is not necessary; for, from the very fact that a thing is known, its privation is known. Hence, both thing and privation are known through the presence of a form in the intellect.

          <td>Ad quartum dicendum, quod oppositio unius ad aliud potest accipi dupliciter: uno modo in generali, sicut dicimus malum opponi bono; et hoc modo malum opponitur Deo: alio modo in speciali, prout dicimus hoc album opponi huic nigro; et sic non est oppositio mali nisi ad illud bonum quod potest per malum privari, et cui potest esse nocivum; et sic malum non opponitur Deo. Unde Augustinus dicit in libro XII de civitate Dei, quod vitium opponitur Deo tamquam malum bono; sed naturae, quam vitiat, non solum opponitur ut malum bono, sed etiam ut nocivum.
          <td>4. The opposition of one thing to another can be taken in two ways: first, in general, as when we say that evil is opposed to good, and in this sense, evil is opposed to God; second, in particular, as when we say that this white thing is opposed to this black thing, and in this sense an evil is opposed only to that good which can be taken away by this evil and to which it would be harmful. In this second way evil is not opposed to God. Augustine accordingly says: “Vice is opposed to God in the way in which evil is opposed to good.” But, to the nature which it vitiates, vice is opposed not merely as evil to good but also as something harmful to that nature.

          <td>Ad quintum dicendum, quod malum in quantum est scitum, est bonum, quia scire malum, bonum est; et sic verum est quod omne addiscibile est bonum; non autem quod sit secundum se bonum, sed solum in quantum est scitum.
          <td>5. In so far as evil is known, it is a good; for to know evil is a good. Thus, it is true that whatever can be learned is a good—not that it is good in itself, but that it is good only in so far as it is known.

          <td>Ad sextum dicendum, quod grammatica scitur in habendo grammaticam, non autem malum; et ideo non est simile.
          <td>6. Grammar is known by possessing the art of grammar. But evil is not known by possessing it. Hence, no analogy can be drawn.
