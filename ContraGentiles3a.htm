            [1] That there is one First Being, possessing the full perfection of
            the whole of being, and that we call Him God, has been shown in the
            preceding Books. From the abundance of His perfection, He endows all
            existing things with being, so that He is fully established not only
            as the First Being but also as the original source of all existing
            things. Moreover, He has granted being to other things, not by a
            necessity of His nature but according to the choice of His will, as
            has been made clear in our earlier explanations. From this it
            follows that He is the Lord of the things that He has made, for we
            are masters of the things that are subject to our will. In fact, He
            holds perfect dominion over things produced by Himself, since to
            produce them He is in need neither of the assistance of an external
            agent nor of the underlying presence of matter, for He is the
            universal maker of the whole of being.

            [2] Now, each of the things produced through the will of an agent is

            must be directed to some end. Moreover, each thing achieves its
            ultimate end through its own action which must be directed to the
            end by Him Who gives things the principles through which they act.

            [4] Of course, the result of this rule is manifested differently in
            different beings, depending on the diversity of their natures. For
            some beings so exist as God’s products that, possessing
            understanding, they bear His likeness and reflect His image.
            Consequently, they are not only ruled but are also rulers of
            themselves, inasmuch as their own actions are directed to a fitting
            end. If these beings submit to the divine rule in their own ruling,
            then by virtue of the divine rule they are admitted to the
            achievement of their ultimate end; but, if they proceed otherwise in
            their own ruling, they are rejected.

            order to the end which is prearranged for them. They are unfailingly

            [6] Other beings, however, are corruptible. They can suffer a defect
            in their natural being, yet such a defect works to the advantage of
            another being. For, when one thing is corrupted, another comes into
            being. Likewise, in their proper actions they may fall short of the
            natural order, yet such a failure is balanced by the good which
            comes from it. Thus, it is evident that not even those things which
            appear to depart from the order of the primary rule do actually
            escape the power of the First Ruler. Even these corruptible bodies
            are perfectly subject to His power, just as they are created by God

            Ruler, even if they go astray sometimes in their own actions, he

            of the earth (that is, of corruptible bodies) and which always

            [10] Therefore, since we have treated of the perfection of the
            divine nature in Book One, and of the perfection of His power
            inasmuch as He is the Maker and Lord of all things in Book Two,
            there remains to be treated in this third Book His perfect authority
            or dignity, inasmuch as He is the End and Ruler of all things. So,
            this will be our order of procedure: first, we shall treat of
            Himself, according as He is the end of all things; second, of His
            universal rule, according as He governs every creature [64-110];
            third, of His particular rule, according as He governs creatures
            possessed of understanding [111-163.

              [2] In the case of things which obviously act for an end we call
              that toward which the inclination of the agent tend the end. For,
              if it attain this, it is said to attain its end; but if it fail in
              regard to this, it fails in regard to the end in tended, as is
              evident in the case of the physician working for the sake of
              health, and of the man who is running toward a set objective. As
              far as this point is concerned, it makes n difference whether the
              being tending to an end is a knowing being or not. For, just as
              the target is the end for the archer, so is it the end for the
              motion of the arrow. Now every inclination of an agent tends
              toward something definite. A given action does not stem from
              merely any power but heating comes from heat, cooling from cold.
              Thus it is that, actions are specifically distinguished by virtue
              of diversity of active powers. In fact, an action may sometime
              terminate in something which is made, as building does in a house,
              and as healing does in health. Sometimes, however, it does not, as
              in the cases of understanding an sensing. Now, if an action does
              in fact terminate in some thing that is made, the inclination of
              the agent tend through the action toward the thing that is
              produced. But if it does not terminate in a product, then the
              inclination of the agent tends toward the action itself. So, it
              must be that every agent in acting intends an end, sometimes the
              action itself, sometimes a thing produced by the action.

              [3] Again, with reference to all things that act for an end, we
              say that the ultimate end is that beyond which the agent seeks
              nothing else; thus, the action of a physician goes as far as
              health, but when it is attained there is no desire for anything
              further. Now, in the action of all agents, one may find something
              beyond which the agent seeks nothing further. Otherwise, actions
              would tend to infinity, which is impossible. Since “it is
              impossible to proceed to infinity,” the agent could not begin to
              act, because nothing is moved toward what cannot be reached.
              Therefore, every agent acts for an end.

              [4] Besides, if the actions of an agent are supposed to proceed to
              infinity, then there must be as a consequence to these actions
              either something that is produced, or nothing. Supposing that
              there is something that results, then the existence of this thing
              would come about after an infinite number of actions. But that
              which presupposes an infinite number of things cannot come into
              existence, since it is impossible to proceed to infinity. Now,
              that which is impossible in regard to being is impossible in
              regard to coming into being. And it is impossible to produce that
              which cannot come into being. Therefore, it is impossible for an
              agent to begin to produce something that presupposes an infinite
              number of actions.

              Supposing, on the other hand, that nothing follows as a product of
              these actions, then the order of such actions must either depend
              on the ordering of the active powers (as in the case of a man who
              senses so that he may imagine, imagines so that he may understand,
              and then understands so that he may will); or it depends on the
              ordering of objects (thus, I think of body so that I may be able
              to think of soul, which latter I think so that I may be able to
              think of immaterial substance, which in turn I think so that I may
              be able to think about God). Indeed, it is impossible to proceed
              to infinity, either through a series of active powers (for
              instance, through the forms of things, as is proved in
              <i>Metaphysics</i> [Ia, 2: 994a 1–b6], for the form is the
              principle of action) or through a series of objects (for there is
              not an infinite number of beings, because there is one First
              Being, as we demonstrated earlier [I:42]). So, it is not possible
              for actions to proceed to infinity. There must, then, be something
              which satisfies the agent’s desire when it is attained. Therefore,
              every agent acts for an end.

              [5] Moreover, for things which act for an end, all things
              intermediate between the first agent and the ultimate end are as
              ends in regard to things prior, and as active principles with
              regard to things consequent. So, if the agent’s desire is not
              directed to some definite thing, but, rather, the actions are
              multiplied to infinity, as was said, then the active principles
              must be multiplied to infinity. This is impossible, as we showed
              above. Therefore, the agent’s desire must be directed to some
              definite thing.

            <td>
              [6] Furthermore, for every agent the principle of its action is
              either its nature or its intellect. Now, there is no question that
              intellectual agents act for the sake of an end, because they think
              ahead of time in their intellects of the things which they achieve
              through action; and their action stems from such preconception.
              This is what it means for intellect to be the principle of action.
              just as the entire likeness of the result achieved by the actions
              of an intelligent agent exists in the intellect that preconceives
              it, so, too, does the likeness of a natural resultant pre-exist in
              the natural agent; and as a consequence of this, the action is
              determined to a definite result. For fire gives rise to fire, and
              an olive to an olive. Therefore, the agent that acts with nature
              as its principle is just as much directed to a definite end, in
              its action, as is the agent that acts through intellect as its
              principle. Therefore, every agent acts for an end.

              [7] Again, there is no fault to be found, except in the case of
              things that are for the sake of an end. A fault is never
              attributed to an agent, if the failure is related to something
              that is not the agent’s end. Thus, the fault of failing to heal is
              imputed to the physician, but not to the builder or the
              grammarian. We do find fault with things done according to art,
              for instance, when the grammarian does not speak correctly, and
              also in things done according to nature, as is evident in the case

              Now, he who looks upon a manifold number of things with
              indifference no more succeeds in doing one of them than another.
              Hence, from an agent contingently indifferent to alternatives no

              something. So, it would be impossible for him to act. Therefore,

              play; at other times they are for an end, for instance, when we

              without attention do not stem from the intellect but from some
              sudden act of imagination or from a natural source. Thus, a
              disorder of the.humors produces an itch and is the cause of
              rubbing the beard, and this is done without intellectual
              attention. So, these actions do tend to some end, though quite
              apart from the order of the intellect.

              [2] That every agent acts for an end has been made clear from the

              toward which an agent tends in a definite way must be appropriate
              to it, because the agent would not be inclined to it except by
              virtue of some agreement with it. But, what is appropriate to
              something is good for it. So, every agent acts for a good.

              the essential meaning of the good is that it provides a terminus

              changing of external matter, it is obvious that the mover intends
              to bring about some perfection in the thing that is moved. Even
              the thing that is moved also tends toward this, if it be a case of
              natural movement. Now, we call what is perfect a good. So, every

            <td>
              [7] Again, an intelligent agent acts for the sake of an end, in
              the sense that it determines the end for itself. On the other
              hand, an agent that acts from a natural impulse, though acting for
              an end, as we showed in the preceding chapter, does not determine
              the end for itself, since it does not know the meaning of an end,
              but, rather, is moved toward an end determined for it by another
              being. Now, the intelligent agent does not determine the end for
              itself, unless it do so by considering the rational character of
              the good, for an object of the intellect is only motivating by
              virtue of the rational meaning of the good, which is the object of
              the will. Therefore, even the natural agent is neither moved, nor
              does it move, for the sake of an end, except in so far as the end
              is a good; for the end is determined for the natural agent by some
              appetite. Therefore, every agent acts for the sake of a good.

              [8] Besides, there is the same general reason for avoiding evil
              that there is for seeking the good, just as there is the same
              general reason for moving downward and for moving upward. But all
              things are known to flee from evil; in fact, intelligent agents
              avoid a thing for this reason: they recognize it as an evil thing.
              Now, all natural agents resist corruption, which is an evil for
              each individual, to the full extent of their power. Therefore, all

              [9] Moreover, that which results from the action of an agent, but
              apart from the intention of the agent, is said to happen by chance
              or by luck. But we observe that what happens in the workings of
              nature is either always, or mostly, for the better. Thus, in the
              plant world leaves are arranged so as to protect the fruit, and
              among animals the bodily organs are disposed in such a way that
              the animal can be protected. So, if this came about apart from the
              intention of the natural agent, it would be by chance or by luck.
              But this is impossible, for things which occur always, or for the
              most part, are neither chance nor fortuitous events, but only
              those which occur in few instances. Therefore, the natural agent
              tends toward what is better, and it is much more evident that the
              intelligent agent does so. Hence, every agent intends the good
              when it acts.

              moved, since it is in potency, tends toward act, and so toward the

              [4] Besides, the movement of a mobile thing and the motion of its
              mover tend toward the same objective. Of itself, the mobile thing
              tends toward the good, but it may tend toward evil accidentally
              and apart from intention. This is best seen in generation and
              corruption. When it is under one form, matter is in potency to
              another form and to the privation of the form it already has.
              Thus, when it is under the form of air, it is in potency to the
              form of fire and to the privation of the form of air. Change in
              the matter terminates in both at the same time; in the form of
              fire, in so far as fire is generated; in the privation of the form
              of air, inasmuch as air is corrupted. Now, the intention and
              appetite of matter are not toward privation but toward form, for
              it does not tend toward the impossible. Now, it is impossible for
              matter to exist under privation alone, but for it to exist under a
              form is possible. Therefore, that which terminates in a privation
              is apart from intention. It terminates in a privation inasmuch as
              it attains the form which it intends, and the privation of another
              form is a necessary result of this attainment. So, the changing of
              matter in generation and corruption is essentially ordered to the
              form, but the privation is a consequence apart from the intention.
              The same should be true for all cases of change. Therefore, in
              every change there is a generation and a corruption, in some
              sense; for instance, when a thing changes from white to black, the
              white is corrupted and the black comes into being. Now, it is a
              good thing for matter to be perfected through form, and for
              potency to be perfected through its proper act, but it is a bad
              thing for it to be deprived of its due act. So, everything that is
              moved tends in its movement to reach a good, but it reaches an
              evil apart from such a tendency. Therefore, since every agent and
              mover tends to the good, evil arises apart from the intention of
              the agent.

              [5] Moreover, in the case of beings that act as a result of
              understanding or of some sort of sense judgment, intention is a
              consequence of apprehension, for the intention tends to what is
              apprehended as an end. If it actually attains something which does
              not possess the specific nature of what was apprehended, then this
              will be apart from the intention. For example, if someone intends
              to eat honey, but he cats poison, in the belief that it is honey,
              then this will be apart from the intention. But every intelligent
              agent tends toward something in so far as he considers the object
              under the rational character of a good, as was evident in the
              preceding chapter. So, if this object is not good but bad, this
              will be apart from his intention. Therefore, an intelligent agent
              does not produce an evil result, unless it be apart from his
              intention. Since to tend to the good is common to the intelligent
              agent and to the agent that acts by natural instinct, evil does
              not result from the intention of any agent, except apart from the
              intention.

              of nature. Even in the case of volitional agents sin occurs in
              most cases, since “it is as difficult to act in accord with virtue

              unreasonable for the agent of voluntarily unjust actions not to
              will to be unjust, and for the self-indulgent man not to wish to
              be incontinent” [1114a 11]; and he proves it also by the fact that
              legislators punish evil men as doers of evil in a voluntary way
              [1113b 22]. So, it does not seem that evil occurs apart from the

              Ut autem positarum rationum solutio manifestior fiat,
              considerandum est quod malum considerari potest vel in substantia

              est ex eo quod deficit ei aliquid quod natum est et debet habere:
              si enim homo non habet alas, non est ei malum, quia non est natus
              eas habere; si etiam homo capillos flavos non habet, non est
              malum, quia etsi natus sit habere, non tamen est debitum ut

              debet habere, si sit perfectus, quod tamen non est malum avi.
              Omnis autem privatio, si proprie et stricte accipiatur, est eius
              quod quis natus est habere et debet habere. In privatione igitur
              sic accepta semper est ratio mali.

            <td>
              [1] So that the solution of these alleged arguments maybe made
              more evident we should notice that evil may be considered either
              in a substance or in its action. Now, evil is in a substance
              because something which it was originally to have, and which it
              ought to have, is lacking in it. Thus, if a man has no wings, that
              is not an evil for him, because he was not born to have them; even
              if a man does not have blond hair, that is not an evil, for,
              though he may have such hair, it is not something that is
              necessarily due him. But it is an evil if he has no hands, for
              these he is born to, and should, have—if he is to be perfect. Yet
              this defect is not an evil for a bird. Every privation, if taken
              properly and strictly, is of that which one is born to have, and
              should have. So, in this strict meaning of privation, there is
              always the rational character of evil.

              actually perfect. Of course, to each thing composed of matter some
              sort of form is due, for water cannot exist unless it have the
              form of water, nor can fire be unless it possess the form of fire.
              So, the privation of such forms in relation to matter is not an
              evil for the matter, but in relation to the thing whose form it
              is, it is an evil for it; just as the privation of the form of

              formae unius est adiuncta privatio alterius. Unde corruptio non
              evenit casualiter neque ut in paucioribus: licet privatio
              quandoque non sit malum simpliciter, sed alicuius, ut dictum est.
              Si autem sit talis privatio quae privet id quod est debitum
              generato, erit casuale et simpliciter malum, sicut cum nascuntur
              partus monstruosi: hoc enim non consequitur de necessitate ad id
              quod est intentum, sed est ei repugnans; cum agens intendat
              perfectionem generati.

              [5] So the evil of natural corruption, though a result which is
              apart from the intention of the agent of generation, is
              nevertheless an invariable consequence, for the acquisition of one
              form is always accompanied by the privation of another form.
              Hence, corruption does not occur by chance, nor as something that
              happens in few cases; even though privation at times is not an
              unqualified evil, but is only so in relation to some definite
              thing, as has been said. However, if it be the kind of privation
              which takes away what is due to the thing generated, this will be
              by chance and unqualifiedly evil, as in the case of the birth of
              monsters. For, such a thing is not the necessary result of what is
              intended; rather, it is repugnant to what is intended, since the
              agent intends a perfect product of generation.

              agent has a defective power, the evil is a result apart from the
              intention, but it will not be a chance result because it follows
              necessarily from this kind of agent, provided this kind of agent
              is subject to this defect of power, either always or frequently.
              However, it will be a matter of chance if this defect is rarely
              associated with this kind of agent.

              [7] In the case of voluntary agents, the intention is directed to
              some particular good, if action is to result, for universals cause
              no movement, but particular things do, since actions go on in
              their area. Therefore, if a particular good that is intended has
              attached to it, either always or frequently, a privation of good
              according to reason, then the result is a moral evil; and not by
              chance, but either invariably or for the most part. This is
              clearly the case with a man who wills to enjoy a woman for the
              sake of pleasure, to which pleasure there is attached the disorder
              of adultery. Hence, the evil of adultery is not something which
              results by chance. However, it would be an instance of chance evil
              if some wrong resulted in a few cases from the object intended:
              for example, in the case of a person who kills a man while
              shooting at a bird.

              are more effective motives in the domain of particular things

              [9] From this it is evident that, though evil be apart from
              intention, it is nonetheless voluntary, as the second argument
              suggests, though not essentially but accidentally so. For
              intention is directed to an ultimate end which a person wills for
              its own sake, but the will may also be directed to that which a
              person wills for the sake of something else, even if he would not
              will it simply for itself. In the example of the man who throws
              his merchandise into the sea in order to save himself [cf.
              <i>Ethics</i> III, 1: 1110a 8-29], he does not intend the throwing
              away of the merchandise but his own safety; yet he wills the
              throwing not for itself but for the sake of safety. Likewise, a
              person wills to do a disorderly action for the sake of some
              sensory good to be attained; he does not intend the disorder, nor
              does he will it simply for itself, but for the sake of this
              result. And so, evil consequences and sins are called voluntary in
              this way, just as is the casting of merchandise into the sea.

            <td>
              [10] The answer to the third difficulty is similarly evident.
              Indeed, the change of corruption is never found without the change
              of generation; neither, as a consequence, is the end of corruption
              found without the end of generation. So, nature does not intend
              the end of corruption as separated from the end of generation, but
              both at once. It is not the unqualified intention of nature that
              water should not exist, but that there should be air, and while a
              thing is so existing it is not water. So, nature directly intends
              that this existing thing be air; it does not intend that this
              thing should not exist as water, except as a concomitant of the
              fact that it is to be air. Thus, privations are not intended by
              nature in themselves, but only accidentally; forms, however, are
              intended in themselves.

              everything that has an essence is, by virtue of that fact, a good
              thing. Therefore, evil has no essence.

              also proportionate to act and not contrary to it. It belongs in

              [1] It is not difficult to answer these arguments. Evil and good
              are assigned as specific differences in moral matters, as the
              first argument asserted, because moral matters depend on the will.
              For this reason, anything that is voluntary belongs in the class
              of moral matters. Now, the object of the will is the end and the
              good. Hence, moral matters get their species from the end, just as
              natural actions are specified by the form of the active principle;
              for instance, the act of heating is specified by heat. Hence,
              because good and evil are so termed by virtue of a universal
              order, or privation of order, to the end, it is necessary in moral
              matters for the primary distinction to be between good and evil.
              Now, there must be but one primary standard in any one genus. The
              standard in moral matters is reason. Therefore, it must be from a
              rational end that things in the moral area are termed good or
              evil. So, in moral matters, that which is specified by an end that
              is in accord with reason is called good specifically; and that
              which is specified by an end contrary to the rational end is
              termed evil specifically. Yet that contrary end, even though it
              runs counter to the rational end, is nevertheless some sort of
              good: for instance, something that delights on the sense level, or
              anything like that. Thus, these are goods for certain animals, and
              even for man, when they are moderated by reason. It also happens
              that what is evil for one being is good for another. So, evil, as
              a specific difference in the genus of moral matters, does not
              imply something that is evil in its own essence, but something
              that is good in itself, though evil for man, inasmuch as it takes
              away the order of reason which is the good for man.

              matters, but they are not when taken without qualification, as the
              second argument suggested. Rather, in so far as it is evil, evil

              Eodem etiam modo potest accipi dictum quod malum et bonum, prout
              sunt in moralibus, sunt genera contrariorum, ex quo tertia ratio
              procedebat. Omnium enim contrariorum moralium vel utrumque est
              malum, sicut prodigalitas et illiberalitas; vel unum bonum et
              alterum malum, sicut liberalitas et illiberalitas. Est igitur
              malum morale et genus et differentia, non secundum quod est
              privatio boni rationis, ex quo dicitur malum; sed ex natura
              actionis vel habitus ordinati ad aliquem finem qui repugnat debito
              fini rationis; sicut homo caecus est hominis individuum non
              inquantum est caecus, sed inquantum est hic homo; et irrationale
              est differentia animalis non propter privationem rationis, sed
              ratione talis naturae ad quam sequitur remotio rationis.
            </td>
            <td>
              [3] In the same way, too, one may understand the statement that
              evil and good, as found in the moral area, are “genera of
              contraries”—from which phrase the third argument begins. Indeed,
              in all moral contraries, either both contraries are evil, as in
              the case of prodigality and illiberality, or one is good and the
              other evil, as in the case of liberality and illiberality.
              Therefore, moral evil is both a genus and a difference, not by the
              fact that it is a privation of the rational good whence it is
              termed evil, but by the nature of the action or habit ordered to
              some end that is opposed to the proper rational end. Thus, a blind
              man is an individual man, not inasmuch as he is blind but in so
              far as he is this man. So, also, irrational is an animal
              difference, not because of the privation of reason but by virtue
              of a certain kind of nature, to which the absence of reason
              follows as a consequence.

              One can also say that Aristotle calls good and evil genera, not
              according to his own opinion (for he does not number them among
              the primary ten genera in which every kind of contrariety is
              found) but according to the opinion of Pythagoras, who supposed
              that good and evil are the first genera and first principles, and
              who placed ten prime contraries under each of them: under the good
              were, “limit, even, one, right, male, rest, straight, light,
              square, and finally good”; and under evil were, “the unlimited,
              odd, multitude, left, female, motion, curved, darkness, oblong,
              and finally evil [cf. <i>Met.</i> I, 5: 986a 24-27].Thus, here and
              in several places in the treatises on logic, he uses examples in
              accord with the views of other philosophers, as if they were more
              acceptable in his time.

              In fact, this statement has some truth, since it is impossible for
              a probable statement to be entirely false. In the case of all
              contraries, one is perfect and the other is a diminished
              perfection, having, as it were, some privation mixed with it. For
              instance, white and hot are perfect conditions, but cold and black
              are imperfect, connoting something of privation. Therefore, since
              every diminution and privation pertains to the formal character of
              evil, and every perfection and fulfillment to the formal character
              of good, it appears to be always so between contraries, that one
              is included under the good and the other approaches the notion of
              evil. From this point of view, good and evil seem to be genera of
              all contraries.

              [4] In this way it also becomes apparent how evil is opposed to
              the good, which is the starting point of the fourth argument.
              According as there is added a privation of a contrary form, and a
              contrary end, to a form and an end (which have the rational
              character of good and are true principles of action) the action
              that results from such a form and end is attributed to the
              privation and the evil. Yet, this attribution is accidental, for
              privation, as such, is not the principle of any action. Hence,
              Dionysius says, quite properly, in the fourth chapter of
              <i>On the Divine Names</i>, that “evil does not fight against
              good, except through the power of the good; in itself, indeed, it
              is powerless and weak,” the principle of no action, as it were.
              However, we say that evil corrupts the good, not only when it acts
              in virtue of the good, as has been explained, but also formally of
              itself. Thus, blindness is said to corrupt sight, for it is itself
              the corruption of sight; similarly, whiteness is said to color a
              wall, when it is the actual color of the wall.

              [5] We do indeed say that something is more or less evil than
              another thing, in reference to the good that it lacks. Thus,
              things which imply a privation admit of increase or decrease in
              degree, as do the unequal and the dissimilar. For we say that
              something is more unequal when it is more removed from equality
              and, likewise, that something is more dissimilar when it is
              farther away from similitude. Consequently, a thing that is more
              deprived of goodness is said to be more evil, as it were, more
              distant from the good. However, privations do not increase as do
              things that have an essence, such as qualities and forms, as the
              fifth argument assumes, but through increase of the depriving
              cause. Thus, just as the air is darker when more obstacles have
              been placed before the light, so does a thing become farther
              removed from participation in the light.

              [6] We also say that evil is in the world, not as possessing some
              essence, nor as a definitely existing thing, as the sixth argument
              suggested, but for the same reason that we may call something evil
              by virtue of its evil. For instance, blindness, or any other sort
              of privation, is said to exist because an animal is blinded by its
              blindness. Indeed, there are two ways of talking about being, as
              the Philosopher teaches in his
              <i>Metaphysics</i> [IV, 7: 1017a 8]. In one way, being means the
              essence of a thing, and thus it falls into the ten categories; so
              taken, no privation can be called a being. In another way, being
              means the truth in a judgment; in this meaning, privation is
              called a being, inasmuch as something is said to be deprived by
              virtue of a privation.

              every accidental cause reduces to a cause that works through
              itself. And only the good can be a cause through itself, for evil

              [7] Now, in the order of nature, this accidental aspect can be
              found either on the side of the agent or of the effect. It will be
              on the side of the agent when the agent suffers a defect in its
              power, the consequence of which is a defective action and a
              defective effect. Thus, when the power of an organ of digestion is
              weak, imperfect digestive functioning and undigested humor result;
              these are evils of nature. Now, it is accidental to the agent, as
              agent, for it to suffer a defect in its power; for it is not an
              agent by virtue of the fact that its power is deficient, but
              because it possesses some power. If it were completely lacking in
              power, it would not act at all. Thus, evil is caused accidentally
              on the part of the agent in so far as the agent is defective in
              its power. This is why we say that “evil has no efficient, but
              only a deficient, cause,” for evil does not result from an agent
              cause, unless because it is deficient in power, and to that extent
              it is not efficient.—And it reduces to the same thing if the
              defect in the action and in the effect arise from a defect of the
              instrument or of anything else required for the agent’s action;
              for example, when the motor capacity produces lameness because of
              a curvature of the tibia. For the agent acts both by means of its
              power and of its instrument.

              [8] On the side of the effect, evil is accidentally caused by the
              good, either by virtue of the matter of the effect, or by virtue
              of its form. For, if the matter is not well disposed to the
              reception of the agent’s action on it, there must result a defect
              in the product. Thus, the births of monsters are the result of
              lack of assimilation on the part of the matter. Nor may this be
              attributed to some defect in the agent, if it fail to convert
              poorly disposed matter into perfect act. There is a determinate
              power for each natural agent, in accord with its type of nature,
              and failure to go beyond this power will not be a deficiency in
              power; such deficiency is found only when it falls short of the
              measure of power naturally due it.

              evil of the product intended by the agent, but of another thing,

              [11] However, in the moral order, the situation seems to be
              different. It does not appear that moral vice results from a
              defect of power, since weakness either completely removes moral
              fault, or at least diminishes it. Indeed, weakness does not merit
              moral punishment that is proper to guilt, but, rather, mercy and
              forgiveness. A moral fault must be voluntary, not necessitated.
              Yet, if we consider the matter carefully, we shall find the two
              orders similar from one point of view, and dissimilar from
              another. There is dissimilarity on this point: moral fault is
              noticed in action only, and not in any effect that is produced;
              for the moral virtues are not concerned with making but with
              doing. The arts are concerned with making, and so it has been said
              that in their sphere a bad result happens just as it does in
              nature Therefore, moral evil is not considered in relation to the
              matter or form of the effect, but only as a resultant from the
              agent.

              [12] Now, in moral actions we find four principles arranged in a
              definite order. One of these is the executive power, the moving
              force, whereby the parts of the body are moved to carry out the
              command of the will. Then this power is moved by the will, which
              is a second principle. Next, the will is moved by the judgment of
              the apprehensive power which judges that this object is good or
              bad, for the objects of the will are such that one moves toward
              attainment, another moves toward avoidance. This apprehensive
              power is moved, in turn, by the thing apprehended. So, the first
              active principle in moral actions is the thing that is cognitively
              apprehended, the second is the apprehensive power, the third is
              the will, and the fourth is the motive power which carries out the
              command of reason.

              Actus autem virtutis exequentis iam praesupponit bonum vel malum

              [13] Now, the act of the power that carries out the action already
              presupposes the distinction of moral good or evil. For external
              acts of this kind do not belong in the moral area, unless they are
              voluntary. Hence, if the act of the will be good, then the
              external act is also deemed good, but if it be bad, the external
              act is bad. It would have nothing to do with moral evil if the
              external act were defective by virtue of a defect having no
              reference to the will. Lameness, for instance, is not a fault in
              the moral order, but in the natural order. Therefore, a defect of
              this type in the executive power either completely excludes moral
              fault, or diminishes it. So, too, the act whereby a thing moves
              the apprehensive power is free from moral fault, for the visible
              thing moves the power of sight in the natural order, and so, also,
              does any object move a passive potency. Then, too, this act of the
              apprehensive power, considered in itself, is without moral fault,
              for a defect in it either removes or diminishes moral fault, as is
              the case in a defect of the executive power. Likewise, weakness
              and ignorance excuse wrongdoing, or diminish it. The conclusion
              follows, then, that moral fault is found primarily and principally
              in the act of the will only, and so it is quite reasonable to say,
              as a result, that an act is moral because it is voluntary.
              Therefore the root and source of moral wrongdoing is to be sought
              in the act of the will.

              [14] However, a difficulty seems to result from this
              investigation. Since a defective act stems from a defect in the
              active principle, we must understand that there is a defect in the
              will preceding the moral fault. Of course, if this defect be
              natural, then it is always attached to the will, and so the will
              would always commit a morally bad action when it acts. But
              virtuous acts show that this conclusion is false. On the other
              hand, if the defect be voluntary, it is already a morally bad act,
              and we will have to look in turn for its cause. Thus, our rational
              investigation will never come to an end. Therefore, we must say
              that the defect pre-existing in the will is not natural, to avoid
              the conclusion that the will sins in everyone of its acts. Nor can
              we attribute the defect to chance or accident, for then there
              would be no moral fault in us, since chance events are not
              premeditated and are beyond the control of reason. So, the defect
              is voluntary. Yet, it is not a moral fault; otherwise, we should
              go on to infinity. How this is possible we must now explain.

            <td>
              [15] As a matter of fact, the perfection of the power of every
              active principle depends on a higher active principle, since a
              secondary agent acts through the power of a primary agent. While,
              therefore, a secondary agent remains in a position of
              subordination to the first agent, it acts without any defect, but
              it becomes defective in its action if it happens to turn away from
              its subordination to the primary agent, as is illustrated in the
              case of an instrument, when it falls short of the motion of the
              agent. Now, it has been said that two principles precede the will
              in the order of moral actions: namely, the apprehensive power, and
              the object apprehended, which is the end. Since to each movable
              there corresponds a proper motive power, not merely any
              apprehensive power is the suitable motive power for any and every
              appetite; rather, one pertains to this appetite and another to a
              second appetite. Thus, just as the proper motive power for the
              sensory appetite is the sensory apprehensive power, so the reason
              itself is the proper motivator for the will.

              motivating object which is not merely any good, but some
              determinate good. Hence, when the will inclines to act as moved by

              [17] Hence, a defect of ordering to reason and to a proper end
              precedes a fault of action in the will: in regard to reason, in
              the case of the will inclining, on the occasion of a sudden sense
              apprehension, toward a good that is on the level of sensory
              pleasure; and in regard to a proper end, in the case when reason

              time or under these conditions, really good, and yet the will
              inclines toward it, as if it were a proper good. Now, this defect
              in ordering is voluntary, for to will and not to will lie within
              the power of the will itself. And it is also within its power for
              reason to make an actual consideration, or to abstain from such a
              consideration, or further to consider this or that alternative.
              Yet, such a defect of ordering is not a moral evil, for, if reason

              [7] Yet it is not improper, provided the truth be investigated to
              its limit. Good is spoken of in just as general a way as being,
              since every being, as such, is good, as we have proved. Now, it is
              not improper for non-being to be present in being, as in a
              subject. Indeed, any instance of privation is a non-being, yet its
              subject is a substance which is a being. However, non-being is not
              present in a being contrary to it, as in a subject. For blindness
              is not universal non-being, but, rather, this particular non-being
              whereby sight is taken away. So, it is not present in the power of
              sight as its subject, but, rather, in the animal. Likewise, evil
              is not present in a good contrary to it, as in its subject;
              rather, this contrary good is taken away by the evil. For
              instance, moral evil is present in a natural good, while a natural
              evil, which is a privation of form, is present in matter which is
              a good, in the sense of a being in potency.

              the good that can be decreased by evil must be finite, for the
              infinite good does not admit of evil, as we showed in Book One
              [39]. So, it seems that eventually the good would be wholly
              destroyed by evil, for, if something be subtracted an infinite
              number of times from a finite thing, the latter must be destroyed
              eventually by the subtraction.

              [4] Now, it cannot be answered, as some people say, that if the
              subsequent subtraction be made in the same proportion as the
              preceding one, going on to infinity, it is not possible to destroy
              the good, as happens in the division of a continuum. For, if you
              subtract half of a line two cubits long, and then half of the
              remainder, and if you go on in this way to infinity, something
              will always remain to be divided. But, in this process of
              division, that which is subtracted later must always be
              quantitatively diminished. In fact, the half of the whole is
              quantitatively greater than half of the half, though the same
              proportion continues. This, however, cannot in any sense happen in
              the decreasing of good by evil, for the more the good would be
              decreased by evil the weaker would it become, and so, more open to
              diminution by subsequent evil. On the contrary, the later evil
              could be equal to, or greater than, the earlier evil; hence a
              proportionately smaller quantity of good would not always be
              subtracted by evil from the good in subsequent cases.

              [5] So, another sort of answer must be given. It is evident from
              what has been said that evil does take away completely the good
              which is its contrary, as blindness does with sight. Yet there
              must remain the good which is the subject of evil. This, in fact,
              inasmuch as it is a subject, has the essential character of
              goodness, in the sense that it is in potency to the act of
              goodness which is lacking due to the evil. So, the less it is in
              potency to this good, the less will it be a good. Now, a subject
              becomes less potential to a form, not simply by the subtraction of
              any of its parts, nor by the fact that any part of the potency is
              subtracted, but by the fact that the potency is impeded by a
              contrary act from being able to proceed to he actuality of the
              form. For example, a subject is less potential in regard to cold
              to the extent that heat is increased in it. Therefore, the good is
              diminished by evil more as a result of the addition of its
              contrary than by the subtraction of some of its goodness. This is
              also in agreement with the things that have been said about evil.
              Indeed, we said that evil occurs apart from the intention of the
              agent, and that he always intends a definite good, and that it
              consequently implies the exclusion of another good which is
              contrary to it. So, the more this intended good (which apart from
              the agent’s intention results in evil) is multiplied, the more is
              the potency to the contrary good diminished. And this is rather
              the way in which the good is said to be diminished by evil.

              of a contrary agent, to be increased to infinity, in such a way
              that the result would be an infinite diminution of good by evil.

              In moralibus autem potest ista diminutio in infinitum procedere.

              tanto difficilius redit ad proprium et debitum finem: quod patet
              in his in quibus per peccandi consuetudinem iam est habitus
              vitiorum inductus. In infinitum igitur per malum moris bonum

              [7] However, in the moral order, this diminution can proceed to
              infinity. For the intellect and the will have no limits to their
              acts. The intellect is able to go on to infinity in its act of
              understanding; this is why the mathematical species of numbers and
              figures are called infinite. Likewise, the will proceeds to
              infinity in its act of willing: a man who wills to commit a theft
              can will again to commit it, and so on to infinity. Indeed, the
              more the will tends toward unworthy ends, the greater is its
              difficulty in returning to a proper and worthy end. This is
              evident in he case of people in whom vicious habits have developed
              already, as a result of their growing accustomed to sinning.
              Therefore, the good of natural aptitude can be infinitely
              decreased by moral evil. Yet, it will never be wholly destroyed;
              rather, it will always accompany the nature that endures.

              Therefore, all things, whether made by Him. immediately, or by
              means of secondary causes, are ordered to God as to their end.
              Now, all things are of this kind, for, as we proved in Book Two
              [15], there can be nothing that does not take its being from Him.
              So, all things are ordered to God as an end.

              [9] Moreover, the end holds first place over other types of cause,
              and to it all other causes owe the fact that they are causes in
              act: for the agent acts only for the sake of the end, as was
              pointed out.” Matter is brought to formal act by the agent, and
              thus matter actually becomes the matter of this particular thing,
              as form becomes the form of this thing: through the action of the
              agent, and consequently through the end. So, too, the posterior
              end is the cause of the preceding end being intended as an end,
              for a thing is not moved toward a proximate end unless for the
              sake of a last end. Therefore, the ultimate end is the first cause
              of all. Now, to be the first cause of all must be appropriate to
              the first being, that is, to God, as was shown above. So, God is
              the ultimate end of all things.

              [2] The ultimate end of all is such that He is, nonetheless, prior

              which, though it holds first place causally in the order of
              intention, is posterior in existing. This is the situation with an
              end which the agent sets up by his own action, as a physician sets
              up health in a sick man by his own action; this is, of course, the
              physician’s end. And then there is an end which takes precedence
              in existing being, just as it precedes in the causal order. For
              instance, we call that an end which one intends to obtain by his
              action or motion, as fire inclines upward by its motion, and a
              king intends to establish a city by fighting. Therefore, God is
              not the end of things in the sense of being something set up as an
              ideal, but as a pre-existing being Who is to be attained.

              attained by His action, but in such a way that something is
              enriched by His action. For He is not in potency to the
              possibility of obtaining something; rather, He is in perfect act
              simply, and as a result He is a source of enrichment. So, things
              are not ordered to God as to an end for which something may be
              obtained, but rather so that they may attain Himself from Himself,
              according to their measure, since He is their end.

              Therefore, things tend toward this objective, of becoming like
              God, inasmuch as He is good.

              [2] Creatures do not attain goodness in the same measure that it
              is in God, though each thing imitates divine goodness according to
              its measure. For, divine goodness is simple, entirely gathered
              together, as it were, into one being. Indeed, this divine existing
              being includes the entire fullness of perfection, as we proved in
              Book One [28]. As a result, since anything is perfect to the
              extent that it is good, this divine being is His perfect goodness.
              In fact, for God it is the same thing to be, to live, to be wise,
              to be blessed, and to be whatever else seems to belong to
              perfection and goodness; the whole divine goodness is, as it were,
              His divine existing being. Again, this divine being is the
              substance of the existing God. Now, this cannot obtain in the case
              of other things. We have pointed out in Book Two [15] that no
              created substance is its own act of being. Hence, if anything is
              good by virtue of the fact that it exists, none of them is its own
              act of being; none of them is its own goodness. Rather, each of
              them is good by participation in goodness, just as it is being by
              participation in existing being itself.

              [3] Again, not all creatures are established on one level of
              goodness. For some of them, substance is their form and their act:
              this is so for the creature to whom, because of what it is
              essentially, it is appropriate to be, and to be good. For others,
              indeed, substance is composed of matter and form: to such a being
              it is appropriate to be, and to be good—but by virtue of some part
              of it, that is to say, by virtue of its form. Therefore, divine
              substance is its own goodness, but a simple substance participates
              goodness by virtue of what it is essentially, while composite
              substance does so by virtue of something that belongs to it as a
              part.

              [4] In this third grade of substance, in turn, there is found a
              diversity in regard to being itself. For some of them that are
              composed of matter and form, the form fulfills the entire
              potentiality of the matter, so that there remains in their matter
              no potentiality for another form. And consequently, there is no
              potentiality in other matter for the form of this type of
              substance. Beings of this type are celestial bodies, which actuate
              their entire matter when they exist. For other substances, the
              form does not exhaust the entire potentiality of their matter;
              consequently, there still remains a potentiality for another form,
              and in some other portion of matter there remains a potentiality
              for this sort of form, as is the case in the elements and in
              things composed of the elements. In fact, since privation is the
              negation in a substance of something which can be present in that
              substance, it is clear that the privation of a form is found
              combined with the type of form that does not exhaust the entire
              potentiality of matter. Indeed, privation cannot be associated
              with a substance whose form exhausts the entire potentiality of
              its matter; nor with one which is a form in its essence; still
              less with one whose essence is its very act of being. Now, since
              it is obvious that change cannot take place where there is no
              potentiality to something else, for motion is the “act of that
              which exists potentially,” and since it is also clear that evil is
              the very privation of the good, it is plain that, in this lowest
              order of substances, the good is mutable and mixed with its
              contrary evil. This cannot occur in the higher orders of
              substances. Therefore, this substance which we have said is on the
              lowest level holds the lowest rank in goodness, just as it has the
              lowest grade in being.

              [5] Still, among the parts of this sort of substance composed of
              matter and form, an order of goodness is found. In fact, since
              matter, considered in itself, is potential being and form is its
              act, and since composite substance is actually existent through
              form, the form will be good in itself; while the composite
              substance is so in so far as it actually possesses form; and the
              matter is good inasmuch as it is in potentiality to form. Besides,
              though anything is good in so far as it is a being, it is not,
              however, necessary for matter which is merely potential being to
              be good only in potency. For being is a term used absolutely,
              while good also includes a relation. In fact, a thing is not
              called good simply because it is an end, or because it has
              achieved the end; provided it be ordered to the end, it may be
              called good because of this relation. So, matter cannot be called
              a being without qualification, because it is potential being, in
              which a relation to existing being is implied, but it can be
              called good, without qualification, precisely because of this
              relation. It is apparent in this conclusion that good is, in a
              way, of wider scope than being. For this reason, Dionysius says,
              in the fourth chapter of On the Divine Names: “the good extends to
              existent beings and also to non-existent ones.” For, this
              non-existent thing—namely matter understood as subject to
              privation—desires a good, that is, to be. It is, consequently,
              evident that it is also good, for nothing except a good thing
              desires the good.

              [6] There is still another way in which the goodness of a creature
              is defective in comparison with divine goodness. For, as we said,
              God in His very act of being holds the highest perfection of
              goodness. On the other hand, a created thing does not possess its
              perfection in unity, but in many items, for what is unified in the
              highest instance is found to be manifold in the lowest things.
              Consequently, God is said to be virtuous, wise, and operative with
              reference to the same thing, but creatures are so described with
              reference to a diversity of things. And so, the more multiplicity
              the perfect goodness of any creature requires, the more removed is
              it from the first goodness. If it cannot attain perfect goodness,
              it will keep imperfect goodness in a few items. Hence it is that,
              though the first and highest good is altogether simple, and the
              substances that are nearer to it in goodness are likewise close to
              it in regard to simplicity, we find some among the lowest
              substances to be simpler than some of their superiors, as is the
              case with elements in relation to animals and men; yet these lower
              simple beings cannot achieve the perfection of knowledge and
              understanding which animals and men do attain.

              [7] So, it is evident from what has been said that, though God has
              His own perfect and complete goodness, in accord with His simple
              existing being, creatures do not attain the perfection of their
              goodness through their being alone, but through many things.
              Hence, although any one of them is good in so far as it exists, it
              cannot be called good, without qualification, if it lack any other
              things required for its goodness. Thus, a man who is destitute of
              virtue and host to vices is indeed called good, relatively
              speaking; that is, to the extent that be is a being, and a man.
              However, in the absolute sense, he is not good, but evil. So, it
              is not the same thing for any creature to be and to be good
              without qualification, although each of them is good in so far as
              it exists. In God, however, to be and to be good are simply the
              same thing.

              tends toward the divine likeness according to each good to which
              it inclines, since any created thing is good through participation
              in divine goodness. And so, things tend toward the divine likeness

              [5] Moreover, it is for the same reason that the effect tends to
              the likeness of the agent, and that the agent makes the effect
              like to itself, for the effect tends toward the end to which it is
              directed by the agent. The agent tends to make the patient like
              the agent, not only in regard to its act of being, but also in
              regard to causality. For instance, just as the principles by which
              a natural agent subsists are conferred by the agent, so are the
              principles by which the effect is the cause of others. Thus, an
              animal receives from the generating agent, at the time of its
              generation, the nutritive power and also the generative power. So,
              the effect does tend to be like the agent, not only in its
              species, but also in this characteristic of being the cause of
              others. Now, things tend to the likeness of God in the same way
              that effects tend to the likeness of the agent, as we have shown.
              Therefore, things naturally tend to become like God by the fact
              that they are the causes of others.

              [8] Again, a thing must first be perfect in itself before it can
              cause another thing, as we have said already. So, this final
              perfection comes to a thing in order that it may exist as the
              cause of others. Therefore, since a created thing tends to the
              divine likeness in many ways, this one whereby it seeks the divine
              likeness by being the cause of others takes the ultimate place.
              Hence Dionysius says, in the third chapter of On the Celestial
              Hierarchy, that “of all things, it is more divine to become a
              co-worker with God”; in accord with the statement of the Apostle:

              operation of a thing that is moved by another, as in the case of
              being heated or being sawed. Still another operation is the
              perfection of an actually existing agent which does not tend to
              produce a change in another thing. And these last differ, first of
              all, from passion and motion, and secondly from action

              operations in this third sense are understanding, sensing, and

              [4] On the other hand, celestial bodies move because they are

              likeness in both ways. In regard to the way which involves its own
              perfection, the celestial body comes to be in a certain place
              actually, to which place it was previously in potency. Nor does it

              is the end of the process of generation, but the likeness of
              divine being in the perpetuation of the species and in the
              diffusion of its goodness, through the act of handing on its
              specific form to others, and of being the cause of others.
              Similarly, then, celestial bodies, although they are of greater
              value than lower bodies, tend toward the generation of these
              latter, and through their motions to the actual eduction of the
              forms of the products of generation, not as an ultimate end but as
              thereby intending the divine likeness as an ultimate end, inasmuch
              as they exist as the causes of other things.

              [6] Now, we should keep in mind that a thing participates in the
              likeness of the divine will, through which things are brought into
              being and preserved, to the extent that it participates in the
              likeness of divine goodness which is the object of His will.
              Higher things participate more simply and more universally in the
              likeness of divine goodness, while lower things do so more
              particularly and more in detail. Hence, between celestial and
              lower bodies the likeness is not observed according to complete
              equivalence, as it is in the case of things of one kind. Rather,
              it is like the similarity of a universal agent to a particular
              effect. Therefore, just as in the order of lower bodies the
              intention of a particular agent is focused on the good of this
              species or that, so is the intention of a celestial body directed
              to the common good of corporeal substance which is preserved, and
              multiplied, and increased through generation.

              [7] As we said, since any moved thing, inasmuch as it is moved,
              tends to the divine likeness so that it may be perfected in
              itself, and since a thing is perfect in so far as it is
              actualized, the intention of everything existing in potency must
              be to tend through motion toward actuality. And so, the more
              posterior and more perfect an act is, the more fundamentally is
              the inclination of matter directed toward it. Hence. in regard to
              the last and most perfect act that matter can attain, the
              inclination of matter whereby it desires form must be inclined as
              toward the ultimate end of generation. Now, among the acts
              pertaining to forms, certain gradations are found. Thus, prime
              matter is in potency, first of all, to the form of an element.
              When it is existing under the form of an element it is in potency
              to the form of a mixed body; that is why the elements are matter
              for the mixed body. Considered under the form of a mixed body, it
              is in potency to a vegetative soul, for this sort of soul is the
              act of a body. In turn, the vegetative soul is in potency to a
              sensitive soul, and a sensitive one to an intellectual one. This
              the process of generation shows: at the start of generation there
              is the embryo living with plant life, later with animal life, and
              finally with human life. After this last type of form, no later
              and more noble form is found in the order of generable and
              corruptible things. Therefore, the ultimate end of the whole
              process of generation is the human soul, and matter tends toward
              it as toward an ultimate form. So, elements exist for the sake of
              mixed bodies; these latter exist for the sake of living bodies,
              among which plants exist for animals, and animals for men.
              Therefore, man is the end of the whole order of generation.

              [8] And since a thing is generated and preserved in being by the
              same reality, there is also an order in the preservation of
              things, which parallels the foregoing order of generation. Thus we
              see that mixed bodies are sustained by the appropriate qualities
              of the elements; Plants, in turn, are nourished by mixed bodies;
              animals get their nourishment from plants: so, those that are more
              perfect and more powerful from those that are more imperfect and
              weaker. In fact, man uses all kinds of things for his own
              advantage: some for food, others for clothing. That is why he was
              created nude by nature, since he is able to make clothes for,
              himself from other things; just as nature also provided him with
              no appropriate nourishment, except milk, because he can obtain
              food for himself from a variety of things. Other things he uses
              for transportation, since we find man the inferior of many animals
              in quickness of movement, and in the strength to do work; other
              animals being provided, as it were, for his assistance. And, in
              addition to this, man uses all sense objects for the perfection of
              intellectual knowledge. Hence it is said of man in the Psalms
              (8:8) in a statement directed to God: “You have subjected all
              things under his feet,” And Aristotle says, in the
              <i>Politics</i> I [5: 1254b 9], that man has natural dominion over
              all animals.

              [3] Again, everything that is moved must be moved by another
              being, as we proved earlier. Therefore, a celestial body is moved
              by something else. So, this other thing is either completely
              separated from it, or is united with it in the sense that the
              composite of the celestial body and the mover may be said to move
              itself, in so far as one of its parts is the mover and another
              part is the thing moved. Now, if it works this way, since
              everything that moves itself is alive and animated, it would
              follow that the heavens are animated, and by no other soul than an
              intellectual one: not by a nutritive soul, for generation and
              corruption are not within its power; nor by a sensitive soul, for
              a celestial body has no diversity of organs. The conclusion is,
              then, that it is moved by an intellective soul.—On the other hand,
              if it is moved by an extrinsic mover, this latter will be either
              corporeal or incorporeal. Now, if it is corporeal, it will not
              move unless it is moved, for no body moves unless it is moved, as
              was evident previously. Therefore, it will also have to be moved
              by another. And since there should be no process to infinity in
              the order of bodies, we will have to come to an incorporeal first
              mover. Now, that which is utterly separate from body must be
              intellectual, as is evident from earlier considerations.
              Therefore, the motion of the heavens, that is of the first body,
              comes from an intellectual substance.

              [4] Besides, heavy and light bodies are moved by their generating
              agent, and by that which takes away any impediment to motion, as
              was proved in
              <i>Physics</i> VIII [4: 256a 1]. For it cannot be that the form in
              them is the mover, and the matter the thing moved, since nothing
              is moved unless it be a body. Now, just as the elemental bodies
              are simple and there is no composition in them, except of matter
              and form, so also are the celestial bodies simple. And so, if they
              are moved in the same way as heavy and light bodies, they must be

              agent which removes an impediment to motion. But this is
              impossible, for these bodies are not capable of generation: for
              they are not endowed with contrariety, and their motions cannot,
              be impeded. So, these bodies must be moved by movers that function
              through knowing; not through sensitive knowledge, as we showed,
              but through intellectual knowledge.

              [5] Moreover, if the principle of celestial motion is simply a
              nature lacking any type of apprehension, then the principle of
              celestial motion must be the form of a celestial body, just as is
              the case in the elements. For, although simple forms are not
              movers, they are nonetheless the principles of motions, since
              natural motions are resultant from them, as are all other natural
              properties. Now, it is impossible for celestial motion to result
              from the form of a celestial body, as from an active principle. A
              form is the principle of local motion in the same way that a
              certain place is proper to a body by virtue of its form; it is
              moved to this place by the force of its form tending to it, and,
              since the generating agent gives the form, it is said to be the
              mover. For instance, it is appropriate to fire, by virtue of its
              form, to be in a higher place. But one place is no more
              appropriate than another for a celestial body, according to its
              form. Therefore, the principle of celestial motion is not simply
              the nature of the body. So, the principle of its motion must be
              something that moves as a result of apprehension.

              [6] Furthermore, nature always tends toward one objective; hence,
              things which result from nature always occur in the same way,
              unless they are interfered with, and this happens to few of them.
              Indeed, that which has a deformity within its very definition
              cannot be an end to which a nature tends. Now, motion, by
              definition, is of this type, for whatever is moved, by virtue of
              that fact, is in a different condition before and after.” So, it
              is impossible for a nature to tend toward motion for the sake of
              motion. Therefore, it tends through motion toward rest, and the
              latter is related to motion as one to many. Indeed, a thing at
              rest is one which is in the same condition before and after. If
              then, the motion of the heavens were simply from a nature, it
              would be ordered to some condition of rest. But the contrary of
              this is apparent, for celestial motion is continuous. Therefore,
              the motion of the heavens does not arise from a nature, as its
              active principle, but rather from an intelligent substance.

              [7] Again, for every motion that is from a nature, as an active
              principle, if its approach to something be natural, then its
              removal from that objective must be unnatural and against nature.
              Thus, a heavy thing naturally moves downward, but for it to move
              in the opposite direction is against nature. Therefore, if the
              motion of the heavens were natural, since it tends westward
              naturally, it would return to the east in the manner of a thing
              that recedes from the west by a motion against nature. Now, this
              is impossible. In celestial motion there is nothing violent and
              against nature. So, it is impossible for the active principle of
              celestial motion to be a nature. Therefore, its active principle
              is some apprehensive power, and through understanding, as is clear
              from what was said earlier. So, a celestial body is moved by an
              intellectual substance.

              [8] Yet we must not deny that celestial motion is natural. In
              fact, a motion is called natural, not simply because of its active
              principle, but also because of its passive one. This is
              exemplified in the generation of simple bodies. Indeed, this
              generation cannot be called natural by reason of the active
              principle, for that is moved naturally by an active principle,
              which has its active principle within it; “a nature is a principle
              of motion in that to which it belongs.” But the active principle
              in the generation of a simple body is outside. So, it is not
              natural by reason of the active principle, but only by reason of
              the passive principle, which is the matter in which the natural
              appetite for a natural form is present. And so, the motion of a
              celestial body, as far as its active principle is concerned, is
              not natural, but voluntary and intellectual; however, in relation
              to its passive principle, the motion is natural, for a celestial
              body has a natural aptitude for such motion.

            <td>
              [9] This becomes clearly evident when we consider the relation of
              a celestial body to its location. A thing is acted on passively,
              and is moved, in so far as it is in potency; while it acts and
              moves, in so far as it is in act. Now, a celestial body,
              considered in its substance, is found to be indifferently related
              to every place, just as prime matter is to every form, as we said
              before. Of course, it is a different situation in the case of a
              heavy or light body which, considered in its nature, is not
              indifferent to every place, but is determined by virtue of its
              form to a place of its own. So, the nature of a heavy or light
              body is the active principle of its motion, while the nature of a
              celestial body is the passive principle of its motion. Hence, no
              one should get the impression that the latter is moved violently,
              as is the case with heavy and light bodies that are moved by us
              through understanding. For there is present in heavy and light
              bodies a natural aptitude for motion contrary to that in which
              they are moved by us, and so they are moved by us through
              violence. However, the motion of an animated body, in which it is
              moved by a soul, is not violent for it as an animal, though it is
              violent for it as a heavy object. Celestial bodies have no
              aptitude for contrary motion, but only for that whereby they are
              moved by an intelligent substance. Consequently, it is at once
              voluntary, in relation to the active principle, and natural, in
              relation to the passive principle.

              [11] It is also evident from the foregoing that in celestial
              motion neither the approach to a certain place, nor the regression
              from that place, is against nature. Such a thing does occur in the
              motion of heavy and light bodies for two reasons. First, because
              the natural tendency in heavy and light things is determined to
              one place; hence, just as such a body naturally tends to this
              place, so does it go against nature in receding from it. Second,
              because two motions, one approaching a term and the other receding
              from it, are contrary. But, if we take into consideration in this
              motion of heavy and light bodies, not the final place but an
              intermediate one, then just as an approach may naturally be made
              to it, so also may a recession be naturally made from it. For the
              whole motion comes under one natural tendency, and these motions
              are not contrary but one and continuous.—So, too, is the situation
              in the motion of celestial bodies, for the tendency of their
              nature is not toward some determinate place, as has been said
              already. Also, the motion whereby a body moves in a circle, away
              from a point of reference, is not contrary to the motion whereby
              it approaches the point, but it is one continuous motion. Hence,
              each place in the motion of the heavens is like a middle point,
              and not like a terminal point in straight-line motion.

              [1] Now, if a celestial body is moved by intellectual substance,
              as we have shown, and if the motion of a celestial body is ordered
              to generation in the realm of things here below, it must be that
              the processes of generation and the motions of these lower things
              start from the intention of an intelligent substance. For the
              intention of the principal agent and that of the instrument are
              directed toward the same thing. Now, the heavens is the cause of
              the movements of inferior bodies, by virtue of its own motion in
              which it is moved by an intellectual substance. It follows, then,
              that the heavenly body is like an instrument for intellectual
              substance. Therefore, the forms and movements of lower bodies are
              caused by intellectual substance which intends them as a principal
              agent, while the celestial body is like an instrument.

              [2] It must be, then, that the species of things caused and
              intended by the intellectual agent exist beforehand in his
              intellect, as the forms of artifacts pre-exist in the intellect of
              the artist and are projected from there into their products. So,
              all the forms that are in these lower substances, and all their
              motions, are derived from the intellectual forms which are in the
              intellect of some substance, or substances. Consequently, Boethius
              says in his book, <i>The Trinity</i>, that “forms which are in
              matter have come from forms which are without matter.” And on this
              point, Plato’s statement is verified, that forms separated from
              matter are the principles of forms that are in it. Although Plato
              claimed that they subsist in themselves and immediately cause the
              forms of sensible things, we assert that they exist in an
              intellect and cause lower forms through the motion of the heavens.

              natural ends, from natural movers; from which movers they also
              receive their forms, powers, and motions.

              things or the other. For, by the fact that they tend to their own
              perfection they tend to the good, since a thing is good to the
              extent that it is perfect. Moreover, by virtue of tending to be
              good it tends to the divine likeness, for a thing is made like

              thing becomes an object of desire according as it is a likeness of
              prime goodness. So, too, for this reason it tends to its own good,
              because it tends to the divine likeness, and not conversely.
              Hence, it is clear that all things desire the divine likeness as

              [7] Now, the good that is proper to a thing may be received in
              many ways. One way depends on what is appropriate to the essential
              character of the individual. It is thus that an animal seeks his
              good, when he desires the food whereby he may be kept in
              existence. A second way depends on what is appropriate to the
              species. It is in this way that an animal desires his proper good,
              inasmuch as he desires the procreation of offspring and the
              nourishment of the same, or the performance of any other work that
              is for the preservation or protection of individuals belonging to
              his species. A third way depends on the essential character of his
              genus. It is in this way that an equivocal agent seeks its proper
              good by an act of causation, as in the case of the heavens. And a
              fourth way depends on the analogical likeness of things produced,
              in relation to their source. And it is in this way that God, Who
              is beyond genus, gives existing being to all, because of His own
              goodness.

              [8] It is evident, next, that the more perfect something is in its
              power, and the higher it is in the scale of goodness, the more
              does it have an appetite for a broader common good, and the more
              does it seek and become involved in the doing of good for beings
              far removed from itself. Indeed, imperfect beings tend only to the
              good proper to the individual, while perfect beings tend to the
              good of their species. But more perfect beings tend to the good of
              the genus, while God, Who is most perfect in goodness, tends
              toward the good of being as a whole. Hence it is said by some
              people, and not inappropriately, that “the good, as such, is
              diffusive,” because the better a thing is, the more does it
              diffuse its goodness to remote beings. And since, “in every genus,
              that which is most perfect is the archetype and measure of all
              things belonging in the genus,” God, Who is most perfect in
              goodness and Who diffuses His goodness in the broadest way, must
              be in His diffusion the archetype for all diffusers of goodness.
              Now, inasmuch as a thing diffuses goodness to other beings, it
              comes to be their cause. As a result, it is also clear that a
              thing which tends to become the cause of others tends toward the
              divine likeness, and nonetheless it tends toward its own good.

              [3] Again, the proper operation of a thing is an end for it, for
              this is its secondary perfection. That is why whatever is
              fittingly related to its proper operation is said to be virtuous
              and good. But the act of understanding is the proper operation of
              an intellectual substance. Therefore, this act is its end. Ana
              that which is most perfect in this operation is the ultimate end,
              particularly in the case of operations that are not ordered to any
              products, such as the acts of understanding and sensing. Now,
              since operations of this type are specified by their objects,
              through which they are known also, any one of these operations
              must be more perfect when its object is more perfect. And so, to
              understand the most perfect intelligible object, which is God, is
              the most perfect thing in the genus of this operation of
              understanding. Therefore, to know God by an act of understanding
              is the ultimate end of every intellectual substance.

              [4] Of course, someone could say that the ultimate end of an
              intellectual substance consists, in fact, in understanding the
              best intelligible object—not that the best object of understanding
              for this or that particular intellectual substance is absolutely
              the best intelligible object, but that, the higher an intellectual
              substance is, the higher will its best object of understanding be.
              And so, perhaps the highest created intellectual substance may
              have what is absolutely best as its best intelligible object, and,
              consequently, its felicity will consist in understanding God, but
              the felicity of any lower intellectual substance will lie in the
              understanding of some lower intelligible object, which is,
              however, the highest thing understood by it. Particularly would it
              seem true of the human intellect that its function is not to
              understand absolutely the best intelligible object, because of its
              weakness; indeed, it stands in relation to the knowing of the
              greatest intelligible object, “as the owl’s eye is to the

              [5] But it seems obvious that the end of any intellectual
              substance, even the lowest, is to understand God. It has been
              shown above that the ultimate end of all things, to which they
              tend, is God. Though it is the lowest in the order of intellectual
              substances, the human intellect is, nevertheless, superior to all
              things that lack understanding. And so, since there should not be
              a less noble end for a more noble substance, the end for the human
              intellect will be God Himself. And an intelligent being attains
              his ultimate end by understanding Him, as was indicated.
              Therefore, the human intellect reaches God as its end, through an
              act of understanding.

              [6] Again, just as things devoid of understanding tend toward God
              as an end, by way of assimilation, so intellectual substances do
              so by way of cognition, as is evident from the foregoing. Now,
              although things devoid of understanding tend to the likeness of
              their proximate agents, their natural tendency does not, however,
              rest there, for this tendency has as its end assimilation to the

              like God by the fact that it is intellectual, for it has this sort
              of likeness over and above what other creatures have, and this
              likeness includes all others. In the genus of this sort of
              likeness a being becomes more like God by actually understanding
              than by habitually or potentially understanding, because God is
              always actually understanding, as we proved in Book One [56]. And,

              [9] Furthermore, that which is capable of being loved only for the
              sake of some other object exists for the sake of that other thing
              which is lovable simply on its own account. In fact, there is no
              point in going on without end in the working of natural appetite,
              since natural desire would then be futile, because it is
              impossible to get to the end of an endless series. Now, all
              practical sciences, arts, and powers are objects of love only
              because they are means to something else, for their purpose is not
              knowledge but operation. But the speculative sciences are lovable
              for their own sake, since their end is knowledge itself. Nor do we
              find any action in human affairs, except speculative thought, that
              is not directed to some other end. Even sports activities, which
              appear to be carried on without any purpose, have a proper end,
              namely, so that after our minds have been somewhat relaxed through
              them we may be then better able to do serious jobs. Otherwise, if
              sport were an end in itself, the proper thing to do would be to
              play all the time, but that is not appropriate. So, the practical
              arts are ordered to the speculative ones, and likewise every human
              operation to intellectual speculation, as an end. Now, among all
              the sciences and arts which are thus subordinated, the ultimate
              end seems to belong to the one that is preceptive and
              architectonic in relation to the others. For instance, the art of
              navigation, to which the end, that is the use, of a ship pertains,
              is architectonic and preceptive in relation to the art of
              shipbuilding. In fact, this is the way that first philosophy is
              related to the other speculative sciences, for all the others
              depend on it, in the sense that they take their principles from
              it, and also the position to be assumed against those who deny the
              principles. And this first philosophy is wholly ordered to the
              knowing of God, as its ultimate end; that is why it is also called
              divine science. So, divine knowledge is the ultimate end of every
              act of human knowledge and every operation.

              sensory appetites, irascible and concupiscible, and that is why we
              do not obey concupiscence unless there be a command from the will;
              and finally, the sense appetite, with the advent of consent from
              the will, now moves the body. Therefore, the end of the intellect

              [12] Moreover, for each effect that he knows, man naturally
              desires to know the cause. Now, the human intellect knows
              universal being. So, he naturally desires to know its cause, which
              is God alone, as we proved in Book Two [15]. Now, a person has not
              attained his ultimate end until natural desire comes to rest.
              Therefore, for human happiness which is the ultimate end it is not
              enough to have merely any kind of intelligible knowledge; there
              must be divine knowledge, as an ultimate end, to terminate the
              natural desire. So, the ultimate end of man is the knowledge of
              God.

              [13] Furthermore, a body tending toward its proper place by
              natural appetite is moved more forcibly and swiftly as it
              approaches its end. Thus, Aristotle proves, in
              <i>On the Heavens</i>
              I [8: 27a 18], that natural motion in a straight line cannot go on
              to infinity, for then it would be no more moved later than
              earlier. So, a thing that tends more forcibly later than earlier,
              toward an objective, is not moved toward an indefinite objective,
              but tends toward some determinate thing. Now, we find this
              situation in the desire to know. The more a person knows, the more
              is be moved by the desire to know. Hence, man’s natural desire
              tends, in the process of knowing, toward some definite end. Now,
              this can be none other than the most noble object of knowledge,
              which is God. Therefore, divine knowledge is the ultimate end of
              man.

              happiness must pertain to an intellectual nature by reason of what
              is proper to that nature. Now, appetite is not peculiar to
              intellectual nature; instead, it is present in all things, though
              it is in different things in different ways. And this diversity
              arises from the fact that things are differently related to
              knowledge. ~For things lacking knowledge entirely have natural
              appetite only. And things endowed with sensory knowledge have, in
              addition, sense appetite, under which irascible and concupiscible
              powers are included. But things possessed of intellectual
              knowledge also have an appetite proportionate to this knowledge,
              that is, will. So, the will is not peculiar to intellectual nature
              by virtue of being an appetite, but only in so far as it depends
              on intellect. However, the intellect, in itself, is peculiar to an
              intellectual nature. Therefore, happiness, or felicity, consists
              substantially and principally in an act of the intellect rather
              than in an act of the will.

              [10] Besides, for all the powers capable of reflection on their
              own acts, the act of such a power must first be brought to bear on
              some other object, and then directed to its own act. If the
              intellect is to understand itself in the act of understanding, it
              must first be taken that it understands something, and then, as a
              result, that it understands that it is understanding. For, this
              act of understanding which the intellect understands pertains to
              some object. Hence, it is necessary either to proceed through an
              endless series, or, if we are to come to a first object of
              understanding, it will not be the act of understanding but rather
              some intelligible thing. Likewise, the first willed object must
              not be the will’s act but some other good thing. But, for an

              itself, or felicity, since it is for the sake of this happiness
              that we will whatever we will. Therefore, it is impossible for
              felicity to consist essentially in an act of the will.

              sive falso; utrum autem vere sit summum bonum quod ut tale

              [11] Moreover, each thing possesses its true nature by virtue of
              the components which make up its substance. Thus, a real man
              differs from a painting of a man by virtue of the things that
              constitute the substance of man. Now, in their relation to the
              will act, true happiness does not differ from false happiness. In
              fact, the will, when it desires, loves or enjoys, is related in
              just the same way to its object, whatever it may be that is
              presented to it as a highest good, whether truly or falsely. Of
              course, whether the object so presented is truly the highest good,
              or is false, this distinction is made on the part of the
              intellect. Therefore, happiness, or felicity, essentially consists
              in understanding rather than in an act of the will.

              [12] Furthermore, if any act of the will were this felicity, this
              act would be either one of desire, of love, or of delight. Now, it
              is impossible for the act of desiring to be the ultimate end. For
              it is by desire that the will tends toward what it does not yet
              possess, but this is contrary to the essential character of the
              ultimate end.—So, two, the act of loving cannot be the ultimate
              end. For a good is loved not only when possessed but also when not
              possessed. Indeed, it is as a result of love that what is not
              possessed is sought with desire, and if the love of something
              already possessed is more perfect, this results from the fact that
              the good which was loved is possessed. So, it is a different thing
              to possess a good which is the end, and to love it; for love,
              before possession, is imperfect, but after possession, perfect.
              —Similarly, delight is not the ultimate end. For the very
              possession of the good is the cause of delight: we either
              experience it while the good is presently possessed, or we
              remember it when it was formerly possessed, or we hope for it when
              it is to be possessed in the future. So, delight is not the
              ultimate end. Therefore, none of the acts of will can be this
              felicity substantially.

              good and desirable, but that which accompanies evil deeds is evil
              and repulsive. So, it owes the fact that it is good and desirable
              to something else. Therefore, delight is not the ultimate end, in

              sake of operation, and not conversely. In fact, we see that nature

              [15] Moreover, pleasure seems to be simply the repose of the will
              in some appropriate good, as desire is the inclination of the will
              toward the attainment of some good. Now, just as a man is inclined
              through his will to the end and reposes in it, so do physical
              bodies in nature possess natural inclinations to proper ends, and
              these inclinations come to rest when the end has already been
              reached. However, it is ridiculous to say that the end of a heavy
              body’s motion is not to be in its proper place, but that the end
              is the resting of the inclination whereby it tends there. If
              nature bad intended this at the beginning, that the inclination
              would come to rest, it would not have given such an inclination;
              instead, it gives it so that, by this means, the thing may tend to
              a proper place. When this has been reached, as an end, the repose
              of the inclination follows. And so, such repose is not the end,
              but rather a concomitant of the end. Nor, indeed, is pleasure the
              ultimate end; it is its concomitant. And so, by an even greater
              reason, no other act of the will is felicity.

              [18] Nor, indeed, is it necessary that everything whereby a thing
              is in any way perfected be the end of that thing, as the second
              argument claimed. In fact, something may be the perfection of a
              thing in two ways: in one way, of a thing that already possesses
              its species; and in a second way, in order that the thing may
              acquire its species. For instance, the perfection of a house which
              already has its species is that to which the species of the house
              is ordered, namely, habitation. For a house is made for this
              purpose only, and so this must be included in the definition of a
              house if the definition is to be perfect. But the perfection for
              the sake of the species of the house is both that which is
              directed to the setting up of the species, such as its substantial
              principles, and also that which is ordered to the preservation of
              its species, such as the foundations made to hold up the house,
              and even those things that make the use of the house more
              agreeable, such as the beauty of the house. And then, that which
              is the perfection of the thing, in so far as it already possesses
              its species, is its end: as habitation is the end of the house.
              Likewise, the proper operation of anything, which is its use as it
              were, is its end. Now, the things that are perfections leading up
              to the species are not the end for the thing; on the contrary, the
              thing is their end, matter and form are for the sake of the
              species. Though form is the end of the generative act, it is not
              the end of the thing that is already generated and possessed of
              its species. Rather, the form is required so that the species may
              be complete. Similarly, factors which preserve a thing in its
              species, such as health and the nutritive power, though
              perfectants of the animal, are not the end of the animal; rather,
              the opposite is true. Also, items by which a thing is improved for
              the perfection of its proper operations, and for the more
              appropriate attainment of its proper end, are not the end for the
              thing; rather, the opposite is so. For instance, beauty is for the
              man, and strength is for the body, and so for other similar things
              which the Philosopher talks about in
              <i>Ethics</i>
              I [8-9: 1099b 2–1099b 28], saying that “they contribute to
              felicity instrumentally.”

              [19] Nor is the fact that men desire pleasure for its own sake,
              and not for the sake of something else, enough to indicate that
              pleasure is the ultimate end, as the third argument concluded.
              For, although pleasure is not the ultimate end, it is, of course,
              a concomitant of this end, since pleasure arises out of the
              attainment of the end.

              [21] Now, what the fifth argument suggests, that the will is
              higher than the intellect, in the sense of moving it, is clearly
              false. For, primarily Ad directly, the intellect moves the will;
              indeed, the will, as such, is moved by its object which is the
              known good. But the will moves the intellect rather accidentally,
              that is, in so far as the act of understanding is itself
              apprehended as good, and so is desired by the will, with the
              result that the intellect actually understands. Even in this act,
              the intellect precedes the will, for the will would never desire
              the act of understanding unless, first of all, the intellect were
              to apprehend the act of understanding as a good.—And again, the
              will moves the intellect actually to perform its operation, in the
              way that an agent is said to move; while the intellect moves the
              will in the way that an end moves something, since the good that
              is understood is the end for the will. Now, the agent comes later,
              in the process of moving, than does the end, since the agent does
              not move except for the sake of the end. Hence, it is evident that
              the intellect is, without qualification, higher than the will. On
              the other hand, the will is higher than the intellect,
              accidentally and in a qualified sense.

              years of carnal pleasures of the belly. Hence, they were also
              called Chiliasts; that is, Millenarians.

              instances of these actions. The operations of fortitude, which are
              concerned with warlike activities, are ordered to victory and to
              peace. Indeed, it would be foolish to make war merely for its own
              sake. Likewise, the operations of justice are ordered to the
              preservation of peace among men, by means of each man having his
              own possessions undisturbed. And the same thing is evident for all
              the other virtues. Therefore, man’s ultimate felicity does not lie
              in moral operations.

              produced by reason in things other than itself, it could not be
              that which is best for man; namely, felicity. Rather would

              contemplation a soundness of body, to which all the products of
              art that are necessary for life are directed. Also required are
              freedom from the disturbances of the passions—this is achieved
              through the moral virtues and prudence—and freedom from external
              disorders, to which the whole program of government in civil life
              is directed. And so, if they are rightly considered, all human
              functions may be seen to subserve the contemplation of truth.

              [8] However, it is not possible for man’s ultimate felicity to
              consist in the contemplation which depends on the understanding of
              principles, for that is very imperfect, being most universal,
              including the potential cognition of things. Also, it is the
              beginning, not the end, of human enquiry, coming to us from nature
              and not because of our search for truth. Nor, indeed, does it lie

              felicity should lie in the working of the intellect in relation to
              the noblest objects of understanding. So, the conclusion remains

              [1] It remains to investigate the kind of knowledge in which the
              ultimate felicity of an intellectual substance consists. For there
              is a common and confused knowledge of God which is found in
              practically all men; this is due either to the fact that it is
              self-evident that God exists, just as other principles of
              demonstration are—a view held by some people, as we said in Book
              One [25]—or, what seems indeed to be true, that man can
              immediately reach some sort of knowledge of God by natural reason.
              For, when men see that things in nature run according to a
              definite order, and that ordering does not occur without an
              orderer, they perceive in most cases that there is some orderer of
              the things that we sec. But who or what kind of being, or whether
              there is but one orderer of nature, is not yet grasped immediately
              in this general consideration, just as, when we see that a man is
              moved and performs other works, we perceive that there is present
              in him some cause of these operations which is not present in
              other things, and we call this cause the soul; yet we do not know
              at that point what the soul is, whether it is a body, or how it
              produces these operations which have been mentioned.

              [3] In fact, the operation of the man enjoying felicity must be
              without defect. But this knowledge admits of a mixture of many
              errors. Some people have believed that there is no other orderer
              of worldly things than the celestial bodies, and so they said that
              the celestial bodies are gods. Other people pushed it farther, to
              the very elements and the things generated from them, thinking
              that motion and the natural functions which these elements have
              are not present in them as the effect of some other orderer, but
              that other things are ordered by them. Still other people,
              believing that human acts are not subject to any ordering, other
              than human, have said that men who order others are gods. And so,
              this knowledge of God is not enough for felicity.

              [5] Besides, no man seems to be blameworthy because of the fact

              are tending toward it, are given praise. But the fact that a
              person lacks the aforesaid knowledge of God makes him appear very
              blameworthy. Indeed, a man’s dullness is chiefly indicated by
              this: he fails to perceive such evident signs of God, just as a
              person is judged to be dull who, while observing a man, does not
              grasp the fact that he has a soul. That is why it is said in the
              Psalms (13:1, 52:1): “The fool hath said in his heart: There is no
              God.” So, this is not the knowledge of God which suffices for
              felicity.

              [3] Then, again, to be actual is the end of what is potential, as
              is clear from the foregoing. So, felicity which is the ultimate
              end is an act to which no potency for further actuality is
              attached. But this sort of knowledge of God, acquired by way of
              demonstration, still remains in potency to something further to be
              learned about God, or to the same knowledge possessed in a higher
              way, for later men have endeavored to add something pertinent to
              divine knowledge to the things which they found in the heritage of
              their predecessors. Therefore, such knowledge is not identical
              with ultimate felicity.

              [4] Moreover, felicity excludes all unhappiness, for no man can be
              at once unhappy and happy. Now, deception and error constitute a
              great part of unhappiness; in fact, that is what all men naturally
              avoid. But manifold error can accompany the aforesaid knowledge
              that is acquired about God, and this is evident in many men who
              learned some truths about God by way of demonstration, and who,
              following their own opinions in cases where demonstration fails
              them, have fallen into many errors. In fact, if there have been
              any men who have discovered the truth about divine things in such
              a way, by means of demonstration, that no falsity attached to
              their judgment, it is clear that there have been few such. This is
              not appropriate to felicity, which is a common end. So, man’s
              ultimate felicity does not lie in this knowledge of God.

              [7] Furthermore, the end of every being which is in potency is to
              be brought into act, for it tends toward this through the motion
              by which it is moved to its end. Of course, every being in potency
              tends to become actual, in so far as that is possible. Now, there
              is one kind of being in potency whose entire potency can be
              reduced to act; hence, its end is to be completely reduced to act.
              Thus, a heavy body in some unusual position is in potency to its
              proper place. But there is another kind of thing whose entire
              potency cannot be reduced to act at the same time. This is the
              case with prime matter, and that is why, through its change, it
              seeks to be actuated successively under different forms which
              cannot be simultaneously present in it, because of their
              diversity. Now, our intellect is in potency to all intelligible
              objects, as was explained in Book Two [47]. But two intelligible
              objects can exist simultaneously in the possible intellect, by way
              of the first act which is science, though perhaps not by way of
              the second act which is consideration. It is evident from this
              that the entire potency of the possible intellect can be reduced
              to act at one time. So, this is required for its ultimate end
              which is felicity. But the aforesaid knowledge of God which can be
              acquired through demonstration does not do this, since, even when
              we possess it, We still remain ignorant of many things. Therefore,
              such knowledge of God is not sufficient for ultimate felicity.

              proposed to him by another person, and which he himself does not
              see. Hence, faith has a knowledge that is more like hearing than

              “that Christ may dwell by faith in our hearts.” Therefore, it is
              not possible for ultimate human felicity to consist in the
              knowledge of faith.

              [1] An intellectual substance has still another kind of knowledge
              of God. Indeed, it has been stated in Book Two [96ff] that a
              separate substance, in knowing its own essence, knows both what is
              above and what is below itself, in a manner proper to its
              substance. This is especially necessary if what is above it is its
              cause, since the likeness of the cause must be found in the
              effects. And so, since God is the cause of all created
              intellectual substances, as is evident from the foregoing, then
              separate intellectual substances, in knowing their own essence,
              must know God Himself by way of a vision of some kind. For a thing
              whose likeness exists in the intellect is known through the
              intellect by way of vision, just as the likeness of a thing which
              is seen corporeally is present in the sense of the viewer. So,
              whatever intellect understands a separate substance, by knowing
              what it is, sees God in a higher way than He is known by any of
              the previously treated types of knowledge.

              [2] Hence, since some men have claimed that man’s ultimate end is
              in this life, because they know separate substances, we must
              consider whether man can know separate substances in this life.
              Now, on this point there is some dispute. For, our intellect in
              our present state understands nothing without a phantasm, and the
              phantasm is related to the possible intellect, whereby we
              understand, as colors are related to vision, as is evident from
              what we have treated in Book Two. Therefore, if any of us could
              achieve the understanding of separate substances through the
              intellectual knowledge which is from phantasms, then it would be
              possible for a person in this life to understand separate
              substances themselves. Consequently, by seeing these separate
              substances one will participate in that mode of knowledge whereby
              the separate substance, while understanding itself, understands
              God. But, if one cannot in any way attain to the understanding of
              separate substances through the knowledge which depends on
              phantasms, then it will not be possible for man in the present
              state of life to achieve the aforesaid mode of divine knowledge.

              [3] Now, various people have claimed in different ways that we
              could reach an understanding of separate substances from the
              knowledge which is accomplished through phantasms. For instance,
              Avempace claimed that, through the study of the speculative
              sciences, we can, on the basis of things understood through
              phantasms, reach an understanding of separate substances. For we
              can by the action of the intellect abstract the quiddity of
              anything that has a quiddity, and which is not identical with its
              quiddity. Indeed, the intellect is naturally equipped to know any
              quiddity, in so far as it is quiddity, since the proper object of
              the intellect is what a thing is. But, if what is primarily
              understood by the possible intellect is something having a
              quiddity, we can abstract through the possible intellect the
              quiddity of that which is primarily understood. Moreover, if that
              quiddity also has a quiddity, it will in turn be possible to
              abstract the quiddity of this quiddity. And since an infinite
              process is impossible, it must stop somewhere. Therefore, our
              intellect is able to reach, by way of resolution, the knowledge of
              a quiddity which has no further quiddity. Now, this is the sort of
              quiddity proper to a separate substance. So, our intellect can,
              through the knowledge of those sensible things that is received
              from phantasms, reach an understanding of separate substances.

              [4] He proceeds, moreover, to show the same thing in another,
              similar way. For he maintains that the understanding of one thing,
              say a horse, is plurally present in me and in you, simply by means
              of a multiplication of spiritual species which are diversified in
              me and in you. So, then, it is necessary that an object of
              understanding, which is not based on any species of this kind, be
              identical in me and in you. But the quiddity of an object of
              understanding, which quiddity our intellect is naturally capable
              of abstracting, has no spiritual but individual species, as we
              have proved, because the quiddity of a thing that is understood is
              not the quiddity of an individual, either spiritual or corporeal,
              for a thing that is understood, as such, is universal. So, our
              intellect is by nature capable of understanding a quiddity for
              which the understanding is one among all men. Now, such is the
              quiddity of a separate substance. Hence, our understanding is
              naturally equipped to know separate substance.

              [5] However, if a careful consideration be made, these ways of
              arguing will be discovered to be frivolous. Since a thing that is
              understood, as such, is universal, the quiddity of the thing
              understood must be the quiddity of something universal; namely, of
              a genus or a species. Now, the quiddity of a genus or species
              pertaining to these sensible things, whose intellectual knowledge
              we get through phantasms, includes matter and form within itself.
              So, it is entirely unlike the quiddity of a separate substance,
              which latter is simple and immaterial. Therefore, it is not
              possible for the quiddity of a separate substance to be

              [6] Besides, the form which in actual being cannot be separated
              from a subject is not of the same rational character as the form
              which is separated in its being from such a subject, even though
              both of them can be taken, in an act of consideration, without
              such a subject. Thus, there is not the same essential character
              for magnitude and for a separate substance, unless we claim that
              magnitudes are separate things midway between specific forms and
              sensible things, as some of the Platonists maintained. Of course,
              the quiddity of a genus or species of sensible things cannot be
              separate in actual being from a given material individual, unless,
              perhaps, we maintain with the Platonists separate forms of things,
              but this has been disproved by Aristotle. Therefore, the quiddity
              of the aforementioned separate substances, which in no way exist
              in matter, is utterly different. Therefore, separate substances
              cannot be understood simply by virtue of the fact that these
              quiddities are understood.

              [7] Again, if it is granted that the quiddity of a separate
              substance is of the same rational character as the quiddity of a
              genus or species of these sensible things, that does not warrant
              saying that it is of the same rational character
              <i>specifically</i>, unless we say that the species of sensible
              things are themselves separate substances, as the Platonists
              claimed. The conclusion stands, then, that they will not be of the
              same rational character, except according to the rational
              character of quiddity as quiddity. Now, this is a meaning of
              rational chasracter which is common to genus and to substance.
              Therefore, nothing except their remote genus could be understood
              concerning separate substances through these sensible quiddities.
              Now, the fact that the genus is known does not mean that hte
              species is known, except in potency. So, separate substances could
              not be understood through an understanding of the quiddities of
              these sensible things.

              [9] Furtherfore, even if we claim that separate substances move
              the spheres, and that from their motions the forms of these
              sensible things are produced, this way of knowing separate
              substance, from sensible things, does not suffice for a knowing of
              their quiddity. For a cause is known through an effect, either by
              reason of a likeness which exists between the effect and the cause
              or in so far as the effect shows the power of the cause. Now, it
              would not be possible to know from the effect, by reason of
              likeness, what the cause is unless the agent is of one species
              with the effect. But that is not the way separate substances are
              related to sensible things. On the other hand, on the basis of
              power, this cannot be done except when the effect is equal to the
              power of the cause. For, in that case, the whole power of the
              cause is known through the effect, and the power of a thing
              demonstrates its substance. But this cannot be asserted in the
              present case, for the powers of separate substances exceed all the
              sensible effects which we may grasp intellectuallly, as a
              universal power surpases a particular effect. Therefore, it is not
              possible for us to be enabled, through an understanding of
              sensible things, to come to an understanding of separate
              substance.

              science is possible, even though it has not yet been discovered,
              this is no argument, because it is not possible to arrive at an
              understanding of the aforesaid substances through any principles
              known to us. Indeed, all the proper principles of any science

              [2] In fact, he tried to show this in the following way. Whenever
              anything has reached maturity in its process of generation and has
              come to the full perfection of its substance, the operation proper
              to it will be at its peak, whether as action or as passion. For,
              as operation is consequent upon substance, so also is the
              perfection of operation a result of the perfection of substance.
              Hence, an animal, when it has become wholly perfect, is able to
              walk by itself. Now, the habitual understanding which is simply
              “intelligible species made to exist in the possible intellect by
              the agent intellect” has a twofold operation: one, to make
              potentially understood things to be actually understood, and it
              owes this to the role of the agent intellect; and the second is
              actually to understand the objects of understanding. These two
              things, then, man can do through an intellectual habit. So,
              whenever the generating of the habitual understanding has reached
              completion, both of these stated operations will be at their peak
              in it. Now, it always approaches the peak perfection of its
              generation when it acquires new kinds of objects of understanding.
              And thus, its process of generation must be completed at some
              time, unless there be an impediment, because no process of
              generation tends to an indefinite termination. So, it will reach
              completion whenever both operations are habitually present in the
              intellect, by virtue of the fact that it makes all the potential
              objects of understanding actual, which is the completion of the
              first operation, and because of the fact that it understands all
              intelligible objects, both separate and not separate.

              [8] Moreover, the form of the intellect, as intellect, is the
              intelligible object, just as the form of the sense is the sensible
              object; indeed, the intellect receives nothing, strictly speaking,
              except in an intellectual way, just as the sense power only
              receives sensitively. So, if the agent intellect cannot be an
              intelligible object through the habitual intellect, then it will
              be impossible for it to be its form.

              [9] Besides, we are said to understand something in three ways.
              First, as we understand by means of the intellect which is the
              power from which such an operation proceeds; hence, both the
              intellect itself is said to understand, and also the intellect’s
              act of understanding becomes our act of understanding. Second, we
              understand by means of an intelligible species; of course, we are
              not said to understand by it, in the sense that it understands,
              but because the intellective power is actually perfected by it, as
              the visual power is by the species of color. Third, we understand

              knowledge of something else.

              [10] So, if at some point man understands separate substances
              through the agent intellect, this must be explained by one of
              these ways that have been mentioned. Now, it is not explained by
              the third way, for Alexander did not admit that either the
              possible or the habitual intellect understands the agent
              intellect. Nor, indeed, is it in the second way, for to understand
              through an intelligible species is the attribute of the
              intellective power for which this intelligible species is the
              form. Now, Alexander did not grant that the possible intellect or
              the habitual intellect understands separate substances; hence, it
              is not possible for us to understand separate substances through
              the agent intellect in the same way that we understand other
              things through an intelligible species. But, if it is as through
              an intellective power, then the agent intellect’s act of
              understanding must be man’s act of understanding. Now, this cannot
              be so unless one actual being is made from the substance of the
              agent intellect and the substance of man; indeed, it is impossible
              if they are two substances with different acts of being, for the
              operation of the one to be the operation of the other. Therefore,
              the agent intellect will be one existing being with man, not one
              accidentally, for then the agent intellect would be not a
              substance but an accident, as is the case when a thing that is one
              being accidentally is made from color and a body. The conclusion
              remains, then, that the agent intellect is united with man in
              substantial being. It will be, then, either the human soul or a
              part of it, and not some separate substance as Alexander claimed.
              Therefore, it cannot be maintained, on the basis of Alexander’s
              opinion, that man understands separate substances.

              similarly understanding through it. It will Mow, then, that two
              men will understand at the same time through the agent intellect
              as through their own form. This is so because the agent
              intellect’s own act of understanding is the act of understanding
              of ‘the man who understands through it, as was said already.

              [12] As a matter of fact, his theory is entirely frivolous. First
              of all because, whenever the process of generation is perfected in
              any member of a genus its operation must be perfected, but, of
              course, according to the manner of its own genus and not according
              to the mode of a higher genus. For instance, when the generation
              of air is perfected it has a development and complete movement
              upward, but not such that it is moved to the place proper to fire.
              Similarly, when the development of the habitual intellect is
              completed its operation of understanding will be completed
              according to its own mode, but not according to the mode whereby
              separate substances understand, so that it may understand separate
              substances. Hence, from the generation of the habitual intellect
              one cannot conclude that man will understand separate substance at
              some time.

              [13] Secondly, it is frivolous because the perfection of an

              belongs. So, if to understand separate substances be a perfection
              of the operation of the habitual intellect, it follows that the

              in time. Now, Alexander does not claim this, for it would follow

              speculative sciences which are included under the notion of
              habitual understanding.

              [14] Thirdly, it is frivolous because the generation of things
              that begin to be generated is nearly always brought to completion,
              since all processes of generating things are due to determinate
              causes which achieve their effects, either always, or in the
              majority of cases. If, then, the perfection of action also follows
              upon the completion of generation, it must also be the case that
              perfect operation accompanies the generated things, either always,
              or in the majority of cases. Now, the actual understanding of
              separate substances is not achieved by those who apply themselves
              to the development of habitual understanding, either in most cases
              or always; on the contrary, no man has openly declared that be had
              achieved this perfection. Therefore, the perfection of the
              operation of habitual understanding does not consist in the actual
              understanding of separate substances.

              [2] He showed, first of all, that it was necessary to hold that
              the agent intellect is related to principles naturally known to
              us, either as agent is to instrument, or as form to matter. For
              the habitual intellect, by which we understand, has not only this
              action of understanding, but also another, which is to make things
              actually understood; indeed, we know by experience that both
              actions stand within our power. Now, the action of making things
              actual objects of understanding is more properly indicative of the
              meaning of habitual intellect than is the act of understanding,
              for to make things actually intelligible precedes the act of
              understanding them. But there are some things within us which are
              rendered actually understood in a natural way, not as a result of
              our effort or of the action of our will: such are the first
              intelligible things. In fact, to make these actually understood
              does not depend on the habitual intellect, through which things
              that we know from study are made to be actually understood;
              rather, these first intelligibles are the starting point of the
              habitual intellect. And that is why the habit of these
              intelligibles is also called understanding by Aristotle, in
              <i>Ethics</i> VI [6: 1141a 7]. Now, they are made to be actually
              understood by the agent intellect alone. And by means of them
              other things are made to be actually understood: these are the
              things that we know from study. So, to make these subsequent
              things actually understood is the work both of the habitual
              intellect, as regards first principles, and of the agent
              intellect. Now, one action is not attributed to two things unless
              one of them is related to the other as agent to instrument or as
              form to matter. So, the agent intellect is necessarily related to
              the first principles of the habitual intellect either as agent to
              instrument or as form to matter.

              [3] In fact, he indicates how this is possible in the following
              way. Since the possible intellect, according to his theory, is a
              separate substance, it understands the agent intellect and the
              other separate substances, and also the first objects of
              speculative understanding. So, it is the subject for both types of
              objects. Now, whenever two things are united in one subject, one
              of them is like the form of the other. Thus, when color and light
              are present in a diaphanous body as their subject, one of them,
              namely, light, must be like the form of the other, namely, color.
              Now, this is necessary when they have an ordered relationship to
              each other, but not in the case of things accidentally associated
              in the same subject, like whiteness and musical ability. But
              speculatively understood things and the agent intellect do have an
              ordered relationship to each other, since the objects of
              speculative understanding are rendered actually understood by
              means of the agent intellect. So, the agent intellect is related
              to the objects of speculative understanding as form is to matter.

              Therefore, when the objects of speculative understanding are
              united with us through the phantasms, which are in a sense their
              subject, the agent intellect must also be connected with us,
              because it is the form of the objects of speculative
              understanding. Thus, when the objects of speculative understanding
              are only potentially present in us, the agent intellect is only
              potentially connected with us. But, when some objects of
              speculative understanding are actually in us, and some are
              potentially present, its connection with us is partly actual and
              partly potential. Then it is that we are said to be in motion
              toward the aforementioned connection, for, as more things are made
              to be actually understood within us, the agent intellect becomes
              more perfectly connected with us. This progress and movement
              toward the connection is accomplished through study in the
              speculative sciences, through which we acquire true objects of
              understanding, and also false opinions that are outside the
              orderly process of this movement are excluded, just as
              monstrosities are outside the order of natural operation. Hence,
              men may help each other in making this progress, as they are of
              mutual assistance in the speculative sciences.

              [7] Furthermore, if the agent intellect is a separate substance,
              it cannot be joined to us except through species that have been
              made actually understood, according to this theory; and neither

              related to these species as matter to form, while, conversely, the
              agent intellect is as form to matter. Now, species that have been
              made actually understood are joined with us, according to his
              theory, by means of the phantasms which are related to the
              possible intellect as colors to the visual power, but to the agent
              intellect as colors to light: as we see from the words of
              Aristotle in Book in of
              <i>On the Soul</i> [III, 5: 430a 15]. But to the stone in which
              color is present, neither the action of the power of sight as it
              sees nor the action of the sun as it enlightens can be attributed.
              Therefore, according to the aforesaid theory, it would be
              impossible to attribute to man either the action of the possible
              intellect as it understands or the action of the agent intellect

              So, it could not be a form for us, unless by virtue of the fact

              the quiddities of separate substances can be known through the
              things that we understand about sensible objects. Therefore, it

              [11] Of course, it might be answered that the agent intellect does
              not become a form for us, in a perfect way, by virtue of certain
              objects of speculative understanding, so that we might understand
              separate substances through it and the only reason for this is

              speculative understanding taken together are sufficient for that
              perfection of the agent intellect by which it understands separate
              substances. For all these objects are intelligible only in so far
              as they have been made to be understood, while those separate
              substances are intelligible by their own nature. So, not even the

              [2] Indeed, a thing is futile which exists for an end which it
              cannot attain. So, since the end of man is felicity, to which his
              natural desire tends, it is not possible for the felicity of man
              to be placed in something that man cannot achieve. Otherwise, it
              would follow that man is a futile being, and his natural desire
              would be incapable of fulfillment, which is impossible. Now, it is
              clear from what has been said that man cannot understand separate
              substances on the basis of the foregoing opinions. So, man’s
              felicity is not located in such knowledge of separate substances.

              [3] Again, in order that the agent intellect be united to us as a
              form, so that we may understand separate substances through it, it
              is required that the generation of the habitual intellect be
              complete, according to Alexander; or that all objects of
              speculative understanding be made actual within us, according to
              Averroes. And these two views reduce to the same thing, for in
              this explanation the habitual intellect is generated in us, in so
              far as the objects of speculative understanding are made actual
              within us. Now, all species from sensible things are potential
              objects of understanding. So, in order that the agent intellect be
              joined with any person, he must actually understand all the
              natures of sensible things, and all their powers, operations, and
              motions, through speculative understanding. This is not possible
              for any man to know through the principles of the speculative
              sciences, by which principles we are moved to a connection with
              the agent intellect, as they say. For, one could not attain all
              these objects of knowledge from the things that come under the
              scope of our senses, and from which the principles of the
              speculative sciences are drawn. So, it is impossible for a man to
              achieve this connection, in the manner suggested by them.
              Therefore, it is not possible for man’s felicity to consist in
              such a connection.

              [4] Besides, even granting that such a connection of man with the
              agent intellect were possible as they describe it, it is plain
              that such perfection comes to very few men; so much so that not
              even these men, nor any other men, however diligent and expert in
              speculative sciences, have dared to claim such perfection for
              themselves. On the contrary, they all state that many things are
              unknown to them, Thus, Aristotle speaks of the squaring of the
              circle, and he can give only probable arguments for his principles
              for the ordering of celestial bodies, as he admits himself, in
              Book II of <i>On the Heavens</i> [5: 288a 2], and what is
              necessary in regard to these bodies and their movers he keeps for
              others to explain, in <i>Metaphysics</i> XI [8: 1073b 2]. Now,
              felicity is a definite common good, which many people can attain,
              “unless they are defective,” as Aristotle puts it, in
              <i>Ethics</i> I [9: 1099b 19]. And this is also true of every
              natural end in any species, that the members of this species do
              attain it, in most cases. Therefore, it is not possible for man’s
              ultimate felicity to consist in the aforesaid connection.

              Patet autem quod nec Aristoteles, cuius sententiam sequi conantur
              praedicti philosophi, in tali continuatione ultimam felicitatem

              et in principio metaphysicae scientiam quam in illo libro tradere

              [5] However, it is clear that Aristotle, whose view the
              aforementioned philosophers try to follow, did not think that
              man’s ultimate felicity is to be found in such a connection. For
              he proves, in <i>Ethics</i> I [13: 1102a 5], that man’s felicity
              is his operation according to perfect virtue. Hence, he had to
              develop his teaching on the virtues, which he divided into the
              moral and the intellectual virtues. Now, he shows in Book X [7:
              1177a 18], that the ultimate felicity of man lies in speculation.
              Hence, it clearly does not lie in the act of any moral virtue, nor
              of prudence or art, though these are intellectual virtues. It
              remains, then, that it is an operation in accord with wisdom, the
              chief of the three remaining intellectual virtues, which are
              wisdom, science, and understanding, as he points out in
              <i>Ethics</i> VI [6: 1141a 3]. Hence, in <i>Ethics</i> X [8: 1179a
              32], he gives his judgment that the wise man is happy. Now,
              wisdom, for him, is one of the speculative knowledges, “the head
              of the others,” as he says in <i>Ethics</i> VI [6]. And at the
              beginning of the <i>Metaphysics</i> [I, 1: 981b 26], he calls the
              science which he intends to treat in this work, wisdom. Therefore,
              it is clear that Aristotle’s opinion was that the ultimate
              felicity which man can acquire in this life is the kind of
              knowledge of divine things which can be gained through the
              speculative sciences. But that later way of knowing divine things,
              not by means of the speculative sciences but by a process of
              generation in the natural order, was made up by some of his
              commentators.

              Quod autem hoc sit possibile nititur ostendere Themistius per

              inquantum sunt facta intellecta in actu per intellectum agentem;

              [2] Themistius tries to show that it is possible, by an argument

              intelligible than material ones; the latter are intelligible, in
              so far as they are made to be actually understood by the agent
              intellect, but the former are intelligible in themselves.
              Therefore, if our intellect comprehends these material substances,
              it is naturally much more capable of understanding separate
              substances.

              [3] Now, this argument must be judged in different ways, depending
              on the various opinions concerning the possible intellect. For, if
              the possible intellect is not a power which depends on matter, and
              again if it is separate in being from body, as Averroes supposes,
              then it follows that it has no necessary relation to material
              things. Consequently, things that are more intelligible in
              themselves will be more intelligible to it. But then it seems to
              follow that, since we understand from the start by means of the
              possible intellect, we therefore understand separate substances
              from the start: which is clearly false.

              [5] However, if the possible intellect is not separated in being
              from body, then by virtue of such a union in being with body it
              has a necessary relation to material things, so that it could not
              reach a knowledge of other things except by means of these
              material things. Hence, it does not follow that, if separate
              substances are more intelligible in themselves, they are for this
              reason more intelligible to our intellect. And the words of
              Aristotle in <i>Metaphysics</i> II [1: 993b 9] prove this. For he
              says there that “the difficulty of understanding these things
              comes from us not from them, for our intellect is to the most
              evident things, as the eye of the owl is to the light of the sun.”
              Hence, since separate substances cannot be understood through
              material things that are understood, as was shown above, it
              follows that our possible intellect can in no way understand
              separate substances.

              illius passiva. Cum ergo substantiae separatae non sint factae
              intellectae in actu per intellectum agentem, sed solum materialia,
              ad haec sola se extendit possibilis intellectus. Non igitur per
              ipsum possumus intelligere substantias separatas.

              [6] This is also evident from the relation of the possible
              intellect to the agent intellect. A passive potency is only a
              potency in regard to those things that are within the power of its
              proper active principle; for, to every passive potency in nature
              there corresponds an active potency; otherwise, the passive
              potency would be useless, for it could not be reduced to act
              except through an active potency. Hence we see that the visual
              power is only receptive of colors which are illuminated by light.
              Now, the possible intellect, since it is a passive power in some
              sense, has its proper corresponding agent, namely, the agent
              intellect which is related to the possible intellect as light is
              to sight. So, the possible intellect is only in potency to those
              intelligible objects which are made by the agent intellect. Hence,
              Aristotle, describing both intellects in Book III of
              <i>On the Soul</i> [5: 430a 14], says that the possible intellect
              is “the capacity to become all things,” while the agent intellect
              is “the capacity to make all things”; so, each potency is
              understood to be referred to the same thing, but one is active and
              the other passive, Thus, since separate substances are not made to
              be actually intelligible by the agent intellect, but only material
              substances are, the possible intellect only includes the latter
              within its scope. Therefore, we cannot understand separate
              substances through it.

              [7] For this point Aristotle made use of an appropriate example,

              eye of the owl in relation to the light of the sun does not extend
              to impossibility, but only to difficulty. He gives a proof for
              this, in the same place, using the following argument: If those
              things which are understood in themselves, namely, separate
              substances, were not possible for us to understand, they would be
              for no purpose, just as if there were a visible object which could

              [1] Now, it seems that some objection may be offered against what
              we have said, on the basis of a text of Augustine which requires
              careful interpretation. In fact, he says in Book IX of
              <i>The Trinity</i>: “Just as the mind gathers knowledge of bodily
              things through the bodily senses, so does it obtain knowledge of
              incorporeal things through itself. And so, it knows itself through
              itself, since it is incorporeal.” Indeed, it does appear from
              these words that our mind understands itself, through itself, and
              by understanding itself it understands separate substances. And
              this is in opposition to what was shown above. Therefore, it is
              necessary to investigate how our soul understands itself through
              itself.

              accomplished. Of course, if it be present in a potential way in

              [6] Now, it appears that even Augustine himself did not intend

              <i>The Trinity</i> that “the soul, when seeking knowledge of
              itself, does not endeavor to see itself as something absent, but
              takes care to observe itself as present; not to learn about itself
              as if it were ignorant, but to distinguish itself from what it
              knows as another thing.” Thus, he makes us understand that the
              soul, through itself, does know itself as present, but not as
              distinct from other things. Consequently, he says that some people
              have erred on this point because they have not distinguished the
              soul from those things which are different from it. Now, because a
              thing is known from the point of view of what it is, that thing is
              also known in distinction from others; consequently, the
              definition which signifies what a thing is distinguishes the thing
              defined from all else. Therefore, Augustine did not wish to say
              that, through itself, the soul knows concerning itself what it is.

              intellectus possibilis intelligit se sicut alia. Intelligit enim
              se per speciem intelligibilem, qua fit actu in genere
              intelligibilium. In se enim consideratus, est solum in potentia ad
              esse intelligibile: nihil autem cognoscitur secundum quod est in
              potentia, sed secundum quod est actu. Unde substantiae separatae,
              quarum substantiae sunt ut aliquid actu ens in genere
              intelligibilium, de se intelligunt quid sunt per suas substantias:
              intellectus vero possibilis noster per speciem intelligibilem, per
              quam fit actu intelligens. Unde et Aristoteles, in III de anima,
              ex ipso intelligere demonstrat naturam intellectus possibilis,
              scilicet quod sit immixtus et incorruptibilis, ut ex praemissis

              [7] But neither did Aristotle intend this. Indeed, he says in Book
              III of
              <i>On the Soul</i> [4: 430a 2] that “the possible intellect
              understands itself as it does other things.” For it understands
              itself through an intelligible species, by which it is made actual
              in the genus of intelligible objects. Considered in itself, it is
              merely in potency in regard to intelligible being; nothing is
              known according to what it is potentially, but only as it is
              actually. Hence, separate substances, whose substances are like
              something actually existing in the genus of intelligible objects,
              do understand, concerning themselves, what they are, through their
              own substances; while our possible intellect does so, through an
              intelligible species, by which it is made an actual agent which
              understands. Hence, also, Aristotle, in Book III of
              <i>On the Soul</i> [4: 429a 2], demonstrates from the very act of
              understanding what is the nature of the possible intellect,
              namely, that it is “unmixed and incorruptible,” as is clear from
              what we have said earlier.

              knowing itself knows that they are, but not what they are, for to
              do the latter is to understand their substances. Indeed, when we
              know this about separate substances, either through demonstration
              or through faith, that there are certain intellectual substances,
              we would not be able to get this knowledge on either basis unless
              our soul knew on its own part this point: what it is to be
              intellectual. Consequently, the knowledge concerning the soul’s
              understanding must be used as a starting point for all that we
              learn about separate substances.

              for it appears from them that we can understand God Himself in
              this life. He says in Book IX of <i>The Trinity</i> that “we see
              with the vision of the mind, in the eternal truth, from which all
              temporal things have been made, the form in accord with which we
              exist, and in accord with which we perform any action by true and
              right reason, either within ourselves or in bodies, and as a
              result of this we have with us a conception and a true knowledge
              of things.” He also says in Book VII of the <i>Confessions</i>:
              “Suppose both of us see that what you say is true, and both of us
              see that what I say is true: where, I ask, do we see it?
              Certainly, I do not see it in you, nor you in me, but both in that
              immutable truth which is above our minds. Again, he says in the
              book <i>On the True Religion</i> that “we judge all things
              according to the divine truth.” And he says in the
              <i>Soliloquies</i> that “truth must be known first, and through it
              other things can be known.” And this seems to mean the divine
              truth. It appears, then, from his words, that we see God Himself,
              Who is His own truth, and thus we know other things through Him.

              which, unless they were above the human mind, certainly would not

              exist in any other location than in God, since only God, according
              to the teaching of our faith, is sempiternal. Therefore, it seems

              [7] As a matter of fact, Augustine himself admits that truth is in
              the soul, in the <i>Soliloquies</i>, and as a result he proves the
              immortality of the soul from the eternity of truth. But truth is
              not in the soul simply in the way that God is said to be in all
              things by His essence, nor as He is in all things by His likeness,
              in the sense that each thing is called true to the extent that it
              approaches the likeness of God; for it is not on this basis that
              the soul is set above other things. Therefore, it is present in a
              special way in the soul, inasmuch as it knows truth. So, just as
              souls and other things are indeed said to be true in their own
              natures, because they have a likeness to the highest nature, which
              is Truth Itself, since it is its own actual being as understood—so
              also, what is known by the soul is true in so far as some likeness
              exists in it of that divine truth which God knows. Hence the Gloss
              on Psalm 11:2: “Truths are decayed from among the children of
              men,” says that: “as from one face there may result many
              reflections in a mirror, so from one first truth there may result

              Now, although different things are known and believed to be true
              by different people, certain things are true on which all men
              agree, such as the first principles of understanding, both
              speculative and practical, according as an image of divine truth
              is reflected universally in the minds of all men. So, in so far as
              any mind knows anything whatever with certitude, the object is
              intuited in these principles, by means of which judgment is made
              concerning all things, by resolving them back into these
              principles; and so the mind is said to see all things in the
              divine truth, or in the eternal reasons, and is said to judge all
              things in accord with them. And this interpretation the words of
              Augustine confirm, in the
              <i>Soliloquies</i>, for he says that the principles of the
              sciences are seen in the divine truth as these visible objects are
              seen in the light of the sun. Yet it is obvious that they are not
              seen in the actual body of the sun, but through its light, which
              is a likeness in the air of solar brilliance, transmitted to
              suitable bodies.

              [2] Again, the ultimate end of man brings to a termination man’s
              natural appetite, in the sense that, once the end is acquired,
              nothing else will be sought. For, if he is still moved onward to
              something else, he does not yet have the end in which he may rest.
              Now, this termination cannot occur in this life. For, the more a
              person understands, the more is the desire to understand increased
              in him, and this is natural to man, unless, perchance, there be
              someone who understands all things. But in this life this does not
              happen to anyone who is a mere man, nor could it happen, since we
              are not able to know in this life the separate substances, and
              they are most intelligible, as has been shown. Therefore, it is

              Adhuc. Omne quod movetur in finem, desiderat naturaliter stabiliri

              [3] Besides, everything that is moved toward an end naturally
              desires to be stationed at, and at rest in, that end;
              consequently, a body does not move away from the place to which it
              is moved naturally, unless by virtue of a violent movement which
              runs counter to its appetite. Now, felicity is the ultimate end
              which man naturally desires. So, there is a natural desire of man
              to be established in felicity. Therefore, unless along with
              felicity such an unmoving stability be attained, he is not yet
              happy, for his natural desire is not yet at rest. And so, when a
              person attains felicity he likewise attains stability and rest,
              and that is why this is the notion of all men concerning felicity,
              that it requires stability as part of its essential character. For
              this reason, the Philosopher says, in <i>Ethics</i> I [10: 1100b
              5], that “we do not regard the happy man as a sort of chameleon.”
              Now, in this life there is no certain stability, for to any man,
              no matter how happy he is reputed to be, illnesses and misfortunes
              may possibly come, and by them he may be hindered in that
              operation, whatever it may be, with which felicity is identified.
              Therefore, it is not possible for man’s ultimate felicity to be in
              this life.

              of generation of a thing to be long, while the time of its
              maturity is short. For it would follow that a nature would be
              without its end, most of the time. Consequently, we see that
              animals which live but a short time also take but a short time to
              come to perfect maturity. Now, if felicity consists in perfect

              pursuits, in which man’s ultimate felicity is placed, as is clear
              from what we have said. For man is barely able to reach perfection
              in scientific speculation in the last stage of his life. But then,

              prospect of sorrow. But, if ultimate felicity were possible in
              this life, it is certain that it would be lost, at least by death.
              And it is not certain whether it would last until death, since for
              any man in this life there is the possibility of sickness, by
              which he may be completely impeded from the work of virtue: such
              things as mental illness and the like, by which the use of reason
              is halted. So, such felicity always will have sorrow naturally
              associated with it. Therefore, it will not be perfect felicity.

              Potest autem aliquis dicere quod, cum felicitas sit bonum

              ostenso quod felicitas sit in operibus virtutis, quae maxime

              talis perfectio in hac vita adest, esse beatos ut homines, quasi

              [9] However, someone may say that, since felicity is a good of
              intellectual nature, perfect and true felicity belongs to those
              beings in whom a perfect intellectual nature is found, that is, to
              separate substances, but that in man there is found an imperfect
              happiness, in the manner of some sort of participation. For, in
              regard to the full understanding of truth, men can attain it only
              through enquiry, and they are utterly deficient in regard to
              objects which are most intelligible in their nature, as is clear
              from what we have said. And so, felicity in its perfect character
              cannot be present in men, but they may participate somewhat in it,
              even in this life. And this seems to have been Aristotle’s view on
              felicity. Hence, in Ethics I, where he asks whether misfortunes
              take away happiness, having shown that felicity consists in the
              works of virtue which seem to be most enduring in this life, he
              concludes that those men for whom such perfection in this life is
              possible are happy as men, as if they bad not attained felicity
              absolutely, but merely in human fashion.

              he is nonetheless superior to irrational creatures. So, he attains
              his ultimate end in a more perfect way than they do. They achieve
              their ultimate end with such perfection because they seek nothing
              else, for the heavy thing comes to rest when it has occupied its
              own place; and even in the case of animals, when they enjoy
              sensual pleasures their natural desire is at rest. So, it is much
              more necessary for man’s natural desire to come to rest when he
              has reached his ultimate end. But this cannot come about in this
              life. Therefore, man does not attain felicity, understood as his
              proper end, during this life, as we have shown. Therefore, he must

              [12] Besides, as long as anything is in motion toward perfection,

              [3] In fact, it is possible to know a cause from its effect, in
              many ways. One way is to take the effect as a means of finding
              out, concerning the cause, that it exists and that it is of a
              certain kind. This occurs in the sciences which demonstrate the
              cause through the effect. Another way is to see the cause in the
              effect itself, according as the likeness of the cause is reflected
              in the effect; thus a man may be seen in a mirror, by virtue of
              his likeness. And this way is different from the first. In fact,
              in the first way there are two cognitions, one of the effect and
              one of the cause, and one is the cause of the other; for the
              knowledge of the effect is the cause of the knowing of its cause.
              But in the second way there is one vision of both, since at the
              same time that the effect is seen the cause is also seen in it. A
              third way is such that the very likeness of the cause, in its
              effect, is the form by which the effect knows its own cause. For
              instance, suppose a box had an intellect, and so knew through its
              form the skilled mind from which such a form proceeded as a
              likeness of that mind. Now, it is not possible in any of these
              ways to know from the effect what the cause is, unless the effect
              be adequate to the cause, one in which the entire virtuality of
              the cause is expressed.

              [4] Now, separate substances know God through their substances, as
              a cause is known through its effect; not, of course, in the first
              way, for then their knowledge would be discursive; but in the
              second way, according as one substance sees God in another; and
              also in the third way, according as any one of them sees God
              within itself. Now, none of them is an effect adequately
              representing the power of God, as we showed in Book Two [22ff].
              So, it is impossible for them to see the divine essence itself by

              understood in its substance must be of the same species or,
              rather, of an identical species; as the form of the house which
              exists in the mind of the artisan is of the same species as the
              form of the house which exists in matter, or, rather, the species

              Unknown.” Indeed, this is the situation, for, while we know of God
              what He is not, what He is remains quite unknown. Hence, to
              manifest his ignorance of this sublime knowledge, it is said of
              Moses that “he went to the dark cloud wherein God was” (Exod.

              Again, since it is possible to come in some way to the proper
              knowledge of a thing by means of negations, as we said above, the
              more a person can know that a large number of closely related
              things are set apart from an object, the more does one approach
              toward a proper knowledge of it. For instance, one approaches
              closer to a proper knowledge of man when he knows that he is
              neither an inanimate, nor an insensitive, being than when one
              merely knows that he is not inanimate; even though neither of them
              makes it known what man is. Now, separate substances know more
              things than we do, and things that are closer to God;
              consequently, in their understanding, they set apart from God more
              things, and more intimately related things, than we do. So, they
              approach more closely to a proper knowledge of Him than we do,

              means of their understanding of themselves.

              things whose substances they see, does not mean that natural
              desire comes to rest in them, unless they also see the substance
              of God Himself.

              [4] Besides, the problem of why something is so is related to the
              problem of whether it is so, in the same way that an inquiry as to
              what something is stands in regard to an inquiry as to whether it
              exists. For the question why looks for a means to demonstrate that
              something is so, for instance, that there is an eclipse of the
              moon; likewise, the question what is it seeks a means to
              demonstrate that something exists, according to the traditional
              teaching in
              <i>Posterior Analytics</i> II [1: 89b 22]. Now, we observe that
              those who see that something is so naturally desire to know why.
              So, too, those acquainted with the fact that something exists
              naturally desire to know what this thing is, and this is to
              understand its substance. Therefore, the natural desire to know
              does not rest in that knowledge of God whereby we know merely that
              He is.

              [5] Furthermore, nothing finite can fully satisfy intellectual
              desire. This is shown from the fact that, whenever a finite object
              is presented, the intellect extends its interest to something
              more, so that, given any finite line, it strives to apprehend a
              longer one; and the same thing takes place in regard to numbers.
              This is the reason for infinite series in numbers and in
              mathematical lines. Now, the eminence and power of any created
              substance are finite. Therefore, the intellect of a separate
              substance does not come to rest simply because it knows created
              substances, however lofty they may be, but it still tends by
              natural desire toward the understanding of substance which is of
              infinite eminence, as we showed concerning divine substance in
              Book One [43].

              God than our intellects are. So, they desire the knowledge of God
              more intensely than we do. But, no matter how fully we know that
              God exists, and the other things mentioned above, we do not cease

              operation of the intellect, since no desire carries on to such
              sublime heights as the desire to understand the truth. Indeed, all
              our desires for pleasure, or other things of this sort that are
              craved by men, can be satisfied with other things, but the
              aforementioned desire does not rest until it reaches God, the
              highest point of reference for, and the maker of, things. This is
              why Wisdom appropriately states: “I dwelt in the highest places,
              and my throne is in a pillar of a cloud” (Sirach 24:7). And
              Proverbs (9:3) says that Wisdom “by her maids invites to the
              tower.” Let those men be ashamed, then, who seek man’s felicity in
              the most inferior things, when it is so highly situated.

              consider that self-subsistent substance is either a form only, or
              a composite of matter and form. And a thing composed of matter and
              form cannot be the form of another being, because the form in it
              is already limited to this matter in such a way that it could not
              be the form of another thing. But a being which subsists in such a

              its being is such that it could be participated by that other
              thing, as we showed concerning the human soul, in Book Two [68].
              However, if its being could not be participated by another, it
              could not be the form of any other thing, for then it would be
              determined within itself by its own being, just as material things
              are by their own matter.

              Now, this should be observed as obtaining in the same way in the

              being. For, since the perfection of the intellect is what is true,
              in the order of intelligible objects, that object which is a
              purely formal intelligible will be truth itself. And this
              characteristic applies only to God, for, since the true is
              consequent on being, that alone is its own truth which is its own
              being. But this is proper to God only, as we showed in Book Two
              [15]. So, other intelligible subsistents do not exist as pure
              forms in the order of intelligible beings, but as possessors of a
              form in some subject. In fact, each of them is a true thing but
              not truth, just as each is a being but not the very act of being.

              Haec igitur visio immediata Dei repromittitur nobis in Scriptura,

              [5] This immediate vision of God is promised us in Scripture: “We
              see now through a glass in a dark manner; but then face to face”
              (1 Cor. 13:12). It is wrong to understand this in a corporeal way,
              picturing in our imagination a bodily face of the Divinity, since
              we have shown that God is incorporeal. Nor is it even possible for
              us to see God with our bodily face, for the power of corporeal
              vision, which is associated with our face, can only apply to
              corporeal things. Thus, then, shall we see God face to face, in
              the sense that we shall see Him without a medium, as is true when
              we see a man face to face.

              [6] In this vision, of course, we become most like unto God, and
              we are partakers in His happiness. For God Himself understands His
              own substance through His own essence; and this is His felicity.
              Hence it is said: “When He shall appear, we shall be like to Him,
              because we shall see Him as He is” (1 John 3:2). And the Lord says
              “I dispose to you, as My Father has disposed to me... my table,
              that you may eat and drink at my table, in my kingdom” (Luke
              22:29-30). Of course, this can be understood not in reference to
              corporeal food or drink, but to Him who is received at the table
              of Wisdom, of whom Wisdom speaks: “Eat My bread and drink the wine
              which I have mingled for you” (Proverbs 9:5). And so, may they who
              enjoy the same felicity whereby God is happy eat and drink at
              God’s table, seeing Him in the way that lie sees Himself.

              essence must be united with it for the first time as an
              intelligible species. Of course, it is not possible for the divine
              essence to be changed, as we showed above. So, this union must
              start to exist by means of a change in the created intellect. In
              fact, this change can only come about by means of the created
              intellect acquiring some new disposition.

              Indeed, the same conclusion follows if it be granted that a
              created intellect is endowed with such a vision from the start of
              its creation. For, if this vision exceeds the capacity of a
              created nature, as we have proved, then any created intellect may
              be understood to enjoy complete existence in the species proper to
              its nature, without seeing the substance of God. Hence, whether it
              begins to see God at the start of its existence, or later,
              something must be added to its nature.

              [5] Furthermore, nothing can be elevated to a higher operation
              unless because its power is strengthened. But there are two
              possible ways in which a thing’s power may be strengthened. One
              way is by a simple intensification of the power itself; thus, the
              active power of a hot thing is increased by an intensification of
              the heat, so that it is able to perform a stronger action of the
              same species. A second way is by the imposition of a new form;
              thus, the power of a diaphanous object is increased so that it can
              shine with light, by virtue of its becoming actually luminous,
              through the form of light received for the first time within it.
              And in fact, this latter kind of increase of power is needed for
              the acquisition of an operation of another species. Now, the power
              of a created intellect is not sufficient to see the divine
              substance, as is clear from what we have said. So, its power must
              be increased in order that it may attain such a vision. But the
              increase through the intensification of a natural power does not
              suffice, since this vision is not of the same essential type as
              the vision proper to a natural created intellect. This is evident
              from the difference between the objects of these visions.
              Therefore, an increase of the intellectual power by means of the
              acquisition of a new disposition must be accomplished.

              [6] However, since we reach the knowledge of intelligible things
              from sensible things, we also take over the names proper to sense
              knowledge for intellectual knowledge, especially the ones which
              apply to sight, which, compared to the other senses, is more noble
              and more spiritual, and so more closely related to the intellect.
              Thus it is that this intellectual knowledge is called vision. And
              since corporeal vision is not accomplished without light, those
              things whereby intellectual vision is perfected take on the name
              fight. Hence, even Aristotle, in Book III of
              <i>On the Soul</i> [5: 430a 15], likens the agent intellect to
              light, because of the fact that the agent intellect makes things
              actually intelligible, just as light in a way makes things
              actually visible. Therefore, this disposition whereby the created
              intellect is raised to the intellectual vision of divine substance
              is fittingly called the light of glory; not because it makes some
              object actually intelligible, as does the light of the agent
              intellect, but because it makes the intellect actually powerful
              enough to understand.

              [7] Now, this is the light of which it is said in the Psalms
              (35:10): “In Thy light we shall see the light,” that is, of the
              divine substance. And it is said in the Apocalypse (22:5; see also
              21:23): “The city,” that is, of the Blessed, “has no need of the
              sun, nor of the moon... for the glory of God bath enlightened it.”

              garment.”And for this reason also, both God and the angels are

              divine substance is not beyond the capacity of the created
              intellect in such a way that it is altogether foreign to it, as
              sound is from the object of vision, or as immaterial substance is
              from sense power; in fact, the divine substance is the first
              intelligible object and the principle of all intellectual
              cognition. But it is beyond the capacity of the created intellect,
              in the sense that it exceeds its power; just as sensible objects
              of extreme character are beyond the capacity of sense power.
              Hence, the Philosopher says that “our intellect is to the most
              evident things, as the eye of the owl is to the light of the sun.”
              So, a created intellect needs to be strengthened by a divine light
              in order that it may be able to see the divine essence. By this,
              the first argument is answered.

              [9] Moreover, this sort of light raises the created intellect to
              the vision of God, not on the basis of a diminution of its
              distance from the divine substance, but by virtue of a power which
              it receives from God in relation to such an effect; even though it
              remains far away from God in its being, as the second argument
              suggested. In fact, this light does not unite the created

              [10] Since, however, it is proper to God Himself to know His own
              substance perfectly, the aforesaid light is a likeness of God,
              inasmuch as it conduces to the seeing of God’s substance. But no
              intellectual substance can be a likeness of God in this sense.
              For, since the divine simplicity is not equaled by any created
              substance, it is not possible for a created substance to have its
              entire perfection in the same identity; indeed, this is proper to
              God, as we showed in Book One [28], for He is being, understanding
              and blessed, identically. So, in a created intellectual substance,
              the light whereby it is beatified in the divine vision is one
              thing, while the light whereby it is in any sense perfected within
              its natural species, and whereby it understands in a manner
              proportioned to its substance, is quite a different thing. From
              this the answer to the third argument is evident.

              is. This latter kind of infinity is rationally unknown, because it
              is like matter devoid of form, which is the principle of
              knowledge. Rather, He is called infinite in the negative sense,
              like a self-subsistent form, not limited by matter receiving it.

              know: either in the sense of a multitude of things, or even in the
              sense of a greater number of reasons for the same things. But the
              divine intellect surpasses every created intellect. So, it knows
              more than any created intellect does, and it does not know
              anything without seeing its essence, as we showed in Book One
              [49]. Therefore, more things are knowable through the divine
              essence than any created intellect can see, through the aforesaid

              can do. So, it is the same to know all the things that a power can
              do and to comprehend the power itself. But, since the divine power
              is infinite, no created intellect can comprehend it, just as its
              essence cannot be comprehended, as we have proved. Nor can the
              created intellect know all that the divine power can do. But all

              divine essence, for God knows all and in no other way than through
              His essence. Therefore, the created intellect, seeing the divine

              [5] Moreover, no cognoscitive power knows a thing except under the
              rational character of its proper object. For instance, we do not
              know anything by sight except according as it is colored. Now, the
              proper object of the intellect is that which is, that is, the
              substance of a thing, as is stated in Book III of
              <i>On the Soul</i> [4: 429b 10]. Therefore, whatever the intellect
              knows about any thing, it knows through knowing the substance of
              the thing. Consequently, in any demonstration through which the
              proper accidents become known to us, we take as our principle that
              which is, as is stated in <i>Posterior Analytics</i> I [4: 73a
              37]. Now, if the intellect knows the substance of a thing through
              its accidents, in accordance with what is said in Book I of
              <i>On the Soul</i> [1: 402b 21], that “the accidents contribute a
              good deal to the knowing of that which is,” this is accidental,
              inasmuch as the intellect must attain to substance through the
              knowledge of sensible accidents. For this reason, this procedure
              has no place in mathematics, but only in the area of physical
              things. Therefore, whatever is in a thing and cannot be known
              through a knowledge of its substance must be unknown to the
              intellect.

              However, what a volitional agent wills cannot be known through a
              knowledge of his substance, for the will does not incline to its
              object in a purely natural way; this is why the will and nature
              are said to be two active principles. So, an intellect cannot know
              what a volitional agent wills except, perhaps, through certain
              effects. For instance, when we see someone acting voluntarily we
              may know what he wishes: either through their cause, as God knows
              our will acts, just as He does His other effects, because He is
              for us a cause of our willing; or by means of one person
              indicating his wish to another, as when a man expresses his
              feeling in speech. And so, since many things are dependent on the
              simple will of God, as is partly clear from earlier
              considerations, and will later be more evident, though the created
              intellect may see God’s, substance, it does not know all that God
              sees through His substance.

              clear from Book III of <i>On the Soul</i> [4: 429a 14], the power
              to sense is destroyed, or weakened, by the more striking sense
              objects, so that later it is unable to perceive weaker objects;
              but the intellect, not being corrupted or hindered by its object
              but only perfected, after understanding a greater object of the
              intellect, is not less able to understand other intelligibles but
              more able. Now, the highest object in the genus of intelligible
              objects is the divine substance. So, the intellect which is
              elevated by divine light in order to see God’s substance is much
              more perfected by this same light, so that it may understand all

              [3] Besides, intelligible being is not of lesser scope than

              is from its origin capable of understanding all things existing in
              reality, and it also understands things that have no natural
              being, such as negations and privations. So, whatever things are
              needed for the perfection of natural being are also needed for the
              perfection of intelligible being, and even more. But the
              perfection of intelligible being is present when the intellect
              reaches its ultimate end, just as the perfection of natural being
              consists in the very establishment of things in actual being.
              Therefore, God shows the intellect that is seeing Him all the
              things which He has produced for the perfection of the universe.

              [6] Moreover, if the foregoing statements are carefully
              considered, it becomes clear that, in a way, those who see the
              divine substance do see all things; whereas, in another way, they
              do not. Indeed, if the word all means whatever things pertain to
              the perfection of the universe, it is obvious from what has been
              said that those who see the divine substance do see all things, as
              the arguments that have just been advanced show. For, since the
              intellect is in some way all things, whatever things belong to the
              perfection of nature belong also in their entirety to the
              perfection of intelligible being. For this reason, according to
              Augustine’s
              <i>Literal Commentary on Genesis</i>, whatever things have been
              made by the Word of God to subsist in their proper nature have
              also come to be in the angelic understanding, so that they might
              be understood by the angels. Now, within the perfection of natural
              being belong the nature of species and their properties and
              powers, for the inclination of nature is drawn to the natures of
              species, since individuals are for the sake of the species. So, it
              is pertinent to the perfection of intellectual substance to know
              the natures of all species and their powers and proper accidents.
              Therefore, this will be obtained in the final beatitude through
              the vision of the divine essence. Moreover, through the cognition
              of natural species the individuals existing under these species
              are known by the intellect that sees God, as can be made evident
              from what has been said above on the knowledge appropriate to God
              and the angels.

              Hoc autem considerari potest quantum ad plura. Primo, quantum ad

              creato, ut supra ostensum est. Hinc est quod Iob 11 dicitur:

            <td>
              [8] But this can be considered under several points. First, in
              regard to those things which God can make but has not made, nor
              will ever make. Indeed, all things of this kind cannot be known
              unless His power is comprehended, and this is not possible for any
              intellectual creature, as we showed above. Hence, the statement in
              Job 11 [7ff]: “Do you think you can understand the steps of God,
              and find out the Almighty perfectly? He is higher than heaven, and
              what will you do? He is deeper than hell, and how will you know?
              His measure is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.”
              Indeed, these things are not said as though God were great in
              quantitative dimensions, but because His power is not limited to
              all things which are seen to be great, for, on the contrary, He
              can make even greater things.

              Secundo, quantum ad rationes rerum factarum: quas omnes cognoscere
              non potest intellectus nisi divinam bonitatem comprehendat. Ratio
              enim cuiuslibet rei factae sumitur ex fine quem faciens intendit.
              Finis autem omnium a Deo factorum divina bonitas est. Ratio igitur
              rerum factarum est ut divina bonitas diffundatur in rebus. Sic
              igitur aliquis omnes rationes rerum creatarum cognosceret, si
              cognosceret omnia bona quae in rebus creatis, secundum ordinem
              divinae sapientiae, provenire possunt. Quod esset divinam
              bonitatem et sapientiam comprehendere: quod nullus intellectus
              creatus potest. Hinc est quod dicitur Eccle. 8-17: intellexi quod

            </td>
            <td>
              [9] Secondly, let us consider it in regard to the reasons for the
              things that have been made: the intellect cannot know all of these
              unless it comprehend the divine goodness. For, the reason for
              everything that has been made is derived from the end which its
              maker intended. But the end of all things made by God is divine
              goodness. Therefore, the reason for the things that have been made
              is so that the divine goodness might be diffused among things. And
              so, one would know all the reasons for things created if he knew
              all the goods which could come about in created things in accord
              with the order of divine wisdom. This would be to comprehend
              divine goodness And wisdom, something no created intellect can do.
              Hence it is said: “I understand that man can find no reason of all
              those works of God” (Eccle. 8:17).

              sanctificationem pertinent creaturae. Hinc est quod dicitur I Cor.

              [10] Thirdly, we may consider the point in regard to those things

              predestination, election, justification, and other similar things
              which pertain to the sanctification of the creature. On this
              matter, it is said: “No man knows the things of a man, but the
              spirit of man that is in him. So the things also that are of God,

              must be seen at once and by one vision, since a vision corresponds

              [4] Besides, if a given action is done in time, this will be
              either because the principle of the action is in time—in this
              sense the actions of temporal things are temporal; or because of
              the terminus of the operation, as in the case of spiritual
              substances which are above time but perform their actions on
              things subject to time. Now, the aforementioned vision is not in
              time by virtue of what is seen, for this is the eternal substance;
              nor by virtue of that whereby the seeing is accomplished, for this
              also is the eternal substance; nor even by virtue of the agent who
              sees, that is the intellect, whose being does not come under time,
              since it is incorruptible, as we proved above. Therefore, this
              vision consists in a participation in eternity, as completely
              transcending time.

              on it. But its action, as joined to lower things which exist in
              time, is temporal. Therefore, its action, as joined to higher
              things which exist above time, participates in eternity.
              Especially so is the vision by which it sees the divine substance.
              And so, by this kind of vision it comes into the participation of
              eternity; and for the same reason, so does any other created

              continues to stimulate desire. But the divine substance is always
              viewed with wonder by any created intellect, since no created
              intellect comprehends it. So, it is impossible for an intellectual
              substance to become tired of this vision. And thus, it cannot, of
              its own will, desist from this vision.

              [10] Moreover, if any two things were formerly united and later
              come to be separated, this must be due to a change in one of them.
              For, just as a relation does not come into being for the first
              time without a change in one of the things related, so also it
              does not cease to be without a new change in one of them. Now, the
              created intellect sees God by virtue of being united to Him in
              some way, as is clear from what we have said. So, if this vision
              were to cease, bringing this union to an end, it would have to be
              done by a change in the divine substance, or in the intellect of
              the one who sees it. Both of these changes are impossible: for the
              divine substance is immutable, as we showed in Book One [13], and,
              also, the intellectual substance is raised above all change when
              it sees God’s substance. Therefore, it is impossible for anyone to
              depart from the felicity in which he sees God’s substance.

              <i>On Generation</i>
              II [10: 336b 30], cannot endure forever. But no creature can come
              closer to God than the one who sees His substance. So, the
              intellectual creature that sees God’s substance attains the
              highest immutability. Therefore, it is not possible for it ever to
              lapse from this vision.

              this in the voluptuous life, and they become intemperate and
              incontinent through immoderation in regard to it. However, the

              desideria quietantur, et in qua est plena sufficientia omnium

              [9] And so, it is evident that through the divine vision
              intellectual substances obtain true felicity, in which their
              desires are completely brought to rest and in which is the full
              sufficiency of all the goods which, according to Aristotle,” are
              required for happiness. Hence, Boethius also says that “happiness
              is a state of life made perfect by the accumulation of all goods”
              [

              [10] Now, there is nothing in this life so like this ultimate and
              perfect felicity as the life of those who contemplate truth, to
              the extent that it is possible in this life. And so, the
              philosophers who were not able to get full knowledge of this
              ultimate happiness identified man’s ultimate happiness with the
              contemplation which is possible in this life. On this account,
              too, of all other lives the contemplative is more approved in
              divine Scripture, when our Lord says: “Mary has chosen the better
              part,” namely, the contemplation of truth, “which shall not be
              taken from her” (Luke 10:42). In fact, the contemplation of truth
              begins in this life, but reaches its climax in the future; whereas
              the active and civic life does not go beyond the limits of this
              life.

              [2] Whenever certain things are ordered to a definite end they all
              come under the control of the one to whom the end primarily
              belongs. This is evident in an army: all divisions of an army and
              their functions are ordered to the commander’s good as an ultimate
              end, and this is victory. And for this reason it is the function
              of t he commander to govern the whole army. Likewise, an art which
              is concerned with the end commands and makes the laws for an art I
              concerned with means to the end. Thus, the art of civil government
              commands that of the military; the military commands the
              equestrian; and the art of navigation commands that of
              shipbuilding. So, since all things are ordered to divine goodness
              as an end, as we showed, it follows that God, to Whom this
              goodness primarily belongs, as something substantially possessed
              and known and loved, must be the governor of all things.

              [4] Besides, we have shown that God is the first unmoved mover.
              The first mover does not move fewer things, but more, than the
              secondary movers, for the latter do not move other things without
              the first. Now, all things that are moved are so moved because of
              the end, as we showed above. So, God moves all things to their
              ends, and He does so through His understanding, for we have shown
              above that He does not act through a necessity of His nature, but
              through understanding and will. Now, to rule or govern by
              providence is simply to move things toward an end through
              understanding. Therefore, God by His providence governs and rules
              all things that are moved toward their end, whether they be moved
              corporeally, or spiritually as one who desires is moved by an
              object of desire.

              [5] Moreover, that natural bodies are moved and made to operate
              for an end, even though they do not know their end, was proved by
              the fact that what happens to them is always, or often, for the
              best; and, if their workings resulted from art, they would not be
              done differently. But it is impossible for things that do not know
              their end to work for that end, and to reach that end in an
              orderly way, unless they are moved by someone possessing knowledge
              of the end, as in the case of the arrow directed to the target by
              the archer. So, the whole working of nature must be ordered by
              some sort of knowledge. And this, in fact, must lead back to God,
              either mediately or immediately, since every lower art and type of
              knowledge must get its principles from a higher one, as we also

              [8] Besides, the nearer a thing is to its cause, the more does it
              participate in its influence. Hence, if some perfection is more
              perfectly participated by a group of things the more they approach
              a certain object, then this is an indication that this object is
              the cause of the perfection which is participated in various
              degrees. For instance, if certain things become hotter as they
              come nearer to fire, this is an indication that fire is the cause
              of heat. Now, things are found to be more perfectly ordered the
              nearer they are to God. For, in the lower types of bodies, which
              are very far away from God in the dissimilarity of their natures,
              there is sometimes found to be a falling away from the regular
              course of nature, as in the case of monstrosities and other chance
              events; but this never happens in the case of the celestial
              bodies, though they are somewhat mutable, and it does not occur
              among separate intellectual substances. Therefore, it is plain
              that God is the cause of the whole order of things. So, He is the

              [9] Furthermore, as we proved above, God brings all things into
              being, not from the necessity of His nature, but by understanding
              and will. Now, there can be no other ultimate end for His
              understanding and will than His goodness, that is, to communicate
              it to things, as is clear from what has been established. But
              things participate in the divine goodness to the extent that they
              are good, by way of likeness. Now, that which is the greatest good
              in caused things is the good of the order of the universe; for it
              is most perfect, as the Philosopher says.” With this, divine
              Scripture is also in agreement, for it is said in Genesis (1:31):
              “God saw all the things He had made, and they were very good,”
              while He simply said of the individual works, that “they were
              good.” So, the good of the order of things caused by God is what
              is chiefly willed and caused by God. Now, to govern things is
              nothing but to impose order on them. Therefore, God Himself
              governs all things by His understanding and will.

              [10] Moreover, any agent intending an end is more concerned about
              what is nearer to the ultimate end, because this nearer thing is
              also an end for other things. Now, the ultimate end of the divine
              will is His goodness, and the nearest thing to this latter, among
              created things, is the good of the order of the whole universe,
              since every particular good of this or that thing is ordered to it
              as to an end (just as the less perfect is ordered to what is more
              perfect); and so, each part is found to be for the sake of its
              whole. Thus, among created things, what God cares for most is the
              order of the universe. Therefore, He is its governor.

              [11] Again, every created thing attains its ultimate perfection
              through its proper operation, for the ultimate end and the
              perfection of a thing must be either its operation or the term or
              product of its operation. Of course, the form, by virtue of which
              the thing exists, is its first perfection, as is evident from Book
              II of
              <i>On the Soul</i> [1: 412a 28]. But the order of caused things,
              according to the distinction of their natures and levels, proceeds
              from divine Wisdom, as we showed in Book Two. So also does the
              order of their operations, whereby caused things draw nearer to
              their ultimate end. Now, to order the actions of certain things
              toward their end is to govern them. Therefore, God provides
              governance and regulation for things by the providence of His
              wisdom.

              [4] Besides, no particular univocal agent can be the unqualified

              every man, and, consequently, of himself—which is impossible. But

              is to be the principle of the generation of an individual man. So,
              it is apparent that neither this man, nor any other univocal agent
              in nature, is the cause of anything except the generation of this

              motion is apart from the being of the thing. Now, nothing.
              corporeal, unless it be moved, is the cause of anything, for no
              body acts unless by motion, as Aristotle proves. Therefore, no
              body is the cause of the being of anything, in so far as it is
              being, but it is the cause of its being moved toward being, that
              is, of the thing’s becoming. Now, the being of any thing is
              participated being, since no thing is its own act of being, except
              God, as we proved above. And thus, God Himself, Who is His own act
              of being, must be primarily and essentially the cause of every
              being. So, divine operation is related to the being of things as
              the motion of a corporeal mover is to the becoming and passive
              movement of the things that are made or moved. Now, it is
              impossible for the becoming and passive movement of a thing to
              continue if the motion of the mover cease. Therefore, it is
              impossible for the being of a thing to continue except through
              divine operation.

              [7] Again, the impression of an agent does not continue in the
              product, if the agent’s action ceases, unless the impression be
              converted into the nature of the product. Indeed, the forms of
              things generated, and their properties, remain in them after
              generation until the end, since they become natural to them. And
              likewise, habits are difficult to change because they are turned
              into a nature. But dispositions and passions, whether of the body
              or soul, endure for a little while after the action of the agent,
              but not forever, since they are present in a state transitional to
              nature. Now, whatever belongs to the nature of a higher type of
              being does not last at all after the action of the agent; light,
              for instance, does not continue in a diaphanous body when the
              source of light has gone away. Now, to be is not the nature or
              essence of any created thing, but only of God, as we showed in

              things: one, from faith, holding that things have been brought
              into being by God, at the beginning; and the position of certain
              philosophers, that things have emanated from God eternally. Now,
              in either position one has to say that things are preserved in
              being by God. For, if things are brought into being by God, after
              they were not existing, then the being of things, and similarly
              their non-being, must result from the divine will; for He has
              permitted things not to be, when He so willed; and He made things
              to be, when He so willed. Hence, they exist just as long as He
              wills them to be. Therefore, His will is the preserver of things.

              and the strength of the Omnipotent and All-sustaining is the cause
              of the subsistence of every creature. And, if this power were ever
              to cease its ruling of the things which have been created, their
              species would at once come to an end, and all nature would
              collapse. For the situation is not like that of a man who has
              built a house and has then gone away, and, while he is not working
              and is absent, his work stands. For, if God were to withdraw His

              [10] Now, by this conclusion the position of the exponents of the
              Law of the Moors is refuted, for, in order to be able to maintain
              that the world needs God’s preservation, they took the view that
              all forms are accidents, and that no accident endures through two
              instants. So that, in this view, the informing of things would be
              in continuous process, as if a thing would not need an agent cause
              except while in the process of becoming. Hence, also, some of
              these people are said to claim that indivisible bodies (out of
              which, they say, all substances are composed and which alone,
              according to them, possess stability) could last for about an hour
              if God were to withdraw His governance from things. Also, some of
              them say that a thing could not even cease to be unless God caused
              in it the accident of “cessation.”— Now, all these views are
              clearly absurd.

              attributed to them as they are united in their participation in
              the motion and power of this agent. For several agents do not
              produce one result unless they are as one. It is clear, for
              example, that all the men in an army work to bring about victory,
              and they do this by virtue of being subordinated to the leader,
              whose proper product is victory. Now, we showed in Book One [13]
              that the first agent is God. So, since being is the common product
              of all agents, because every agent produces actual being, they
              must produce this effect because they are subordinated to the
              first agent and act through His power.

              instance, the form of a house, which is the proper product of the
              builder, appears later than the preparation of the cement, stones,
              and timbers, which are made by the lower workmen who come under
              the builder. Now, in every action, actual being is primarily
              intended, but is last in the process of generation. In fact, as
              soon as it is achieved, the agent’s action and the patient’s
              motion come to rest. Therefore, being is the proper product of the
              primary agent, that is, of God; and all things that give being do

              non solum cum primo res conditae sunt, eis virtutes operativas
              dedit, sed semper eas in rebus causat. Unde, cessante influentia
              divina, omnis operatio cessaret. Omnis igitur rei operatio in

              [3] Besides, it is obvious that every action which cannot continue
              after the influence of a certain agent has ceased results from
              that agent. For instance, the manifestation of colors could not
              continue if the sun’s action of illuminating the air were to
              cease, so there is no doubt that the sun is the cause of the
              manifestation of colors. And the same thing appears in connection
              with violent motion, for it stops with the cessation of violence
              on the part of the impelling agent. But just as God has not only
              given being to things when they first began to exist, and also
              causes being in them as long as they exist, conserving things in
              being, as we have shown, so also has He not merely granted
              operative powers to them when they were originally created, but He
              always causes these powers in things. Hence, if this divine
              influence were to cease, every operation would cease. Therefore,
              every operation of a thing is traced back to Him as to its cause.

              aliquem motum vel corporis, vel animae. Primum autem principium

              applicantur aliquae virtutes ad operandum, reducitur in Deum sicut

              [4] Moreover, whatever agent applies active power to the doing of
              something, it is said to be the cause of that action. Thus, an
              artisan who applies the power of a natural thing to some action is
              said to be the cause of the action; for instance, a cook of the
              cooking which is done by means of fire. But every application of
              power to operation is originally and primarily made by God. For
              operative powers are applied to their proper operations by some
              movement of body or of soul. Now, the first principle of both
              types of movement is God. Indeed, He is the first mover and is
              altogether incapable of being moved, as we shown above. Similarly,
              also, every movement of a will whereby Powers are applied to
              operation is reduced to God, as a first object of appetite and a
              first agent of willing. Therefore; every operation should be
              attributed to God, as to a first and principal agent.

            <td>
              [5] Furthermore, in all agent causes arranged in an orderly way
              the subsequent causes must act through the power of the first
              cause. For instance, in the natural order of things, lower bodies
              act through the power of the celestial bodies; and, again, in the
              order of voluntary things, all lower artisans work in accord with
              the direction of the top craftsman. Now, in the order of agent
              causes, God the first cause, as we showed in Book One [64]. And
              so, all lower agent causes act through His power. But the cause of
              an action is the one by whose power the action is done rather than
              the one who acts: the principal agent, for instance, rather than
              the instrument. Therefore, God is more especially the cause of
              every action than are the secondary agent causes.

              [3] Again, everything that is in a place, or in something, is in

              while an incorporeal thing is said to be in something according to
              the contact of power, since it lacks dimensive quantity. And so,
              an incorporeal thing is related to its presence in something by
              its power, in the same way that a corporeal thing is related to
              its presence in something by dimensive quantity. Now, if there

              [5] Moreover, whenever an agent is present only to one of its
              effects, its action cannot be transferred to another, unless by
              using the first effect as an intermediary, because the agent and
              the patient must be simultaneous. For instance, the organic motive
              power does not have a member of the body except through the heart
              as an intermediary. So, if God were present to but one of His
              effects—for instance, to the first moved sphere which would be
              moved immediately by Him—it would follow that His action could not
              be transferred to another thing except through the mediation of
              this sphere. Now, this is not appropriate. Indeed, if the action
              of any agent cannot be transferred to other things except through
              the mediation of a first effect, then this effect must correspond
              proportionally with the agent according to its entire power;
              otherwise, the agent could not use his entire power. We see an
              instance of this in the fact that all the motions that the motive
              power can cause can be carried out through the heart. But there is
              no creature that can serve as a medium for the carrying out of
              whatever the divine power can do, for divine power infinitely
              surpasses every created thing, as is evident from the things shown
              in Book One [43]. Therefore, it is not appropriate to say that
              divine action does not extend to other effects except through the
              mediation of a first one. So, He is not merely present in one of
              His effects, but in all of them. The same reasoning will be used
              if a person says that He is present in some and not in others,
              because, no matter how many divine effects are taken, they could
              not be sufficient to carry out the execution of the divine power.

              [8] Through this conclusion, moreover, the error is set aside of
              those who say that God is in some definite part of the world (for
              instance, in the first heaven and in the eastern section) and that
              He is consequently the principle of heavenly motion.—Of course,
              this statement of theirs could be supported, if soundly
              interpreted: not, for instance, that we may understand God as
              being confined to some determinate part of the world, but that the
              source of all corporeal motions, according to the order of nature,
              takes its start from a determinate part, being moved by God.
              Because of this He is spoken of in Sacred Scripture also as being
              in the heavens in a particular way; in the text of Isaiah toward
              the end (66:1): “Heaven is My throne,” and in the Psalm (113: 16):
              “The heaven of heaven is the Lord’s,” and so on.—But from the fact
              that, apart from the order of nature, God performs some operation
              in even the lowest of bodies which cannot be, caused by the power
              of a celestial body it is clearly shown that God is immediately
              present, not only in the celestial body, but also in the lowest
              things.

              impossible unless it A at one, indivisible place. In fact, God is
              indivisible, in the sense of existing entirely outside the genus
              of continuous things. And so, He is not determined in regard to
              place, either large or small, by any necessity of His essence

              cannot come into being from matter, since they do not have matter
              as one of their parts. Hence, if they are made, they must be made
              from nothing, and this is to be created. And because creation is
              an act of God alone, as we showed in Book Two [21], it would seem
              to follow that God alone produces both substantial and accidental
              forms in nature.

              does exist through itself, it appears that the forms of things,
              which are not existing through themselves but in matter, come from
              forms which are existent through themselves without matter. It is
              as if forms existing in matter were certain participations in
              those forms which exist without matter. And because of this, Plato
              claimed that the species of sensible things are certain forms
              separate from matter, which are the causes of being for these
              sensible things, according as these things participate in them.

              motion. As an indication of this, they assert that the more that

              [12] Now, many inappropriate conclusions follow from the foregoing
              theories. For, if no lower cause, and especially no bodily one,
              performs any operation, but, instead, God operates alone in all
              things, and if God is not changed by the fact that He operates in
              different things, then different effects would not follow from the
              diversity of things in which God operates. Now, this appears false
              to the senses, for cooling does not result from putting something
              near a hot object, but only heating; nor does the generation of
              anything except a man result from the semen of man. Therefore, the
              causality of the lower type of effects is not to be attributed to
              divine power in such a way as to take away the causality of lower
              agents.

              celestial body which is the first agent of alteration; and so all
              things that produce a change of form in these lower bodies do so
              by its power. And for this reason the celestial power is enough,
              without a univocal agent, to produce some imperfect forms. But to
              produce perfect forms, like the souls of perfect animals, there is
              also required a univocal agent together with the celestial agent.
              In fact, such animals are not generated except from semen. And
              that is why Aristotle says that “man and the sun generate man” [
              <i>Physics</i>
              II, 2: 194b 14].

              [25] Moreover, it is not true that quantity impedes the action of
              a form, except accidentally; that is to say, in so far as all
              continuous quantity is in matter, and form existing in matter,
              having lesser actuality, is consequently less powerful in acting.
              Hence, a body that has less matter and more form, for instance,
              fire, is more active. But, if we consider a kind of action which a
              form existing in matter may have, then quantity helps to increase
              rather than to diminish the action. For instance, the larger a hot
              body is, granting equal intensity of heat, the more is it able to
              give off heat; and granting equal degree of weight, the bigger a
              heavy body is, the more rapidly will it be moved by natural
              motion; that is why it is moved more slowly by unnatural motion.
              Therefore, the fact that heavy bodies have slower unnatural motion
              when they have larger quantity does not show that quantity impedes
              action, but that it helps to increase it.

              [26] Nor, indeed, is it necessary for every body to lack action
              because bodily substance is generically the lowest in the order of
              things. For, even among bodies, one is higher than another, and
              more formal, and more active: as fire is in regard to lower
              bodies. Nor, in fact, is even the lowest body prevented from.
              acting. For it is clear that a body cannot act in its entirety,
              since it is composed of matter which is potential being, and of
              form which is act. Indeed, each thing acts according as it is in
              act. And because of this, every body acts in accord with its form;
              and related to it is another body, namely, the patient, which is a
              subject by virtue of its matter, because its matter is in potency
              to the form of the agent. But, conversely, if the matter of the
              agent’s body be in potency to the form of the patient’s body, they
              will be mutually related as agent to patient. This happens, for
              instance, between two elemental bodies. But, on the other hand,
              one may be only an agent and the other only a patient in relation
              to the first, as is the relation between a celestial body and an
              elemental body. And so, a body that is an agent acts on a subject,
              not by virtue of its entire body, but of the form through which it
              acts.

              [5] However, these points present no difficulty, provided the
              things previously established be considered. In every agent, in
              fact, there are two things to consider: namely, the thing itself
              that acts, and the power by which it acts. Fire, for instance,
              heats by means of heat. But the power of a lower agent depends on
              the power of the superior agent, according as the superior agent
              gives this power to the lower agent whereby it may act; or
              preserves it; or even applies it to the action, as the artisan
              applies an instrument to its proper effect, though he neither
              gives the form whereby the instrument works, nor preserves it, but
              simply gives it motion. So, it is necessary for the action of a
              lower agent to result not only from the agent by its own power,
              but also from the power of all higher agents; it acts, thus,
              through the power of all. And just as the lowest agent is found
              immediately active, so also is the power of the primary agent
              found immediate in the production of the effect. For the power of
              the lower agent is not adequate to produce this effect of itself,
              but from the power of the next higher agent; and the power of the
              next one gets this ability from the power of the next higher one;
              and thus the power of the highest agent is discovered to be of
              itself productive of the effect, as an immediate cause. This is
              evident in the case of the principles of demonstration, the first
              of which is immediate. So, just as it is not unfitting for one
              action to be produced by an agent and its power, so it is not
              inappropriate for the same effect to be produced by a lower agent
              and God: by both immediately, though in different ways.

              these two ways, as we showed above. By this, in fact, the beauty
              of order in created things is evident.

              [2] Indeed, divine governance, whereby God works in things, does
              not exclude the working of secondary causes, as we have already
              shown. Now, it is possible for a defect to happen in an effect,
              because of a defect in the secondary agent cause, without there
              being a defect in the primary agent. For example, in the case of
              the product of a perfectly skilled artisan, some defect may occur
              because of a defect in his instrument. And again, in the case of a
              man whose motive power is strong, he may limp as a result of no
              defect in his bodily power to move, but because of a twist in his
              leg bone. So, it is possible, in the case of things made and
              governed by God, for some defect and evil to be found, because of
              a defect of the secondary agents, even though there be no defect
              in God Himself.

              [3] Moreover, perfect goodness would not be found in created
              things unless. there were an order of goodness in them, in the
              sense that some of them are better than others. Otherwise, all
              possible grades of goodness would not be realized, nor would any
              creature be like God by virtue of holding a higher place than
              another. The highest beauty would be taken away from things, too,
              if the order of distinct and unequal things were removed. And what
              is more, multiplicity would be taken away from things if
              inequality of goodness were removed, since through the differences
              by which things are distinguished from each other one thing stands
              out as better than another; for instance, the animate in relation
              to the inanimate, and the rational in regard to the irrational.
              And so, if complete equality were present in things, there would
              be but one created good, which clearly disparages the perfection
              of the creature. Now, it is a higher grade of goodness for a thing
              to be good because it cannot fall from goodness; lower than that
              is the thing which can fall from goodness. So, the perfection of
              the universe requires both grades of goodness. But it pertains to
              the providence of the governor to preserve perfection in the
              things governed, and not to decrease it. Therefore, it does not
              pertain to divine goodness, entirely to exclude from things the
              power of falling from the good. But evil is the consequence of
              this power, because what is able to fall does fall at times. And
              this defection of the good is evil, as we showed above. Therefore,
              it does not pertain to divine providence to prohibit evil entirely
              from things.

              [4] Again, the best thing in any government is to provide for the
              things governed according to their own mode, for the justice of a

              [5] Besides, it is impossible for an agent to do something evil,
              unless by virtue of the fact that the agent intends something
              good, as is evident from the foregoing. But to prohibit
              universally the intending of the good for the individual on the
              part of created things is not the function of the providence of
              Him Who is the cause of every good thing. For, in that way, many
              goods would be taken away from the whole of things. For example,

              and the preservation of the same according to its species.

              exclude evil from things.

              [13] So, too, the difficulty of some people is solved; namely,
              whether evil actions are from God. Indeed, since it has been shown
              that every agent produces its action by acting through the divine
              power, and, consequently that God is the cause both of all effects
              and all actions, and since it was also shown that evil and defects
              occur in things ruled by divine providence as a result of the
              establishment of secondary causes in which there can be
              deficiency, it is evident that bad actions, according as they are
              defective, are not from God but from defective proximate causes;
              but, in so far as they possess something of action and entity,
              they must be from God. Thus limping arises from the motive power,
              in so far as it possesses something of motion, but in regard to
              what it has by way of defect it is due to the crookedness of the
              leg.

              [2] It has already been shown that the operation of providence,
              whereby God works in things, does not exclude secondary causes,
              but, rather, is fulfilled by them, in so far as they act by God’s
              power. Now certain effects are called necessary or contingent in
              regard to proximate causes, but not in regard to remote causes.
              Indeed, the fact that a plant bears fruit is a fact contingent on
              a proximate cause, which is the germinative power which can be
              impeded and can fail, even though the remote cause, the sun, be a
              cause acting from necessity. So, since there are many things among
              proximate causes that may be defective, not all effects subject to
              providence will be necessary, but a good many are contingent.

              [4] Besides, the nearer certain things are to God, the more they
              participate in His likeness; and the farther they are away, the
              more defective are they in regard to His likeness. Now, those that
              are nearest to God are quite immobile; namely, the separate
              substances which most closely approach the likeness of God, Who is
              completely immutable. But the ones which are next to these, and
              which are moved immediately by those which always exist in the
              same way, retain a certain type of immobility by the fact that
              they are always moved in the same way, which is true of the
              celestial bodies. It follows, then, that those things which come
              after them and are moved by them are far distant from the
              immutability of God, so that they are not always moved in the same
              way. And beauty is evident in this order. Now, every necessary
              thing, as such, always exists in the same wav. It would be
              incompatible, then, with divine providence. to which the
              establishment and preservation of order in things belongs, if all

              [2] Indeed, the governance of every provident ruler is ordered
              either to the attainment, or the increase, or the preservation of
              the perfection of the things governed. Therefore, whatever
              pertains to perfection is to be preserved by providence rather
              than what pertains to imperfection and deficiency. Now, among
              inanimate things the contingency of causes is due to imperfection
              and deficiency, for by their nature they are determined to one
              result which they always achieve, unless there be some impediment
              arising either from a weakness of their power, or on the part of
              an external agent, or because of the unsuitability of the matter.
              And for this reason, natural agent causes are not capable of
              varied results; rather, in most cases, they produce their effect
              in the same way, failing to do so but rarely. Now, the fact that
              the will is a contingent cause arises from its perfection, for it
              does not have power limited to one outcome but rather has the
              ability to produce this effect or that; for which reason it is
              contingent in regard to either one or the other. Therefore, it is
              more pertinent to divine providence to preserve liberty of will
              than contingency in natural causes.

              [3] Moreover, it is proper to divine Providence to use things
              according to their own mode. Now, the mode of acting peculiar to
              each thing results from its form, which is the source of action.
              Now, the form whereby an agent acts voluntarily is not determined,
              for the will acts through a form apprehended by the intellect,
              since the apprehended good moves the will as its object. Now, the
              intellect does not have one form determined to an effect; rather,
              it is characteristic of it to comprehend a multitude of forms. And
              because of this the will can produce effects according to many
              forms. Therefore, it does not pertain to the character of
              providence to exclude liberty of will.

              [4] Besides, by the governance of every provident agent the things
              governed are led to a suitable end; hence, Gregory of Nyssa says
              of divine providence that it is the “will of God through which all
              things that exist receive a suitable end.” But the ultimate end of
              every creature is to attain the divine likeness, as we showed
              above. Therefore, it would be incompatible with providence for
              that whereby a thing attains the divine likeness to be taken away
              from it. Now, the voluntary agent attains the divine likeness
              because it acts freely, for we showed in Book One [88] that there
              is free choice in God. Therefore, freedom of will is not taken
              away by divine providence.

              [5] Moreover, what does not exist cannot be the cause of anything.
              Hence, each thing must stand in the same relation to the fact that
              it is a cause, as it does to the fact that it is a being. So,
              depending on the diversity of order in beings, there must also be
              a diversity of order among causes. Now, it is necessary for the
              perfection of things that there be among things not only
              substantial beings but also accidental beings. Indeed, things that
              do not possess ultimate perfection in their substance must obtain
              such perfection through accidents, and the more of these there
              are, the farther are they from the simplicity of God. From the
              fact, then, that a certain subject has many accidents it follows
              that it is a being accidentally, because a subject and an
              accident, and even two accidents of one substance, are a unit and
              a being accidentally; as in the example of a white man, and of a
              musical, white being. So, it is necessary to the perfection of
              things that there should also be some accidental causes. Now,
              things which result accidentally from any causes are said to
              happen by chance or fortune. Therefore, it is not contrary to the
              rational character of providence, which preserves the perfection
              of things, for certain things to come about as a result of chance
              or fortune.

              [2] Except for the fact of their contingency, and the fact that
              many of them come about by chance and fortune, it does not seem
              that providence is inapplicable to them. For it is only on this
              basis that they differ from incorruptible things, and the
              universal natures of corruptible things, to which providence does
              apply, as people say. But contingency is not incompatible with
              providence, nor are chance or fortune or voluntary action, as we
              have shown. Therefore, nothing prohibits providence from also
              applying to these things, just as it does to incorruptible and
              universal things.

              [3] Again, if God does not exercise providence over these
              singulars, this is either because He does not know them, or
              because He is not able to do so, or because He does not wish to
              take care of them. Now, it cannot be said that God does not know
              singulars; we showed above that God does possess knowledge of
              them. Nor can it be said that God is unable to take care of them,
              for His power is infinite, as we proved above. Nor, indeed, are
              these singulars incapable of being governed, since we see them
              governed by the use of reason in the case of men, and by means of
              natural instinct in the case of bees and many brute animals that
              are governed by some sort of natural instinct. Nor, in fact, can
              it be said that God does not wish to govern them, since His will
              is universally concerned with every good thing, and the good of
              things that are governed lies chiefly in the order of governance.
              Therefore, it cannot be said that God takes no care of these
              singulars.

              individual of the species may be preserved in being. For example,
              organs for the taking in and digestion of food have been given to
              animals, and also horns with which to protect themselves.
              Moreover, good uses of these cannot fail to be made, except in
              rare instances, because things that are from nature produce their
              effects in all cases, or frequently. Thus, it is not possible for

              happen in connection with the singular members of any species that

              [10] Furthermore, in the relation of things to their end, an order
              appears, such that accidents exist for the sake of substances, in
              order that substances may be perfected by them; on the other hand,
              within substances matter is for the sake of form, for it
              participates in divine goodness through form, and that is why all
              things were made, as we showed above. Consequently, it is clear
              that singulars exist for the sake of the universal nature. The
              sign of this is the fact that, in the case of beings whose

              plural individuals of one species, as is instanced by the sun and

              truth, which consists primarily and essentially in immaterial and
              universal things; but the end of practical cognition is operation,

              knowledge, for its function is to order things to their end.

              universal principles is common. However, that man who has not only
              universal, but also a proper, knowledge of things is more perfect
              in speculative science, for, the man who knows only universally
              merely knows a thing potentially. This is why a student is led

              Quidam autem concesserunt providentiam divinam usque ad haec
              singularia procedere, sed quibusdam mediantibus causis. Posuit
              enim Plato, ut Gregorius Nyssenus dicit, triplicem providentiam.
              Quarum prima est summi Dei, qui primo et principaliter providet
              propriis, idest omnibus spiritualibus et intellectualibus;
              consequenter vero toti mundo quantum ad genera et species, et
              universales causas, quae sunt corpora caelestia. Secunda vero est
              qua providetur singularibus animalium et plantarum, et aliorum
              generabilium et corruptibilium, quantum ad eorum generationem et
              corruptionem et alias mutationes. Quam quidem providentiam Plato
              attribuit diis qui caelum circumeunt. Aristoteles vero horum
              causalitatem attribuit obliquo circulo. Tertiam vero providentiam
              ponit rerum quae ad humanam vitam pertinent. Quam quidem attribuit
              quibusdam Daemonibus circa terram existentibus, qui sunt, secundum
              ipsum, humanarum actionum custodes. Sed tamen, secundum Platonem,
              secunda et tertia providentia a prima dependet: nam Deus summus
              secundos et tertios statuit provisores.

              [1] Now, some have conceded that divine providence extends to
              singulars, but through certain intermediary causes. Indeed, Plato
              asserted a threefold providence, according to Gregory of Nyssa
              [Nemesius, <i>De natura hominis</i>, 44]. The first of these is
              that of the highest God, Who primarily and above all provides for
              His own things, that is, for all things spiritual and
              intellectual, but subsequently for the whole world, as far as
              genera and species go, and the universal causes which are the
              celestial bodies. Then the second type of providence is that by
              which provision is made for individual animals and plants, and for
              other generable and corruptible individuals, in respect to their
              generation and corruption, and other changes. Now, Plato
              attributes this kind of providence to the “gods that circulate
              about the heavens.” Aristotle, on the other hand, attributes their
              causality to the “oblique circle. Finally, he assigns a third kind
              of providence to things that pertain to human life. So, he
              attributes this function to certain “daemons living in the region
              of the earth” who are caretakers for human actions, according to
              him. But still, according to Plato, the second and third types of
              providence depend on the first, for the highest God has
              established the ones on the second and third levels as provident
              agents.

              faith, in regard to this: it says that not all particulars are
              immediately subject to divine providence. Now, we can show from
              the foregoing that they are.

              [3] In point of fact, God has immediate knowledge of singulars,
              not merely in the sense that He knows them in their causes, but
              even in themselves, as we showed in Book One [65ff]of this work.
              But it would appear inappropriate for Him to know singulars and
              yet not to will their order, in which their chief good consists,
              for His will is the source of goodness in its entirety. Therefore,
              just as He knows singulars immediately, He must also establish
              order for them immediately.

              Amplius. Ordo qui per providentiam in rebus gubernatis statuitur,

            <td>
              [4] Again, the order that is established by providence among
              things that are governed arises from the order which the provident
              agent decides on within his own mind. For example, the artistic
              form that is produced in matter proceeds from the form that is in
              the mind of the artist. Now, where there are many overseers,
              arranged one under the next, the order that is conceived by the
              higher one must be handed down to the lower one; just as a lower
              type of an receives its principles from a higher one. If, then,
              the second and third provident agents are claimed to be under the
              first provident agent, Who is the highest God, they must receive
              the order that is to be established in things from the highest
              God. Now, it is not possible for this order to be more perfect in
              them than in the highest God; on the contrary, all perfections
              come to other things from Him by way of descent, as appears from
              things said earlier. The order of things must, then, be present in
              the secondary agents of providence, not merely universally, but
              also in respect to singulars; otherwise, they could not establish,
              order in singulars by their providence. Therefore, the ordering of
              singulars is much more under the control of divine providence.

              [5] Besides, in the case of things regulated by human providence
              we find that a certain higher overseer thinks out the way in which
              some of the big and universal matters are to be ordered, but he
              does not himself think out the ordering of the smallest details;
              rather, he leaves these to be planned by agents on a lower level.
              But, as a matter of fact, this is so because of his own
              deficiency, either because he does not know the circumstances for
              the individual details, or because he is not able to think out the
              order for all, by virtue of the effort and length of time that
              might be needed. Now, deficiencies of this kind are far removed
              from God, because He knows all singular things, and He does not
              make an effort to understand, or require any time for it; since,
              by understanding Himself He knows all other things, as we showed
              above. Therefore, He plans even the order for all singular things.
              So, His providence applies to all singulars immediately.

              [6] Moreover, in human affairs the lower overseers, through their
              own efforts, plan the order for those things whose direction has
              been given them by the chief executive. Of course, they do not get
              this ability from the man who is in charge, or even its use.
              Indeed, if they did get it from him, the ordering would already be
              accomplished by the higher executive, and they would not be the
              agents responsible for this ordering, but simply the ones who
              carry it out. Now, it is obvious from things said above that all
              wisdom and understanding are caused in intelligent beings by the
              highest God, and that no intellect can understand anything unless
              by divine power; just as no agent can perform any operation unless
              be act by this divine power. Therefore, God Himself is the
              disposer of all things immediately by His providence, and whatever
              beings are called agents of providence under Him are executors of
              His providence.

              [7] Furthermore, a higher providence gives regulations to a lower
              providence, just as a statesman gives regulations and laws to the
              leader of an army, who gives laws and regulations to the heads of
              larger or smaller military units. If, then, there be other
              providences under the first providence of the supreme God, God
              must give these secondary or tertiary overseers the regulations
              for their commands. So, He gives them either universal regulations
              and laws or particular ones. But, if He gives them universal
              regulations for their commands, since universal regulations cannot
              be applied in all cases, to particulars, especially in the case of
              variable things that do not always remain the same, these
              secondary or tertiary overseers would have to give orders at times
              that are contrary to the regulations given them for the things
              subject to their control. So, they would be able to pass judgment
              on the regulations that they have received, as to when action
              should accord with these regulations and when one should overlook
              them. Now, this could not be, for such judgment belongs to a
              superior. Indeed, it is the prerogative of the one who establishes
              the laws to interpret them and issue dispensations from them. So,
              this judgment over universally given regulations must be carried
              out by the supreme overseer. Of course, He could not do this if He
              refused to involve Himself immediately in the ordering of these
              singular things. So, according to this, He must be the immediate
              overseer of these things. On the other hand, if the secondary and
              tertiary overseers receive particular regulations and laws from
              the highest overseer, then it is quite obvious that the ordering
              of these singulars is done immediately by divine providence.

              [8] Again, the superior overseer always holds the power of
              judgment over the orders issued by inferior overseers, as to
              whether the orders are properly given or not. If, then, the
              secondary or tertiary overseers are under God as the first
              overseer, God must hold the power of judgment over the things
              ordered by them. In fact, He could not do this if He did not
              consider the order of these singulars. Therefore He Himself takes
              care by Himself of these singulars.

              [9] Besides, if God does not immediately by Himself take care of

              despises them or because His dignity might be lowered by them, as
              some people say. But this is unreasonable. It is indeed a matter
              of greater dignity to oversee the planning of the order for
              certain things than for it to be produced in them. So, if God
              works in all things, as we showed above, and if His dignity is not
              diminished thereby, and if this belongs rather to His universal
              and supreme power, it is in no sense something to be despised by
              Him, or something that might besmirch His dignity, if He exercises
              His providence immediately over these singulars.

              [1] We should attend to the fact that two things are required for
              providence: the ordering and the execution of the order. The first
              of these is accomplished by the cognitive power; as a consequence,
              those who have more perfect knowledge are called orderers of the
              others. “For it is the function of the wise man to order.” But the
              second is done by the operative power. Now, the situations in
              these two functions are contrary to each other. For, the more
              perfect an ordering is, the more does it descend to small details;
              but the execution of small details is appropriate to a lower
              power, proportionate to such an effect. Now, in God the highest
              perfection in regard to both functions is found; in fact, there is
              in Him the most perfect wisdom for ordering and the most perfect
              power for operating. So, He Himself through His wisdom must
              arrange the orders for all things, even the least; on the other
              hand, He may execute the small details by means of other lower
              powers, through which He Himself works, as does a universal and
              higher power through a lower and particular power. It is
              appropriate, then, that there be inferior agents as executors of
              divine providence.

              providence, since God orders all singulars by Himself, as we

              to execute it which is clone by operative power, are both required
              for providence, and rational creatures share in both types of
              power, while the rest of creatures have operative powers only.
              Therefore, all other creatures are ruled by means of rational
              creatures under divine providence.

              [3] Besides, to whomever any power is given by God, the recipient
              is given the power together with an ordination toward the effect
              of that power. For in that way all things are arranged for the
              best, inasmuch as each thing is ordered to all the goods that can
              naturally come from it. Now, the intellectual power by itself is
              capable of ordering and ruling; hence, we see that the operative
              power follows the direction of the intellective power, when they
              are combined in the same subject. In man, for instance, we observe
              that the bodily members are moved at the command of the will. The
              same is evident even if they are in different subjects; for
              instance, those men who excel in operative power must be directed
              by those who excel in intellectual power. Therefore, the rational
              plan of divine providence demands that other creatures be ruled by
              intellectual creatures.

              intellectual power contains universal forms, while each power is
              operative only because of some form proper to the agent.

              directive in relation to the next, and it knows the rational plan
              best. Thus, we see in the case of the arts that one art, which is
              concerned with the end from which the plan for the entire artistic
              production is derived, directs and commands another art which
              makes the product, as the ‘art of navigation does in regard to
              shipbuilding. So, the one that introduces the form commands the
              one that prepares the matter. Instruments, on the other hand,
              which do not know the plan at all, are simply ruled. Since only
              intellectual creatures can know the rational plans for the
              ordering of creatures, it will therefore be their function to rule
              and govern all other creatures.

              Hence, Dionysius, speaking of the highest intellectual substances
              whom he calls the first hierarchy, that is, the sacred
              sovereignty, says: “they are not sanctified by other substances
              but they are immediately ranged about Himself by the Godhead and
              are conducted to the immaterial and invisible beauty, in so far as
              it is permitted, and to the knowable reasons for the divine
              workings.” And thus, through them, he says, “those placed below in
              the ranks of the celestial essences are instructed.” In this way,
              then, the higher understandings receive a perfect knowledge from a
              higher source of knowledge.

              [4] Moreover, in every arrangement of providence this ordering of
              effects is derived from the form of the agent, because the effect
              must proceed from the cause by virtue of a certain likeness. Now,
              the fact that an agent communicates a likeness of his form to his
              effects is due to some end. So, the first principle in
              providential arrangement is the end; the second is the form of the
              agent; and the third is the arrangement of the order of the
              effects. Therefore, the highest function in the order of
              understanding is for the rational nature of the order to be
              considered in relation to the end; and the second most important
              thing is to observe it in relation to the form; while the third
              thing is to know the arrangement of this order in itself, and not
              in a higher source. Thus, the art which considers the end is
              architectonic in relation to the one which considers the form, as
              the art of navigating a ship is to the art of making one; but the
              art which considers the form is architectonic in relation to the
              art which merely considers the orders of the motions that are
              ordered in terms of the form, as the art of shipbuilding orders
              the skill of the workmen.

              [5] So, there is a definite order in those understandings which
              grasp immediately in God Himself a perfect knowledge of the order
              of divine providence. For the highest and first intellects
              perceive the plan of the providential order in the ultimate end
              itself, which is the divine goodness, and some of them do so more
              clearly than others. These are called
              <i>Seraphim</i>, meaning the “ardent” or “burning” ones, because
              the intensity of love or desire, which are functions concerned
              with the end, is customarily symbolized by fire. Thus Dionysius
              says that, as a result of this name of theirs, there is a
              suggestion of “their mobility in relation to the divine, a fervent
              and flexible mobility, and of their leading of lower things to
              God,” as to their end.

              knowledge is made perfect through the form of the knowable object.

              they are “capable of contemplating the first operative power of

              symbolized, according to this text: “You sit on the throne and

              [9] So, also, among the lower spirits who attain, through the
              higher spirits, a perfect knowledge of the divine order which they
              are to carry out there must be some order. In fact, the superior
              ones among them have a more universal power of knowing; hence,
              they obtain knowledge of the order of providence through
              principles and causes that are more universal, whereas the lower
              ones acquire it in more particular causes. For instance, the man
              who could consider the order of all natural things in the
              celestial bodies would be possessed of higher understanding than
              the man who is obliged, for the sake of perfect knowledge, to
              direct his gaze upon the lower bodies. So, those who can perfectly
              know the order of providence in the universal causes, which are
              intermediaries between God, Who is the most universal cause, and
              particular causes are intermediate between the ones who are able
              to consider the plan of this order in God Himself and the ones who
              must consider it in particular causes. These are placed by
              Dionysius in the middle hierarchy, for, just as it is directed by
              the highest, so also does it direct the lowest one, as he says in

              function of those who hold dominion to prescribe what the others
              execute. Hence, Dionysius says that the word
              <i>Domination</i>

              servitude and superior to all subjection.”

              [11] Then, secondly, there is a distribution and multiplication in
              the form of diverse effects on the part of the agent and executor.
              In fact, this is done by the order of
              <i>Virtues</i>, whose name, as Dionysius says in the same place,
              suggests “a strong forcefulness in regard to all Godlike
              operations, one which does not abandon its Godlike movement
              because of any weakening in itself.” It is evident from this that
              the source of universal operation belongs to this order. Hence it
              appears that pertinent to this order is the motion of the
              celestial bodies, from which bodies as universal causes, the
              particular effects in nature follow. So, they are called “the
              powers of the heavens” where it is said: “the powers of the
              heavens shall be moved” (Luke 21:26). Also pertinent to these
              spirits is the execution of divine works which are done outside
              the order of nature, for these are most sublime among the divine
              ministrations. For which reason, Gregory says, “those spirits are
              called Virtues through which miracles are frequently wrought” [
              <i>In Evangelium</i>, homil. 34]. And if there be anything else
              that is universal and primary in the carrying out of divine
              ministrations, it is proper to assign it to this order.

              state or a people, and this seems to belong to the order of
              <i>Principalities</i>. Hence, Dionysius says, in the same chapter,
              that the name Principality suggests “a certain leadership along
              with sacred order.” For this reason, mention is made of “Michael
              the Prince of the Jews,” and of “a Prince of the Persians and a
              Prince of the Greeks” (Dan. 10:13, 20). And so, the arrangement of

              concerning matters pertinent to the administration of their rule

              [15] There is also a type of human good which does not lie in the
              community, but pertains to one. person as such; whose profit is
              not confined to one but is available to many. Examples are the
              things to be believed and practiced by all and sundry, such as
              items of faith, of divine worship, and the like. This pertains to
              the
              <i>Archangels</i>, of whom Gregory says: “they announce the most
              important things.” For instance, we call Gabriel an Archangel,
              because he announced the Incarnation of the Word to the Virgin,
              for the belief of all.

              [16] Still another human good is pertinent to each person
              individually. This type of good belongs to the
              <i>Angels</i>; of whom Gregory says: “they announce less important
              things.” So, they are said to be “guardians of men,” according to
              the Psalm (90:11): “He gave His angels charge over you, to keep
              you in all thy ways.” Hence, Dionysius says that the Archangels
              are intermediate between the Principalities and the Angels, having
              something in common with both: with the Principalities, “in so far
              as they have charge of leading the lower angels,” and this is as
              it should be, for in human affairs private goods should be
              allotted on the basis of the things that are common; and in common
              with the Angels, because “they make announcements to the Angels
              and through the Angels to us,” and the function of the Angels is
              to make known to men “the things that pertain to them, in accord
              with what is proper to each man.” For this reason, too, the last
              order takes the common name for its own special one; that is to
              say, because it has the duty of making announcements immediately
              to us. That is also why the name Archangel is composed of both
              names, for Archangels are called, as it were, Principal Angels.

              Assignat autem et Gregorius aliter caelestium spirituum

              principantur, quasi primi existentes in ministeriorum divinorum

              aliquo speciali casu, praeter communem ordinem, oportet aliqua
              miraculose fieri. Secundum quam rationem satis convenienter cum

            <td>
              [17] However, Gregory assigns a different ordering to the
              celestial spirits; for he numbers the Principalities among the
              intermediate spirits, immediately after the Dominations, while he
              puts the Virtues among the lowest, before the Archangels. But to
              people who consider the matter carefully the two ways of ordering
              them differ but slightly. In fact, according to Gregory,
              Principalities are called, not those put in charge of peoples, but
              “who are given leadership even over good spirits,” as if they held
              first position in the execution of the divine ministrations. He
              says, indeed, that “to be put in the position of leader is to
              stand out as first among the rest.” Now, we said that this
              characteristic, in the previously given arrangement, belongs to
              the order of Virtues. But, according to Gregory, the Virtues are
              those related to certain particular operations, when in some
              special case outside the general order something has to be done
              miraculously. On the basis of this meaning, they are quite
              appropriately put in the same order with the lowest ones.

              Utraque autem ordinatio ex verbis apostoli auctoritatem habere

              Christum, ad dexteram suam in caelestibus, supra omnem principatum

              potestates, omnia per ipsum et in ipso creata sunt. In quo patet

              [18] Moreover, both ways of ordering them can find support in the
              words of the Apostle. For he says: “Sitting Him,” that is, Christ,
              “on His right hand in heavenly places, above all principality, and
              power, and virtue, and dominion” (Eph. 3:20-21). It is clear that
              in the ascending order of this list he placed Powers above
              Principalities, and the Virtues above these, and the Dominations
              over these. Now, this is the order that Dionysius kept. However,
              to the Colossians, in speaking of Christ, he says: “whether
              thrones, or dominations, or principalities, or powers, all things
              were created by Him and in Him” (Col. 1:16). In this text it
              appears that, starting with Thrones and going downward, he placed
              under them the Dominations, under them the Principalities, and
              under these the Powers. Now, this is the order that Gregory
              retained.

              [1] As a matter of fact, human souls bold the lowest rank in
              relation to the other intellectual substances, because, as we said
              above,” at the start of their existence they receive a knowledge
              of divine providence, wherein they know it only in a general sort
              of way. But the soul must be brought to a perfect knowledge of
              this order, in regard to individual details, by starting from the
              things themselves in which the order of divine providence has
              already been established in detail. So, the soul had to have
              bodily organs by which it might draw knowledge from corporeal
              things. Yet, even with such equipment, because of the feebleness
              of its intellectual light, man’s soul is not able to acquire a
              perfect knowledge of the things that are important to man unless
              it be helped by higher spirits, for the divine disposition
              requires this, that lower spirits acquire perfection through the
              higher ones, as we showed above. Nevertheless, since man does
              participate somewhat in intellectual light, brute animals are
              subject to him by the order of divine providence, for they
              participate in no way in understanding. Hence it is said: “Let us
              make man to our own image and likeness,” namely, according as he
              has understanding, “and let him have dominion over the fishes of
              the sea, and the fowls of the air, and the beasts of the earth”

              quod intellectus sensualem virtutem sequitur; sensualis vero
              virtus propter corporis indispositionem trahitur ad corporis
              motum, ut in claudicantibus apparet: ita et in regimine humano
              inordinatio provenit ex eo quod non propter intellectus
              praeminentiam aliquis praeest, sed vel robore corporali dominium
              sibi usurpat, vel propter sensualem affectionem aliquis ad
              regendum praeficitur. Quam quidem inordinationem nec Salomon
              tacet, qui dicit, Eccle. 10-5 est et malum quod vidi sub sole,
              quasi per errorem egrediens a facie principis, positum stultum in

              providentiam non excludit: provenit enim, permissione divina, ex
              defectu inferiorum agentium; sicut et de aliis malis dictum est.
              Neque per huiusmodi inordinationem totaliter naturalis ordo
              pervertitur: nam stultorum dominium infirmum est, nisi sapientum
              consilio roboretur. Unde dicitur Proverb. 20-18: cogitationes
              consiliis roborabuntur et gubernaculis tractanda sunt bella; et
              24-5 vir sapiens fortis est et vir doctus validus et robustus:
              quia cum dispositione initur bellum, et erit salus ubi multa
              consilia. Et quia consilians regit eum qui consilium accipit, et
              quodammodo ei dominatur, dicitur Proverb. 17-2, quod servus

              [6] Now, just as in the activities of one man disorder arises from
              the fact that understanding follows the lead of sensual power,
              while the sensual power is dragged down to the movement of the
              body by virtue of some disorder of the body, as is evident in the
              case of men who limp, so also does disorder arise in a human
              government, as a result of a man getting control, not because of
              the eminence of his understanding, but either because he usurps
              dominion for himself by bodily strength or because someone is set
              up as a ruler on the basis of sensual affection. Nor is Solomon
              silent on this kind of disorder, for he says: “There is an evil
              that I have seen under the sun, as it were by an error proceeding
              from the face of the prince: a fool set in high dignity” (Eccles.
              10:5-6). But disorder of this kind does not exclude divine
              providence; it comes about, indeed, with divine permission, as a
              result of the deficiency of lower agents, just as we explained in
              connection with other evils. Nor is the natural order entirely
              perverted by such disorder, for the dominion of fools is weak
              unless strengthened by the counsel of the wise. Hence it is said
              in Proverbs (20:16): “Designs are strengthened by counsels, and
              wars are to be arranged by governments”; and again: “a wise man is
              strong, and a knowing man stout and valiant: because war is
              managed by due ordering, and there shall be safety when there are
              many counsels” (Prov. 24:5-6). And since he who gives counsel
              rules the man who takes counsel, and in a sense governs him, it is
              said in Proverbs (17:2): “a wise servant shall rule over foolish
              sons.”

              is of place. In fact, water is more formal than earth, air than
              water, fire than air. But the celestial bodies are superior in

              and, therefore, more active. So, they act on the lower bodies;

              [3] Besides, that which is in its nature perfected without
              contrariety is more universal than that which is not perfected in
              its nature without contrariety. Indeed, contrariety arises from
              the various things that determine and contract a genus; hence, in
              the realm of understanding, because it is universal the species of
              contraries are not contraries, for they may co-exist. But
              celestial bodies are perfected without any contrariety in their
              natures, for they are neither light nor heavy, neither hot nor
              cold. However, lower bodies are not perfected in their natures
              without some contrariety. Their motions also demonstrate this, for
              there is nothing contrary to the circular motion of the celestial
              bodies, and, consequently, there can be no violence in regard to
              them; but there are contraries to the motion of lower bodies,
              namely, downward motion as opposed to upward motion. So, celestial
              bodies are possessed of more universal power than lower bodies.
              But universal powers move particular ones, as is evident from what
              we have said. Therefore, celestial bodies move and dispose lower
              bodies.

              they are not moved except by one kind of motion, namely, local

              the motion of the heavens; first of all, of course, because local

              Ex omnibus autem quae ostensa sunt colligere possumus quod,
              quantum ad ordinis excogitationem rebus imponendum, Deus omnia per
              seipsum disponit. Unde super illud Iob 33, quem posuit alium super
              orbem quem fabricatus est? Dicit Gregorius: mundum quippe per
              seipsum regit qui per seipsum condidit. Et Boetius, in III de
              Consol.: Deus per se solum cuncta disponit.

              [1] Now, from all the things that have been pointed out we may
              gather that, as far as the planning of the order to be imposed on
              things is concerned, God disposes everything by Himself. And so,
              in his commentary on the text of Job 34:13 (“What other did He
              appoint over the earth?”) Gregory says: “Indeed, He Who created
              the world by Himself rules it by Himself” [
              <i>Moralia</i> XXIV, 20]. And Boethius says, in
              <i>Consolation of Philosophy</i> III: “God disposes all things of
              Himself alone.”

              Sed quantum ad executionem, inferiora per superiora dispensat.
              Corporalia quidem per spiritualia. Unde Gregorius dicit, in IV
              Dialog.: in hoc mundo visibili nihil nisi per invisibilem
              creaturam disponi potest. Inferiores vero spiritus per superiores.
              Unde dicit Dionysius, IV cap. Cael. Hier., quod caelestes
              essentiae intellectuales primo in seipsas divinam edunt
              illuminationem, et in nos deferunt quae supra nos sunt
              manifestationes. Inferiora etiam corpora per superiora. Unde dicit
              Dionysius, IV cap., de Div. Nom., quod sol generationem visibilium
              corporum confert, et ad vitam ipsam movet, et nutrit et auget et
              perficit, et mundat et renovat.

              [2] But, in regard to the execution, He orders the lower things
              through the higher ones, and the bodily things through the
              spiritual ones. Hence, Gregory says, in his fourth Dialogue: “in
              this visible world nothing can be ordered except through an
              invisible creature.” And the lower spirits are ordered through the
              higher ones. Hence, Dionysius says that “the heavenly intellectual
              essences first give divine illumination to themselves, and then
              bring us manifestations which are above us.” Also, the lower
              bodies are ordered by the higher ones. Hence, Dionysius says that
              “the sun brings generation to visible bodies, and stimulates them
              to life itself, and nourishes, increases and perfects, cleanses
              and renews.”

              De his autem omnibus simul dicit Augustinus, in III de Trin.:
              quemadmodum corpora crassiora et inferiora per subtiliora et
              potentiora quodam ordine reguntur, ita omnia corpora per spiritum
              vitae rationalem; et spiritus rationalis peccator per spiritum
              rationalem iustum.

              [3] Moreover, Augustine speaks on all these points together, in
              the Book III of <i>The Trinity</i>: “As the grosser and lower
              bodies are ruled in a certain order by means of the subtler and
              more powerful ones, so are all bodies by means of the rational
              spirit of life, and also the sinful rational spirit of the sinner
              by the righteous rational spirit.”
