            2177 Above, our Lord consoled his disciples by example and
            encouragement; here he comforts them by his prayer. In this prayer
            he does three things: first, he prays for himself; secondly, for the
            group of the disciples (v 6); thirdly, for all the faithful (v 20).
            He does three things with the first: first, he makes his request;
            secondly, he states the fruit of this request,
            <b>that the Son may glorify you;</b> thirdly, he mentions why his
            request deserves to be heard (v 4). In regard to the first point:
            first, we see the order he followed in his prayer; secondly, the way
            he prayed; thirdly, the words he used.

            <b>When Jesus had spoken these words.</b> This gives us the example
            to help by our prayers those we are teaching by our words, because
            religious teaching has its greatest effect in the hearts of those
            who hear it when it is supported by a prayer which asks for divine
            help: "Pray for us, that the word of the Lord may speed on and
            triumph" (2 Thess 3:1). Again, our sermon should end with a prayer:
            "The sum of our words is: 'he is the all.'"

            2179 The way he prayed is that
            <b>he lifted up his eyes to heaven</b>. There is a difference
            between the prayer of Christ and our own prayer: our prayer arises
            solely from our needs, while the prayer of Christ is more for our
            instruction, for there was no need for him to pray for himself,
            since together with his Father he answers prayers. He instructs us
            here by his words and actions. He teaches us by his actions in
            lifting up his eyes, so that we also will lift our eyes to heaven
            when we pray: "To you I lift up my eyes, O you who are enthroned in
            the heavens!" (Ps 123:1). And not just our eyes, but also our
            actions, by referring them to God: "Let us lift up our hearts and
            hands to God in heaven" (Lam 3:41). He teaches us by his words, for
            he said his prayer publicly, and said, so that those whom he taught
            by teaching he might also teach by praying. We are taught not just
            by the words of Christ, but also by his actions.

            <b>Father, the hour has come.</b> Their effectiveness is caused by
            three things. First, by the love of the one praying. For the Son is
            praying to his Father and petitioning the Father because of his love
            for the Father. So he says, <b>Father,</b> to show us that we should
            pray to God with the affection of his children: "And I thought you
            would call me, My Father, and would not turn from following me" (Jer
            3:19).

            Secundo ex orandi necessitate; unde dicit
            <i>venit hora</i>, passionis, de qua supra II, 4:
            <i>nondum venit hora mea</i>. Hora inquam, non tempus, non dies,
            quia statim capiendus erat et cetera. Nec hora fatalis necessitatis,
            sed suae ordinationis et beneplaciti. Et convenienter rogaturus
            interponit tribulationes, quia in eis maxime Deus exaudit; Ps. CXIX,
            1: <i>ad dominum, cum tribularer, clamavi et exaudivit me</i>; II
            Paral. XX, 12:

            Secondly, his prayer is effective because of the need for this
            prayer; for as he says,
            <b>the hour has come,</b> for his passion, about which he had said
            before: "My hour has not yet come" (2:4). The hour, I say, not the
            season, not the day, because Christ was to be seized right away. Not
            an hour fixed but fate, but chosen by his own plan and good
            pleasure. And it is appropriate that right before he prays he
            mentions his troubles, because God especially hears us when we are
            troubled: "In my troubles I cried to the Lord, and he heard me" [Ps
            120:1]; "Since we do not know what to do, we can only turn our eyes
            to you" [2 Chron 20:12]. Thirdly, his prayer is effective because of
            its content, <b>glorify your Son.</b>

            2181 But the Son of God is Wisdom itself, and this has the greatest
            glory: "Wisdom is radiant and unfading" (Wis 6:13). How then can he
            speak of glory being glorified, especially since he is the splendor
            of the Father (Heb 1:3)? We should say that Christ asked to be
            glorified by the Father in three ways. First, in his passion, and
            this was done by the many miracles which occurred: for the sun was
            darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent, and graves were
            opened. This was referred to before (12:28): "I have glorified it,"
            by the miracles occurring before the passion, "and I will glorify it
            again," during the passion. With this understanding Christ says,
            <b>glorify</b> me in my passion by showing that I am your Son. And
            so the centurion, after seeing the miracles, said: "Truly, this was
            the Son of God" (Mt 27:54).

            Secundo in resurrectione. Anima enim illa sancta semper Deo
            coniuncta fuit habens gloriam ex Dei visione; supra, I, 14:
            <i
              >vidimus gloriam eius, gloriam quasi unigeniti a patre, plenum
              gratiae et veritatis</i

            sed in resurrectione habuit claritatem corporis, de qua Phil. III,
            21:
            <i

            Secondly, Christ sought to be glorified in his resurrection. His
            holy soul was always joined to God and possessed glory from the
            vision of God: "We have beheld his glory, glory as of the only Son
            from the Father" (1:14). From the beginning of his conception, his
            soul was glorified, but in the resurrection he had glory of body
            also, referred to in "Jesus Christ, who will change our lowly body
            to be like his glorious body" (Phil 3:21). Thirdly, he sought to be
            glorified in the knowledge of all people: "Because of her I shall
            have glory among the multitudes and honor in the presence of the
            elders" (Wis 8:10).

            2183 The fruit of the Son's being glorified is that the Father is
            glorified; thus he says,
            <b>that the Son may glorify you.</b>
            When Arius observed that our Lord said,
            <b>glorify your Son,</b>
            he supposed that the Father is greater than the Son. This is true if
            we consider the Son in his human nature: "The Father in greater than
            I" (14:28). Consequently, Christ adds,
            <b>that the Son may glorify you</b>
            (in the knowledge of men) to show he is equal to the Father as
            regards the divine nature. Now glory is renown joined with praise.
            Formerly, God was renowned among the Jews: "In Judah God is known"
            (Ps 76:1); but later, through his Son, he was known throughout the
            entire world. Holy people also increase God's renown by their good
            works: "That they may see your good works and give glory to your
            Father who is in heaven" (Mt 5:16). Above Christ said: "I do not
            seek my own glory; there is One who seeks it and he will be the
            judge" (8:50).

            quaecumque autem non nisi ab aliis moventur, non dicuntur viventia,
            sed mortua: et ideo omnes operationes ad quas operans movet se,

            opera vitae in potentia, et sic dormiens dicitur vivere vita
            sensitiva, quia habet potestatem movendi se, licet actu non
            moveatur; aut quia iam exercet opera vitae in actu, et tunc perfecte
            dicitur aliquid vivere: unde somnus dicitur dimidium vitae. Inter
            opera autem vitae altius est opus intelligentiae, quod est

            intelligere sit vivere, sequitur quod intelligere rem aeternam sit

            Two things need explanation here. First, why he says,
            <b>this is eternal life, that they may know.</b>
            Note that strictly speaking, we call those things living which move
            themselves to their activities. Those things which are only moved by
            other things are not living, but dead. And so all those activities
            to which an active thing moves itself are called living activities,
            for example, to will, to understand, to sense, to grow and to move
            about. Now a thing is said to be alive in two senses. First because
            it has living activities in potency, as one who is asleep is said to
            have sensitive life because it has the power to move itself about,
            although it is not actually doing so. Or, something is said to be
            alive because it is actually engaged in living activities, and then
            it is alive in the full sense. For this reason one who is asleep is
            said to be half alive. Among living activities the highest is the
            activity of the intellect, which is to understand. And thus the
            activity of the intellect is living activity in the highest degree.
            Now just as the sense in act is identified with the sense‑object in
            act, so also the intellect in act is identified with the thing
            understood in act. Since then intellectual understanding is living
            activity, and to understand is to live, it follows that to
            understand an eternal reality is to live with an eternal life. But
            God is an eternal reality, and so to understand and see God is
            eternal life.

            Accordingly our Lord says that eternal life lies in vision, in

            substance. But it is love which moves one to this vision, and is in
            a certain way its fulfillment: for the completion and crown of
            beatitude (happiness) is the delight experienced in the enjoyment of
            God, and this is caused by charity. Still, the substance of
            beatitude consists in vision, seeing: "We shall see him as he is" (1
            Jn 3:2).

            2187 Secondly, we should explain the phrase,
            <b>you the only true God.</b>
            It is clear that Christ was speaking to the Father, so when he says,
            <b>you the only true God,</b>
            it seems that only God the Father is true God. The Arians agree with
            this, for they say that the Son differs by essence from the Father,
            since the Son is a created substance, although he shares in the
            divinity more perfectly and to a greater degree than do all other
            creatures. So much more that the Son is called God, but not the true
            God, because he is not God by nature, which only the Father is.

            Hilary answers this by saying that when we want to know whether a
            certain thing is true, we can determine it from two things: its
            nature and its power.
            <a href="John17.htm#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" id="_ftnref3">[3]</a>
            For true gold is that which has the species of true gold; and we
            determine this if it acts like true gold. Therefore, if we maintain
            that the Son has the true nature of God, because the Son exercises
            the true activities of divinity, it is clear that the Son is true
            God. Now the Son does perform true works of divinity, for we read,
            "Whatever he [the Father] does, that the Son does likewise" (5:19);
            and again he said, "For as the Father has life in himself," which is
            not a participated life, "so he has granted the Son also to have
            life in himself" (5:26); "That we may be in his true Son, Jesus
            Christ. This is the true God and eternal life" [1 Jn 5:20].

            2188 Or, according to Augustine in his work,
            <i>The Trinity,</i>
            he says this to exclude the error of those who claim that it is
            false to say that the Father is God, and the Son is God, and the
            Holy Spirit is God; while it is true to say that the Father and the
            Son and Holy Spirit are one God.
            <a href="John17.htm#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" id="_ftnref5">[5]</a>
            The reason for this opinion was that the Apostle said that "Christ
            [is] the power of God and the Wisdom of God" (1 Cor 1:24). Now it is
            clear that we cannot call anyone God unless he has divine power and
            wisdom. Therefore, since these people held that the Father was
            wisdom, which is the Son, they held further that the Father
            considered without the Son would not be God. And the same applies to
            the Son and the Holy Spirit.

            2190 He states that he merited to be heard for two reasons. First,
            because of his teaching, when he says,
            <b>I glorified you on earth</b>, that is, in the minds of men, by
            manifesting you in my teaching: "Glorify the Lord in teaching" [Is
            24:15]. Secondly, I glorified you by my obedience; thus he said,
            <b>I... having accomplished the work</b>. He uses the past tense in
            place of the future:
            <b>I glorified</b>
            for "I will glorify," and
            <b>accomplished</b>
            in place of "I will accomplish." He does this because these things
            had already begun, and also because the hour of his passion, when
            his work would be accomplished, was very near.

            mutetur in Deum; quia hoc nihil aliud esset quam ipsam naturam

            2191 The reward for Christ's obedience and teaching is glory: "He
            humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even death on a
            cross. Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the
            name which is above every name" (Phil 2:8). And so Christ asks for
            his reward, saying,
            <b>and now, Father, glorify me</b>. According to Augustine this does
            not mean, as some have thought, that the human nature of Christ,
            which was assumed by the Word, would at some time be changed into
            the Word, and the human nature changed into God.
            <a href="John17.htm#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" id="_ftnref6">[6]</a>
            This would be to annihilate the [human] nature of Christ, for when a
            first thing is changed into another in such a way that this other is
            not enriched, the first thing seems to have been annihilated
            [because it produced no effect]. But nothing can be added to enrich
            the divine Word of God.

            Thus, for Augustine,
            <b>and now, Father, glorify me</b>, refers to the predestination of
            Christ as man. Something can be had by us both in the divine
            predestination and in actual fact. Now Christ, in his human nature,
            as all other human beings, was predestined by God the Father: "He
            was predestined Son of God" [Rom 1:4]. With this in mind he says,
            <b>and now</b>
            ‑ after I have glorified you, having accomplished the work which you
            gave me to do ‑
            <b>Father, glorify me</b>
            in your own presence, that is, have me sit at your right hand,
            <b
              >with the glory which I had with you before the world was made,</b
            >
            that is to say, with the glory I had in your predestination: "The
            Lord Jesus... was taken up into heaven, and sat down at the right
            hand of God" (Mk 16:19).

            Vel aliter, secundum Hilarium. Nam gloria hominum est quaedam
            conformitas ad gloriam Dei, quamvis inaequalis; Christus autem
            secundum quod Deus, habuit gloriam ab aeterno apud patrem, scilicet
            divinam, et aequalem patri. Petit ergo hic quod in humanitate
            clarificetur, ut scilicet id quod ex tempore erat caro, et in
            corruptione transformata, gloriam eius, quae sine tempore est,
            claritatis acciperet. Non tamen aequalem, sed similem: ut scilicet
            sicut ab aeterno apud patrem immortalis et ad dexteram consedens
            fuit, ita et secundum quod homo immortalis efficiatur, et ad Dei
            dexteram exaltetur.

            2192 Hilary gives the other interpretation.
            <a href="John17.htm#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" id="_ftnref8">[8]</a>
            The glory of human beings will be in a certain way similar to the
            glory of God, although unequal. Now Christ, as God, had glory with
            the Father from all eternity, a divine glory and equal to that of
            the Father. Accordingly, what he is asking for here is that he be
            glorified in his human nature, that is to say, that what was flesh
            in time and changed by corruption, should receive the glory of that
            brightness which is outside of time. He is asking not for an equal
            glory, but for one which is similar, which is to say that just as
            the Son is immortal and sitting at the right hand of the Father from
            all eternity, so he now become immortal in his human nature and
            exalted to the right hand of God.

            2195 There is a problem with this: Since God the Father was known to
            men before Christ came ‑ "In Judah God is known" (Ps 76:1) ‑ why
            does Christ say, <b>I have manifested your name</b>. I answer that
            the name of God the Father can be known in three ways. In one way,
            as the creator of all things; and this is the way the Gentiles knew
            him: "His invisible nature... has been clearly perceived in the
            things that have been made" (Rom 1:20); "God has shown it to them"
            (Rom 1:19). In another way [the Father can be known] as the only one
            to whom the veneration of <i>latria</i> [adoration] is to be given.
            He was not known to the Gentiles in this way, for they gave the
            veneration of <i>latria</i> to other gods. He was known in this way
            only to the Jews, for they alone had been commanded in their law to
            sacrifice only to the Lord: "Whoever sacrifices to any god, save to
            the Lord only, shall be utterly destroyed" (Ex 22:20). Thirdly, he
            can be known as the Father of an only Son, Jesus Christ. He was not
            known to anyone in this way, but did become so known through his Son
            when the apostles believed that Christ was the Son of God.

            2196 He gives the second reason why he prays for them when he says,
            <b>whom you gave me</b>. First, he mentions that they were given to
            him, from which we can see the reason or way they were given. He
            says, <b>whom you gave me</b>, that is, it is to these that
            <b>I have manifested your name</b>. But did Christ possess them as
            the Father possessed them? Yes he did, insofar as he was God. But he
            says, <b>whom you gave me</b>, that is, to me as man, to listen to
            me and obey me: "No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me
            draws him" (6:44). Those who come to Christ do so through the gift
            and grace of God: "For by grace you have been saved... it is the
            gift of God" (Eph 2:8). You gave them to me out of the world, that
            is, they were chosen from the world: "I chose you out of the world"
            (5:19). For even though the entire world was given to the Son
            insofar as he was God, the apostles were given to the Son to obey.
            He mentions the reason for this giving when he says,
            <b>thine they were</b>. This is like saying: the reason they were
            given is that <b>thine they were</b>, and mine, and predestined from
            eternity to attain by grace a future glory: "He chose us in him
            before the foundation of the world" (Eph 1:4).
            <b>And you gave them to me</b>, that is, by making them adhere to me
            you accomplished in fact what was previously predestined for them
            with me and in me.

            2201 It is stated that knowledge is given in two ways. In the first

            <b>the words which you gave me</b>, in my eternal generation, in
            which the Father gave words to the Son, although the Son himself is
            the Word of the Father. These words are nothing else than the

            of Christ was full with all knowledge of the truth, "full of grace
            and truth" (1:14), that is, with the knowledge of every truth: "In

            2203 According to Augustine the words that follow,
            <b>and they have believed that you did send me</b>, are added to

            <a href="John17.htm#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" id="_ftnref12">[12]</a>
            Knowledge of God is of two kinds: one is perfect, by the clear
            vision of glory; the other is imperfect, through faith: "For now we
            see in a mirror dimly," in the second way, "but then face to face,"
            in the first way (1 Cor 13:12). He says [in the previous sentence],
            <b>they know in truth that I came from you.</b>
            But what kind of knowledge was this? The knowledge of our homeland,
            heaven? No, it was the knowledge of faith. And so he adds,
            <b>and they have believed</b>, indicating that to know this is to
            believe it.
            <b>They have believed</b>
            I say,
            <b>in truth</b>, that is, firmly and strongly: "Do you now believe?"
            that is, firmly. "The hour is coming" when you will believe
            completely (16:31). He uses the past tense, <b>have believed</b>, in
            place of the future tense because of his certainty about the future,
            and because of the infallibility of divine predestination.

            We can harmonize both of these interpretations because all these
            things had already begun, but they still remained to be completed.
            Thus, in reference to what has already begun, he speaks in the past
            tense, but in reference to their completion he speaks in the future,
            because they would be accomplished by the coming of the Holy Spirit.

            The reason why a person's prayer should be heard and why he should
            pray for others is that they belong to him in a special way; for
            general prayers are less likely to be heard. Accordingly he says,

            2207 To the contrary, it seems that he prayed for all: "We have an
            advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous; and he is the
            expiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins
            of the whole world" (1 Jn 2:1); "God our Savior, who desires all men
            to be saved" (1 Tim 2:4). We should say to this that Christ did pray
            for all because his prayer is powerful enough to benefit the entire
            world. Yet it does not produce its effect in all, but only in the
            elect and saints of God. This is because of the obstacles present in
            the worldly.

            they were not yours in such a way that the Son could not have them;

            devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our

            alio modo intelligendum, scilicet quod iam non sit in mundo

            2211 The third reason why he prays for them is his coming physical
            absence; so he says,
            <b>and now I am no more in the world.</b>
            Note that one is said to be "in the world" in two senses. First, by
            clinging to the world by one's affections: "For all that is in the
            world [is] the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the
            pride of life" (1 Jn 2:16). This is not the sense in which Christ
            was no longer in the world, since he never clung to it with his
            affections. He is no longer in the world in another way, that is, by
            his physical presence, for while he had been in the world
            physically, he would soon physically leave it. But they, the
            disciples, are in the world, physically present.
            <b>And I am coming to you,</b>
            as regards my humanity, to share your glory and to be seated at your
            right hand. So it is fitting that I pray for those whom I will soon
            physically leave.

            <b>that they may be one, even as we are one.</b>
            This can be connected with what has gone before in two ways. In the
            first way, it shows the way they will be kept or protected. Then the
            meaning is: They will be kept and protected by being kept as one.
            For a thing is preserved in existence as long as it remains one, and
            it ceases to be when it become divided: "Every kingdom divided
            against itself is laid waste" (Mt 12:23). Accordingly, the Church
            and people can be preserved if they remain one. In another way this
            phrase can state the purpose of their being kept. Then the meaning
            is this: Let them be kept or protected so that they may be one: for
            our entire perfection lies in a unity of spirit: "eager to maintain
            the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace" (Eph 4:3); "Behold,
            how good and pleasant it is when brothers dwell in unity" (Ps

            2214 He adds, <b>even as we are one</b>. This causes a problem. The
            Father and Son are one in essence. And so we also will be one in
            essence? This is not true. The solution is that the perfection of
            each thing is nothing but sharing a likeness to God; for we are good
            to the extent that we resemble God. Accordingly, our unity
            contributes to our perfection to the extent that it shares in the
            unity of God. Now there is a twofold unity in God. There is a unity
            of nature: "I and the Father are one" (10:30); and a unity of love
            in the Father and Son, which is a unity of spirit. Both of these
            unities are found in us, not in an equal way, but with a certain
            likeness. The Father and the Son have the same individual nature
            [literally "numerically the same nature"], while we have the same
            specific nature. Again, they are one by a love which is not a
            participated love and a gift from another; rather, this love
            proceeds from them, for the Father and Son love themselves by the
            Holy Spirit. We are one by participating in a higher love.

            and glory; and it is God who directs us to each of these. Two things
            are involved in reprobation: guilt, and punishment in time. And God
            ordains a person to only one of these, that is, punishment, and even
            this is not for its own sake.

            In the interpretation of Augustine, this present statement is
            related to "that they may be one, even as we are one" (v 11).
            <a href="John17.htm#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" id="_ftnref20">[20]</a>
            In this case, these words (v 13) indicate the fruit of being one. It
            is like saying:
            <b>that they may have my joy</b>, by which they can rejoice in me,
            or, which they have received from me,
            <b>fulfilled in themselves.</b>
            They will obtain this joy by a unity of spirit, which will give them
            the joy of eternal life, which is full joy. And so this joy follows
            upon being one, because unity and peace produce perfect joy: "Those
            who follow plans for peace have joy" [Prv 12:20]; "The fruit of the
            Spirit is joy" (Gal 5:22).

            recedat, qui enim diligit mundum, non est perfecta caritas Dei in

            2223 The result of this is the hatred of the world: because they
            have received your word,
            <b>the world has hated them:</b>
            "Blessed are you when men hate you" (Lk 6:22); "Do not wonder,
            brethren, that the world hates you" (1 Jn 3:13). The reason for this
            hatred is that they have left the world. For the word of God causes
            us to leave the world since it unites us to God, and one cannot be
            joined to God without leaving the world, for one who loves the world
            does not have a perfect love for God. Thus he says,
            <b>because they are not of the world:</b>
            "I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you"
            (15:19). For it is natural for one to love others who are similar:
            "Every beast loves its own kind, and hates the others" [Sir 13:19];
            "The very sight of him is a burden to us," and this is "because his
            manner of life is unlike that of others" (Wis 2:15).

            Another interpretation: In the Old Testament everything set aside
            for divine worship was said to be sanctified: "Then bring near to
            you Aaron your brother, and his sons with him, from among the people
            of Israel to serve me as priests" (Ex 28:1). Accordingly he says,
            <b>sanctify them</b>, that is, set them aside, <b>in truth,</b> that
            is, to preach your truth, because <b>your word</b>, which they are

            He is saying in effect: I have come to preach the truth: "For this I
            was born... to bear witness to the truth" (18:37). And so I have
            sent my disciples to preach the truth: "Go into all the world and
            preach the gospel to the whole creation" (Mk 16:15). Accordingly,
            they have to be sanctified in the truth: "As the Father has sent me,

            considering his human nature. Referring to his divine nature he
            says,
            <b>I sanctify myself</b>, by taking on flesh for them. I do this in
            order that the sanctity or holiness of grace, which is found in my
            humanity, but is also from me as God, might flow from me to them,
            because "from his fullness we have all received" (1:16). "It is like
            the precious oil upon the head," and this head is Christ, who is
            God, "running down upon the beard, upon the beard of Aaron," that
            is, upon his human nature, and from here, "running down on the

            In the Old Testament there were sanctifications of the body:
            "Cleansing of the body imposed until the time comes to set things
            right" [Heb 9:10]. These were figures of a spiritual sanctification,
            and these figures involved the offering of some sacrifice. And so it
            was appropriate that some sacrifice be offered for the
            sanctification of the disciples. This is what he is saying: I
            sanctify myself in order that they might be sanctified, that is, I
            am offering myself as a sacrifice: "who offered himself without
            blemish to God" (Heb 9:14); "So Jesus also suffered outside the gate
            in order to sanctify the people through his own blood" (Heb 13:12).
            He did this in truth, not in a figure, as was done in the Old
            Testament.

            2235 Again, what of others who did not believe through the word of
            the apostles, but through Christ's, like Paul believed: "I did not
            receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came through a
            revelation of Jesus Christ" (Gal 1:12), or like the thief on the
            cross (Lk 23:43). It does not seem that Christ prayed for them. The
            answer, according to Augustine, is that those are said to believe
            through the word of the apostles who not only listened to the
            apostles, but those also who believed through the word [as coming
            from others] which the apostles preached, which is the word of faith
            (Rom 10:8).
            <a href="John17.htm#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" id="_ftnref24">[24]</a>
            The word of faith is called the word of the apostles because they
            were especially commissioned to preach it. The same word was
            divinely revealed to Paul and the thief on the cross. Or, one could
            say that those who were converted directly by and through Christ,
            like Paul and the thief on the cross, and others like these, are
            included in that part of the prayer in which our Lord prayed for his
            disciples. And so our Lord said: "whom you gave me" (17:6), or will

            2238 He says: I am praying
            <b>that they may all be one</b>. As the Platonists say, a thing
            acquires its unity from that from which it acquires its goodness.
            For that is good for a thing which preserves it; and a thing is
            preserved only if it remains one. Thus when our Lord prays that his
            disciples be perfect in goodness, he prays that they be one. Indeed,
            this was accomplished: "Now the company of those who believed were
            of one heart and soul" (Acts 4:32); "Behold, how good and pleasant
            it is when brothers dwell in unity" (Ps 133:1).

            <b>as you, Father, are in me, and I in you</b>, that is, let them be
            united by believing in me and in you: "We, though many, are one body

            Lord, one faith, one baptism" (Eph 4:3). We are one or united in the
            Father and the Son, who are one; for if we were seeking different

            We should say to this that there is a twofold unity of the Father
            and the Son: a unity of essence and of love. In both of these ways
            the Father is in the Son and the Son is in the Father. The
            <b>even as you, Father, are in me, and I in you</b>, can be
            understood of the unity of love, according to Augustine, and then
            the meaning is: <b>even as you, Father, are in me</b>, through love,
            because love, charity, makes one be with God.
            <a href="John17.htm#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" id="_ftnref25">[25]</a>
            It is like saying: as the Father loves the Son and the Son loves the
            Father, so the disciples love the Father and the Son. Then the words
            even as do not imply equality but a remote likeness.

            that of the divine nature, by which the Father and the Son are one.

            <b>that the world may believe</b>
            ? One can answer by giving the mystical sense. Then our Lord is
            praying that all believers be one. Yet all would not believe at the
            same time; some would be the first to believe, and they would
            convert others. So when he says,
            <b>that the world may believe</b>, it refers to those who did not
            believe at first, from the beginning, but when they did believe they
            did become one. And the same applies to those who would believe
            after them, and continuing to the end of the world.

            2248 Referring to the first explanation [the unity from grace],
            since the Father also, as well as the Son, is in them by grace - "We
            will come to him and make our home with him" (14:23) ‑ why does he
            say,
            <b>I in them</b>, without mentioning the Father? According to
            Augustine, he does this because they have access to the Father
            through the Son: "We have peace with God through our Lord Jesus
            Christ. Through him we have obtained access" (Rom 5:1); and it does
            not mean that the Son is in them without the Father. Or, according
            to Chrysostom, above Christ said, "We will come to him" (14:23), to
            indicate that there is a plurality of divine persons, contrary to
            Sabellius; but here he says, <b>I in them</b>, to indicate the
            equality of the Father and the Son, contrary to Arius. We can
            understand from this that it is enough for the faithful if the Son
            alone dwells in them.

            all men to be saved" (1 Tim 2:4). But his will for a punishing
            justice is not fundamental, as it presupposes sin: "God does not
            delight in the destruction of men" [Wis 1:13]; and in Ezekiel
            [18:32] we read: "I do not desire the death of the sinner,"

            saves men: "He has mercy upon whomever he wills" (Rom 9:18). If we
            refer this to Christ's human will, it indicates merit, for Christ's
            human will merits our salvation. For if the wills of the just, who
            are the members of Christ, have merit entitling them to be heard ‑
            "Ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you" (15:7) ‑ much
            more so does the human will of Christ, who is the head of all the
            saints.

            to ascend and to be in heaven: "I am ascending to my Father and your
            Father" (20:17). Then the meaning is:
            <b>I desire that they also,</b> the faithful,
            <b>may be with me,</b> in heaven, <b>where I am</b> about to ascend:
            "Wherever the body is, there the eagles," that is, the saints, "will
            be gathered together" (Mt 24:28). For this is what Christ promised:
            "Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven" (Mt 5:12).

            As to the second objection, when we read that "No one has ascended
            into heaven but he who descended from heaven" (3:13), we should
            understand that the Son is in heaven by reason of his divinity, and
            descended by taking on a human nature, and then ascended by reason
            of his human nature, now glorified. But now we have been made one
            with him. Thus, he alone comes, in himself, by descending from
            heaven, and he alone returns there, now one with us, by ascending
            into heaven. This is the observation of Gregory, (<i>Morals</i>,
            28).

            in a beatifying vision: "When he appears we shall be like him, for
            we shall see him as he is" (1 Jn 3:2). This can be understood to
            refer to the glory of his human nature after the resurrection ‑ "He
            will change our lowly body to be like his glorious body" (Phil 3:21)
            ‑ or to the glory of his divine nature, for he is the radiance of
            the Father's glory and the image of his substance, as we see from
            Hebrews (1:3); "The radiance of eternal light" [Wis 7:26]. The
            saints in glory will see both of these glories. We read about the
            first [the glory of Christ's human nature]: "Your eyes will see the
            king in his beauty" (Is 33:17). The wicked will see this glory only
            at the judgment: "And then they will see the Son of man coming in a
            cloud with power and majesty" [Lk 21:27]; and Mark adds "and glory"
            (Mk 13:26). But the sight of this glory will be taken away from them
            after the judgment: "Let the wicked be taken away so they cannot see
            the glory of the Lord" [Is 26:10], as we read in one version. Yet
            the saints will see the second glory [that of the divine nature]
            forever: "In your light," that is, of grace, "do we see light," that
            is, of glory, which the wicked will never see.

            Christ has in his human nature, "predestined the Son of God in
            power" [Rom 1:4]. So the meaning is this: I say that you have given

            If we refer this to Christ as God, then the

            indicates a sign. For then the Father did not give because he loved:
            for when we say the Father gave to the Son we are referring to the
            eternal generation of the Son. If love is taken essentially, it
            indicates the divine will; if it is taken notionally, it indicates
            the Holy Spirit. Now it was by nature that the Father gave radiance
            to the Son, not by his will, because the Father begot the Son by
            nature. And so he also did not give to the Son because he brought
            forth the Holy Spirit.

            me through their word" (17:20). He also excluded the world and
            unbelievers when he said, "I am praying for them; I am not praying
            for the world" (17:9). Now he gives the reason for this: first, he
            mentions the failure of the world; secondly, the progress of the

            world his invisible nature, namely, his eternal power and deity, has
            been clearly perceived in the things that have been made." We should
            say to this that knowledge is of two kinds: one is speculative, and
            the other affective. Through neither of these ways did the world
            know God completely. Although some Gentiles knew God as having some
            of those attributes which are knowable by reason, they did not know
            God as the Father of an only begotten and consubstantial Son ‑ and

            Again, if they did have some speculative knowledge of God, this was
            mixed with many errors: some denied his providence over all things;
            others said he was the soul of the world; still others worshipped
            other gods along with him. For this reason they are said not to know
            God. Composite things can be known in part, and unknown in part,
            while simple things are unknown if they are not known in their
            entirety. Thus, even though some erred only slightly in their
            knowledge of God, they are said to be entirely ignorant of him.
            Consequently, since these people did not know the special excellence
            of God, they are said not to know him: "For although they knew God
            they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became
            futile in their thinking and their senseless minds were darkened"
            (Rom 1:21); "Nor did they recognize the craftsman while paying heed
            to his works" (Wis 13:1).

            quod pater diligit filium, ut ostenditur per claritatem quam dedit
            ei: consequens ergo est ut diligat omnes in quibus est filius, qui
            est in eis, inquantum habent veritatis cognitionem. Et sic est
            sensus: <i>ego faciam eis notum nomen tuum</i>; et per hoc quod
            cognoscunt te, ego verbum tuum ero in eis; et per hoc quod in eis
            sum, <i>dilectio, qua dilexisti me, in ipsis sit</i>, idest, ad eos
            derivetur, et diligas eos sicut me dilexisti.

            2270 The fruit of this knowledge is
            <b
              >that the love with which you have loved me may be in them, and I
              in them.</b
            >
            This can be explained in two ways. The first and better way is that
            since the Father loves the Son, as is shown by the glory he gave
            him, consequently, he loves all those in whom the Son is present ‑
            and the Son is in them insofar as they have knowledge of the truth.
            So the meaning is this: I will make your name known to them; and by
            the fact that they know you, I, your Word, will be in them; and by
            the fact that I am in them,
            <b>the love with which you love me may be in them,</b>
            that is, will be given to them, and you will love them as you have
            loved me.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr style="text-align: justify" valign="top">
          <td>
            Vel aliter:
            <i>ut dilectio qua dilexisti me</i>, idest, sicut tu me dilexisti,
            ita ipsi participando spiritum sanctum, diligant: et per hoc ergo
            ero in ipsis sicut Deus in templo, et ipsi in me, sicut membra in
            capite; I Io. IV, v. 16:
            <i>qui manet in caritate, in Deo manet, et Deus in eo</i>.
          </td>
          <td>
            Here is the other explanation:
            <b>that the love with which you have loved me may be in them,</b>
            that is, as you have loved me, so they, by sharing in the Holy
            Spirit, may love. And by that fact I will be in them as God in a
            temple, and they in me, as members of the head: "He who abides in
            love abides in God, and God abides in him" (1 Jn 4:16).
