var WPFootnote1 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>St. Thomas&#8217; text had &#8220;convivificavit&#8221; inserted in verse 1 after &#8220;vos&#8221;so that it read, similar to verse 5, &#8220;And he has\
 restored you to life when you were dead...&#8221; This reading corresponds to a few Vulgate codices and was adopted in\
 the edition of Pope Sixtus V, although it is now recognized as an interploation.<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote2 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>St. Thomas notes in his <i>Commentary on St. John&#8217;s Gospel. <\/i>Ch. 1, Lect. 5, that &#8220;world&#8221; has at least three different\
 meanings in Scripture. Positively, it may refer to the world as created and ruled by God; or, as it is loved by God\
 and brought to perfection through Christ&#8217;s redemption. Negatively, it refers to the world as perverted by sin and\
 hostile to God, which is the meaning St. Paul gives it here. For the way in which these three are interrelated, and how\
 the positive triumphs over the negative, cf. &#8220;Christian Humanism and St. John&#8217;s Theology of Life,&#8221; <i>Review for\
 Religious, <\/i>March, 1964.<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote3 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>Following a common Biblical approach, Aquinas equates idol worship with slavery to the devil, cf. Ps 95:5;\
 105:33; Deut. 32:17; Bar. 4:3; 1 Cor. 10:20.<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote4 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>The &#8220;lower bodies&#8221; are identical with the &#8220;corruptible and mutable causes&#8221; mentioned in note 35 above. Aquinas\
 never went into a detailed speculation about which ranks of angels governed which parts of the universe. In a general\
 way, it could be said that the Middle Hierarchy would govern the celestial bodies&#8212;the nine celestial spheres (cf.\
 Appendix)&#8212;and the Lower Hierarchy the terrestrial sphere made up of the four elements of fire, water, earth and\
 air; cf. <i>S.T.<\/i> I, 63, 7c. Yet St. Thomas only mentions this as an opinion of others and does not seem attracted to it;\
 he reminds us that the lowest possible angel transcends the whole of material creation by reason of its pure\
 spirituality, <i>ibid.<\/i>, 110, 1 ad 3.<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote5 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>St. John Damascene (c. 677-750), a priest and Doctor of the Church. The work referred to here is his celebrated\
 <i>De Fide Orthodoxa<\/i>, 11, 4 (P.G. 94, 873-76).<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote6 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>This is the opinion of St. Gregory the Great in his <i>Homilia 34 in Evangelia, <\/i>P.L. 76, 1250. For a further discussion\
 of this cf. <i>S.T.<\/i> I, 63, 7.<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote7 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>St. Thomas is borrowing this observation from Peter Lombard&#8217;s <i>Collectanea, <\/i>P.L. 192, Col 179. The Greek has\
 the genitive <i>tou pneumatos, <\/i>&#8220;of the spirit.&#8221;<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote8 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>In these few sentences St. Thomas hints at his thought on concupiscence and original sin. It is not that these desires\
 are sinful, for if the delight resulting from obtaining what we desire is not evil (<i>S.T.<\/i> I, 1-4), neither is the desire evil\
 (<i>ibid., <\/i>30, 2c). If man had not sinned his enjoyment of sensible goods would be even more intense than now; to be\
 ruled by reason is not to become &#8220;angelized,&#8221; cf. I, 98, 2 ad 3. Yet, due to the lack of original justice (I-II, 82, 3),\
 these desires can become causes of sin (I-II, 77). This is taking &#8220;concupiscentia&#8221; in the strictly theological sense,\
 cf. K. Ralmer, &#8220;The Theological Concept of Concupiscentia,&#8221; <i>Theological Investigations <\/i>(Baltimore: Helicon,\
 1960), pp. 360-69. By &#8220;natural concupiscences&#8221; St. Thomas means that men share them with all animals, whereas\
 the &#8220;concupiscence of knowledge,&#8221; or of reason, is proper to man only, cf. <i>S.T.<\/i> I-II, 30, 3c.<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote9 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>This same quotation is ascribed to St. Gregory in Lecture 5 of Ch. 3. 1 have not been able to locate it in his\
 writings. It occurs word for word in the <i>Exultet <\/i>of the Easter Vigil Liturgy&#8212;&#8220;O inaestimabilis dilectio caritatis: ut\
 servum. redimeres, filium tradidisti.&#8221; Liturgists seem to agree that the <i>Exultet, <\/i>or &#8220;Benedictio Cerei Gallicana,&#8221; owes\
 its main inspiration to the fourth or fifth century; and it has been attributed both to St. Ambrose and Augustine. The\
 earliest records we have of it are in the Gelasian Sacramentaries of the eighth century, cf. Schmidt, S.J., <i>Hebdomada\
 Sancta<\/i>, Vol. 2 (Rome: Herder, 1957) pp. 639-45. Possibly St. Thomas was under the impression that St. Gregory\
 had composed the <i>Exultet. <\/i>St. Thomas&#8217; attribution of the quotation to St. Gregory more than likely springs from the\
 common medieval custom of accepting Gregory as the author of the texts in the missal.<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote10 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>Cf. note 11 above. For St. Thomas &#8220;salus&#8221; is a divine action directed at the whole of man&#8217;s being. V. White, O.P.,\
 has pointed out how &#8220;holiness (<i>sanctitas<\/i>), health (<i>sanitas<\/i>),<i> <\/i>completeness (<i>perfectio<\/i>), and wholeness (<i>integritas<\/i>)<i> <\/i>are,\
 in principle, virtually synonymous&#8221; for Aquinas; cf. his Soul <i>and Psyche <\/i>(London: Collins &amp; Harvill, 1960), pp. 184-86. Notice how St. Thomas regularly speaks of &#8220;human salvation&#8221; or the &#8220;salvation of man&#8221; rather than the\
 &#8220;salvation of souls.&#8221;<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote11 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>The act of faith is essentially an assent to God revealing himself to man (<i>S.T.<\/i> II-II, 1, 1c). The individual articles\
 of faith are only the material determinations of this essential acceptance of Divinity revealing himself. St. Thomas\
 brings out this interpersonal character of faith: &#8220;Everyone who believes assents to someone&#8217;s words; and thus, in any\
 form of belief, it seems that it is the person to whose words the assent is given, who is of principal importance and,\
 as it were, the end; while the individual truths through which one assents to that person are secondary&#8221; (<i>ibid.<\/i>, 11,\
 1c). Cf. J. Mouroux, <i>I Believe, The Personal Structure <\/i>of <i>Faith <\/i>(New York: Sheed &amp; Ward, 1959).<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote12 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>Cf. note 7 above. The &#8220;habitus&#8221; are creative powers by which men can perform different types of actions. For\
 instance, the ability to solve complex mathematical problems is only acquired through training and practice; we\
 cannot perform the requisite mental acts until we are conditioned by a learning process. The creative power which\
 results from this conditioning is obviously distinct from the individual acts of solving mathematical problems, yet\
 it is nonetheless real since if it did not exist we should have to go through the whole learning process before each\
 act. Unlike such acquired powers, the supernatural virtues are infused by God, cf. <i>S.T.<\/i> I-II, 51, 4; 63, 4.<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote13 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>St. Thomas is using &#8220;sacramenta&#8221; here in the Patristic sense which does not limit it to the seven sacraments. All\
 sanctifying mysteries are &#8220;Sacraments.&#8221; Christ, as the incarnation of God, is thus <i>the <\/i>sacrament of the Divine\
 redemptive presence in the world of man; the Church&#8212;or as St. Thomas refers to it in discussing the second\
 sacrament of which the pagans were deprived, the &#8220;society of the saints&#8221;&#8212;is the continuation of this sacramental\
 presence. Aquinas probably owed this terminology to Hugh of St. Victor&#8217;s <i>De Sacramentis, <\/i>P.L. 176, 181 ff. Like\
 Hugh, he discussed the &#8220;sacraments of nature&#8221; (<i>In IV Sent., <\/i>d. 1, q. 2, a. 6, sol. 3) which were even capable of\
 symbolizing Christ (<i>S.T.<\/i> I-II, 103, 1; cf. note 154 below). The Old Law also had its sacraments <i>(S.C.G. <\/i>IV, 57; <i>S.T.\
 <\/i>I-II, 101, 4; 102, 5; 103; 111, 61, 3 ad 2). On &#8220;sacramentum&#8221; as aholy secret or sanctifying mystery, cf. <i>S.T.<\/i> III, 60,\
 1 ad 2; and A. M. Roguet, <i>O.P., les Sacrements <\/i>(Paris: Descl&eacute;e et Cie, 1945) pp. 257-M. A broader usage of the term\
 &#8220;sacrament&#8221; is being restored to contemporary theology, cf. E. Schillebeeckx, O.P., <i>Christ: The Sacrament of the\
 Encounter with God <\/i>(New York: Sheed &amp; Ward, 1963).<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote14 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>The Douay-Rheims translation of the singular &#8220;testament&#8221; corresponds to neither the Vulgate nor the original\
 Greek.<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote15 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>&#8220;Land of distortion&#8221; translates &#8220;regio dissimilitudinIs&#8221; This expression originated in Plato (cf. <i>Politicus, <\/i>273 d),\
 designating the region of becoming between pure being and absolute non-being. St. Augustine used it in his\
 <i>Confessions <\/i>VII, 10 and it enjoyed wide vogue in the Middle Ages where it was associated with the &#8220;terra longinqua&#8221;\
 of the prodigal son in Lk 15:13. In similar fashion St. Thomas here links it with the &#8220;de longe venerunt&#8221; of Mk. 8:3.\
 The Christian concept of sin distorting man&#8217;s likeness to God is what it mainly implies. Cf. E. Gilson, <i>The Mystical\
 Theology of St. Bernard <\/i>(New York: Sheed &amp; Ward, 1940) pp. 33-59; and note 43 on pp. 224-25. Also P. Courcelle,\

<\/span>'

var WPFootnote16 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>The Douay-Rheims translates &#8220;paries&#8221; as &#8220;wall,&#8221; but St. Thomas distinguishes between &#8220;paries&#8221; and &#8220;murus.&#8221; The\
 former is a temporary partition&#8212;I have translated it as &#8220;barrier&#8221;&#8212;whereas the latter is permanent and used often\
 in reference to city walls.<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote17 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>St. Augustine&#8217;s <i>De Gratia Christi et Peccato Originali<\/i>, 2, 24&#8211;25 (P.L. 44, Col 398-400); also <i>Contra Adamantum\
 Manich. Discip. <\/i>17, (P.L. 42, Col 157-62). In St. Thomas&#8217; view of salvation-history the Old Law had an embryonic\
 relationship to the New: &#8220;As the effect is in its cause, or the perfect is in its less perfect beginnings-just as the whole\
 tree is contained in the seed-so is the New Law contained in the Old Law.&#8221; <i>S.T. <\/i>I-II, 107, 3. This is a corollary of\
 the general pattern of God&#8217;s salvific revelation to man, it is gradual in order for man to better assimilate. it (<i>ibid.<\/i>,\
 99, 6). Thus the New Covenant fulfills the Old by realizing its deepest potentialities (<i>ibid.<\/i>, 107, 2); they both have\
 the same goal while they differ as less perfect and more perfect in their methods of attaining that goal (<i>ibid.<\/i>, 107,\
 1). This is why Aquinas characterized the Old Law as one of Fear and the New as one of Love. For a genuine\
 supernatural love could only be offered to God by God himself become man and communicating his love, the Holy\
 Spirit, to other men (<i>S.T.<\/i> II-II, 24, 2c; III, 8, 6c). Hence Christ is the head of all mankind (<i>ibid.<\/i>, III, 8, 3) and those\
 who observed God&#8217;s commands out of supernatural love in the Old Testament really belonged to the New, while\
 those in the New Covenant who still practice virtue out of fear of punishment are acting as though they were under\
 the Old Law (<i>ibid.<\/i>, I-II, 107, 1 ad 2). For a comparison of the Old and New Covenants in an eschatological\
 perspective, cf. <i>ibid.<\/i>, 103, 3.<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote18 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>The ceremonial precepts, in Aquinas&#8217; view, served two purposes. One was to provide Israel with a suitable religious\
 cult of Yahweh, the other was to symbolize the mystery of Christ. Thomas (in <i>S.T.<\/i> I-II, 102, 2) refers to St. Jerome&#8217;s\
 comment on Old Testament prophecy to show how this symbolic character must be present in the actual rites\
 themselves and not fanciful speculations arbitrarily tacked on to them later. Jerome&#8217;s observation was: &#8220;During the\
 course of the Old Testament period the prophets promised much about the coming of Christ and the salvation of the\
 Gentiles; yet they did this precisely by not neglecting the age in which they lived. As though they would not instruct\
 the assembled people about the matters then confronting them, but would rather seem to wildly speculate about\
 uncertain and future happenings.&#8221; (Comm. <i>super Osee<\/i>, 1, P.L. <i>25, 824). <\/i>In the remaining articles of question 102\
 St. Thomas applies the principles discussed here, and in note 56 above, with too much attention to minor\
 details&#8212;closer to Latin patristic methods than those of modem scholars. Nevertheless, the latter base their theories\
 on principles similar to those St. Thomas adopted, cf. C. Charlier, <i>The Christian Approach to the Bible, <\/i>(Maryland:\
 Newman, 1959) pp. 15984,255-73.<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote19 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>The text is somewhat ambiguous here: inter Judaeos et Gentiles: quia isti volebant legem servare, illi vero\
 minime...&#8221; According to literal usage, &#8220;isti&#8221; and &#8220;illi&#8221; would make the passage read: &#8220;between the Jews and Gentiles,\
 the latter wanting to observe the law and the former least (wanting it).&#8221; If Thomas was asserting that the Gentiles\
 were eager to observe the law, then either the Jews were not at all eager to observe it themselves or they were not\
 eager to let the Gentiles do so. Old Testament history, however, offers so few instances of these phenomena&#8212;not\
 to mention St. Paul&#8217;s struggles with the judaizing Christians in the New&#8212;that I have taken &#8220;isti&#8221; to refer to the Jews\
 and &#8220;illi&#8221; to the Gentiles.<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote20 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>The Douay-Rheims, closer to the meaning of the Greek, translates the &#8220;decretis&#8221; of the Vulgate as &#8220;in the decrees,&#8221;\
 referring to the Old Testament. St. Thomas saw it instead as an ablative of means, &#8220;by the decrees,&#8221; referring to the\
 commands of the New Law abrogating the Old. The following text from Leviticus is used to designate the three\
 divinely originating laws operative in human history and society, cf. <i>S.T.<\/i> I-II, 91; 93; 98; 106. The temporal\
 adjectives of the scriptural text have the following correlatives:<\/p>\

<p>The basic principles of the natural law were changed by neither the Old nor the New Laws (<i>ibid.<\/i>, I-II, 94, 5). Since\
 the moral precepts, e.g., the ten commandments, are closely related to the natural law they too are still in force (<i>ibid.,\
 <\/i>100, 1). The New Law of the Gospel is primarily a spiritual law, existing by the grace of the Holy Spirit in the hearts\
 of the faithful; the written expression of this law is only a secondary characteristic (<i>ibid.<\/i>, 106, 1-2).<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote21 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>The Gloss is the Lombard&#8217;s <i>Collectanea, <\/i>P.L. 192, Col 184. St. Thomas took his interpretation of &#8220;decretis&#8221; as\

<\/span>'

var WPFootnote22 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>Cf. Augustine&#8217;s commentary on Ps 124, n. 10 (P.L. 37, Col 1655--56). In discussing the peace which results from\
 true Christian love, St. Thomas is careful to point out that it consists in a harmony of wills in matters pertaining to\
 salvation, and not necessarily in a harmony of intellectual opinions, cf. <i>S.T. <\/i>II-II, 29, 1; 3 ad 2; 37, 1; 38, 1. St.\
 Augustine&#8217;s sharp difference of opinion with St. Jerome indicates that he understood the distinction clearly, cf. <i>St.\
 Augustine&#8217;s Letters <\/i>(translated by W. Parsons, S.N.D., F.C., 1951) Vol. 1, pp. 93 ff., 172 ff., 390 ff. A short history\
 of the dispute is given in <i>The Letters of St. Jerome <\/i>(translated by C. Mierow, A.C.W. 1963) Vol. 1, pp. 13-16; and\

var WPFootnote23 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>I have translated &#8220;collegium fidelium&#8221; as &#8220;the community of<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<\/span>the faithful&#8221;: although the collegiality of the faithful\
 certainly carries different connotations than the community of the faithful. Throughout these paragraphs community\
 translates <i>collegium. <\/i>The political community and the domestic community are two distinct domains in human\
 intersubjective experience. Each has its own type of authority, cf. In <i>Libros Politicorum Aristotelis Expositio <\/i>(Turin:\
 Marietti, 1951) <i>p. 27, <\/i>n. <i>90; <\/i>and each requires its own specialization of the virtue of prudence, cf. <i>S.T.<\/i> II-II, 50, 2\

var WPFootnote24 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>In both the Piana-Cai and the Parma editions this is given as a direct quotation. It seems to come from <i>The City of\
 God<\/i>, XIV, 28 (P.L. 41, 436). But there it reads: &#8220;Two cities have been formed by two loves: the earthly by the love\
 of self, even to the contempt of God; the heavenly by the love of God, even to the contempt of self.&#8221; (translated by\
 M. Dodds, New York: Modern Library, 1950), p. 477. It is most likely that St. Thomas picked up his &#8220;Jerusalem-Babylon&#8221; designations from a sentence in Peter Lombard&#8217;s commentary on this same verse in Ephesians (P.L. 192,\
 Col 186): &#8220;Two loves have made the whole world into two cities, the love of God has formed Jerusalem, and earthly\
 love Babylon.&#8221;<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote25 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>The Parma edition notes that a quotation from Proverbs 31:21 has been inserted at this point: &#8220;For all her domestics\
 are clothed with double garments.&#8221; The Piana-Cai includes it in the text without comment. If St. Thomas actually\
 mentioned the quote in his lecture it may have been within a context which pointed out how love of Cod to contempt\
 of self paradoxically leads to the highest realization of self; the city of God&#8217;s love takes good care of its domestics.\
 This is the analysis St. Bernard made of the growth in man&#8217;s love for God. He begins by loving God for man&#8217;s sake\
 and, in the fourth and highest stage, ends by loving himself for God&#8217;s sake, cf. <i>Saint Bernard on the Love of God,\
 <\/i>a translation of <i>De Diligendo Deo <\/i>(P.L. 182, 973 ff.), by T. Connolly, S.J. (Maryland: Newman, 1951) pp. 43-46.\

var WPFootnote26 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>Primary and secondary should be understood here in the light of primary and secondary causality. The secondary\
 causes are totally dependent on God, the primary and universal cause, <i>Cf. S.T.<\/i> I, 19, 6; 21, 4; 65, 3; 105, 6. But this\
 in no way dispenses from the necessity and real causal influence of the secondary causes, <i>ibid., <\/i>22, 3; 103, 6; 116,\
 2. St. Thomas hints, in this way, at the intimate relationship between Christ and the scriptures.<\/p>\
<\/span>'

var WPFootnote27 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p><i>&#160;<\/i>Aquinas interprets Mt 16:18 as primarily referring to Peter&#8217;s confession of Christ&#8217;s divinity: &#8220;&#8216;Upon this rock,&#8217;\
 namely, your confession, &#8216;I will build my Church.&#8217;&#8221; (<i>S.T.<\/i> II-II, 174, 6c). And this is the meaning he gives the text\
 here. For the New Testament affirmation of the Petrine teaching office he more realistically turns to Lk 22:32, &#8220;But\
 I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not; and thou, being once converted, confirm thy brethren.&#8221; (<i>ibid., <\/i>II-II, 1,\
 10c). Yet St. Thomas was aware of other possibilities, cf. his <i>Commentary on St. Matthew&#8217;s Gospel, <\/i>Ch. 16, Lect.\

var WPFootnote28 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>In contemporary terms, these four stages would be: laying the foundation, erecting the supporting superstructure,\

XVIII, 13: <i>delicta quis intelligit</i>, etc., et peccatis quantum ad commissa. <i>In quibus aliquando ambulastis</i>, quod ideo dicit, ut multitudinem peccatorum exaggeret. Nam aliqui si ad horam mortui sunt in peccatis et in delictis, cessant tamen aliquando, et peccare desistunt; sed isti, de malo in peius procedentes et ambulantes, proficiebant. Simile habetur Phil. III, 18: <i>multi enim ambulant, quos saepe dicebam vobis, nunc autem et flens dico</i>, et cetera. Ier. II, 5: <i>ambulaverunt post vanitatem suam, et vani facti sunt</i>.
          <td>He demonstrates the need for such a blessing when he states <span style="font-weight: bold">when you were dead in your offenses and sins</span> where he describes so well their sin. First of all, [he depicts] the multitude [of their sins] at <span style="font-weight: bold">And you, when you were dead</span> with the worst type of death, spiritual death. “Evil will slay the wicked [Vul: The death of the wicked is very evil]” (Ps 34:22). Sin is termed a death because by it man is separated from God who is life: I am the way, and the truth, and the life” (Jn 14:6). <span style="font-weight: bold">Dead</span> I say, <span style="font-weight: bold">in your offenses and sins</span> —behold the great number! For offenses are the omissions [of what they should have done]—“Who can discover errors?” (Ps 19:13)—while sins are [the evil they] committed. <span style="font-weight: bold">Wherein in time past you walked</span> is added to exaggerate the great number of sins. For if some are dead in offenses and sins at one time, they nonetheless cease at another time and leave off sinning; but these keep up their pace in going from bad to worse. Philippians 3 (18) contains a similar idea: “For many, as I have often told you and now tell you with tears, conduct themselves as enemies of the cross of Christ.” They “have gone after worthlessness and become worthless” (Jer 2:5).

He exerts a power, not by the fact that he has it naturally, since he is neither the Lord nor creator by nature, but to the degree that he dominates over men who subject themselves to him by sinning. “Now shall the prince of this world be cast out” (Jn 12:31); “for the prince of this world is coming; he has no power over me” (Jn 14:30).

Constat autem totam creaturam corporalem administrari a Deo, ministerio Angelorum. Et haec est opinio Ioannis Damasceni, scilicet quod primus eorum qui ceciderunt, praeerat ordini terrestrium, quod forte sumptum est ex dicto Platonis, qui ponebat quasdam substantias caelestes seu mundanas.

Unde Iudas in sua canonica dicit: <i>Angelos vero qui non servaverunt suum principatum, sed dereliquerunt suum domicilium, in iudicium Dei magni, vinculis aeternis sub caligine reservavit</i>. Ratio autem quare non statim post eorum casum retrusi sunt in Infernum, sed dimittuntur in aere, est, quia Deus noluit quod ipsis peccantibus eorum creatio totaliter frustraretur, et ideo dedit eos hominibus in exercitium quo bonis praepararent coronam, malis autem aeternam mortem. Et quia usque ad diem iudicii est nobis tempus belli et merendi, ideo usque tunc in aere permanebunt; post diem vero iudicii retrudentur in Infernum.

          <td>Tertio quantum ad operationem, ibi, cum dicit <i>qui nunc operatur in filios diffidentiae</i>, id est in illos qui a se repellunt fructum passionis Christi, qui erant filii diffidentiae. Vel quia de aeternis non habent fidem, nec spem salutis per Christum: et in talibus princeps potestatis aeris huius libere operatur, ducens eos quo vult: de quibus infra IV, 19, dicitur: <i>qui desperantes semetipsos tradiderunt impudicitiae, in operationem immunditiae</i>. Vel <i>diffidentiae</i>, id est de quibus eis est diffidendum, id est qui ex malitia peccant, in quibus princeps huius mundi etiam operatur ad nutum.

          <td>Thirdly, [he describes] their activity when be states <span style="font-weight: bold">that now works on the children of despair</span>. They are the children of despair who reject the fruit of Christ’s passion. Or, those who have no faith in eternal realities nor hope in salvation through Christ. In these the prince of the power of this air freely <span style="font-weight: bold">works</span>, leading them wherever he wishes. Later it is said of them: “They have become callous [Vul: despairing] and have given themselves up to licentiousness, greedy to practice every kind of uncleanness” (Eph 4:19). Perhaps, <span style="font-weight: bold">of despair</span> means those of whom we should despair because they sin out of malice; the prince of this world doing whatever he pleases in them. For no one should despair of those who sin from ignorance or weakness, nor does that prince do whatever he wants with them.

          <td>Sed contra. De nemine est desperandum quamdiu vivit. Respondeo. Dicendum est quod de aliquo potest esse duplex spes. Una ex parte hominis, alia ex parte divinae gratiae. Et sic de aliquo potest desperari ex parte sua, de quo tamen desperandum non est ex parte Dei, sicut desperandum erat de Lazaro iacente in sepulcro, quod resurgeret ex parte sua, de quo tamen desperandum non erat ex parte Dei, a quo resuscitatus est. De illis ergo, qui ex malitia sunt multum in peccatis demersi, si attendatur eorum virtus, desperari potest, Ps. LXVIII, 3: <i>infixus sum in limo profundi, et non est substantia</i>, non tamen si attendatur virtus divina. De istis autem filiis diffidentiae dicitur infra V, 6: <i>nemo vos seducat inanibus verbis. Propter hoc enim venit ira Dei in filios diffidentiae</i>.
          <td>On the contrary, however, one should never despair of anyone else as long as he lives. I reply. Our hope in someone can be twofold. On the one hand, it can be in the man, and on the other, in divine grace. Thus someone may be despaired of as far as he himself is concerned, but never must confidence in God be lost. For instance, people rightly despaired of Lazarus’ power to bring himself back to life once he bad been placed in the tomb, but no trust should have been lost in the God who raised him up. Therefore, those who out of malice are sunk in their many sins can be despaired of from the point of view of their own strength: “I have sunk into the abysmal Mire, where there is no footing” (Ps 69:3). But no one should despair if it is a question of the divine power. Concerning these children of despair it mentions further on: “Let no man deceive you with empty words.

III, 9: <i>causati sumus Iudaeos et Graecos omnes sub peccato esse</i>. Attendenda est tamen differentia circa hoc, quia apostolus, agens de culpa gentilium, assignavit duas causas culpae fuisse. Unam scilicet ex parte mundi, aliam ex parte Daemonum, quos colebant. Quia ergo Iudaei erant similes gentilibus in statu culpae, quantum ad primam causam, non autem quantum ad secundam, ideo apostolus non facit mentionem de culpa eorum, nisi quantum ad causam quae est ex parte mundi.

          <td>Next (v. 3), the Apostle recalls the sinful state of the Jews, thereby demonstrating how everyone had sinned, according to that saying of Romans 3 (9): “For we have charged both Jews and Greeks, that they are all under sin.” Nevertheless, a difference should be noted. The Apostle had designated two causes when dealing with the sin of the Gentiles, one on the side of the world and the other on that of the demons whom they worshiped. The Jews were like the Gentiles in their sinful condition in regard to the first cause, but not the second; hence, the Apostle only mentions their sin as arising from worldly causes. In reference to this he makes three points:

          <td>Regarding these he says <span style="font-weight: bold">fulfilling the will of the flesh</span>, doing what the flesh delights in. “And they who are in the flesh cannot please God” (Rom 8:8). Another concupiscence exists, that of thought. These desires do not spring from the flesh but from the appetitive faculty of the soul, such as the ambition for honors, for one’s own excellence and the like.

Et sicut homines per Baptismum mundantur a peccato originali solum quantum ad personas proprias, unde generant filios baptizandos, ita circumcisio mundabat ab originali personas solum, sed generabant adhuc circumcidendos. Et hoc est quod dicit <i>eramus natura</i>, id est per originem naturae, non quidem naturae ut natura est, quia sic bona est et a Deo, sed naturae ut vitiata est, <i>filii irae</i>, id est vindictae, poenae et Gehennae, et hoc <i>sicut et caeteri</i>, id est gentiles.

Baptism cleanses only the individual person who receives it from original sin; his children must also be baptized. Likewise, circumcision cleansed only the individual from original sin; the children they begot still had to be circumcised.

XI, 25: <i>diligis enim omnia quae sunt, et nihil odisti eorum quae fecisti</i>, et cetera.<br>
          secundo quia ad imaginem suam nos fecit, et capaces beatitudinis suae. Deut. XXXIII, 2-3: <i>cum eo sanctorum millia, in dextra illius ignea lex, dilexit populos, omnes sancti in manu illius sunt</i>.<br>

          <td>The efficient cause of the divine blessing of justification is God’s charity: <span style="font-weight: bold">But God, who is rich in mercy, for his exceeding charity wherewith he loved us</span>. He states <span style="font-weight: bold">for his exceeding charity</span> since we can think of a fourfold goodness and efficacy of the divine love. First, it brought us into existence: “For you love all things that are, and hate none of the things which you have made” (Wis 11:25). Second, he made us according to his own image, capable of enjoying his own beatitude: “He [God] came from Miribath-Kadesh [Vul & lit: thousands of saints]. At his right hand a fire blazed forth. He has loved the people; all the saints are in his hand” (Deut 33:2-3). Third, he renewed men corrupted by sin: “Yea, I have loved them with an everlasting love; therefore have I drawn thee, taking pity on thee” (Jer 31:3). Fourth, for our salvation he gave over his own Son: “For God so loved the world, as to give his only begotten Son” (Jn 3:16). Hence Gregory exclaims: “O the incalculable love of your charity! To redeem slaves you delivered up your Son.”
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Dicit autem <i>qui dives est in misericordia</i>, quia cum amor hominis causetur ex bonitate eius qui diligitur, tunc homo ille qui diligit, diligit ex iustitia, inquantum iustum est quod talem amet. Quando vero amor causat bonitatem in dilecto, tunc est amor procedens ex misericordia. Amor autem quo Deus amat nos, causat in nobis bonitatem, et ideo misericordia ponitur hic quasi radix amoris divini. Is. LXIII, 7: <i>largitus est in eis secundum indulgentiam suam, et secundum multitudinem misericordiarum suarum</i>. Ibidem: <i>multitudo viscerum tuorum et miserationum tuarum super me</i>.
          <td>He then asserts <span style="font-weight: bold">who is rich in mercy</span>. When a man’s love is caused from the goodness of the one he loves, then that man who loves does so out of justice, inasmuch as it is just that he love such a person. When, however, love causes the goodness in the beloved, then it is a love springing from mercy. The love with which God loves us produces goodness in us; hence mercy is presented here as the root of the divine love: “The favors of Yahweh I will recall, the praises of Yahweh for all that Yahweh has done for us... which he has given according to his kindness and the multitude of his mercies” (Is 63:7). And “where is your zealous care and might, your surge of pity and mercy toward me?” (Is 63:15).

          <td>Dicitur autem Deus dives in misericordia, quia habet eam infinitam et indeficientem, quod non habet homo. In tribus enim homo miseretur cum termino et limitatione. Primo quidem largiendo beneficia temporalia, et haec misericordia est finita, non excedens limites propriae facultatis. Tob. IV, 8: <i>quomodo potueris, ita esto misericors</i>; sed Deus dives est etiam in omnes qui invocant illum, ut dicitur Rom. X, 12.<br>
          secundo est finita misericordia hominis quia non remittit nisi offensam propriam, et in hoc etiam modus esse debet, ut scilicet non sic passim remittat, ut ille cui remittit efficiatur procacior, pronior et facilior ad iterum offendendum. Eccle. VIII, 11: <i>etenim quia non profertur cito contra malos sententia, absque timore ullo filii hominum perpetrant mala</i>. Deo autem nihil nocere potest, et ideo potest omnem offensam remittere. Iob c. XXXV, 6: <i>si peccaveris, quid ei nocebis?</i> Et parum post: <i>porro si iuste egeris, quid donabis ei?</i><br>
          tertio, homo miseretur poenam remittendo, et in hoc etiam est modus servandus, scilicet ut non facias contra legis superioris iustitiam: Deus autem poenam omnium remittere potest, cum non obstringatur aliqua superioris lege. Iob XXXIV, 13: <i>quem constituit alium super terram, et quem posuit super orbem quem fabricatus est?</i> Sic ergo misericordia Dei est infinita, quia non coarctatur angustiis divitiarum, neque timore nocumenti restringitur, et neque lege superioris.
          <td>God is said to be <span style="font-weight: bold">rich in mercy</span> because he possesses an infinite and unfailing mercy, which man does not. For man has a mercy that is bounded or limited in three ways. Firstly, in bestowing temporal benefits, man’s mercy is restricted by the amount of his own possessions. “If you have little, do not be afraid to give from that little” (Tob 4:8); whereas God is “enriches all who call upon him” (Rom 10:12). Secondly, the mercy of man is limited since he can only pardon offenses against himself. Even with these there ought to be a certain qualification; he should not forgive so indiscriminately that whoever is pardoned becomes more bold, prone and ready to offend again. “For, because sentence is not speedily pronounced against the evil, the hearts of the sons of men are fully set to do evil” (Eccl 8:11). But nothing can harm God and hence he can forgive every offense: “If you sin, what harm do you do to him?” And a little further on, “And if you act rightly, what do you give him?” (Job 35:6 & 7). Thirdly, a man shows mercy in remitting punishment; yet here too a qualification must be observed: he must not contravene the justice of a higher law. God, on the other hand, can remit all punishment since he is not bound by any higher law: “Who gave him charge over the earth? Or who else set the land in its place?” (Job 34:13). Thus the mercy of God is infinite because it is not limited by a scarcity of wealth, nor is it restricted through a fear of injury, nor by any higher law.

He has quickened us, I say, through a life of justice: “Who placed us among the living” (Ps 66:9). This occurs in Christ, that is, through the grace of Christ by whose grace you are saved. “For we are saved by hope” (Rom 8:24). Regarding the second, he says <span style="font-weight: bold">and has raised us up together</span> with Christ—for the soul [this has happened] in reality, in hope the body [awaits it]. “He who raised Jesus Christ from the dead will give life to your mortal bodies also through his Spirit which dwells in you” (Rom 8:11). In respect to the third he asserts <span style="font-weight: bold">and has made us sit together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus</span>, now through hope, and in the future in reality. For, as John 12 (26) puts it: “Where I am, there also will my servant be. If anyone serves me, my Father will honor him.” Also the Apocalypse 3 (21): “He who conquers I will grant him to sit with me in my throne; as I myself have conquered and sat down with my Father on his throne.”

I Tim. I, 15 s.: <i>Iesus Christus venit in hunc mundum peccatores salvos facere, quorum primus ego sum. Sed ideo misericordiam consecutus sum, ut in me ostenderet Christus omnem patientiam ad informationem illorum qui credituri sunt illi in vitam aeternam</i>.

          <td>Consequently, when he says <span style="font-weight: bold">that he might shew in the ages to come</span>, he discloses the final cause of the blessing which has been given. It can be read in two ways, depending on whether <span style="font-weight: bold">ages to come</span> pertains to the present or future life. If it applies to this life, then age is a certain measure of time and a period of one generation. As though he affirmed: I am saying that we who are the first-fruits of those who sleep (cf. 1 Thes 4:12 ff.), <span style="font-weight: bold">he has quickened in Christ that he might show in the ages to come</span>, to those who will exist after us, the abundant riches of his grace. And this is not on account of our merits, but in his own <span style="font-weight: bold">goodness towards us in Christ Jesus</span>, that is, through Christ Jesus. “Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of these I am the foremost. But I have received mercy for this reason, that in me first Christ Jesus might display his perfect patience, as an example for those who would believe in him for eternal life” (1 Tim. 1:15-16). Therefore, God has communicated copious gifts of grace to the early saints that later generations would more easily be converted to Christ.

De his saeculis dicitur in Ps. CXLIV, 13: <i>regnum tuum regnum omnium saeculorum</i>. Dicit ergo secundum hunc sensum: dico quod vivificavit nos in spe, scilicet per Christum, vel in gratia, <i>ut ostenderet in saeculis supervenientibus</i>, id est in alia vita compleret, <i>abundantes divitias gratiae suae</i>, id est abundantem gratiam, quam etiam in hoc mundo, dum multa dimittit peccata et maxima dona concedit, dicit: quae quidem superabundat in vita alia, quia ibi indeficienter habetur.

          <td>Or, <span style="font-weight: bold">age</span> can be taken in reference to the next life, of which Sirach 24 (14) states: “For eternity I shall not cease to exist.” Although there will then be only one age, since it will be eternity, he nevertheless says <span style="font-weight: bold">in the ages to come</span> on account of the numerous saints who will participate in eternity; there are said to be as many ages as there are shared-in eternities. Psalm 145 (13) speaks of these ages: “Your kingdom is an eternal kingdom.” In this sense he affirms: I say that he has vivified us in hope, namely, through Christ or in grace <span style="font-weight: bold">that he might shew in the ages to come</span>, that is, that he might bring to perfection in the next life, <span style="font-weight: bold">the abundant riches of his grace</span>. Such an abundant grace with which, even in this world, he forgives many sins and confers the greatest of gifts, will superabound even more in the next life, since there it will be enjoyed unfailingly. “I have come that they might have a life,” namely, of grace in this world, “and have it more abundantly” in the fatherland of glory (Jn 10:10).

But that hidden treasure, although it has not yet been revealed, is shown in the ages to come, since in the fatherland everything relating to the transparent glory of the saints will be unveiled before us. “The sufferings of this time are not worthy to be compared with the glory to come that shall be revealed in us” (Rom 8: 18).

Salus enim importat liberationem a periculis; unde perfecta salus hominis erit in vita aeterna, quando ab omnibus periculis immunis erit, sicut navis dicitur esse salvata, quando venit ad portum. Is. LX, 18: <i>occupabit salus muros tuos, et portas tuas laudatio</i>.

For to be saved is the same as to be justified. Salvation implies a freedom from dangers; hence, man’s perfect salvation will be in eternal life when he will be immune from all dangers, as a ship is said to be safe when it has arrived at port. “You shall call your walls ‘salvation’ and your gates ‘praise’” (Is 60: 18).

In the justification of an adult who has sinned, the movement of faith towards God coincides with the infusion of grace. “Your faith has saved you.

III, 25: <i>plurima supra sensum hominis ostensa sunt tibi</i>. I Cor. c. II, 11: <i>quae Dei sunt nemo novit, nisi spiritus Dei</i>, et cetera.

I, 29: <i>vobis autem donatum est pro Christo non solum ut in eum credatis, sed ut etiam pro eo patiamini</i>, et cetera. I Cor. XII, 9: <i>alii enim datur fides in eodem spiritu</i>.
          <td>He eliminates two errors concerning the first point. The first of these is that, since he had said we are saved by faith, any one can hold the opinion that faith itself originates within ourselves and that to believe is determined by our own wishes. Therefore to abolish this he states <span style="font-weight: bold">and that not of yourselves</span>. Free will is inadequate for the act of faith since the contents of faith are above human reason. “Matters too great for human understanding have been shown to you” (Sir 3:25). “No one knows what pertains to God except the Spirit of God” (1 Cor 2:11). That a man should believe, therefore, cannot occur from himself unless God gives it, according to that text of Wisdom 9 (17): “Who could ever have known your will, had you not given Wisdom and sent your Holy Spirit from above.”
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secundo excludit alium errorem. Posset enim aliquis credere quod fides daretur nobis a Deo merito operum praecedentium, et, ad hoc excludendum, subdit <i>non ex operibus</i>, scilicet praecedentibus, hoc donum meruimus aliquando, quod salvati sumus, quoniam hoc ex gratia, ut supra dictum est, secundum illud Rom. XI, 6: <i>si autem gratia, iam non ex operibus, alioquin gratia iam non est gratia</i>. Subdit autem rationem quare Deus salvat homines per fidem, absque meritis praecedentibus, <i>ut ne quis glorietur</i> in seipso, sed tota gloria in Deum referatur. Ps. CXIII, 1: <i>non nobis, domine, non nobis</i>, et cetera. I Cor. c. I, 29: <i>ut non glorietur omnis caro in conspectu eius, ex ipso autem vos estis in Christo Iesu</i>.
          <td>The second error he rejects is that anyone can believe that faith is given by God to us on the merit of our preceding actions. To exclude this he adds <span style="font-weight: bold">Not of</span> preceding <span style="font-weight: bold">works</span> that we merited at one time to be saved; for this is the grace, as was mentioned above, and according to Romans 11 (6): “If by grace, it is not now by works; otherwise grace is no more grace.” He follows with the reason why God saves man by faith without any preceding merits, <span style="font-weight: bold">that no man may glory</span> in himself but refer all the glory to God. “Not for our sake, Yahweh, not for our sake, but for the sake of your name display your glory, because of your kindness, because of your faithfulness” (Ps 115:1-2). “That no flesh should glory in his sight. It is due to him that you are in Christ Jesus, who became for us wisdom from God, justice, sanctification and redemption” (1 Cor 1:29-30).

            <p style="margin-left:.3in">First, he clarifies the infusion of grace.<br>
            Secondly, he declares the predestination of grace (2: l0b).
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Duo autem ad rationem gratiae pertinent, quae etiam iam dicta sunt, quorum primum est ut id quod est per gratiam, non insit homini per seipsum, vel a seipso, sed ex dono Dei. Et quantum ad hoc dicit <i>ipsius enim factura sumus</i>, quia scilicet quidquid boni nos habemus, non est ex nobis ipsis, sed ex Deo faciente. Ps. XCIX, 3: <i>ipse fecit nos, et non ipsi nos</i>. Deut. XXXII, v. 6: <i>nonne ipse est pater tuus, qui possedit, fecit et creavit te?</i> Et continuatur immediate cum praecedenti, ut dicatur: ne quis glorietur, quia scilicet ipsius factura sumus. Vel potest continuari cum eo quod supra dixerat: gratia enim salvati sumus.
          <td>There are two essential characteristics of grace, they have already been spoken of. The first of these is that what exists through grace is not present in man through himself or by himself, but from the gift of God. In reference to this he states <span style="font-weight: bold">For we are his workmanship</span>, whatever good we possess is not from ourselves but from the action of God. “Know that Yahweh is God: he made us, the Almighty” (Ps 99:3). “Is he not your Father, who created you, made you and fashioned you?” (Deut. 32:6). This is immediately linked with what went before: <span style="font-weight: bold">that no man may glory for we are his workmanship</span>. Or, it can be joined with what was said above: <span style="font-weight: bold">For by grace you are saved</span>.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secundo, pertinet ad rationem gratiae, ut non sit ex operibus praecedentibus, et hoc exprimitur in hoc quod subdit <i>creati</i>. Est enim creare, aliquid ex nihilo facere, unde quando aliquis iustificatur sine meritis praecedentibus, dici potest creatus, quasi ex nihilo factus. Haec autem actio, scilicet creatio iustitiae, fit virtute Christi, spiritum sanctum dantis. Propter quod subdit <i>in Christo Iesu</i>, id est per Christum Iesum. Gal. ult.: <i>in Christo enim Iesu neque circumcisio aliquid valet, neque praeputium, sed nova creatura</i>. Ps. CIII, 30: <i>emitte spiritum tuum, et creabuntur</i>. Ulterius, non solum datur nobis habitus virtutis et gratiae sed interius per spiritum renovamur ad bene operandum. Unde subdit <i>in operibus bonis</i>, quia scilicet ipsa bona opera sunt nobis a Deo. Is. XXVI, 12: <i>omnia enim opera nostra operatus es in nobis</i>.
          <td>The second essential characteristic of grace is that it is not from previous works; this is expressed when he adds <span style="font-weight: bold">created</span>. To create anything is to produce it from nothing; hence, when anyone is justified without preceding merits, he can be said to have been created as though made from nothing. This creative action of justification occurs through the power of Christ communicating the Holy Spirit. On this account he adds <span style="font-weight: bold">in Christ Jesus</span>, that is, through Christ Jesus. “For [in Christ Jesus] neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything, but a new creation” (Gal. 6:15). “Send forth your Spirit, they are created anew” (Ps 104:30). Moreover, not only are the habits of virtue
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Et quia <i>quos praedestinavit hos et vocavit</i>, scilicet per gratiam, ut dicitur Rom. VIII, 30, ideo subdit de praedestinatione, dicens <i>quae</i>, scilicet bona opera, <i>praeparavit Deus</i>. Nihil enim aliud est praedestinatio, quam praeparatio beneficiorum Dei, inter quae beneficia computantur et ipsa bona opera nostra. Dicitur autem Deus nobis aliqua praeparare, inquantum disposuit se nobis daturum. Ps. LXIV, 10: <i>parasti cibum illorum</i>, et cetera.
          <td>Since “those he predestined he also called” through grace, as Romans 8 (30) expresses it, therefore he adds something concerning predestination, saying, <span style="font-weight: bold">which</span> good works <span style="font-weight: bold">God has prepared</span>. For predestination is nothing else than the pre-arrangement of God’s blessings, among which blessings our good works themselves are numbered. God is said to prepare something for us insofar as be disposes himself to give it to us. “Provide the land with grain, for you prepared it for this” (Ps 64:10).
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sed ne aliquis intelligeret bona opera sic esse nobis praeparata a Deo, ut nihil ad illa per liberum arbitrium cooperaremur, ideo subdit <i>ut in illis ambulemus</i>, quasi dicat: sic nobis ea praeparavit, ut ea nos ipsi nobis per liberum arbitrium impleremus. <i>Dei enim adiutores sumus</i>, ut dicitur I Cor. III, 9. Propter quod dicebat de seipso apostolus I Cor. c. XV, 10: <i>gratia eius in me vacua non fuit, sed abundantius omnibus laboravi, non ego autem, sed gratia Dei mecum</i>. Signanter autem dicit <i>ambulemus</i>, ut designet boni operis profectum, secundum illud Io. XII, 35: <i>ambulate, dum lucem habetis</i>. Infra V, 8: <i>ut filii lucis ambulate</i>.
          <td>Lest anyone imagine that good works are prepared for us by God in such a way that we do not cooperate in their realization through our free will, he annexes <span style="font-weight: bold">that we should walk in them</span>. As though he said: Thus has he prepared them for us, that we might perform them for ourselves through our free will. “For we are God’s co-workers” (1 Cor 3:9). For this reason the Apostle said of himself: “By the grace of God, I am what I am. And his grace in me has not been in vain; rather I have worked harder than all of them—yet not I, but the grace of God that is with me” (1 Cor 15:10). He expressly said we should walk to designate a progress in good works, in line with that saying: “Walk while you have the light, so that darkness may not overtake you” (Jn 12:35); “Walk then as children of the light” (Eph 5:8).

          <td>In reference to the first he exposes three evils. First was the crime of paganism, by which they were accustomed to worship idols; this he implies in <span style="font-weight: bold">that you being heretofore Gentiles</span>. “You know that when you were heathens, you went to dumb idols according as you were led” (1 Cor 12:2). Some books have “You who were Gentiles” and omit everything until “But now in Christ Jesus...” (v. 13). Secondly, he discusses their carnal way of life, saying <span style="font-weight: bold">in the flesh</span>, that is, living lustfully. “And they who are in the flesh cannot please God” (Rom 8:8). Thirdly, he speaks of the repugnance and contempt with which the Jews despised them. Hence he mentions <span style="font-weight: bold">who are called uncircumcision by that</span> type of circumcision <span style="font-weight: bold">which is called circumcision in the flesh</span> as the circumcised Jews performed this circumcision. He says <span style="font-weight: bold">made by hands</span> to distinguish it from the spiritual circumcision spoken of in Colossians 2 (11-13): “In whom [Christ] you also were circumcised with a circumcision not hand-made, by putting off the body of the flesh, but in the circumcision of Christ, buried with him in baptism... And when you were dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, he has brought you to life together with him, forgiving you all offenses.”

They were, first of all, without the fundamental truth of Christ; whence he affirms <span style="font-weight: bold">that you were at that time without Christ,</span> without the promise of a Christ as was made to the Jews. “I will raise up for David a just branch; and a king shall reign and shall be wise” (Jer 23:5). “Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Sion, shout for joy, O daughter of Jerusalem: See, your King is coming to you, triumphant and victorious” (Zech 9:9).

Unde subditur <i>et hospites testamentorum</i>, quasi dicat: huiusmodi proselyti, quando convertebantur ad Iudaeos et fiebant proselyti, non sicut cives sed sicut hospites recipiebantur ad percipiendum testamenta Dei. Dicit autem <i>testamentorum</i> in plurali; quia Iudaeis vetus testamentum erat exhibitum, et novum erat promissum; quia, ut dicitur Eccli. XLIV, 25: <i>testamentum suum confirmavit super caput Iacob</i>; quod potest intelligi de veteri testamento. Promiserat enim Deus dare aliud testamentum. Bar. II, 35: <i>statuam illis testamentum alterum sempiternum</i>. Hoc autem reddidit illis, quorum <i>adoptio est filiorum</i> Dei <i>et gloria et testamentum</i>, ut dicitur Rom. IX, 4.
          <td>They were deprived, in the second place, from the society of the saints as long as they remained in paganism. He says they were <span style="font-weight: bold">aliens from Israel’s way of life</span>, since the Jews were not permitted to mix with the Gentiles. “You shall not make any league with them, nor show them mercy. Neither shall you make marriages with them” (Deut 7:2-3). “Jews do not communicate with Samaritans” (Jn 4:9). With respect to those who—not without contempt—were accepted into Judaism when they became proselytes he adds and <span style="font-weight: bold">strangers to the testaments</span>. As though he asserted: These converts, when they went over to Judaism and became proselytes, were accepted to partake of God’s covenants as strangers rather than as citizens.

          <td>Ulterius ponit summam damnificationem qua damnificantur, scilicet ob Dei ignorantiam, ibi <i>et sine Deo in hoc mundo</i>, id est sine cognitione Dei. Ps. LXXV, 2: <i>notus in Iudaea Deus</i>: non autem gentibus, ut dicitur I Thess. IV, 5: <i>non in passione desiderii, sicut et gentes, quae ignorant Deum</i>; quod tamen intelligitur de cognitione quae est per fidem. Nam de cognitione naturali dicitur Rom. I, 21: <i>qui cum cognovissent Deum, non sicut Deum glorificaverunt</i>, et cetera.
          <td>Finally, he writes of the greatest injury from which they suffered, ignorance of God. <span style="font-weight: bold">And without God in this world</span> means without the knowledge of God. “God has shown himself in Judah” (Ps 76:2), but not among the Gentiles: “Not in the passion of lust, like the Gentiles that do not know God” (1 Thes 4:5). This must be understood of the knowledge obtainable through faith, for Romans 1 (21) speaks of their natural knowledge: “Although they knew God, they did not glorified him as God or give him thanks.”

It is usual to adopt this way of speaking when the totality of the effect depends on its cause; for instance, we say that God himself is our salvation because whatever salvation is present in us is caused by God. In the same way, whatever peace we possess is caused by Christ and, as a result, whatever convergence [men have with one another]. For when a man is at peace with another he can securely walk towards or approach him. Hence, <span style="font-weight: bold">he is our peace</span>. Angels announced peace at his birth: “Glory to God in the highest; and on earth peace to those he is pleased with” (Lk 2:14). Indeed, while Christ lived in the body the world enjoyed the greatest peace, the like of which it had never before possessed. “May the just man flourish in his days, and peace pour down till the moon be no more” (Ps 72:7). He himself proclaimed peace when he arose from the dead: “He said to them: ‘Peace be with you’” (Lk 24:36).

A barrier, however, runs down the field, some are on one side and the rest on the other. The Old Law can be termed such a barrier, its carnal observances kept the Jews confined: “Before the faith came, we were under the guardianship of the law, confined in anticipation of the faith which was to be revealed” (Gal 3:23). Christ was symbolized through the Old Law: “See, he stands behind our wall” (Cant. 2:9). Christ, however, has put an end to this barrier and, since no division remained, the Jews and the Gentiles became one people. This is what he says: I affirm that <span style="font-weight: bold">he has made both one</span> by the method of <span style="font-weight: bold">breaking down the middle barrier</span>.

Vetus ergo lex est paries maceriae propter duo. Primo quia non conglutinabatur charitate, quae est quasi cementum conglutinans singulos sibi invicem, et omnes simul Christo. Infra IV, 3: <i>solliciti servare unitatem spiritus in vinculo pacis</i>. Vetus enim lex est lex timoris, inducens homines per poenas et comminationes ad observantias mandatorum.

A barrier of partition is one in which the stones are not mortared together with cement; it is not built to last permanently but only for a specified time. The Old Law was a barrier of partition for two reasons. First, because it was not mortared together with charity which is, as it were, the cement uniting individuals among themselves and everyone together with Christ. “Be careful to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace” (Eph 4:3). The Old Law is a law of fear, persuading men to observe its commands by punishments and threats. While that law was in force, those who kept it out of love belonged by anticipation, as Augustine holds, to the New Testament which is the law of love.

Dicendum est, quod in veteri lege erant praecepta moralia et caeremonialia. Moralia quidem praecepta Christus non solvit, sed adimplevit, superaddendo consilia, et exponendo ea quae Scribae et Pharisaei male intelligebant. Unde dicebat Matth. V, 19: <i>nisi abundaverit iustitia vestra plus quam Scribarum</i>, et cetera. Et iterum: <i>dictum est antiquis: diliges proximum tuum, et odio habebis inimicum tuum. Ego autem dico vobis: diligite inimicos vestros</i>, et cetera.

I have not come to destroy, but to fulfill.” I reply. The Old Law contained both moral and ceremonial precepts. The moral commandments were not destroyed by Christ but fulfilled in the counsels he added and in his explanations of what the Scribes and Pharisees had wrongly interpreted. So he says in Matthew 5 (20): “Unless your justice abounds more than that of the Scribes and Pharisees, you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.” And further on: “You have heard that it has been said: ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ But I say to you: Love your enemies; do good to those who hate you; and pray for those who persecute and calumniate you” (Mt 5:43-44). He abolished the ceremonial precepts with regard to what they were in themselves, but he fulfilled them with regard to what they prefigured, adding what was symbolized to the symbol.

          <td>What that barrier was he implies when he says <span style="font-weight: bold">the law of commandments,</span> as though he said: <span style="font-weight: bold">Breaking down the barrier</span> which is <span style="font-weight: bold">the law of the commandments.</span> The Old Law is termed the law of commandments, not because other laws lacked injunctions since the New Law has commandments: “A new commandment I give you” (Jn 13:34). There are two reasons why [this title is applied to the Old Law]. One is the great number of legal injunctions it contained, so many that men could not possibly keep them all, according to that text of Acts 15 (10): “Now, therefore, why tempt God to put a yoke upon the necks of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear?” And Job 11 (6): “That he would tell you the secrets of wisdom, which have multiple applications.” Or, it is called <span style="font-weight: bold">of commandments</span> meaning “of works.” “Where then is your boasting? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? No, but by the law of faith” (Rom 3:27). Thus the baptism of John was called a baptism of water since it would cleanse only externally and not sanctify interiorly. Likewise, the Old Law was termed of works be cause it ordained only what must be done, but did not confer the grace through which men would have been assisted in fulfilling the law. The New Law, on the other hand, regulates what must be done by giving commands, and it aids in fulfilling them by bestowing grace.

Civitas enim habet collegium politicum: domus autem oeconomicum, inter quae quidem duplex differentia invenitur. Nam qui sunt de collegio domus communicant sibi in actibus privatis; qui vero sunt de collegio civitatis, communicant sibi in actibus publicis. Item, qui sunt in collegio domus, reguntur ab uno qui vocatur paterfamilias; sed qui sunt in collegio civitatis reguntur a rege. Ita enim est paterfamilias in domo, sicut rex in regno.

If the ruler of the community is thought of, he is a father: “Our Father, who art in heaven” (Mt 6:9); “I though you would me Father and would not turn from following me” (Jer 3:19). In this perspective, the community is a home. But if you consider the subjects themselves, it is a city since they have in common with one another the particular acts of faith, hope and charity. In this way, if the faithful are considered in themselves, the community is a civil one; if, however, the ruler is thought of, it is a domestic community.

A stranger is an outsider, as it were, of a family: “It is a miserable life to go from house to house, and where you are a guest you may not open your mouth” (Sir 29:24). A foreigner is as an alien to the city into which he comes. As though the Apostle said: Formerly you were estranged from the community of believers, as strangers to a home and foreigners to a state—and as the proselytes were to the Old Law—but this is true no longer, for you are no more strangers and foreigners.

Hence Augustine remarks: “Two loves have formed two cities. For the love of God, even to the “contempt of self,” namely, of the man loving, “builds the heavenly city of Jerusalem.

To accept their doctrine is to accept Christ crucified: “We preach Christ crucified” (1 Cor 1:23); and “We have the mind of Christ” (1 Cor 2:16). 1 Peter 1 (12) affirms [of the Prophets]: “It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves but you, in the things which are have been announced to you by those who preached the good news to you.”

          <td>Notandum est quod apostoli dicuntur fundamenta. Ps. LXXXVI, 1: <i>fundamenta eius in montibus sanctis</i>. Is. LIV, 11: <i>fundabo te in sapphiris</i>, id est, in caelestibus viris. Expresse autem dicuntur fundamenta Apoc. XXI, 14: <i>murus civitatis habens fundamenta duodecim, et in ipsis nomina duodecim apostolorum</i>. Qui intantum dicuntur fundamenta, inquantum eorum doctrina Christum annuntiant. Matth. XVI, 18: <i>super hanc petram aedificabo Ecclesiam meam</i>.
          <td>Notice that the Apostles are designated as foundations: “O city founded by him on the holy mountains” (Ps 87:1). I will lay your foundations with sapphires” (Is 54:11), that is, with saintly men. In the Apocalypse 21 (14) they are expressly called foundations: “And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.” They are referred to as foundations to the degree that their doctrine proclaims Christ. “Upon this rock I will build my Church” (Mt 16:18).

XIII, 52: <i>Scriba doctus in regno caelorum similis est homini patrifamilias, qui profert de thesauro suo nova et vetera</i>. Item ut ostendat concordiam inter utramque, alterius ad alteram, dum idem est utriusque fundamentum. Nam quod prophetae praedixerunt futurum, apostoli praedicaverunt factum. Rom. I, 1 s.: <i>Paulus servus Iesu Christi, vocatus apostolus, segregatus in Evangelium Dei, quod ante promiserat per prophetas suos</i>.
          <td>Both <span style="font-weight: bold">Apostles and Prophets</span> are alluded to so that he might indicate that the doctrine of both is necessary for salvation. “Therefore, every scribe instructed in the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings forth out of his treasure new things and old” (Mt 13:52). Also, that he might show the harmony between the two, of the one with the other, since there is an identical foundation to both. What the Prophets foretold was to come, the Apostles proclaimed as accomplished. “Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, which he had promised before by his prophets in the holy scriptures, concerning his Son” (Rom 1: 1-3).

          <td>Lapis quidem est propter fundamenti firmitatem. Unde dicitur Matth. VII, 25, quod domus quae fundata erat supra petram, firmiter aedificata erat, intantum quod nec pluvia, nec flumina, nec venti potuerunt eam destruere. Non sic autem de domo fundata super arenam. Dan. II, 45: <i>lapis abscissus de monte sine manibus</i>. Angularis autem dicitur propter utriusque coniunctionem; nam ut in angulo duo parietes uniuntur, sic in Christo populus Iudaeorum et gentium uniti sunt. Ps.: <i>lapidem quem reprobaverunt aedificantes, hic factus est in caput anguli</i>. Act. IV, 11 s.: <i>hic est lapis qui reprobatus est a vobis aedificantibus, qui factus est in caput anguli, et non est in aliquo alio salus</i>. Et hoc idem de se introducit Matth. XXI, 42: <i>numquid legistis in Scripturis: lapidem quem reprobaverunt aedificantes, hic factus est in caput anguli</i>, et cetera. Summus autem dicitur propter dignitatis celsitudinem. Is. XXVIII, 16: <i>ecce ego mittam in fundamentis Sion lapidem angularem, probatum, pretiosum, in fundamento fundatum</i>.
          <td>He is a stone on account of the strength of the foundation. Whence Matthew 7 (25) speaks of the house founded on a rock and built solidly; neither rains, nor floods, nor winds could destroy it. Such was not the case with the house built on sand. “You saw a stone cut out of the mountain without a hand being put to it” (Dan. 2:45). He is called a comer-stone on account of the convergence of both [Jews and Gentiles]. As two walls are joined at the comer, so in Christ the Jewish and Pagan peoples are united. “The stone which the builders rejected became the cornerstone” (Ps 118:22): “This is the stone rejected by you, the builders, which became the cornerstone. And there salvation in no one else” (Acts 4:11-12). And Christ applies this text to himself in Matthew 21 (42): “Have you never read in the Scriptures: The stone which the builders rejected has become the cornerstone?” He is referred to as the chief one by reason of his heavenly dignity: “See, I am laying a stone in Zion, a tested stone, a cornerstone, a precious stone, a foundation stone” (Is 28:16).

          <td>Sed non est idem de fundamento in aedificio spirituali et in aedificio materiali. Materiale namque aedificium fundamentum habet in terra, et ideo oportet ut principalius fundamentum sit magis infimum. Spirituale vero aedificium fundamentum habet in caelo, et ideo oportet quod fundamentum quanto est principalius, tanto sit sublimius: ut sic imaginemur civitatem quamdam descendentem de caelo, cuius fundamentum in caelo existens, et aedificium demissum ad nos, videatur inferius; secundum illud Apoc. XXI, v. 2: <i>vidi civitatem sanctam Ierusalem descendentem de caelo</i>, et cetera.
          <td>The foundation of a spiritual edifice contrasts with that of a material building. For a material building rests on a foundation in the earth, the more important the foundation is, the deeper must it be. A spiritual structure, on the other hand, has its foundation in heaven; as a result, the more principal the foundation, the higher it necessarily Is Thus we could imagine a city, as it were, coming down from heaven with its foundation in heaven and the building itself appearing to come downward towards us below, according to that passage of the Apocalypse 21 (2): 1 John, saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God.”

          <td>Next (v. 21), he treats of the building’s construction. In erecting any building four stages are requisite. First is the foundation of the edifice, second is the construction, third its increase, and fourth is the completion.

          <td>Primum, cum dicit <i>in quo</i>, scilicet fundamento, qui Christus est principaliter, et doctrina apostolorum et prophetarum secundario, quia, ut dicitur I Cor. III, 11: <i>fundamentum aliud nemo potest ponere praeter id</i>, et cetera.<br>
          secundo vero tangit secundum, cum dicit <i>omnis aedificatio constructa</i>. Et quidem si intelligatur allegorice, designat ipsam Ecclesiam, quae tunc construitur quando homines ad fidem convertuntur. Si autem moraliter intelligatur, significat animam sanctam, et tunc eiusmodi aedificatio construitur, quando bona opera superaedificantur super Christum. Prov. XIV, 1: <i>sapiens mulier aedificat domum suam</i>. I Cor. III, 10: <i>unusquisque videat quomodo superaedificet</i>. In hoc ergo fundamento, scilicet Christo, omnis aedificatio spiritualis construitur, Iudaeorum vel gentilium, a Deo per auctoritatem. Ps. CXXVI, 1: <i>nisi dominus aedificaverit domum</i>, et cetera. Hebr. III, v. 4: <i>omnis namque domus fabricatur ab aliquo, qui autem omnia creavit, Deus est</i>. Sed instrumentaliter construitur aedificium vel ab homine qui seipsum aedificat, vel a praelatis.

Crescit etiam quando homo crescit in bonis operibus, et in gratia crescit quantum ad hoc, quod fit templum sanctum. Templum enim a Deo inhabitatur, et ideo oportet quod sit sanctum. Ps. XLV, 5: <i>sanctificavit tabernaculum suum altissimus</i>. Et quia nos debemus inhabitari a Deo, ut Deus in nobis habitet, ad hoc nos parare debemus, ut sancti simus. I Cor. III, 16: <i>nescitis quia templum Dei estis, et spiritus Dei habitat in vobis</i>; Apoc. c. XXI, 3: <i>ecce tabernaculum Dei cum hominibus, et habitabit cum eis</i>.

It also grows when a man makes progress in good works, and he grows in grace to the degree that he becomes a holy temple. A temple is the dwelling plate of God and must be holy: “The Most High sanctifies his dwelling.” (Ps 46:5). Since we should be inhabited by God, that he might live in us, we ought to prepare ourselves in order to be holy. “Do you not know that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?” (1 Cor 3:16). “See God’s dwelling is with men, and he will dwell with them” (Rev 21:3).
