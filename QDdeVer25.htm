              1. As the Master says, anything in our soul that is found to be
              had in common with beasts belongs to sensuality.” But the sense
              cognitive powers are common to us and the beasts. They therefore
              belong to sensuality.

              Praeterea, Augustinus, XII de Trinitate, dicit quod sensualis
              animae motus, qui in corporis sensus intenditur, nobis et
              pecoribus communis est, et seclusus a ratione sapientiae; et hoc
              exponens, subiungit: sensu quippe corporis corporalia sentiuntur;
              aeterna vero et immutabilia spirituali ratione sapientiae
              intelliguntur. Sed sentire corporalia est cognitivae. Ergo
              sensualitas, cuius est actus sensualis motus, est vis cognitiva.

              2. Augustine says: “The movement of the sensual soul, which is
              directed to the senses of the body, is common to us and beasts and
              quite outside reason as the principle of wisdom.” In expatiating
              upon this he adds: “Corporeal things are sensed by a sense of the
              body, whereas eternal and unchangeable things are understood by
              spiritual reason, the principle of wisdom.” But to sense corporeal
              things is the function of a cognitive power. Consequently
              sensuality, to which the act of sensual movement belongs, is a
              cognitive power.

              Sed dicendum, quod Augustinus hoc subiungit ut manifestet obiecta
              sensuum: sic enim motus sensualitatis intenditur in corporis
              sensus, in quantum versatur circa sensibilia.- Sed contra:
              Augustinus hoc subiungit ad ostendendum quomodo sensualitas a
              ratione secludatur. Sed circa corpora, quae Augustinus dicit esse
              obiecta sensuum, ratio vertitur; et inferior disponendo, et
              superior iudicando; et sic per hoc non secluditur sensualitas a
              ratione. Ergo Augustinus non intendit hoc quod dicitur.

            <td>
              3. The answer was given that Augustine adds this in order to point
              out the objects of the senses, for the movement of sensuality is
              attributed to the senses of the body inasmuch as it is concerned
              with the objects of sense.—On the contrary, Augustine adds this to
              show in what respect sensuality is discriminated from reason. But
              reason too is concerned with corporeal things, which Augustine
              says are the objects of the senses—lower reason by disposing them,
              and higher reason by judging them. And so sensuality is not by
              this fact discriminated from reason. Augustine therefore did not
              have the meaning alleged in the answer.

              Praeterea, in progressu peccati, quod in nobis agitur, ut
              Augustinus, ibidem, dicit, sensualitas tenet locum serpentis.
              Serpens autem in tentatione primorum parentum se habuit ut
              nuntians et proponens peccatum; quod est cognitivae, non autem
              appetitivae, quia eius est ferri in peccatum. Ergo sensualitas est

              4. In the commission of a sin in progress within us sensuality has
              the role of the serpent, as Augustine says. Now in the temptation
              of our first parents the serpent’s role was that of suggesting and
              proposing the sin. But that is the function of the cognitive, not
              the appetitive power, because the business of the latter is to be
              drawn to the sin. Sensuality is therefore a cognitive power.

              Praeterea, Augustinus dicit, in eodem libro, quod sensualitas

              solum appetitiva; cum ratio scientiae sit cognitiva; sic enim ad
              aliud genus potentiarum animae pertineret. Ergo sensualitas est
              cognitiva, et non tantum appetitiva.

            <td>
              5. Augustine says again: “Sensuality is very close to reason as
              the principle of science.” It would not be very close to it,
              however, if it were only an appetitive power, since reason as the
              principle of science is cognitive; for in that case it would
              belong to a different genus of the powers of the soul.
              Consequently sensuality is cognitive, and not only appetitive.

              Praeterea, sensualitas, secundum Augustinum, XII de Civit. Dei,
              distinguitur et a ratione superiori, et ab inferiori, in quibus
              appetitus superior, qui est voluntas, continetur; alias in eis
              peccatum mortale esse non posset. Sed appetitus inferior non
              distinguitur ut alia potentia ab appetitu superiori, ut
              probabitur, in corp. art. Ergo sensualitas non est appetitus
              inferior. Est autem aliqua vis animae inferior, ut ex eius
              definitione apparet. Ergo est vis cognitiva inferior. Probatio
              mediae. Differentia per accidens obiectorum non indicat
              differentiam potentiarum secundum speciem: non enim visus
              dividitur per hoc quod est videre hominem et videre asinum: homo
              enim et asinus accidunt visibili, in quantum est visibile. Sed
              appetibile apprehensum a sensu et apprehensum ab intellectu, per
              quae videntur superior et inferior appetitus distingui, accidunt
              appetibili, in quantum est, appetibile; cum appetibile, in quantum
              appetibile, sit bonum, cui accidit apprehendi sensu vel
              intellectu. Ergo appetitus inferior non est alia potentia a
              superiori.
            </td>
            <td>
              6. According to Augustine sensuality is distinguished from both
              higher reason and lower, in both of which is contained the higher
              appetite, the will. Otherwise there could not be any mortal sin in
              them. But the lower appetite is not distinguished from the higher
              appetite as a different power, as will be proved directly.
              Therefore sensuality is not the lower appetite. It is, however,
              some sort of lower power of the soul, as appears from its
              definition. It is therefore the lower cognitive power.—Proof of
              the minor: An accidental difference in objects does not indicate a
              specific difference in powers. Sight, for example, is not divided
              into different species by the difference between seeing a man and
              seeing an ass; for man and ass are accidental differences in the
              object of sight as such. But the object of appetite apprehended by
              sense and that apprehended by intellect the difference on which
              the distinction of higher and lower appetite seems to be based are
              accidental to the object of appetite as such, since the appetible
              as appetible is good, and it is accidental to good to be
              apprehended by sense or by intellect. The lower appetite is
              therefore not a power distinct from the higher.

              Sed dicendum, quod duo appetitus praedicti distinguuntur per bonum

              7. The answer was given that the two appetites mentioned are
              distinguished on the basis of good in an unqualified sense and
              something good here and now.—On the contrary, appetite is related
              to good as the intellect to truth. But truth in an unqualified
              sense and something true here and now, which is contingent, do not
              distinguish the intellect into two powers. Then neither can the
              appetite be distinguished into two powers on the basis of good in
              an unqualified sense and something good here and now.

              Praeterea, bonum ut nunc, est bonum apparens, ut videtur; bonum
              autem simpliciter est verum bonum. Sed appetitus superior
              quandoque in bonum apparens consentit, et appetitus inferior
              aliquod verum bonum interdum appetit, sicut ea quae sunt corpori
              necessaria. Ergo bonum ut nunc et bonum simpliciter, non
              distinguunt superiorem et inferiorem appetitum; et sic idem quod
              prius.
            </td>
            <td>
              8. Something good here and now is an apparent good, it seems,
              whereas good in an unqualified sense is the true good. But the
              higher appetite sometimes consents to an apparent good, and the
              lower appetite sometimes tends to a true good, such as the
              necessities of the body. Consequently good here and now and good
              in an unqualified sense do not distinguish a higher and a lower
              appetite. Thus the conclusion is the same as before.

              Praeterea, vis sensitiva contra appetitivam dividitur, ut patet

              distinguit: scilicet nutrire, sentire, appetere, moveri secundum
              locum, et intelligere. Sensualitas autem sub sensitiva continetur,

              9. The sensitive power is set over against the appetitive, as is
              clear from the Philosopher’s distinction of five genera of
              activities in the soul: to nourish, to sense, to tend
              appetitively, to be moved locally, and to understand. But
              sensuality is included in the sensitive power, as even the name
              shows. Sensuality is therefore not an appetitive but a cognitive
              power.

              10. What is defined corresponds to the same thing as the
              definition. But the definition of sensuality which the Master
              gives corresponds to lower reason, which also is sometimes
              directed to the senses of the body and the body’s concerns. Lower
              reason and sensuality are there fore the same thing. But reason is
              a cognitive power; then so too is sensuality.

              2. Sin consists in tending by appetite, not in knowing. But in
              sensuality there is some very slight sin, as Augustine says.
              Therefore sensuality is an appetitive power.

              Sensuality seems to be nothing but the appetitive power of the
              sensitive part of the soul, and it is called sensuality as being
              something derived from sense. The movement of the appetitive part
              arises somehow from apprehension, because every operation of a
              passive principle takes its origin from an active principle. Now
              appetite is a passive power, because it is moved by the object of
              appetite, which is an “unmoved mover,” as is said in
              <i>The Soul</i>. But the object of appetite does not move the
              appetite unless it is apprehended. Inasmuch as the lower
              appetitive power is moved by the appetible object apprehended by
              sense, its movement is called sensual, and the power itself is
              called sensuality.

              aspects which can be considered: the thing itself which is

              Natural appetite tends to the appetible thing itself without any
              apprehension of the reason for its appetibility; for natural
              appetite is nothing but an inclination and ordination of the thing
              to something else which is in keeping with it, like the ordination
              of a stone to a place below. But because a natural thing is
              determined in its natural existence, its inclination to some
              determined thing is a single one. Hence there is not required any
              apprehension by which an appetible thing is distinguished from one
              that is not appetible on the basis of the reason for its
              appetibility. But this apprehension is a prerequisite in the one
              who established the nature, who gave to each nature its own
              inclination to a thing in keeping with itself.

              The higher appetite, the will, however, tends directly to the very
              reason for appetibility itself in an absolute way. Thus the will
              tends primarily and principally to goodness itself, or utility, or
              something like that. It tends to this or that appetible thing,
              however, secondarily, inasmuch as it shares in the above-mentioned
              reason. This is because a rational nature has a capacity so great
              that an inclination to one determinate thing would not be
              sufficient for it, but it has need of a number of different
              things. For that reason its inclination is to something common
              found in many things; and so by the apprehension of that common
              aspect it tends to the appetible thing in which it knows that this

              regard to this or that particular thing, however much it may be
              apprehended as good or useful. This is so because each power has

              It is accordingly clear that the will and sensuality are

              particular good thing are tended to in different ways; for
              goodness is tended to for its own sake, but a particular good
              thing is tended to as sharing in something. And so, just as things
              which share are perfected by what they share, as a particular good
              thing. by goodness, in the same way the higher appetite rules the
              lower, and the intellect likewise judges about the things which
              sense apprehends. The proper object of sensuality is accordingly a
              thing which is good or suitable for the one sensing. This comes
              about in two ways: (1) because it is suitable for the very
              existence of the one sensing, as food and drink and the like; and
              (7,) because it is suitable to our senses for sensing, as a

              4. In the temptation of our first parents the serpent not only
              proposed something to be sought, but by his suggestions he
              deceived them. Now a man would not be deceived when a pleasurable
              object of sense is proposed if the judgment of reason were not
              inhibited by a passion of the appetitive faculty. Sensuality is
              accordingly an appetitive power.

              5. Sensuality is said to be very near reason as the principle of
              science, not as regards the genus of the power, but as regards its
              objects, because both deal with temporal matters, though in
              different ways, as has been said.

              haberet ad appetitivas vires, nisi diversitati apprehensionum
              diversitas apprehensorum coniungeretur. Nam sensus, qui non est
              nisi particularium, non apprehendit bonitatem absolutam, sed hoc
              bonum; intellectus vero, quia est universalium, apprehendit
              bonitatem absolutam, ex quo diversificatur appetitus inferior a

              6. The difference in the apprehensions would be accidental to the
              appetitive powers if there were not joined to it a difference of
              things apprehended. For sense, which attains only particulars,
              does not apprehend goodness taken absolutely, but a particular
              good; whereas the intellect, which attains universals, apprehends
              goodness itself taken absolutely. But from this difference the
              difference of lower and higher appetite is taken, as has been
              said.

              9. The sensitive part is taken in two ways: (1) Sometimes it is
              taken as opposed to the appetitive power, and then it includes
              only the apprehensive powers. Thus taken sensuality does not
              belong to the sensitive part except as to that which is, so to
              speak, its source. This is enough to justify the name derived from
              it. (2) It is sometimes taken as including both the appetitive and
              the motive powers, as is the case when the sensitive soul is
              opposed to the rational and the vegetative. In this usage
              sensuality is included in the sensitive part of the soul.

              2. One and the same power of the soul “is concerned with one
              contrariety, as sight is concerned with white and black,” as is
              said in
              <i>The Soul</i>. But agreeable and harmful are contraries. One and
              the same power of the soul is therefore referred to both. But the
              concupiscible power is referred to the agreeable, and the
              irascible to the harmful. The irascible and the concupiscible are
              therefore one and the same power, and sensuality is accordingly
              not divided into several powers.

              extreme and approaches the other, as by reason of gravity a stone
              leaves the top and goes to the bottom. But by the irascible power
              the soul withdraws from the harmful by shunning it; and by the
              concupiscible power it approaches the agreeable by craving it. The
              irascible and the concupiscible are therefore the same power of

              is the object of the whole of sensuality, as is evident from the
              definition of sensuality explained above; for the body’s concerns
              are things agreeing with the body. Consequently the whole of
              sensuality is nothing but the concupiscible power. Then either the
              irascible and the concupiscible powers are the same, or the
              irascible does not belong to sensuality. Whichever of these two is
              granted, the thesis (that sensuality is one simple power) stands.

              contrary, the harmful or disagreeable is the object of sadness,
              just as the agreeable is the object of joy. But both joy and
              sadness are found in the concupiscible power. Consequently both
              the agreeable and the harmful are the object of the concupiscible.
              Thus, whatever is the object of sensuality is the object of the

              love is in the same power. But anger is in the irascible.
              Therefore the irascible and the concupiscible are one and the same
              power, for otherwise anger could not be in both.

              Consequently a power distinct from the rest need not be referred

              distinct from the irascible. Then so also is the irascible from

              inasmuch as both tend to a thing agreeing with the subject of the
              tendency. Natural appetite is found to tend to two things in
              accordance with the two types of operation of a natural being. One
              of these is that by which the natural being strives to acquire
              what is capable of preserving its nature, as a heavy body moves
              downward in order to be preserved there” The other type is that by
              which the natural being destroys its contraries by an active
              quality. This is necessary for a corruptible being because, if it
              did not have the strength to conquer its contrary, it would be
              destroyed by it.

              were, a victory over whatever is opposed to it. The first is done
              by way of reception, the second by ‘way of action. They are
              consequently reduced to different principles, for receiving and
              acting are not from the same principle, as fire is borne upward by
              its lightness and by heat destroys things contrary to it.

              favorable to it. This is done by the concupiscible power, whose
              proper object is what is delightful to sense. It also seeks to
              gain the mastery and victory over things that are contrary to it.
              This it does by the irascible power. Its object is accordingly
              said to be something arduous.

              Et sic patet quod irascibilis est alia potentia a concupiscibili.
              Nam aliam rationem appetibilitatis habet aliquid ex hoc quod est
              arduum, cum quandoque illud quod est arduum, a delectatione
              separet, et rebus circumstantibus immisceat; sicut cum animal

              appetit ut ei suum delectabile coniungatur; altera vero, scilicet
              irascibilis, est ordinata ad agendum, quia per actionem aliquam
              superat id quod est contrarium vel nocivum, ponens se in quadam
              altitudine victoriae super ipsum. Hoc autem communiter in
              potentiis animae invenitur quod recipere et agere ad diversas
              potentias pertinent, sicut patet de intellectu agente et
              possibili. Et inde est quod secundum Avicennam, ad irascibilem
              pertinet fortitudo et debilitas cordis, quasi virtuti ordinatae ad
              agendum; ad concupiscibilem autem dilatatio et constrictio ipsius,
              quasi virtuti ordinatae ad recipiendum.

            <td>
              From this it is clear that the irascible is a different power from
              the concupiscible. If something is pleasurable it has a different
              reason for its appetibility than if it is arduous, since the
              arduous sometimes keeps us away from pleasure and involves us in
              affairs that bring sadness, as when an animal leaves the pleasure
              which he was enjoying and enters a fight and is not made to
              withdraw from it by the pains which he incurs. One of the two,
              moreover, the concupiscible power, seems to be directed to
              reception; for it tends in order that the object of its delight
              may be joined to it. The other, however, the irascible power, is
              directed to action, because by its action it overcomes something
              which is contrary or harmful to it, getting the upper hand by
              victory over it. It is found to be the case among the powers of
              the soul in general that receiving and acting belong to different
              powers, as is clear of the agent and possible intellect. It is for
              this reason too that according to Avicenna courage and faintness
              of heart pertain to the irascible power as the faculty directed to
              action, whereas the expansion and contraction of the heart pertain
              to the concupiscible power as the faculty directed to reception.

              ex aliqua tristitia illata, quae est in concupiscibili, et
              terminatur post vindictam adeptam ad gaudium, quod iterum est in

            <td>
              It is clear, then, from what has been said that the irascible
              power is in some sense subordinated to the concupiscible as its
              defender. For it is necessary for an animal to gain victory over
              the things contrary to it by means of the irascible power, as has
              been said, in order that the concupiscible may possess the object
              of its delight without hindrance. An indication of this is the
              fact that animals fight among themselves on account of things that
              give them pleasure, such as copulation and food, as is said in
              <i>Animals.</i>
              For this reason all the passions of the irascible power have their
              beginning and end in the concupiscible. Anger, for instance,
              begins with some sadness that has been caused (in the
              concupiscible power) and, after revenge has been got, ends with
              joy (which is likewise in the concupiscible power). In the same
              way hope begins with desire or love and ends in enjoyment.

              It should be noted, however, that not only in the apprehensive

              to the sensitive soul in accordance with its own nature and
              something else according as it has some slight participation in
              reason, coming into contact at its highest level of activity with
              reason at its lowest. There is verified here the statement of
              Dionysius that the divine wisdom “joins the ends of the first

              Thus the imaginative power belongs to the sensitive soul in
              accordance with its own nature, because forms received from sense
              are stored up in it; but the estimative power, by which an animal
              apprehends intentions not received by the senses, such as
              friendship or hostility, is in the sensitive soul according as it
              shares somewhat in reason. It is accordingly in virtue of this
              estimative power that animals are said to have a sort of prudence,
              as is seen in the beginning of the
              <i>Metaphysics.</i>
              A sheep, for example, flees from a wolf whose hostility it has

              The same principle is verified also in regard to the appetitive

              senses (the business of the concupiscible power) is in accordance
              with the sensitive soul’s own nature; but that it should leave
              what is pleasurable and seek something for the sake of a victory
              which it wins with pain (the business of the irascible), this
              belongs to it according as it in some measure reaches up to the
              higher appetite. The irascible power, therefore, is closer to
              reason and the will than the concupiscible. On this account a man
              unable to control his anger is less base than one unable to
              control his concupiscence, being less deprived of reason, as the
              Philosopher says.

              of sensuality inasmuch as it is in any way advantageous to the
              animal, either by way of the arduous or by way of the pleasurable.

              and flees the disagreeable. Consequently the irascible and the

              nature and naturally inclines to something. And the same

              1. The higher appetite extends to more things than the lower,
              since it is concerned with both corporeal and spiritual things.
              Now if the lower appetite is divided into two powers, the
              irascible and the concupiscible, then all the more should the

              2. To the higher part of the soul pertain those powers which
              belong to it alone, for the lower powers are common to the soul
              and the body. But the irascible and the concupiscible are powers
              of the soul alone. Thus it is said in
              <i>Spirit and Soul:</i> “The soul has these powers before being
              commingled with the body, since they are natural to it and are
              nothing but the soul itself as a whole. For the full and complete
              substance of the soul consists in these three: rationality,
              concupiscibility, and irascibility.” Consequently the irascible
              and the concupiscible powers pertain to the higher appetite.

              human and another not human; and the same is done with the

              exercised through organs of the body; otherwise the sensitive soul
              in brutes would be incorruptible, as being capable of having its
              operation by itself. But in the separated soul there remain joy
              and sadness, love and fear, and the like, which are attributed to
              the irascible and the concupiscible powers. The irascible and

              Among the apprehensive faculties we find that the higher
              apprehensive remains one and undivided with reference to things
              regarding which the lower apprehensive faculties are
              distinguished. By one and the same intellective power we come to
              know as to their natures all sensible things with reference to
              which the sense powers are distinguished. According to Augustine,
              what a man sees and what he hears is different externally, but
              internally in the intellect it is the same. And the same is to be
              said of the appetitive powers: the higher appetitive is one and
              the same in regard to all the objects of appetite, though the
              lower appetitive powers are distinguished in regard to all the
              different appetible objects.

              inferiores inveniuntur secundum speciem distinctae; sed superior

              The reason for this is found in the nature of each. The higher
              power has a universal object; the lower powers have particular
              objects. Many things correspond essentially to particulars which
              have only an accidental reference to something universal. Since it
              is not an accidental difference but only an essential one which
              distinguishes a species, the lower powers are found to be
              specifically distinct while the higher power remains undivided. It
              is clear, for example, that the object of the intellect is the
              what, and that the same faculty of intellect extends to all things
              that have quiddity and is not distinguished by any differences
              that do not differentiate the very notion of quiddity. But since
              the object of sense is a body, which is capable of moving the
              sense organ, the sensitive powers must be differentiated according
              to differences in the manner of moving. Sight and hearing are
              accordingly distinct powers because color and sound move the sense
              in different ways.

              The same is true of the appetitive powers. For the object of
              higher appetite is good taken absolutely, as was said above,
              whereas the object of the lower appetite is a thing in some way
              advantageous to the animal. But the arduous and the pleasurable
              are not suited to the animal under the same aspect, as appears
              from what has been said. Consequently the object of lower appetite
              is thereby essentially diversified, but not the object of higher
              appetite, which tends to what is good absolutely in any way
              whatever.

              Sciendum tamen est, quod sicut intellectus habet aliquam

              passionibus nomen irascibilis et concupiscibilis imponitur;
              appetitus vero superior habet aliquos actus similes inferiori
              appetitui, sed absque omni passione. Et sic operationes superioris
              appetitus sortiuntur interdum nomina passionum; sicut voluntas
              vindictae dicitur ira, et quietatio voluntatis super aliquo
              diligibili, dicitur amor. Et eadem ratione, ipsa voluntas, quae
              hos actus producit, dicitur interdum irascibilis et
              concupiscibilis, non tamen proprie, sed per quamdam similitudinem;
              nec tamen ita quod in voluntate sint aliquae vires diversae
              similes irascibili et concupiscibili.

              It should, however, be borne in mind that, just as the intellect
              has some of its operations directed to the same things as the
              senses, but in a higher way, since it knows universally and
              immaterially what sense knows materially and in particular; in the
              same way higher appetite has some of its operations directed to
              the same things as the lower appetites, though in a higher way.
              For the lower appetites tend to their objects materially and
              accompanied by a bodily passion; and it is from these passions
              that the irascible and concupiscible get their names. Now higher
              appetite has certain acts similar to those of lower appetite,
              though without any passion. The operations of higher appetite are
              accordingly sometimes given the names of passions. Thus the will
              for revenge is called “anger,” and the repose of the will in some
              object of spiritual affection is called “love.” By the same
              process the will itself which produces these acts is sometimes
              called “irascible” or “concupiscible,” not properly but by a
              figure of speech; and even so there is no implication in this that
              there are in the will two distinct powers corresponding to the
              irascible and the concupiscible.

              soul radically. And whichever opinion is taken, the irascible and
              the concupiscible powers do not remain in any other way than the
              rest of the sensitive powers. Thus it is said in the work

              first being which moves itself and by which is moved whatever is
              not moved by itself, because everything that exists through
              another is reduced to that which exists through itself, as is
              gathered from the <i>Physics</i>. Then, since the will moves
              itself by reason of its being the master of its own act, the other
              powers which do not move themselves must somehow be moved by the
              will. Now the nearer any of the other powers comes to the will,
              the more it participates in the will’s motion. Consequently the
              lower appetitive powers obey the will in their principal acts as
              being nearest to the will; and the other powers farther removed,
              as the nutritive and generative, are moved by the will in some of
              their external acts.

              Subduntur autem appetitivae inferiores, scilicet irascibilis et

              opponit sensualitati mediante imaginatione rem aliquam sub ratione

              sensualitas movetur ad gaudium vel tristitiam. Et ideo dicit
              philosophus, in I Ethic., quod ratio semper suadet ad optima.
              Secundo ex parte voluntatis. In viribus enim ordinatis ad invicem
              et connexis ita se habet, quod motus intensus in una earum, et
              praecipue in superiori, redundat in aliam. Unde, cum motus
              voluntatis per electionem intenditur circa aliquid, irascibilis et
              concupiscibilis sequitur motum voluntatis. Unde dicitur in III de
              anima quod appetitus movet appetitum, superior scilicet
              inferiorem, sicut sphaera sphaeram in corporibus caelestibus.

              Now the lower appetitive powers, the irascible and the
              concupiscible, are subject to reason in three respects: (1) On the
              part of reason itself. For since the same thing considered under
              different conditions can be made either pleasurable or repulsive,
              by means of the imagination; reason lays a particular thing before
              sensuality under the aspect of the pleasurable or the disagreeable
              as it appears to reason; and so sensuality is moved to joy or to
              sorrow. The Philosopher accordingly says that reason persuades “to
              the best.” (2) On the part of the will For among powers
              hierarchically connected the situation is such that an intense
              movement in one, and especially in the higher, overflows into the
              other. Accordingly, when by a choice the movement of the will is
              directed to something intensely, even the irascible and the
              concupiscible powers follow the movement of the will. It is
              accordingly said in
              <i>The Soul</i>
              that appetite moves appetite (that is, the higher moves the lower)
              as sphere moves sphere among the heavenly bodies.

              (3) On the part of the motive power which carries it out. For just
              as in an army the advance to battle depends upon the command of
              the general, so in us the motive power moves the members only at
              the command of that which rules in us, namely reason, whatever
              sort of movement may occur in the lower powers. Reason therefore
              holds the irascible and the concupiscible powers in check lest
              they proceed to an external act. On this account it is said in
              Genesis (4:7): “The lust thereof shall be under thee.”

              sensuality does not refer to these powers according to their
              participation in reason but according to the nature of the
              sensitive part of the soul. It is consequently not said in as
              proper a sense that sensuality is subject to reason as that the
              irascible and the concupiscible powers are so subject.

              5. The answer was given that there can be sin in sensuality by the
              mere fact that reason can prevent its movement.—On the contrary,
              the fact that reason can prevent it and does not, merely indicates
              the interpretative consent of reason, which is not sufficient for
              sin since nothing less than express consent suffices for merit.
              “For God is more ready to have mercy than to punish,” as is said
              in the Gloss in a comment upon the beginning of Jeremiah. Then not

              element of mortal sin is not found in it. But the formal element
              of venial sin, the privation of due order, is not in sensuality
              but in reason, whose business it is to put things in order.
              Consequently venial sin is not found in sensuality.

              An act is moral by the fact that it is somehow in our power, for
              thus it deserves praise or blame. Consequently an act which is
              completely in our power is completely moral and is capable of
              verifying the full notion of mortal sin. Such are the acts which
              the will elicits or commands. The act of sensuality, however, is
              not completely in our power, because it precedes the judgment of
              reason; yet it is in our power to some extent inasmuch as
              sensuality is subject to reason, as appears from what has been
              said. Its act accordingly attains to the genus of moral acts, but
              incompletely. In sensuality there consequently cannot be mortal
              sin, which is complete sin, but only venial sin, in which the
              incomplete character of mortal sin is found.

              5. The reason why sin is said to be in sensuality is not the

              precedes the judgment of reason, there is no consent either
              interpreted or expressed; but from the very fact that sensuality
              is able to be subjected to reason its act, even though it precedes
              reason, has the character of sin. It should, however, be borne in
              mind that, even though interpreted consent sometimes may suffice
              for sin, it does not have to suffice for merit. There are more
              requisites for good than for evil, since evil occurs from
              individual defects, whereas good depends upon a total situation
              not vitiated in any particular, as Dionysius says.

              8. Moral virtue is in the powers of sensuality, the irascible and

              that temperance and fortitude belong to the non-rational parts.
              But because sensuality designates these powers as having an
              inclination which is natural to sense but to something contrary to
              reason, and not as participating in reason, on this account vice
              is more properly said to be in sensuality, and virtue to be in the
              irascible and the concupiscible powers. The sin which is in
              sensuality, however, is not opposed to virtue as its contrary.

              10. The material element in mortal sin can be taken in three ways:
              (1) In so far as the object is the matter of the act. In this
              sense the matter of mortal sin is sometimes in sensuality, as when
              a person consents to sensual pleasure. (2) In so far as the
              external act is called material with reference to the internal
              act, which is the formal element in mortal sin, since the external
              and the internal act constitute one sin. In this sense too the act
              of sensuality can be regarded as the material element in mortal
              sin. (3) In so far as the material element in mortal sin is the
              turning towards a changeable good as one’s end, whereas the formal
              element is the turning away from the unchangeable good. In this
              sense the material element in mortal sin cannot be in sensuality.
              Nor does it follow (for the reason given above) that, if mortal
              sin cannot be found there, then there is no venial sin there
              either.

              is disposed to receive a form. Such a disposition is in the same
              subject as the form. There is another disposition by which an
              agent is disposed to act. Regarding this kind it is not true that
              it is in the same subject as the form for which it disposes.
              Venial sin, which is in sensuality, is this kind of disposition to
              mortal sin, which is in reason; for sensuality is like an agent in
              regard to mortal sin, since it inclines reason to sin.

              external members are applied to the act only by the command of

              1. The corruption and infection of human nature comes from
              original sin. But original sin is in the essence of the soul as
              its subject, as some say, because the soul contracts it from its
              union with the body, to which it is joined by its essence. Since
              all the powers of the soul are equally close to its essence, being
              rooted in it, the infection and corruption does not seem to be any
              more in the concupiscible than in the irascible and other powers.

              2. From the corruption of our nature there is in us a certain
              inclination to sin. But the sins of the irascible power are more
              serious than those of the concupiscible, because according to
              Gregory spiritual sins are more culpable than carnal sins. The
              irascible power is therefore more corrupt than the concupiscible.

              corruption of our nature. But the movements of the irascible power
              seem to be more sudden than those of the concupiscible. For the
              irascible is moved with a certain virility of spirit, whereas the
              concupiscible is moved with a certain effeminacy. The irascible is
              therefore more, corrupt than the concupiscible.

              Now original guilt is said to be in a power of the soul in two
              different ways: essentially and causally. Essentially it is either
              in the very essence of the soul or in the intellectual part,
              formerly the seat of original justice, which is taken away by
              original sin. Causally it is in the powers concerned in the act of
              human generation, by which original sin is handed on: the
              generative power, which carries it out, the concupiscible power,
              which commands it for the sake of pleasure, and the sense of
              touch, which perceives the pleasure. That infection is accordingly
              attributed to touch among the senses, to the concupiscible among
              the appetitive powers, and among the faculties of the soul in
              general to the generative power, which is said to be infected and

              The corruption of the soul of which we are speaking is to be
              viewed after the manner of bodily corruption. The latter comes
              about from the fact that, when the principle which holds the
              individual contrary parts together is removed, they tend to
              whatever agrees with them individually according to their own
              natures, and so the dissolution of the body takes place. So too
              since the loss of original justice, through which reason held the
              lower powers altogether subject to itself in the state of
              innocence, each of the lower powers tends to what is proper to it:
              the concupiscible to pleasure, the irascible to anger, and so on.

              Now the corruption of the body is not said to be in the soul,
              whose withdrawal occasions the body’s dissolution, but rather in
              the body, which is dissolved. In the same way the corruption
              spoken of is in the sensitive powers inasmuch as they are deprived
              of the unifying control exercised by reason and go out in all
              directions; but it is not in reason itself except to the extent
              that it is deprived of its own proper perfection when separated
              from God. On this account the more one of the lower powers gets
              away from reason, the more corrupt it is; and consequently, since
              the irascible power is closer to reason as participating to some
              extent in reason in its own movement, as the Philosopher teaches,
              the irascible power will be less corrupt than the concupiscible.

              1. Even though all the powers are rooted in the essence of the
              soul, some flow from that essence more immediately than the others
              and have a different relationship to the cause of original sin.
              The corruption and infection of original sin are accordingly not
              in all in the same way.

              Ad secundum dicendum, quod ex hoc ipso quod motus rationis magis
              participatur in irascibili, peccata irascibilis sunt graviora; sed
              peccata concupiscibilis turpiora: ipsa enim discretio rationis
              culpam auget, sicut ignorantia culpam alleviat. Recessus autem a
              ratione, in qua tota dignitas humana consistit, ad turpitudinem
              pertinet: unde ex hoc ipso patet quod concupiscibilis est magis

              2. From the fact that the irascible power shares in the movement
              of reason more than the concupiscible it results that the sins of
              the irascible power are more serious but those of the
              concupiscible more shameful. The very discernment of reason
              increases the guilt, just as ignorance lessens it. But because the
              whole human dignity consists in reason, withdrawal from it entails
              shamefulness. It is accordingly clear from this that the
              concupiscible power is more corrupt as withdrawing farther from
              reason.

              Ad tertium dicendum, quod motus irascibilis et concupiscibilis
              dupliciter potest considerari: scilicet in appetendo et in
              exequendo. In appetendo quidem magis est subitus motus
              concupiscibilis quam irascibilis, quia irascibilis movetur quasi
              deliberando et conferendo vindictam intentam ad iniuriam receptam,
              quasi syllogizans, ut dicitur in VII Ethic.; sed concupiscibilis,
              ad solam apprehensionem delectabilis, movetur ad fruitionem
              delectabilis, ut ibi dicitur. Sed in exequendo motus irascibilis
              est magis subitus quam concupiscibilis; quia irascibilis cum
              quadam fiducia et fortitudine agit, concupiscibilis vero cum
              quadam mollitie insidiose tendit ad propositum adipiscendum. Unde
              dicit philosophus in VII Ethicorum, quod iracundus non est
              insidiator, sed manifestus; concupiscentia vero insidiator; et
              inducit versum Homeri, qui dixit, Venerem esse dolosam, et eius
              corrigiam variam, significans deceptionem qua Venus furatur
              intellectum etiam multum sapientis.

            <td>
              3. The movement of the irascible and of the concupiscible powers
              can be considered in two respects: in desiring and in executing.
              In desiring, the movement of the concupiscible power is more
              sudden than that of the irascible, because the irascible is moved
              by deliberating and comparing, as it were, the intended revenge
              with the insult received, as if syllogizing, as is said in the
              <i>Ethics.</i>
              But the concupiscible power is moved to enjoyment upon the mere
              apprehension of the pleasurable object, as is said in the same
              place. But in executing, the movement of the irascible is more
              sudden than that of the concupiscible, because the irascible power
              acts with a certain courage and confidence, whereas the
              concupiscible with a certain pusillanimity tends to the attainment
              of its purposes by wiles. The Philosopher accordingly says that
              “the wrathful man does not lay snares but works out in the open,
              whereas concupiscence lays snares.” And he alludes to the verse of
              Homer who said that Venus is guileful and her seducing girdle is
              cunningly adorned, thereby conveying the deception by which Venus
              snatches away the understanding even of a very wise man.

              Ad quartum dicendum, quod aliquid dicitur esse naturale

              concupiscibilis sunt magis naturalia quam peccata irascibilis;

              4. Something is said to be natural in either of two senses: from
              the point of view of the nature of the species or from that of the
              nature of the individual. From the point of view of the nature of
              the species sins of the concupiscible power are more natural than
              those of the irascible. Thus the Philosopher says that sensual
              pleasure “grows up with all of us from our infancy,” as if it were
              contemporary with life. But from the point of view of the nature
              of the individual the sins of the irascible power are more
              natural.

              et hoc ideo quia si consideretur motus appetitus sensibilis ex

              utpote magis naturale et conveniens secundum seipsum: est enim
              cibi et potus, et aliorum huiusmodi, per quae natura conservatur;

            <td>
              The reason for this is that, if the motion of the sensible
              appetite is viewed from the standpoint of the soul, the
              concupiscible power tends more naturally to its object as being
              more natural and better suited to it in itself; for this power is
              concerned with food and drink and other things of the sort by
              which nature is preserved. But if this sort of motion is viewed
              from the standpoint of the body, a greater alteration and
              commotion of the body is brought about by the motion of anger than
              by that of concupiscence, commonly and proportionately speaking.

              For this reason the bodily make-up, in which children are for the
              most part like their parents, has more influence in the control of
              anger than in that of concupiscence. Consequently children imitate
              their parents more in sins of anger than in those of
              concupiscence. For what depends upon the soul relates to the
              species, but what depends upon a definite make-up of the body
              relates more to the individual. Original sin, however, is a sin of
              the whole of human nature. Hence it is clear that the argument
              proves nothing.

              although the sin of Adam belonged first to the irascible power,
              yet in us corruption belongs more to the concupiscible.

              medicine, because, as the Epistle to the Romans (5:15) makes
              clear, Christ’s gift is more potent than Adam’s sin by which this
              corruption was brought on; nor in the sickness, because it is
              against nature, since it was not in nature as instituted; nor in

              infirmity removed, since because of it man is prone to evil and

              Sensuality cannot be cured in this life except by a miracle. The
              reason for this is that what is natural cannot be changed except
              by a supernatural power. But the sort of corruption by which the
              parts of the soul are said to be corrupt, in some sense follows
              the inclination of nature.

              Quod enim homini in primo statu collatum fuit ut ratio totaliter
              inferiores vires contineret, et anima corpus, non fuit ex virtute
              principiorum naturalium, sed ex virtute originalis iustitiae ex
              divina liberalitate superadditae. Qua quidem iustitia per peccatum
              sublata, homo rediit ad statum convenientem sibi per principia sua
              naturalia; unde dicit Dionysius, in Eccl. Hierarch. III cap., quod
              per peccatum natura humana ad principii consequentem merito ducta
              est finem.

              The gift bestowed upon man in his first state, as a result of
              which reason kept the lower powers entirely in check, and the soul
              kept in check the body, was not from the efficacy of any natural
              principles but from the efficacy of original justice, which was
              given by divine liberality over and above them. When this justice
              was removed by sin, man returned to a state which befitted him
              according to his own natural principles. Dionysius accordingly
              says that by sin human nature “was deservedly brought to an end
              befitting its beginning.”

              Just as man naturally dies and cannot be restored to immortality
              except miraculously, in the same way the concupiscible power
              naturally tends to what is pleasurable and the irascible to what
              is arduous, even outside the order of reason. As a consequence it
              is not possible for that corruption to be removed unless a
              supernatural power miraculously brings it about.

              2. The irascible and the concupiscible powers obey reason inasmuch

              Consequently it is not entirely removed. It is, however,
              contrarily opposed to any excess in the inclination of the said
              powers toward their objects; and this is removed by the virtue.

              Ad quintum dicendum, quod ex parte illorum omnium quatuor
              contingit quod sensualitas in hac vita non curetur. Ipse enim Deus
              quamvis sit potens curare, tamen secundum ordinem suae sapientiae
              disposuit ut non curetur in hac vita. Similiter donum gratiae,
              quod per Christum nobis confertur, quamvis sit efficacius quam
              peccatum primi hominis, non tamen ordinatur ad removendam
              corruptionem praedictam, quae est naturae, sed ad removendam
              culpam personae. Similiter huiusmodi corruptio quamvis sit contra
              statum naturae primitus institutae, est tamen consequens principia
              naturae sibi relictae. Est etiam homini utile ad vitandum
              elationis vitium, ut sensualitatis infirmitas maneat; II Corinth.,
              cap. XII, 7: ne magnitudo revelationum extollat me, datus est mihi
              stimulus carnis meae: et ideo post Baptismum remanet haec
              infirmitas in homine; sicut sapiens medicus dimittit aliquem
              morbum non curatum, qui non posset curari sine periculo maioris
              morbi.
            </td>

              5. The reason why sensuality is not cured in this life is to be
              found in all four of the factors proposed. For God Himself, though
              able to cure it, has nevertheless appointed according to the order
              of His wisdom that it should not be cured in this life. In like
              manner the gift of grace which has been conferred upon us by
              Christ, though more efficacious than the sin of the first man, is
              not ordained to the removal of the corruption in question, which
              is one of our nature, but to the removal of the guilt of the
              person. In like manner too, although this corruption is against
              the state of nature as originally instituted, it is nevertheless a
              consequence of the principles of nature left to itself; and it is
              also useful for man in order to avoid the vice of self-exaltation
              that the infirmity of sensuality remain: “And lest the greatness
              of the revelations should exalt me, there was given me a sting of
              my flesh” (2 Cor. 12: 7). Consequently this infirmity remains in
              man after baptism, just as a wise physician discharges a patient
              without having cured his illness if it could not be cured without
              the danger of a more serious illness.
