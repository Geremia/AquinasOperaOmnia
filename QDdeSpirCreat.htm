          <td>Et videtur quod sic.
          <td>And it would seem that it is.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicit enim Boetius in Lib. de Trin.: forma simplex, subiectum esse non potest. Sed substantia spiritualis creata, est subiectum scientiae et virtutis et gratiae. Ergo non est forma simplex. Sed nec est materia simplex, quia sic esset in potentia tantum, non habens aliquam operationem. Ergo est composita ex materia et forma.
          <td>1 For Boethius says in his book <i>De Trinitate</i> [II, Patrologia Latina LXIV, 1250 D]: A simple form cannot be a subject. But a created spiritual substance is a subject of knowledge and of power and of grace; therefore, it is not a simple form. But neither is it simple matter, for in that case it would exist in potency only, and would have no activity. Therefore it is composed of matter and form.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, quaelibet forma creata est limitata et finita. Sed forma limitatur per materiam. Ergo quaelibet forma creata est forma in materia. Ergo nulla substantia creata est forma sine materia.
          <td>2 Furthermore, any created form is limited and finite. But form is limited through matter. Therefore, any created form is a form in matter. Therefore no created substance is a form without matter.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, principium mutabilitatis est materia; unde, secundum philosophum, necesse est ut materia imaginetur in re mota. Sed substantia spiritualis creata est mutabilis; solus enim Deus naturaliter immutabilis est. Ergo substantia spiritualis creata habet materiam.
          <td>3 Furthermore, the principle of changeability is matter; hence, according to the Philosopher [ <i>Metaphysica</i> II, 2, 994b 26], "it is necessary that matter be conceived in a thing that is moved." But a created spiritual substance is changeable; for only God is by nature unchangeable. Therefore a created spiritual substance has matter.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, Augustinus dicit, XII confessionum, quod Deus fecit materiam communem visibilium et invisibilium. Invisibilia autem sunt substantiae spirituales. Ergo substantia spiritualis habet materiam.
          <td>4 Furthermore, Augustine says in XII <i>Confessiones</i> [17, 25] that God made matter common to things visible and things invisible. Now the things invisible are spiritual substances. Therefore a spiritual substance has matter.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, philosophus dicit in VIII Metaphys., quod si qua substantia est sine materia, statim est ens et unum; et non est ei alia causa ut sit ens et unum. Sed omne creatum habet causam sui esse et unitatis. Ergo nullum creatum est substantia sine materia. Omnis ergo substantia spiritualis creata, est composita ex materia et forma.
          <td>5 Furthermore, the Philosopher says in VIII <i>Metaphysica</i> [6, 1045a 36] that if any substance is without matter, it is at once both being and one ( <i>ens et unum</i> ), and there is no other cause for it to be both being and one. But everything that has been created has a cause of its being and of its unity. Therefore no created thing is substance without matter. Therefore, every created spiritual substance is composed of matter and form.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, Augustinus dicit in libro de quaestionibus veteris et novi testamenti, quod prius fuit formatum corpus Adae quam anima ei infunderetur: quia prius est necesse fieri habitaculum quam habitatorem introduci. Comparatur autem anima ad corpus sicut habitator ad habitaculum. Sed habitator est per se subsistens; anima igitur est per se subsistens, et multo fortius Angelus. Sed substantia per se subsistens non videtur esse forma tantum. Ergo substantia spiritualis creata non est forma tantum: est ergo composita ex materia et forma.
          <td>6 Furthermore, Augustine says in his book <i>De Quaestionibus Veteris et Novi Testamenti</i> [q. 23, PL XXXV, 2229] that Adam's body was formed before the soul was infused into it, because a dwelling must be made before a dweller is introduced. Now the soul is related to the body as a dweller to a dwelling; but a dweller has a subsistence of its own: the soul accordingly has a subsistence of its own, and, for all the greater reason, an angel. But a substance with a subsistence of its own does not seem to be merely a form. Therefore a created spiritual substance is not merely a form; it is, therefore, composed of matter and form.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, manifestum est quod anima est susceptiva contrariorum. Hoc autem videtur esse proprium substantiae compositae. Ergo anima est substantia composita, et eadem ratione Angelus.
          <td>7 Furthermore, it is manifest that the soul is able to take on contraries. Now this would seem to be a property of a composite substance. Therefore the soul is a composite substance, and by the same reasoning so is an angel.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, forma est quo aliquid est. Quidquid ergo compositum est ex quo est et quod est, est compositum ex materia et forma. Omnis autem substantia spiritualis creata composita est ex quo est et quod est, ut patet per Boetium in libro de hebdomadibus. Ergo omnis substantia spiritualis creata est composita ex materia et forma.
          <td>8 Furthermore, form is that whereby a thing is ( <i>quo aliquid est</i> ). Whatever, therefore, is composed of that whereby it is and of that which it is ( <i>quo et quod est</i> ) is composed of matter and form. Now every created spiritual substance is composed of that whereby it is and of that which it is, as Boethius makes clear in his book <i>De Hebdomadibus</i> [PL LXIV, 1311]. Therefore, every created spiritual substance is composed of matter and form.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, duplex est communitas: una in divinis, secundum quod essentia est communis tribus personis; alia in rebus creatis, secundum quod universale est commune suis inferioribus. Singulare autem videtur primae communitatis, ut id quo distinguuntur ea quae communicant in illo communi, non sit aliud realiter ab ipso communi: paternitas enim qua pater distinguitur a filio, est ipsa essentia, quae est patri et filio communis. In communitate autem universalis oportet quod id quo distinguuntur ea quae continentur sub communi, sit aliud ab ipso communi. In omni ergo creato quod continetur sub aliquo genere communi, necesse est esse compositionem eius quod commune est, et eius per quod commune ipsum restringitur. Substantia autem spiritualis creata est in aliquo genere. Oportet ergo quod in substantia spirituali creata, sit compositio naturae communis, et eius per quod natura communis coarctatur. Haec autem videtur esse compositio formae et materiae. Ergo in substantia spirituali creata, est compositio formae et materiae.
          <td>9 Furthermore, there are two kinds of "commonness" ( <i>duplex communitas</i> ): one, in the divine order, whereby the essence is "common" to the three persons; another, in the created order, whereby the universal is "common" to the things that come under it ( <i>suis inferioribus</i> ). Now it would seem to be a peculiarity of the first sort of "commonness" that the feature which makes a difference between those beings which share the common element is not really anything else than the common element itself. For the paternity by which the Father is different from the Son is itself the essence which is common to the Father and to the Son. Now in the "commonness" of the universal the feature that makes a difference between the things which are included under the common element must be something else than the common element itself. In every created thing, therefore, which is included in a common genus there necessarily is a composition of the common element and of that whereby the common element itself is restricted. Now a created spiritual substance is in a given genus. Therefore in a created spiritual substance there must be composition of the common nature and of that whereby the common nature is confined. Now this seems to be a composition of form and of matter. Therefore in a created spiritual substance there is composition of form and of matter.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, forma generis non potest esse nisi in intellectu vel materia. Sed substantia spiritualis creata, ut Angelus, est in aliquo genere. Forma igitur generis illius vel est in intellectu tantum, vel in materia. Sed si Angelus non haberet materiam, non esset in materia. Ergo esset in intellectu tantum; et sic, supposito quod nullus intelligeret Angelum, sequeretur quod Angelus non esset; quod est inconveniens. Oportet igitur dicere, ut videtur, quod substantia spiritualis creata sit composita ex materia et forma.
          <td>10 Furthermore, the form of a genus cannot exist save in the intellect or in matter. But a created spiritual substance, such as an angel, is in a given genus. Accordingly, the form of that genus exists either in the intellect only, or in matter. But if an angel did not possess matter, it would not exist in matter. Therefore it would exist in the intellect only, and so, supposing that nobody had intellectual knowledge of an angel, it would follow that the angel did not exist. This is an incongruity ( <i>inconveniens</i> ). Accordingly, it is necessary to say (as it seems) that created spiritual substance is composed of matter and form.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, si substantia spiritualis creata esset forma tantum, sequeretur quod una substantia spiritualis esset praesens alteri. Si enim unus Angelus intelligit alium, aut hoc est per essentiam Angeli intellecti, et sic oportebit quod substantia Angeli intellecti sit praesens in intellectu Angeli intelligentis ipsum; aut per speciem, et tunc idem sequitur, si species per quam Angelus ab alio intelligitur, non differt ab ipsa substantia Angeli intellecti. Nec videtur posse dari in quo differat, si substantia Angeli est sine materia, sicut et eius species intelligibilis. Hoc autem est inconveniens quod unus Angelus per sui substantiam sit praesens in alio: quia sola Trinitas mente rationali illabitur. Ergo et primum, ex quo sequitur, est inconveniens, scilicet quod substantia spiritualis creata sit immaterialis.
          <td>11 Furthermore, if a created spiritual substance were merely form, it would follow that one spiritual substance would be present to another. For if one angel has intellectual knowledge of another, either this happens through the essence of the understood angel, and in this case it will be necessary for the substance of the understood angel to be present in the intellect of the angel understanding it; or else it happens through a species, and in that case the same conclusion follows, if the species through which the angel is understood by the other angel does not differ from the very substance of the understood angel. Nor does it seem possible to indicate anything wherein it does differ, if the substance of the angel is without matter, as is its intelligible species also. Now this latter is an incongruity, that one angel should be present in another by its own substance, because it is only the Trinity that enters into the rational mind ( <i>menti rationali illabitur</i> ). Therefore the first point too, from which this follows, is incongruous; namely, that a created spiritual substance is immaterial.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, Commentator dicit in XI Metaph., quod si esset arca sine materia, idem esset cum arca quae est in intellectu; et sic videtur idem quod prius.
          <td>12 Furthermore, the Commentator says in XI <i>Metaphysica</i> [XII, comm. 36] that if there were a box without matter, it would be the same as the box which exists in the intellect. Consequently the conclusion seems the same as before.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, Augustinus dicit, VII super Genes. ad litteram, quod sicut caro habuit materiam, id est terram, de qua fieret, sic fortasse potuit, et antequam ea ipsa natura fieret quae anima dicitur, habere aliquam materiam pro suo genere spiritualem, quae nondum esset anima. Ergo anima videtur esse composita ex materia et forma; et eadem ratione Angelus.
          <td>13 Augustine says in VII Super Genesi ad Litteram [6, 9] that, just as the flesh had matter (that is, earth) from which it was made, so perhaps it might have been the case that, even before that very nature which is called the soul was made, it had as its own genus a kind of spiritual matter, which was not yet a soul. Therefore the soul seems to be composed of matter and form, and by the same reasoning an angel also.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, Damascenus dicit, quod solus Deus essentialiter immaterialis est et incorporeus. Non ergo substantia spiritualis creata.
          <td>14 Furthermore, Damascene says [ <i>De Fide Orthodoxa</i> II, 3 & 12, Patrologia Graeca XCIV, 867 and 919] that "God alone is essentially immaterial and incorporeal." Therefore a created spiritual substance is not immaterial and incorporeal.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, omnis substantia naturae suae limitibus circumscripta, habet esse limitatum et coarctatum. Sed omnis substantia creata est naturae suae limitibus circumscripta. Ergo omnis substantia creata habet esse limitatum et coarctatum. Sed omne quod coarctatur, aliquo coarctatur. Ergo in qualibet substantia creata est aliquid coarctans, et aliquid coarctatum; et hoc videtur esse forma et materia. Ergo omnis substantia spiritualis est composita ex materia et forma.
          <td>15 Furthermore, every substance circumscribed by the limits of its own nature has a limited and confined existence. But every created substance is circumscribed by the limits of its own nature. Therefore every created substance has a limited and confined existence. But every thing which is confined is confined by something. Therefore in any and every created substance there is a confining element and a confined element; and these seem to be matter and form. Therefore every spiritual substance is composed of matter and form.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, nihil secundum idem agit et patitur; sed agit unumquodque per formam, patitur autem per materiam. Sed substantia spiritualis creata, ut Angelus, agit dum illuminat inferiorem Angelum, et patitur dum illuminatur a superiori: similiter in anima est intellectus agens et possibilis. Ergo tam Angelus quam anima componitur ex materia et forma.
          <td>16 Furthermore, nothing is active and passive on the same basis, but each thing is active through its form, whereas it is passive through its matter. But a created spiritual substance, such as an angel, is active while it is enlightening a lower angel and is passive while it is being enlightened by a higher angel. Similarly, there is in the soul the agent intellect ( <i>intellectus agens</i> ) and the possible intellect ( <i>intellectus possibilis</i> ). Therefore an angel as well as the soul is composed of matter and form.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, omne quod est, aut est actus purus, aut potentia pura, aut compositum ex actu et potentia. Sed substantia spiritualis non est actus purus, hoc enim solius Dei est; nec etiam potentia pura. Ergo est compositum ex potentia et actu; quod videtur idem ei quod est componi ex materia et forma.
          <td>17 Furthermore, every thing that is either is a pure act or a pure potency, or is something composed of act and potency. But a spiritual substance is not a pure act (for this is characteristic of God alone), nor is it a pure potency either. Therefore it is something composed of potency and act, which seems the same as something composed of matter and form.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, Plato in Timaeo inducit Deum summum loquentem diis creatis et dicentem: voluntas mea maior est nexu vestro; et inducit haec verba Augustinus in Lib. de Civit. Dei. Dii autem creati videntur esse Angeli. Ergo in Angelis est nexus, sive compositio.
          <td>18 Furthermore, Plato in the <i>Timaeus</i> [13, 41 AB] introduces the highest god as saying, when speaking to the created gods: "My will is greater than your bond." Augustine quotes these words in his book <i>De Civitate Dei</i> [XIII, 16, 1]. Now the created gods seem to be angels. Therefore in angels there is a bond or composition.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, in his quae numerantur et essentialiter differunt, est materia: quia materia est principium distinctionis secundum numerum. Sed substantiae spirituales numerantur et essentialiter differunt. Ergo habent materiam.
          <td>19 Furthermore, in those things which are counted, and are different in essence, there is matter; because matter is the principle of numerical distinction. But spiritual substances are counted, and are different in essence. Therefore they have matter.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, nihil patitur a corpore nisi habens materiam. Sed substantiae spirituales creatae patiuntur ab igne corporeo, ut patet per Augustinum, de Civit. Dei. Ergo substantiae spirituales creatae habent materiam.
          <td>20 Furthermore, nothing is acted on by a body except a thing that has matter. But created spiritual substances are acted on by bodily fire, as Augustine makes clear in <i>De Civitate Dei</i> [XXI, 10]. Therefore created spiritual substances have matter.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, Boetius in Lib. de unitate et uno, expresse dicit, quod Angelus est compositus ex materia et forma.
          <td>21 Furthermore, Boethius in his book <i>De Unitate et Uno</i> [PL LXIII, 1076-77] expressly says that an angel is composed of matter and form.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, Boetius dicit in libro de Hebdomad., quod id quod est, aliquid aliud potest habere admixtum. Sed ipsum esse nihil omnino aliud habet admixtum; et idem possumus dicere de omnibus abstractis et concretis. Nam in homine potest aliquid aliud esse quam humanitas, utpote albedo, vel aliquid huiusmodi; sed in ipsa humanitate non potest aliud esse nisi quod ad rationem humanitatis pertinet. Si ergo substantiae spirituales sunt formae abstractae, non poterit in eis esse aliquid quod ad eorum speciem non pertineat. Sed sublato eo quod pertinet ad speciem rei, corrumpitur res. Cum ergo omnis substantia spiritualis sit incorruptibilis, nihil quod inest substantiae spirituali creatae, poterit amittere; et ita erit omnino immobilis; quod est inconveniens.
          <td>22 Furthermore, Boethius says in his book <i>De Hebdomadibus</i> [PL LXIII, 1311] that that which is can have something else mixed with it. But existence itself has absolutely nothing else mixed with it; and we can say the same about all abstract and concrete things. For in man there can be something other than "humanity", such as "whiteness" or something of that sort; but in "humanity" itself there can be nothing other than what pertains to the character of "humanity". If, therefore, spiritual substances are abstract forms, there will not possibly be in them anything that does not pertain to their species. But if something that pertains to the species of a thing be taken away, the thing is corrupted. Since, therefore, every spiritual substance is incorruptible, nothing that is in a created spiritual substance will possibly be lost; and so it will be utterly immobile, which is incongruous.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, omne quod est in genere participat principia generis. Substantia autem spiritualis creata, est in praedicamento substantiae. Principia autem huius praedicamenti sunt materia et forma, quod patet per Boetium in Comment. praedicamentorum, qui dicit quod Aristoteles relictis extremis, scilicet materia et forma, agit de medio, scilicet de composito; dans intelligere quod substantia quae est praedicamentum, de qua ibi agit, sit composita ex materia et forma. Ergo substantia spiritualis creata, est composita ex materia et forma.
          <td>23 Furthermore, every thing which is in a genus participates in the principles of the genus. Now a created spiritual substance is in the category of substance. Now the principles of this category are matter and form, as Boethius makes clear in his <i>Commentum Praedicamentorum</i> [PL LXIV, 184], where he says that Aristotle, leaving out of consideration the extremes, namely, matter and form, discusses the mean, namely, the composite; and gives us to understand that the substance, which is the category about which he is speaking in that passage, is composed of matter and form. Therefore a created spiritual substance is composed of of matter and form.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, omne quod est in genere componitur ex genere et differentia. Differentia autem sumitur a forma, genus autem a materia, ut patet in VIII Metaphys. Cum ergo substantia spiritualis sit in genere, videtur quod sit composita ex materia et forma.
          <td>24 Furthermore, every thing which is in a genus is composed of genus and difference. Now the difference is obtained from the form, whereas the genus is obtained from the matter, as he makes clear in VIII <i>Metaphysica</i> [2, 1043a 19; 3, 1043b 30]. Since, then, a spiritual substance is in a genus, it seems that it is composed of matter and form.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, id quod est primum in quolibet genere, est causa eorum quae sunt post; sicut primus actus est causa omnis entis in actu. Ergo eadem ratione omne illud quod est in potentia quocumque modo, habet hoc a potentia prima, quae est potentia pura, scilicet a prima materia. Sed aliqua potentia est in substantiis spiritualibus creatis; quia solus Deus est actus purus. Ergo substantia spiritualis creata habet hoc a materia: quod non posset esse, nisi materia esset pars eius. Est ergo composita ex materia et forma.
          <td>25 Furthermore, that which is first in any genus whatever is the cause of the things which are subsequent; as for instance, the first act is the cause of every being that is in act. Therefore by the same reasoning every thing that is in potency in any way whatever has this character from the first potency which is pure potency, namely, from prime matter. But there is some potency in created spiritual substances, because God alone is pure act. Therefore a created spiritual substance has this character from matter; which could not be so unless matter were a part of it. Therefore it is composed of matter and form.

Unde ad huius veritatis inquisitionem, ne in ambiguo procedamus, considerandum est quid nomine materiae significetur. Manifestum est enim quod cum potentia et actus dividant ens, et cum quodlibet genus per actum et potentiam dividatur; id communiter materia prima nominatur quod est in genere substantiae, ut potentia quaedam intellecta praeter omnem speciem et formam, et etiam praeter privationem; quae tamen est susceptiva et formarum et privationum, ut patet per August. XII Confess. et I super Genes. ad litteram, et per philosophum in VII Metaph.
          <td>There are a variety of conflicting opinions concerning this question. For some assert that a created spiritual substance is a composite of matter and form; but some deny this. And hence, in order not to proceed to the investigation of this truth in an ambiguous fashion, we must consider what is meant by the term "matter." For it is obvious that since potency and act are divisions of being (ens), and since any genus whatever is divided into potency and act, the term "prime matter" is generally used to mean something which is in the genus of substance as a kind of potency, which is understood as excluding every species and form, and even as excluding privation, and yet is a potency capable of receiving both forms and privations; as Augustine makes clear in XII <i>Confessiones</i> [vii, viii, xv] and in I <i>Super Genesi ad Litteram</i> [xiv, xv], and the Philosopher in VII <i>Metaphysica</i> [3, 1029a 20].

Illud autem quod est prius, non dependet a posteriori, sed e converso. Et ideo invenitur aliquis primus actus absque omni potentia; nunquam tamen invenitur in rerum natura potentia quae non sit perfecta per aliquem actum; et propter hoc semper in materia prima est aliqua forma. A primo autem actu perfecto simpliciter, qui habet in se omnem plenitudinem perfectionis, causatur esse actu in omnibus; sed tamen secundum quemdam ordinem. Nullus enim actus causatus habet omnem perfectionis plenitudinem; sed respectu primi actus, omnis actus causatus est imperfectus. Quanto tamen aliquis actus est perfectior, tanto est Deo propinquior. Inter omnes autem creaturas Deo maxime appropinquant spirituales substantiae, ut patet per Dionysium IV cap. caelestis Hierar.; unde maxime accedunt ad perfectionem primi actus, cum comparentur ad inferiores creaturas sicut perfectum ad imperfectum, et sicut actus ad potentiam. Nullo ergo modo haec ratio ordinis rerum habet quod substantiae spirituales ad esse suum requirant materiam primam, quae est incompletissimum inter omnia entia: sed sunt longe supra totam materiam et omnia materialia elevatae.
          <td>For although in one and the same given thing which is sometimes in act and sometimes in potency, potency is prior to act in the order of time, yet in the order of nature act is prior to potency. Now that which is prior does not depend on that which is subsequent, but vice versa. And consequently one comes upon a first act in isolation from all potency; yet one never finds in nature a potency which is not perfected by some act, and on this account there is always some form in prime matter. Now the first absolutely perfect act, which has in itself all the fullness of perfection, causes actual existence in all things; but yet according td a certain order. For no caused act has all the fullness of perfection, but in comparison with the first act every caused act is imperfect. Still, the more perfect an act is, the nearer it is to God. Now of all creatures, the spiritual substances are nearest to God, as Dionysius makes clear in chapter 4 of De <i>Caelesti Hierarchia</i> [l]. And hence they most nearly approach the perfection of the first act, since they are related to lower creatures as the perfect is to the imperfect and as act is to potency. Therefore the ordered scheme of things does not in any sense imply that spiritual substances, for their own actual being, need prime matter, which is the most incomplete of all beings; but they are on a level that is far above all matter and all material things.

          <td>Hoc etiam manifestum apparet, si quis propriam operationem substantiarum spiritualium consideret. Omnes enim spirituales substantiae intellectuales sunt. Talis autem est uniuscuiusque rei potentia, qualis reperitur perfectio eius; nam proprius actus propriam potentiam requirit: perfectio autem cuiuslibet intellectualis substantiae, in quantum huiusmodi, est intelligibile prout est in intellectu. Talem igitur potentiam oportet in substantiis spiritualibus requirere, quae sit proportionata ad susceptionem formae intelligibilis. Huiusmodi autem non est potentia materiae primae: nam materia prima recipit formam contrahendo ipsam ad esse individuale; forma vero intelligibilis est in intellectu absque huiusmodi contractione. Sic enim intelligit intellectus unumquodque intelligibile, secundum quod forma eius est in eo. Intelligit autem intellectus intelligibile praecipue secundum naturam communem et universalem; et sic forma intelligibilis in intellectu est secundum rationem suae communitatis. Non est ergo substantia intellectualis receptiva formae ex ratione materiae primae, sed magis per oppositam quamdam rationem. Unde manifestum fit quod in substantiis spiritualibus illa prima materia quae de se omni specie caret, eius pars esse non potest.
          <td>This fact also becomes evident if one takes into consideration the activity that is proper to spiritual substances. For all spiritual substances are intellectual. Now, the potency of each individual thing is such as its perfection is found to be; for a proper act requires its own proper potency. Now the perfection of any intellectual substance, insofar as it is intellectual, is intelligible because it is in the intellect. The sort of potency then that we must seek in spiritual substances is one that is proportionate to the reception of an intelligible form. Now the potency of prime matter is not of this sort, for prime matter receives form by contracting it to the individual being. But an intelligible form is in the intellect without any such contraction; for thus the intellect understands each intelligible as its form is in it. Now the intellect understands the intelligible chiefly according to a common and universal nature, and so the intelligible form is in the intellect according to its universality ( <i>secundum rationem suae communitatis</i> ). Therefore, an intellectual substance is not made receptive of form by reason of prime matter, but rather through a character which is, in a way, the opposite. Hence it becomes obvious that in the case of spiritual substances the kind of prime matter which of itself is void of all species cannot be part of that substance.

          <td>Si tamen quaecumque duo se habent ad invicem ut potentia et actus, nominentur materia et forma, nihil obstat dicere, ut non fiat vis in verbis, quod in substantiis spiritualibus est materia et forma. Oportet enim in substantia spirituali creata esse duo, quorum unum comparatur ad alterum ut potentia ad actum. Quod sic patet. Manifestum est enim quod primum ens, quod Deus est, est actus infinitus, utpote habens in se totam essendi plenitudinem, non contractam ad aliquam naturam generis vel speciei. Unde oportet quod ipsum esse eius non sit esse quasi inditum alicui naturae quae non sit suum esse; quia sic finiretur ad illam naturam. Unde dicimus, quod Deus est ipsum suum esse. Hoc autem non potest dici de aliquo alio: sicut enim impossibile est intelligere quod sint plures albedines separatae; sed si esset albedo separata ab omni subiecto et recipiente, esset una tantum; ita impossibile est quod sit ipsum esse subsistens nisi unum tantum. Omne igitur quod est post primum ens, cum non sit suum esse, habet esse in aliquo receptum, per quod ipsum esse contrahitur; et sic in quolibet creato aliud est natura rei quae participat esse, et aliud ipsum esse participatum. Et cum quaelibet res participet per assimilationem primum actum in quantum habet esse, necesse est quod esse participatum in unoquoque comparetur ad naturam participantem ipsum, sicut actus ad potentiam. In natura igitur rerum corporearum materia non per se participat ipsum esse, sed per formam; forma enim adveniens materiae facit ipsam esse actu, sicut anima corpori.
          <td>Yet on the other hand if we use the terms "matter" and "form" to mean any two things which are related to each other as potency and act, there is no difficulty in saying (so as to avoid a mere dispute about words) that matter and form exist in spiritual substances. For in a created spiritual substance there must be two elements, one of which is related to the other as potency is to act. This is clear from the following. For it is obvious that the first being, which is God, is infinite act, as having in itself the entire fullness. of being, not contracted to any generic or specific nature. Hence its very existence must not be an existence that is, as it were, put into some nature which is not its own existence, because thus it would be limited to that nature. Hence we say that God is His own existence. Now this cannot be said of any other being. For, just as it is impossible to understand that there are many separate whitenesses, but if there were "whiteness" apart from every subject and recipient, there would be but one whiteness, so it is impossible to have a self-subsisting existence unless there is but one. Accordingly, every thing which exists after the first being, because it is not its own existence, has an existence that is received in something, through which the existence is itself contracted; and thus in any created object the nature of the thing which participates in existence is one thing, and the participated existence itself is another. And because any thing participates in the first act through similitude insofar as it has existence, the participated existence must in each case be related to the nature participating in it, as act is related to potency. Accordingly, in the world of physical objects, matter does not of itself participate in actual existence, but it does participate therein through form; for the form coming upon the matter makes the matter itself actually exist, as the soul does to the body.

Remoto igitur fundamento materiae, si remaneat aliqua forma determinatae naturae per se subsistens, non in materia, adhuc comparabitur ad suum esse ut potentia ad actum: non dico autem ut potentiam separabilem ab actu, sed quam semper suus actus comitetur. Et hoc modo natura spiritualis substantiae, quae non est composita ex materia et forma, est ut potentia respectu sui esse; et sic in substantia spirituali est compositio potentiae et actus, et per consequens formae et materiae; si tamen omnis potentia nominetur materia et omnis actus nominetur forma. Sed tamen hoc non est proprie dictum secundum communem usum nominum.
          <td>Hence in composite objects there are two kinds of act and two kinds of potency to consider. For first of all, matter is as potency with reference to form, and the form is its act. And secondly, if the nature is constituted of matter and form, the matter is as potency with reference to existence itself, insofar as it is able to receive this. Accordingly, when the foundation of matter is removed, if any form of a determinate nature remains which subsists of itself but not in matter, it will still be related to its own existence as potency is to act. But I do not say, as that potency which is separable from its act, but as a potency which is always accompanied by its act. And in this way the nature of a spiritual substance, which is not composed of matter and form, is a potency with reference to its own existence; and thus there is in a spiritual substance a composition of potency and act, and, consequently, of form and matter, provided only that every potency be called matter, and every act be called form; but yet this is not properly said according to the common use of the terms.

Si quae ergo forma est quae sit actus tantum, ut divina essentia, illa nullo modo potest esse subiectum; et de hac Boetius loquitur. Si autem aliqua forma sit quae secundum aliquid sit in actu, et secundum aliquid in potentia; secundum hoc tantum erit subiectum, secundum quod est in potentia. Substantiae autem spirituales, licet sint formae subsistentes, sunt tamen in potentia, in quantum habent esse finitum et limitatum. Et quia intellectus est cognoscitivus omnium secundum sui rationem, et voluntas est amativa universalis boni; remanet semper in intellectu et voluntate substantiae creatae potentia ad aliquid quod est extra se. Unde si quis recte consideret, substantiae spirituales non inveniuntur esse subiectae nisi accidentium quae pertinent ad intellectum et voluntatem.
          <td>As to the first argument, therefore, it must be said that the character of a form is in sharp contrast to the character of a subject: for every form, as such, is an act, whereas every subject is related to that of which it is the subject, as a potency is related to an act. If therefore, there is any form which is exclusively an act, such as the divine essence, it cannot in any sense be a subject; and it is of this form that Boethius is speaking. Now if there happens to be a form, which is in act in one respect and is in potency in another, it will be a subject only in that precise respect in which it is in potency. Now spiritual substances, although they are subsistent forms, are nevertheless in potency inasmuch as they possess a finite and limited existence. And because the intellect, as a consequence of its character, has a capacity for knowing all things, and the will has a capacity for loving all good, there always remains within the intellect and the will of a created substance a potency toward something which is outside of itself. Hence, if one views the matter rightly, spiritual substances are not found to be subjects, except of accidents which pertain to the intellect and to the will.

From this it is plainly manifest that matter, which is without any species, is not a part of the angelic substance. But the formlessness of spiritual substance is a consequence of the fact that the substance has not yet been turned toward the Word whereby it is enlightened, and this is something that pertains to its power of understanding." In this sense, therefore, he calls them both "common matter of things visible and things invisible," according as each is formless in its own way.

But a form does not have being through another form. And hence, if there be a subsisting form, it is immediately both being and one, nor does it have a formal cause of its own existence; it does nevertheless have a cause that pours existence into it, but not a moving cause such as would bring it into act out of previously existent potency.

Sed quod est, est id quod subsistit in esse, quod quidem in substantiis corporeis est ipsum compositum ex materia et forma, in substantiis autem incorporeis est ipsa forma simplex; quo est autem, est ipsum esse participatum, quia in tantum unumquodque est, in quantum ipse esse participat. Unde et Boetius sic utitur istis vocabulis in libro de Hebdomad., dicens, quod in aliis praeter primum, non idem est quod est et esse.
          <td>As to the eighth, it must be said that to be composed of "that which is" (quod est) and of "that whereby something is" ( <i>quo est</i> ) is not the same as to be composed of matter and form. For although form can be called "that whereby something is," nevertheless matter cannot properly be called "that which is," since it is not, save in potency. But "that which is" is that which subsists in existence and this, in the case of corporeal substances, is the thing itself that is composed of matter and form, whereas in the case of incorporeal substances it is the simple form itself. Now "that whereby something is" is participated existence itself, because each individual is, insofar as it participates in existence itself. And hence Boethius also uses these words in this sense in the book De Hebdomadibus, saying that in the case of beings other than the First "that which is" and "existence" ( <i>esse</i> ) are not the same.

          <td>Ad nonum dicendum quod sub aliquo communi est aliquid dupliciter: uno modo sicut individuum sub specie; alio modo sicut species sub genere. Quandocumque igitur sub una communi specie sunt multa individua, distinctio multorum individuorum est per materiam individualem, quae est praeter naturam speciei; et hoc in rebus creatis. Quando vero sunt multae species sub uno genere, non oportet quod formae quibus distinguuntur species ad invicem, sint aliud secundum rem a forma communi generis. Per unam enim et eamdem formam hoc individuum collocatur in genere substantiae, et in genere corporis, et sic usque ad specialissimam speciem. Si enim secundum aliquam formam hoc individuum habeat quod sit substantia, de necessitate oportet quod aliae formae supervenientes, secundum quas collocatur in inferioribus generibus et speciebus, sint formae accidentales.
          <td>As to the ninth, it must be said that a thing is "under" something common in two senses: in one, as an individual is "under" a species; in another, as a species is "under" a genus. Whenever then many individuals are under one common species, the distinction between many individuals is effected through individual matter, which has nothing to do with their specific nature. This is true in the case of created things. But when there are many species under one genus the forms whereby the species are distinguished from one another should in reality be something other than the common form of the genus. For through one and the same form this particular individual is put in the genus "substance", in the genus "body", and so on down to the most specific species. For if this particular individual were to possess its substantiality in consequence of some form, then necessarily it would have to be the case that the other additional forms in consequence of which it is placed in lower genera and species would be accidental forms.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quod ex hoc patet. Forma enim accidentalis a substantiali differt, quia forma substantialis facit hoc aliquid, forma autem accidentalis advenit rei iam hoc aliquid existenti. Si igitur prima forma, per quam collocatur in genere, facit individuum esse hoc aliquid; omnes aliae formae advenient individuo subsistenti in actu, et ita erunt formae accidentales. Sequetur etiam quod per adventum posteriorum formarum, quibus collocatur aliquid in specie specialissima vel subalterna, non sit generatio, neque per subtractionem corruptio, simpliciter, sed secundum quid. Cum enim generatio sit transmutatio ad esse rei, illud simpliciter generari dicitur quod simpliciter fit ens de non ente in actu, sed ente in potentia tantum. Si igitur aliquid fiat de praeexistenti in actu, non generabitur simpliciter ens, sed hoc ens; et eadem ratio est de corruptione. Est ergo dicendum quod formae rerum sunt ordinatae, et una addit super alteram in perfectione. Et hoc patet per philosophum in VIII Metaph., qui dicit quod definitiones et species rerum sunt sicut numeri, in quibus species multiplicantur per additionem unitatis; tum etiam hoc per inductionem appareat gradatim species rerum multiplicari secundum perfectum et imperfectum.
          <td>This is clear from the following. For an accidental form differs from a substantial form because a substantial form makes this given thing to be something, whereas an accidental form is added to a thing which already exists as "this something." If then the first form by which the individual is placed in a genus will make the individual to be "this something," all the other forms will be added to an individual that subsists in actuality, and consequently they will be accidental forms. It will also follow that through the addition of the later forms whereby something is given its place in the most specific species or in some subordinate species, generation does not occur, and by the taking away of these forms there is no corruption in an absolute sense but in a qualified sense ( <i>secundum aliquid</i> ). For since generation is a change oriented to the existence of a thing, something is said to be generated, absolutely speaking, if it absolutely becomes a being (ens) out of that which is non-being in act but being in potency only. If, then, something comes into being out of something that is previously existing in act, what will be generated is not a being in an absolute sense, but "this particular being." Concerning corruption the same reasoning holds good. It must, therefore, be said that the forms of things are ranged in order, and that one form exceeds another in perfection. This is clear both from what the Philosopher says in VIII <i>Metaphysica</i> [3, 1043b 33], namely, that the definitions and species of things are like numbers, in the case of which the species are multiplied by adding one; and also from the fact that through induction the species of things appear to be multiplied hierarchically according to the perfect and the imperfect.

          <td>Sic igitur per hoc excluditur positio Avicebron in Lib. fontis vitae, quod materia prima, quae omnino sine forma consideratur, primo recipit formam substantiae; qua quidem supposita in aliqua sui parte, super formam substantiae recipit aliam formam, per quam fit corpus; et sic deinceps usque ad ultimam speciem. Et in illa parte in qua non recipit formam corpoream, est substantia incorporea, cuius materiam non subiectam quantitati aliqui nominant materiam spiritualem. Ipsam autem materiam iam perfectam per formam substantiae, quae est subiectum quantitatis et aliorum accidentium, dicit esse clavem ad intelligendum substantias incorporeas. Non enim ex hoc contingit quod aliquod individuum sit corpus inanimatum et aliud corpus animatum, per hoc quod individuum animatum habet formam aliquam, cui substernatur forma substantialis corporis; sed quia hoc individuum animatum habet formam perfectiorem, per quam habet non solum subsistere et corpus esse, sed etiam vivere, aliud autem habet formam imperfectiorem, per quam non attingit ad vitam, sed solum ad subsistere corporaliter.
          <td>Thus, then, by this line of argument Avicebron's position in the book <i>Fons Vitae</i> is ruled out, to the effect that prime matter, something that is regarded as entirely without form, first receives the form of substance; and once this form is supposed in any part of itself it receives, in addition to the form "substance", another form through which it becomes a body; and so on in succession down to its ultimate species. And in that part in which it does not receive a corporeal form it is incorporeal substance, the matter of which, not being subject to quantity, some call "spiritual matter". Moreover, the matter itself, already perfected through the form of substance which is the subject of quantity and of the other accidents, is "the key", he says, to the understanding of incorporeal substances [II, 6, p. 35]. For the reason why some individual thing happens to be a non-living body and another happens to be a living body is not the fact that a living individual has some form of which the substantial form of a body is a substratum; but the reason is that this particular living individual has a more perfect form, through which it has not only subsistence and bodily existence; but also life; whereas the other has a more imperfect form, through which it does not attain to life, but only to bodily existence.

Still that two-fold being ( <i>esse</i> ) is not the consequence of two different forms, but of one form, which confers on man not only "animal being" (esse) but "human being" (esse). Now the soul of another animal confers on it only "animal being" ( <i>esse</i> ). Hence the common element "animal" is not one numerically, but mentally only, because it is not from one and the same form that a man and an ass are "animal". Once matter is taken away, therefore, from spiritual substances, the genus and the difference will remain in them, not in consequence of matter and form, but in consequence of considering in a spiritual substance both that element which is common to itself and to less perfect substances, and also that element which is proper to itself.

Unde contra rationem substantiae spiritualis esse videtur quod sit corporis forma; et propter hoc Gregorius Nyssenus in suo libro quem de anima fecit, imposuit Aristoteli quod posuit animam non per se subsistentem esse, et corrumpi corrupto corpore, quia posuit eam entelechiam, idest actum vel perfectionem physici corporis.

And for this reason Gregory of Nyssa in his book <i>De Anima</i> [PG XLV, 199] accused Aristotle of asserting that the soul is not self-subsistent, and that it is corrupted when the body is corrupted, because he asserted it as the entelechy, that is, as the act or perfection, of the physical body.

Est autem unumquodque actu per formam aliquam vel substantialem vel accidentalem, cum forma sit actus; sicut ignis est actu ignis per igneitatem, actu calidus per calorem. Oportet igitur principium huius operationis quod est intelligere, formaliter inesse huic homini. Principium autem huius operationis non est forma aliqua cuius esse sit dependens a corpore, et materiae obligatum sive immersum; quia haec operatio non fit per corpus, ut probatur in III de anima; unde principium huius operationis habet operationem sine communicatione materiae corporalis. Sic autem unumquodque operatur secundum quod est; unde oportet quod esse illius principii sit esse elevatum supra materiam corporalem, et non dependens ab ipsa. Hoc autem proprium est spiritualis substantiae. Oportet ergo dicere, si praedicta coniungantur, quod quaedam spiritualis substantia, sit forma humani corporis.
          <td>But yet, if one carefully studies the matter, it becomes clearly evident that some substance must be the form of the human body. For it is obvious that understanding belongs to "this particular man" (as, for instance, Socrates or Plato). Now no activity belongs to any given thing except through some form which exists in the thing itself, either a substantial or an accidental form, because nothing acts or functions except in consequence of its being actual. Now each individual thing is actual through some form, either substantial or accidental, since a form is an act; thus, for instance, fire is actually fire through "fireness", and actually hot through heat. Accordingly, it must be the case that the principle of that activity which is understanding should be in "this man" in the way of a form. Now the principle of this activity is not a form whose actual being is dependent on matter and tied down to or immersed in matter, because this activity is not effected by means of the body, as its proven in III <i>De Anima</i> [4, 429a 24]; and hence the principle of this activity possesses an activity that has nothing in common with corporeal matter. Now, the way in which each thing acts is a consequence of its being. Hence the actual being of that principle must be an actual being which is raised above corporeal matter and not dependent on it. Now this is characteristic of a spiritual substance. It is necessary to say, therefore, if the preceding considerations are put together, that some kind of substance is the form of the human body.

Si enim sint duae substantiae omnino disiunctae, una agente vel operante, alia non dicitur operari. Unde posuit intellectum illum, quem dicebat separatum omnino secundum esse a corpore, continuari cum hoc homine per phantasmata, hac ratione, quia species intelligibilis, quae est perfectio intellectus possibilis, fundatur in phantasmatibus a quibus abstrahitur. Sic ergo habet duplex esse: unum in intellectu possibili, cuius est forma; et aliud in phantasmatibus, a quibus abstrahitur.

          <td>But there are some who, while admitting that understanding is the act of a spiritual substance, have denied that such a spiritual substance is united to the body as a form. Among these Averroes asserted that the possible intellect, in its actual being, is separated from the body. He saw nevertheless that unless there were some union of it with "this man", its act could not pertain to "this man". For if there are two substances entirely unconnected, when one is acting or functioning, the other is not said to be functioning. And hence he asserted that such an intellect, which he said was entirely separated from the body in its actual being, is connected with "this man" through phantasms, for this reason, that the intelligible species, which is a perfection of the possible intellect, is based on the phantasms from which it is abstracted. So, therefore, it has a two-fold kind of actual being: one in the possible intellect, of which it is the form, and the other in the phantasms from which it is abstracted. Now the phantasms are in "this man" because the imaginative power is a power within the body; that is, one which has a corporeal organ. The intelligible species itself, therefore, is the medium which joins the possible intellect to "the individual man".

Per hoc autem quod species visibilis, quae est forma visus, fundatur in colore parietis, non coniungitur visus parieti ut videnti, sed ut viso; non enim per hoc paries videt, sed videtur.

Per hoc igitur magis demonstratur disiunctio intellectus possibilis a phantasmatibus quam continuatio. Oportet enim illa esse omnino disiuncta, quorum uni aliquid uniri non potest, nisi fuerit ab altero separatum.
          <td>But this connection is in no way sufficient to explain the fact that "this individual man" understands. For, as Aristotle says in his book III <i>De Anima</i> [7, 431a 14], the phantasms are related to the possible intellect as color is to the sight. Accordingly, the intelligible species abstracted from the phantasms is in the possible intellect in the same way as the species "color" is in the sense of sight. Now the intelligible species is in the phantasms in the same way as a species which makes seeing possible (species visibilis) is in the physical object which is a wall. Now owing to the fact that the species which makes seeing possible, the form "sight", is based on the color of the wall, the act of seeing is not connected with the wall as with a seeing object, but as with a seen object: for by means of it the wall does not see, but is seen; for what constitutes a knower is not the fact that there is in him a form whose image is in some knowing power, but the fact that there is in him the cognitive power itself. And "this man," accordingly, will not be one who understands because of the fact that in him are phantasms whose image, which is an intelligible species, is in the possible intellect; but it does follow because of this fact that his phantasms are understood by him. But the possible intellect itself, which is the understanding power, must be in "this man" in the way of a form, precisely in order that "this man" may understand. He seems to have made a mistake also in regard to the character of connection itself, since the intelligible species is not one with the possible intellect, save insofar as it has been abstracted from the phantasms: for only so is it understood in act, whereas insofar as it is in the phantasms it is understood only in potency." By this fact, then, is proved rather the disconnection of the possible intellect from the phantasms than its connection with them, for it must be the case that two things are entirely disconnected when something cannot be united to one of them unless it has been previously separated from the other.

          <td>Hac igitur opinione reiecta tanquam impossibili, considerandum est quod Plato efficacius posuit hunc hominem intelligere, nec tamen substantiam spiritualem uniri corpori ut formam.

Ex qua ratione dicit Aristoteles in I de generatione quod quaedam tangunt et non tanguntur, quia agunt et non patiuntur. Unde dicebat Plato, ut dictus Gregorius refert, quod homo non est aliquid compositum ex anima et corpore, sed est anima utens corpore, ut intelligatur esse in corpore quodammodo sicut nauta in navi. Quod videtur tangere Aristoteles in II de anima. Sic igitur et hic homo intelligit in quantum hic homo est ipsa substantia spiritualis, quae est anima, cuius actus proprius est intelligere; hac tamen substantia forma corporis non existente.
          <td>Setting aside this view then as impossible, we must consider that Plato produced a better result by asserting that "this man" understands, and yet that a spiritual substance is not united to the body as a form. For, as Gregory of Nyssa tells us [De An. PG XLV, 216], Plato asserted that the intellectual substance which is called the soul is united to the body by a kind of spiritual contact: and this is understood in the sense in which a thing that moves or acts touches the thing that is moved or is passive, even though it be incorporeal; and for this reason Aristotle says in I <i>De Generatione</i> [6, 323a 28] that certain things touch and yet are not touched, because they act and are not passive. And hence Plato used to say, as the aforesaid Gregory relates, that man is not something that is composed of soul and body, but is a soul using a body, so that he is understood to be in a body in somewhat the same way as a sailor is in a ship; and Aristotle seems to be touching upon this in II <i>De Anima</i> [1, 413a 8]. Thus, then, "this man" also understands, inasmuch as "this man" is the very spiritual substance which is the soul, whose proper act is understanding, even though, nevertheless, this substance does not exist as the form of the body.

Unde manifestum est quod anima est forma et quod quid erat esse huius corporis, id est a qua hoc corpus habet rationem suae speciei. Qualiter autem hoc esse possit inquirendum est.
          <td>But for the invalidation of this argument the one point suffices which Aristotle brings forward directly against this position in II <i>De Anima</i> [1, 412a]. For if the soul were not united to the body as a form, it would follow that the body and its parts would not have specific actual being through the soul; and this is seen to be obviously false: because once the soul departs, one does not say eye or flesh or bone, save equivocally, as one says painted eye or eye of stone. And hence it is obvious that the soul is the form and "the essence of this body", that is, that from which this body has the character of its own species. Exactly how this can be, however, we must proceed to investigate.

Forma autem corporis mineralis habet aliquam operationem excedentem qualitates activas et passivas, quae consequitur speciem ex influentia corporis caelestis; ut quod magnes attrahit ferrum, et quod sapphyrus curat apostema. Ulterius autem anima vegetabilis habet operationem, cui quidem deserviunt qualitates activae et passivae organicae; sed tamen supra posse huiusmodi qualitatum, ipsa effectum proprium sortitur nutriendo et augendo usque ad determinatum terminum, et alia huiusmodi complendo.

          <td>Now it must be borne in mind that the more perfect a form is, the more does it surpass corporeal matter. This is clear from induction in regard to the various orders of forms. For the form of an element does not have any activity but the one which takes place through active and passive qualities, which are the dispositions of corporeal matter. But the form "mineral body" has an activity that goes beyond active and passive qualities, and is a consequence of its species by reason of the influence of a heavenly body; for instance, that a magnet attracts iron, and that a sapphire cures an abscess. And further, the vegetative soul (anima vegetabilis) has an activity to which the active and passive organic qualities of course contribute; but nevertheless, over and above the power of qualities like these, the soul itself achieves an effect of its own by nurture and growth up to a definite limit, and by carrying on other functions of this sort. And the sensing soul ( <i>anima sensitiva</i> ) has a further activity to which the active and the passive qualities do not extend in any way, save insofar as they are needed for the composition of the organ through which this sort of activity is exercised; such as seeing, hearing, desiring, and the like.

And because the actual being of a thing is proportioned to its activity, as has been said, since each thing acts according as it is a being ( <i>ens</i> ), it must be the case that the actual being of the human soul surpasses corporeal matter, and is not totally included in it, but yet in some way is touched upon by it. Inasmuch, then, as it surpasses the actual being of corporeal matter, having of itself the power to subsist and to act, the human soul is a spiritual substance; but inasmuch as it is touched upon by matter and shares its own actual being with matter, it is the form of the body. Now it is touched upon by corporeal matter for this reason, that the highest point of the lowest always touches the lowest point of the highest, as Dionysius makes clear in the seventh chapter [lec. 4] of De Divinis Nominibus; and consequently the human soul, which is the lowest in the order of spiritual substances, can communicate its own actual being to the human body, which is the highest in dignity, so that from the soul and the body, as from form and matter, a single being results. But if a spiritual substance were composed of matter and form, it would be impossible for it to be the body's form: because it is essential to matter that it be not in anything else, but that it should itself be the primary subject.

Quod patet ex hoc quod in virtute ipsius animae est quod fluant ab ea quaedam potentiae quae non sunt actus organorum corporalium, secundum quod excedit corporis proportionem; et iterum quod fluant ab ea potentiae quae sunt actus organorum, in quantum potest contingi a materia corporali. Non est autem aliquid perfectum in sua natura, nisi actu explicari possit quod in eo virtute continetur. Unde anima, licet possit esse et intelligere a corpore separata, tamen non habet perfectionem suae naturae cum est separata a corpore ut Augustinus dicit, XII super Genes. ad litteram.
          <td>As to the fifth, it must be said that no part has the perfection of a nature, when separated from the whole. And hence the soul, since it is a part of a human nature, does not have the perfection of its own nature, save in union with the body. This is clear from the following fact: the soul itself has such virtuality that certain powers which are not acts of corporeal organs flow from it, inasmuch as it goes beyond its relationship with the body; and again, that powers which are acts of the organs flow from it, inasmuch as it can be dependent on corporeal matter. Nor is a thing perfect in its own nature unless what is virtually contained in it can be actually brought out. And hence the soul, although it can exist and can understand when separated from the body, nevertheless does not have the perfection of its own nature when it is separated from the body, as Augustine says in XII <i>Super Genesi ad Litteram</i> [35, 68].

          <td>Ad sextum dicendum quod miraculum non accipitur ibi secundum quod dividitur contra naturalem operationem, sed secundum quod etiam ipsa naturalia opera miracula dicuntur, prout ab incomprehensibili divina virtute procedunt. Et hoc modo dicit Augustinus super Ioan., quod mirabilius est quod Deus ex paucis granis tantam segetum multitudinem producit, quae sufficiat ad totius humani generis satietatem, quam quod ex quinque panibus quinque millia hominum satiavit.
          <td>As to the sixth, it must be said that "miracle" is not to be taken in that passage in the sense of something opposed to natural activity, but in the sense in which even natural works themselves are called miracles, seeing that they proceed from the incomprehensible power of God. And in this sense Augustine says in Super Joannem [24, 1 ] , that the fact that God produces from a few seeds as great a number of sheaves of grain as is sufficient to feed the whole human race is more marvelous than that He fed five thousand men with five loaves of bread.

Contingit tamen plerumque quod aliquid est pertinens ad naturam alicuius, ex quo tamen sequitur in eo aliqua debilitatio aut defectus: sicut componi ex contrariis est naturale animali, ex quo sequitur in eo mors et corruptio. Et similiter naturale est animae quod indigeat phantasmatibus ad intelligendum; ex quo tamen sequitur quod diminuatur in intelligendo a substantiis superioribus. Quod autem dicitur, quod anima a corpore praegravatur, hoc non est ex eius natura, sed ex eius corruptione, secundum illud Sapient. IX: corpus quod corrumpitur aggravat animam. Quod vero dicitur quod abstrahit se a nexibus corporalibus ut se intelligat, intelligendum est quod abstrahit se ab eis quasi ab obiectis, quia anima intelligitur per remotionem omnis corporeitatis; non tamen ab eis abstrahitur secundum esse. Quinimmo, quibusdam corporeis organis laesis, non potest anima directe nec se nec aliud intelligere, ut quando laeditur cerebrum.
          <td>As to the seventh, it must be said that that through which a thing is weakened, once its nature has been presupposed, is not something natural. Nevertheless it frequently happens that there is something which pertains to the nature of a thing, in consequence of which there nevertheless follows some weakness or defect in that thing: thus, for instance, to be composed of contraries is something natural to an animal, and in consequence of this death and corruption follow in it. And similarly it is something natural for the soul to need phantasms for understanding, and yet in consequence of this it follows that the soul, in its understanding, is made less than higher substances. As for the statement that the soul is weighed down by the body, this is not a consequence of the body's nature, but of its corruption, according to that passage in Wisdom IX [15]: "The body which is corrupted is a load upon the soul." But as for the statement that the soul withdraws itself from corporeal connections in order to understand itself, this must be understood as meaning that it abstracts itself from them as it abstracts from objects, because the soul is understood through the negation of all corporeity. Yet the soul is not withdrawn from them in its actual being; nay, rather, if certain corporeal organs have been harmed, the soul cannot directly understand either itself or anything else, as when the brain is injured.

          <td>Ad octavum dicendum quod quanto aliqua forma est altior, tanto plus indiget a potentiori agente produci. Unde cum anima humana sit altissima omnium formarum, producitur a potentissimo agente, scilicet Deo; alio tamen modo quam aliae formae a quibuscumque agentibus. Nam aliae formae non sunt subsistentes: unde esse non est earum, sed eis aliqua sunt; unde fieri earum est secundum quod materia vel subiectum reducitur de potentia in actum: et hoc est educi formam de potentia materiae absque additione alicuius extrinseci. Sed ipsa anima habet esse subsistens; unde sibi proprie debetur fieri, et corpus trahitur ad esse eius. Et propter hoc dicitur quod est ab extrinseco, et quod non educitur de potentia materiae.
          <td>As to the eighth, it must be said that the higher a form is, the more does it need to be produced by a more powerful agent. Hence, since the human soul is the highest of all forms, it is produced by the most powerful agent, namely, God; yet in a way quite different from the way in which other forms are produced by any agents whatever. For the other forms are not subsistent: and hence they do not possess actual being, but some things have being through them; and hence their coming into being is due to the fact that some matter or subject is brought from potency into act: and this is a bringing forth of the form from the potency of matter, without the addition of anything extrinsic. But the soul itself has subsistent actual being; and hence coming into being is strictly due to it, and the body is brought over to its actual being. And on this account it is said that the soul exists from the outside and that it is not brought forth from the potency of matter.

          <td>As to the tenth, it must be said that spirit fits in with spirit rather than with body by a congruity of nature. But by a congruity of relationship which is required between form and matter, spirit fits in with body more than spirit does with spirit: since two spirits are two acts, whereas the body is related to the soul as potency is to act.

Anima autem, licet sit incorruptibilis, non tamen est in alio genere quam corpus; quia cum sit pars humanae naturae, non competit sibi esse in genere vel specie, vel esse personam aut hypostasim, sed composito.

Now the soul, although it is incorruptible, is nevertheless in no other genus than the body because, since it is a part of a human nature, to be in a genus or in a species or to be a person or hypostasis is not characteristic of the soul, but of the composite. And hence, also, it cannot be called "this something", if by this phrase is meant an hypostasis or person, or an individual situated in a genus or in a species. But if "this something" means every thing which is able to be self-subsistent, in this sense the soul is "this something."

The physical organic body, therefore, having life potentially, is related to the soul as matter is to form. But this latter, namely, the physical organic body. does not exist except through some substantial form. Therefore that substantial form, whatever it may be, is present in matter before the spiritual substance which is the rational soul, and so for the same reason are the other subsequent forms, which are the sentient and the vegetative souls.

But the genus of man is "animal", which is derived from a sentient nature, whereas the difference is "rational", which is derived from the rational soul. Therefore the sentient nature is related to the rational soul as matter is to form. But the sentient nature is perfected by the sentient soul.

Eadem enim ratio esset de aliis qualitatibus, quarum quaelibet in duobus elementis invenitur. Si ergo dicatur quod remaneat idem specie sed differens numero, non erit facilior conversio aeris in ignem quam aquae in ignem; quia forma ignis habebit corrumpere duas qualitates in aere sicut in aqua. Relinquitur ergo quod sit idem calor numero.

          <td>19 Furthermore, according to the Philosopher in his book <i>De Generatione</i> [II, 4, 331a], air is more easily converted into fire than water is because of the fact that it agrees with fire in one quality, namely, heat. When, therefore, fire comes into being out of air, it is necessary that the heat remain specifically the same: because if the heat of fire and the heat of air were specifically different, there would be eight primary qualities and not four only; for the same reasoning would apply to the other qualities, every one of which is found in two elements. If, therefore, one were to say that it remains specifically the same but numerically different, the conversion of air into fire will not be easier than that of water into fire, because the form of fire will have to break up two qualities in the air just as it does in water. The only remaining alternative, therefore, is that the heat is numerically the same. But this cannot be unless there is already in existence some substantial form, which remains one in both and preserves the subject of heat as one; for an accident cannot be numerically one unless its subject is already one. One must therefore say that prior to the form of a simple body, some substantial form is presupposed in matter; much more so, then, prior to the rational soul.

Si enim anima rationalis unitur corpori solum per contactum virtualem, ut motor, ut aliqui posuerunt, nihil prohibebat dicere quod sunt multa media inter animam et corpus; et magis inter animam et materiam primam. Si vero ponatur anima uniri corpori ut forma, necesse est dicere, quod uniatur ei immediate. Omnis enim forma sive substantialis sive accidentalis, unitur materiae vel subiecto. Unumquodque enim secundum hoc est unum, secundum quod est ens. Est autem unumquodque ens actu per formam, sive secundum esse substantiale, sive secundum esse accidentale: unde omnis forma est actus; et per consequens est ratio unitatis, qua aliquid est unum. Sicut igitur non est dicere quod sit aliquod aliud medium quo materia habeat esse per suam formam, ita non potest dici quod sit aliquod aliud medium uniens formam materiae vel subiecto. Secundum igitur quod anima est forma corporis, non potest esse aliquid medium inter animam et corpus. Secundum vero quod est motor, sic nihil prohibet ponere ibi multa media; manifeste enim anima per cor movet alia membra, et etiam per spiritum movet corpus.
          <td>It must be said that the truth of this question depends to some extent on the preceding one. For if the rational soul is united to the body only through virtual contact, like a mover, as some have asserted, nothing would prevent us from saying that there are many intermediates between the soul and the body, and more so between the soul and prime matter. But if it be asserted that the soul is united to the body as a form, it must be said that it is united to the body immediately. For every form, whether substantial or accidental, is united to matter or to a subject. For each individual thing is one on the same basis on which it is a being. Now, each individual thing is actually a being through a form, whether in the case of actual substantial being or in the case of actual accidental being. And hence every form is an act, and as a consequence it is the reason for the unity whereby a given thing is one. Therefore, just as we cannot say that there is any other medium whereby matter has actual being through its own form, so it cannot be said that there is any other medium uniting a form to matter or to a subject. In consequence of the fact that the soul, then, is the form of the body, there cannot be any medium between the soul and the body. But in consequence of the fact that it is a mover, from this point of view nothing prevents our asserting many media there: for obviously the soul moves the other members of the body through the heart, and also moves the body through the spirit.

For some say that there are many substantial forms in the same individual, and that one of these is the substrate of another; and on this view prime matter is not the immediate subject of the ultimate substantial form, but underlies it, with intermediate forms acting as media, so that matter itself, viewed as subject of a form, is the proximate subject of the second form; and so on down to the ultimate form. Thus, then, the proximate subject of the rational soul is the body perfected by the sentient soul, and to this latter is united the rational soul as a form. The other opinion is that in one individual there is but one substantial form; and on this view it is necessary to say that through the substantial form, which is the human soul, this individual has not only "being man", but "being animal", and "being alive", and "being body", and "substance", and "being." And thus in this particular man no other substantial form is prior to the human soul, and consequently neither is any accidental form; because in that case one would have to say that prime matter is first perfected through an accidental form rather than through the substantial form, which is impossible: for every accident must be grounded on some substance.

Consideraverunt Platonici ordinem quemdam generum et specierum, et quod semper superius potest intelligi sine inferiori; sicut homo sine hoc homine, et animal sine homine, et sic deinceps. Existimaverunt etiam quod quidquid est abstractum in intellectu, sit abstractum in re; alias videbatur eis quod intellectus abstrahens esset falsus aut vanus, si nulla res abstracta ei responderet; propter quod etiam crediderunt mathematica esse abstracta a sensibilibus, quia sine eis intelliguntur. Unde posuerunt hominem abstractum ab his hominibus; et sic deinceps usque ad ens et unum et bonum, quod posuerunt summam rerum virtutem. Viderunt enim quod semper inferius particularius est suo superiori, et quod natura superioris participatur in inferiori: participans autem se habet ut materiale ad participatum; unde posuerunt quod inter abstracta quanto aliquid est universalius, tanto est formalius.
          <td>Now the diversity of these two opinions proceeds from the fact that some, in order to investigate the truths of nature, have taken as their starting point intelligible essences, and this was characteristic of the Platonists; whereas some began with sensible things, and this was characteristic of the philosophy of Aristotle, as Simplicius says in his commentary <i>Super Praedicamenta</i> [Preface]. The Platonists envisaged a definite order of genera and species, and held that the higher can always be understood apart from the lower, as, for instance, "man" apart from "this man", and "animal" apart from "man", and so on. They thought also that whatever is abstract in the intellect is abstract in reality; otherwise it seemed to them that the abstracting intellect would be false or futile, if there were no abstract thing corresponding to it; and on this account they also believed that mathematical objects exist apart from sensible things, because they are understood apart from them.' Hence they asserted "man in the abstract" apart from "these men", and so on up to "being", and "one", and "good", which they asserted as the highest virtue of things. For they saw that the lower is always more particular than what is above it, and that the nature of the higher is participated by the lower; now, that which participates serves as the material element for that which is participated, and hence they asserted that among abstract things the more universal a thing is, the more it is something formal.

          <td>Quidam vero secundum eamdem viam ingredientes, ex opposito posuerunt quod quanto aliqua forma est universalior, tanto est magis materialis. Et haec est positio Avicebron in libro fontis vitae; posuit enim materiam primam absque omni forma, quam vocavit materiam universalem, et dixit eam communem substantiis spiritualibus et corporalibus, cui dixit advenire formam universalem quae est forma substantiae. Materiam autem sic sub forma substantiae existentem in aliquo suo dixit recipere formam corporeitatis, alia parte eius, quae pertinet ad spirituales substantias, sine huiusmodi forma remanente; et sic deinceps posuit in materia formam sub forma secundum ordinem generum et specierum usque ad ultimam speciem specialissimam. Et haec positio, quamvis videatur discordare a prima, tamen secundum rei veritatem cum ea concordat, et est sequela eius. Posuerunt enim Platonici quod quanto aliqua causa est universalior et formalior, tanto eius perfectio in aliquo individuo magis est substrata; unde effectum primi abstracti, quod est bonum, posuerunt materiam primam, ut supremo agenti respondeat primum subiectum; et sic deinceps secundum ordinem causarum abstractarum et formarum participatarum in materia, sicut universalius abstractum est formalius, ita universalior forma participata est materialior.
          <td>But some, starting out along the same road, asserted on the contrary that the more universal a form is, the more material it is. And this is the position of Avicebron in his book Pons Vitae': he asserted a prime matter without any form which he called universal matter; and he said that it is common to spiritual and corporeal substances, and to it, he said, there is added a universal form which is the form of substance. Now, matter thus existing under the form of substance, he said, receives in a part of itself the form of corporeity, while another part of it which pertains to spiritual substances remains without a form of this sort. And so he proceeded to assert in matter one form under another according to the order of genera and species, down to the ultimate specific species. And this position, although it seems to disagree with the first, nevertheless in actual truth agrees with it and is a consequence of it. For the Platonists asserted that the more universal and the more formal a cause is, the more remote is its perfection in a given individual: and hence as an effect of the first abstract, that is, of the good, they put down prime matter, in order to have a primary subject corresponding to the supreme agent; and so following, according to the order of abstract causes and forms that have a share in matter, just as a more universal abstract is more formal, so a more universal participated form is more material.

          <td>Sed haec positio, secundum vera philosophiae principia, quae consideravit Aristoteles, est impossibilis. Primo quidem, quia nullum individuum substantiae esset simpliciter unum. Non enim fit simpliciter unum ex duobus actibus, sed ex potentia et actu, in quantum id quod est potentia fit actu; et propter hoc homo albus non est simpliciter unum, sed animal bipes est simpliciter unum, quia hoc ipsum quod est animal est bipes. Si autem esset seorsum animal et seorsum bipes, homo non esset unum sed plura, ut philosophus argumentatur in III et VIII Metaph. Manifestum est ergo, quod si multiplicarentur multae formae substantiales in uno individuo substantiae, individuum substantiae non esset unum simpliciter, sed secundum quid, sicut homo albus.
          <td>But this position, according to the true principles of philosophy which Aristotle considered, is an impossible one. In the first place, because no individual instance of substance would be "one" in an unqualified sense. For a thing that is one in an unqualified sense does not come into being from two acts, but from potency and act inasmuch as that which is in potency comes into being actually. And on this account "white man" is not one in an unqualified sense, but "two-footed animal" is one in an unqualified sense, because the very thing which is animal is two-footed. But if "animal" were something in isolation, and if "two-footed" were something in isolation, "man" would not be one but several, as the Philosopher argues in III and in VIII <i>Metaphysica</i> [4, 999b 25; 6, 1045a 16]. It is obvious, therefore, that if there were a manifold of many substantial forms in one individual instance of substance, the individual instance of substance would not be one in an unqualified sense, but in a qualified sense, like "white man."
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundo vero, quia in hoc consistit ratio accidentis quod sit in subiecto, ita tamen quod per subiectum intelligatur aliquod ens actu, et non in potentia tantum; secundum quem modum forma substantialis non est in subiecto sed in materia. Cuicumque ergo formae substernitur aliquod ens actu quocumque modo, illa forma est accidens. Manifestum est autem quod quaelibet forma substantialis, quaecumque sit, facit ens actu et constituit; unde sequitur quod sola prima forma quae advenit materiae sit substantialis, omnes vero subsequenter advenientes sint accidentales. Nec hoc excluditur per hoc quod quidam dicunt, quod prima forma est in potentia ad secundam; quia omne subiectum comparatur ad suum accidens ut potentia ad actum. Completior etiam esset forma corporis quae praestaret susceptibilitatem vitae, quam illa quae non praestaret. Unde si forma corporis inanimati facit ipsum esse subiectum, multo magis forma potentia vitam habentis facit ipsum esse subiectum; et sic anima esset forma in subiecto, quod est ratio accidentis.
          <td>Secondly, because the essential character of an accident consists in the fact that it is in a subject, yet in this sense, that by a subject is meant an actual being and not one merely in potency, and in this sense a substantial form is not in a subject but in matter. Whenever there is a form, therefore, of which some actual being is a substrate in any sense, that form is an accident. Now it is obvious that any substantial form, whatever it may be, makes a being actual and is a constituent thereof; and hence it follows that only the first form which comes to matter is substantial, whereas all those that come later are accidental. And this is not ruled out by what some say, that the first form is in potency to the second form; because every subject is related to its own accident as potency is to act. Besides, a form of a body which would bestow capacity for life would be more complete than one which did not: and hence, if the form of a non-living body makes that body to be an actual subject, much more does the form of a body that has life in potency make that body to be an actual subject; and thus the soul would be a form in a subject, which is the essential characteristic of an accident.

          <td>Tertio, quia sequeretur quod in adeptione postremae formae non esset generatio simpliciter, sed secundum quid tantum. Cum enim generatio sit transmutatio de non esse in esse, id simpliciter generatur quod fit ens simpliciter loquendo, de non ente simpliciter. Quod autem praeexistit ens actu non potest fieri ens simpliciter, sed potest fieri ens hoc, ut album vel magnum, quod est fieri secundum quid. Cum igitur forma praecedens in materia faciat esse actu, subsequens forma non faciet esse simpliciter, sed esse hoc, ut esse hominem vel asinum vel plantam; et sic non erit generatio simpliciter. Et propter hoc omnes antiqui, qui posuerunt materiam primam esse aliquid actu, ut ignem, aerem aut aquam, aut aliquid medium, dixerunt quod fieri nihil erat nisi alterari; et Aristoteles eorum dubitationem solvit ponendo materiam esse in potentia tantum, quam dicit esse subiectum generationis et corruptionis simpliciter. Et quia materia nunquam denudatur ab omni forma, propter hoc quandocumque recipit unam formam, perdit aliam, et e converso.
          <td>Thirdly, because it would follow that in the acquiring of the last form, there would be generation not in an unqualified sense but in a qualified sense only. For since generation is a changing over from non-being into actual being, a thing is generated in an unqualified sense when it becomes a being, unqualifiedly speaking, from non-being in an unqualified sense. Now a thing which is already in existence as an actual being cannot become a being in an unqualified sense, but it can become "this particular being", as, for instance, "white being" or "large being", and this is becoming in a qualified sense. Since, then, it is the preceding form in matter which produces actual being, a subsequent form will not produce actual being in an unqualified sense, but "being this particular thing", as, for instance, "being man" or "being ass" or "being plant"; and so there will not be generation in an unqualified sense. And on this account, all the ancients who asserted that prime matter is actually something, such as fire or air or water or something in between, said that becoming was nothing but change; and Aristotle solves their difficulty by asserting that matter exists only in potency, and he says that it is the subject of generation and corruption in an unqualified sense. And because matter is never denuded of all form, on this account whenever it receives one form it loses another, and vice versa.

          <td>Sic ergo dicimus quod in hoc homine non est alia forma substantialis quam anima rationalis; et quod per eam homo non solum est homo, sed animal et vivum et corpus et substantia et ens. Quod quidem sic considerari potest. Forma enim est similitudo agentis in materia. In virtutibus autem activis et operativis hoc invenitur quod quanto aliqua virtus est altior, tanto in se plura comprehendit, non composite sed unite; sicut secundum unam virtutem sensus communis se extendit ad omnia sensibilia, quae secundum diversas potentias sensus proprii apprehendunt. Perfectioris autem agentis est inducere perfectiorem formam. Unde perfectior forma facit per unum omnia quae inferiores faciunt per diversa, et adhuc amplius: puta, si forma corporis inanimati dat materiae esse et esse corpus, forma plantae dabit ei et hoc et insuper vivere; anima vero sensitiva et hoc, insuper et sensibile esse; anima vero rationalis et hoc, et insuper rationale esse. Sic enim inveniuntur differre formae rerum naturalium secundum perfectum et magis perfectum, ut patet intuenti. Propter quod species comparantur numeris, ut dicitur in VIII Metaph.: quorum species per additionem et subtractionem unitatis variantur. Unde etiam Aristoteles in II de anima dicit, quod vegetativum est in sensitivo, et sensitivum in intellectivo, sicut trigonum in tetragono, et tetragonum in pentagono; pentagonum enim virtute continet tetragonum: habet enim hoc et adhuc amplius; non autem quod seorsum in pentagono sit id quod est tetragoni, et id quod est pentagoni proprium, tanquam duae figurae. Sic etiam anima intellectiva virtute continet sensitivam, quia habet hoc et adhuc amplius; non tamen ita quod sint duae animae. Si autem diceretur quod anima intellectiva differret per essentiam a sensitiva in homine, non posset assignari ratio unionis animae intellectivae ad corpus, cum nulla operatio propria animae intellectivae sit per organum corporale.
          <td>Thus, therefore, we say that in "this man" there is no other substantial form than the rational soul, and that by it man is not only man, but animal, and living being, and body, and substance, and being. And this can be thought out in the following way. For the form is a likeness of the agent in the matter. Now, in the case of active and functioning powers what we find is this, that the higher a power is, the more things does it include within itself, not in composite fashion but as a unit; thus, for instance, as a single power the common sense extends itself to all sense-objects, which the special senses apprehend as different powers. Now, it is characteristic of a more perfect agent to produce a more perfect form. And hence a more perfect form does by means of one thing all that lower forms do by means of different things, and still more: for example, if the form of non-living body confers on matter "actual being" and "being a body", the form of plant will confer on it this too, and "life" besides; and the sentient soul will confer this too and besides it will confer "sentient being"; and the rational soul will also confer this and besides it will confer "rational being". For this is the way in which the forms of natural things are found to differ in the order of increasing perfection, as is clear to anyone who looks at all the genera and species of natural things; and on this account the species are compared to numbers, as is said in VIII <i>Metaphysica</i> [3, 1043b 33], the species of which are made different through adding and subtracting one. And hence Aristotle also says in II <i>De Anima</i> [3, 414b 31]: "The vegetative is in the sentient," and the sentient is in the intellectual, as "a triangle is in a quadrilateral" and a quadrilateral in a pentagon; for a pentagon virtually contains a quadrilateral: for it has this and still more; not that something proper to a quadrilateral and something proper to a pentagon exists outside the pentagon, as though there were two figures. So also the intellectual soul virtually contains the sentient soul, because it has this and still more, yet not in such a way that there are two souls. Now if we were to say that the intellectual soul differed essentially from the sentient soul in man, no reason could be given for the union of the intellectual soul with the body, since no activity proper to the intellectual soul takes place through a corporeal organ.

Secundum enim quod intelligitur corpus perfectum in esse sensibili ab anima, sic comparatur ad perfectionem ultimam quae est ab anima rationali in quantum huiusmodi, ut materiale ad formale.

For according as the body is understood as perfected in sensible being by the soul, in this sense it is related to the ultimate perfection, which comes from the rational soul as such, as a material element is related to a formal element. For since genus and species signify certain conceptual entities, a real distinction of forms is not needed for the distinction between a species and a genus, but only a mental distinction.

          <td>As to the fourth, it must be said that the soul moves the body through knowledge and appetite. However, the sentient and the appetitive power in an animal have a definite organ, and thus the movement of the animal originates in that organ which is the heart, according to Aristotle [ <i>De Gener. Anim.</i> II, 6, et saepe]. Thus, then, one part of the animal is what does the moving and the other is the part that is moved, so that the moving part may be taken to be the primary organ of the appetitive soul, and the remainder of the body is what is moved. But because in man the moving is done by the will and the intellect, which are not acts of any organ, the thing that does the moving will be the soul itself, considered on its intellectual side, whereas the moved thing will be the body, considered as something which is perfected by that soul in corporeal being.

Nor must it be said that the form comes into being or is corrupted, because coming into being and being corrupted are characteristics of that which has actual being, and actual being does not belong to a form as to something that exists, but as to that whereby something is.

Quidam vero dixerunt quod a principio inest anima vegetabilis; et illa eadem cum fuerit magis perfecta fit anima sensitiva, et tandem fit anima intellectiva, sed per actionem exterioris agentis quod est Deus. Sed hoc est impossibile. Primo, quia sequeretur quod forma substantialis reciperet magis et minus, et quod generatio esset motus continuus. Secundo, quia sequeretur animam rationalem esse corruptibilem, cum vegetabilis et sensibilis corruptibiles sint, dum ponitur fundamentum animae rationalis esse substantia vegetabilis et sensibilis. Non autem dici potest quod sint tres animae in uno homine, ut ostensum est. Relinquitur ergo dicendum quod in generatione hominis vel animalis sunt multae generationes et corruptiones sibi invicem succedentes. Adveniente enim perfectiori forma, deficit imperfectior. Et sic cum in embryone primo sit anima vegetativa tantum, cum perventum fuerit ad maiorem perfectionem, tollitur forma imperfecta, et succedit forma perfectior, quae est anima vegetativa et sensitiva simul; et ultimo cedente, succedit ultima forma completissima, quae est anima rationalis.
          <td>As to the thirteenth, it must be said that in the embryo certain vital functions are manifest. But some have said that such functions come from the soul of the mother; but this is impossible because it is an essential characteristic of vital functions that they come from an intrinsic principle which is the soul. On the other hand, some have said that from the outset the vegetative soul is present; and that same soul, when it is further perfected, becomes the sentient soul, and at length becomes the intellectual soul, but through the action of an outside agent which is God. But this is impossible: first, because it would follow that a substantial form is susceptible of degrees and that generation is a continuous movement; secondly, because it would follow that the rational soul is corruptible, so long as it is asserted that the foundation of the rational soul is a vegetative and sentient substance. Now it cannot be said that there are three souls in one man, as has been shown. The only thing left to say is that in the generation of man or of animal, there are many generations and corruptions succeeding one another reciprocally, for when a more perfect form comes the less perfect form fades away. And thus, although in the embryo there is first the vegetative soul only, when it has attained a greater perfection the imperfect form is taken away, and the more perfect form takes its place, i.e., a soul which is vegetative and sentient simultaneously; and when the last departs there comes in the most complete ultimate form, which is the rational soul.

Nec tamen sequitur quod abstrahentium sit mendacium, si corpus mathematicum sit in intellectu tantum: quia non intelligit intellectus abstrahens corpus aliquod esse non in sensibilibus, sed intelligit ipsum, non intelligendo sensibilia; sicut si quis intelligat hominem, non intelligendo eius risibilitatem, non mentitur; mentiretur autem, si intelligeret hominem non esse risibilem. Dico tamen quod si corpus mathematicum esset in corpore sensibili, cum corpus mathematicum sit dimensionale, tantum pertineret ad genus quantitatis; unde non requireretur ad ipsum aliqua forma substantialis.

          <td>As to the fourteenth, it must be said that a mathematical body is called an abstract body; and hence, to say that a mathematical body exists in sensible things is to say two opposite things at the same time, as Aristotle argues in III Metaphysica [2, 998a 7] against certain Platonists who make this assertion. And yet it does not follow that abstraction is falsification, if a mathematical body exists in the intellect only: because the abstracting intellect does not think that some body exists which is not in sensible things, but it thinks that body by not thinking sensible objects; thus, for instance, if someone thinks "man", not thinking his risibility, he is not falsifying; but he would be falsifying if he thought "man is not a risible being." I say, nevertheless, that if "mathematical body" were in "sensible body", then since "mathematical body" has dimensions, it pertains only to the genus of quantity; hence no substantial form would be needed. But "body" which is in the genus of substance has a substantial form which is called "corporeity", which is not three dimensions, but is any substantial form whatever from which the three dimensions follow in matter, and this form in fire is "fireness", in the animal the sentient soul, and in man the intellectual soul.

For among the celestial bodies themselves, one is more universally active than another: nor does the more universal agent act apart from inferior agents, but the ultimate proper agent acts in virtue of all the higher agents.

But the soul acts where it is not; for Augustine says in his letter to Volusianus [ <i>Epistola</i> CXXXVII, II, 5]: the soul feels and sees in the heavens, where it is not. It is not, therefore, necessary for the soul to be in every part of the body.

Now it may be the case that one part of the body is moved while another is at rest.

Therefore, since the shape of the whole is not found in a part, the soul will not be in a part. And this is what the same Commentator says on the same book [comm. 94, f. 126r], "that if the heart has a natural capacity for receiving a soul because it has a particular kind of shape, it is obvious that a part of it does not receive that soul, because a part does not have that particular shape."

But this seems impossible. For there are three ways in which a thing begins to exist where it previously was not: either through the fact that something quite new comes into being, as when the soul is created and is infused into the body; or through a changing over of the thing itself, as when the body is changed from place to place; or through the change of another thing into the thing itself, as when Christ's body begins to exist on the altar.

Posterius vero ostensum est quod anima non praesupponit alias formas substantiales in materia, quae dent esse substantiale corpori aut partibus eius; sed et totum corpus et omnes eius partes habent esse substantiale et specificum per animam, qua recedente, sicut non manet homo aut animal aut vivum, ita non manet manus aut oculus aut caro aut os nisi aequivoce, sicut depicta aut lapidea. Sic igitur, cum omnis actus sit in eo cuius est actus, oportet animam, quae est actus totius corporis et omnium partium, esse in toto corpore et in qualibet eius parte.
          <td>It must be said that the truth of this question depends on the preceding ones. For it has previously been pointed out that the soul is united to the body not only as a mover, but as a form. And later on it was shown that a soul does not presuppose in matter other substantial forms, which would give substantial actual being to a body or to its parts; but that both the whole body and all its parts have actual substantial and specific being through the soul, and, when the soul departs, just as "man" or "animal" or "living body" does not remain, so neither "eye" nor "flesh" nor "bone" remain, except in an equivocal sense, like things painted or made of stone. Thus, then, since every act is in that of which it is the act, it must be that the soul, which is the act of the whole body and of all the parts, is in the whole body and in every one of its parts.

In istis rebus corruptibilibus formae imperfectiores, quae sunt debilioris virtutis, habent paucas operationes, ad quas non requiritur partium dissimilitudo; sicut patet in omnibus inanimatis corporibus. Anima vero, cum sit forma altioris et maioris virtutis, potest esse principium diversarum operationum, ad quarum executionem requiruntur dissimiles partes corporis. Et ideo omnis anima requirit diversitatem organorum in partibus corporis cuius est actus; et tanto maiorem diversitatem, quanto anima fuerit perfectior. Sic igitur formae infimae uniformiter perficiunt suam materiam; sed anima difformiter, ut ex dissimilibus partibus constituatur integritas corporis, cuius primo et per se anima est actus.
          <td>But yet the whole body is related in one way to the soul and in another to its parts. For the soul is indeed the act of the whole body primarily and essentially, but of the parts in their relation to the whole. To make this clear it must be considered that, since matter is for the sake of form, the matter must be such as suits the form. In those things which are subject to corruption the more imperfect forms, which are of weaker power, have few activities, for which dissimilarity of parts is not required, as is clear in the case of all inanimate bodies. But the soul, since it is a form of higher and greater power, can be the principle of different activities, for the carrying out of which dissimilar parts of the body are required. And consequently every soul requires a diversity of organs in parts of the body of which it is the act; and all the greater diversity in proportion as the soul is more perfect. Thus, then, the lowest forms perfect their matter in a uniform way, but the soul does this in a non-uniform way, with the result that the entirety of the body of which the soul is primarily and essentially the act is made up of dissimilar parts.

Sed hoc est illarum tantum formarum quae coextenduntur quantitati; quod ex hoc competit aliquibus formis, quia habent materiam similem aut fere similem et in toto et in parte. Unde formae quae requirunt magnam dissimilitudinem in partibus, non habent huiusmodi extensionem et totalitatem, sicut animae, praecipue animalium perfectorum. Secunda autem totalitas attenditur secundum perfectionem essentiae, cui totalitati etiam respondent partes essentiae, physice quidem in compositis materia et forma, logice vero genus et differentia; quae quidem perfectio in formis accidentalibus recipit magis et minus, non autem in substantialibus. Tertia autem totalitas est secundum virtutem. Si ergo loqueremur de aliqua forma habente extensionem in materia, puta de albedine, possemus dicere quod est tota in qualibet parte totalitate essentiae et virtutis, non autem totalitate prima, quae est ei per accidens; sicut tota ratio speciei albedinis invenitur in qualibet parte superficiei, non autem tota quantitas quam habet per accidens, sed pars in parte.
          <td>But we still have to inquire into the statement: the soul is wholly in the whole and wholly in each individual part. To make this clear, we must consider that wholeness is primarily and more obviously something based on quantity, inasmuch as a whole is called a quantum, which is naturally susceptible of division into quantitative parts; and this sort of wholeness cannot be ascribed to forms except in an accidental sense, namely, insofar as they are accidentally divided by the division of a quantity, as whiteness is divided by the division of a surface. But this is characteristic of those forms only which are extended along with quantity; and the reason why this latter property belongs to some forms is that they have similar, or almost similar, matter in their whole and in a part. And hence forms which require great dissimilarity in the parts do not have this sort of extension and wholeness, as, for instance, souls, especially those of perfect animals. Now the second kind of wholeness is considered on the basis of the perfection of an essence, and is a wholeness to which essential parts correspond: the physical parts, matter and form, in the case of composites, and the logical parts, genus and difference; and this perfection is susceptible of degrees in the case of accidental forms, but not in the case of substantial forms. The third sort of wholeness is on a basis of powers If, then, we were to speak of a given form which has extension in matter, such as "whiteness", we might say that the whiteness is wholly in every part by a wholeness of essence and of power, but not by the first sort of wholeness, which belongs to it accidentally; thus the whole character of the species "whiteness" is found in every part of the surface; the total quantity which it accidentally possesses, however, is not, but part of this is in a part.

And hence if the soul's wholeness is taken in the sense of wholeness of power, not only is the soul not wholly in every part, but neither is it wholly in the whole body; because the power of the soul exceeds the body's capacity, as has been said above [Art. II, Resp.].

Thus, therefore, when someone is said to be acting in this or in that place, that statement can be understood in two senses. In one sense, that by adverbs of this sort the verb is modified from the standpoint of the activity going out from the agent, and in this sense it is true that wherever the soul acts, there it is.

          <td>As to the seventh, it must be said that the soul, when the body is moved, is moved accidentally and not of itself. Now it is not incongruous that a thing be at once moved and at rest accidentally, in different respects.

Unde in animalibus in quibus figura partis fere est conformis figurae totius, pars recipit animam ut quoddam totum: quare decisa vivit.

          <td>As to the ninth, it must be said that a soul is said to be in a body through a definite shape, not in the sense that the shape is the cause of its being in the body, but rather the shape of the body results from the soul; and hence where there is no shape suited to "this soul", "this soul" cannot actually be. But the soul requires one shape in the whole body of which it is in a prior sense the act, and another in a part, of which it is the act in relation to the whole, as has been said. And hence in the case of animals in which the shape of a part is almost of the same form as the shape of the whole, a part receives the soul as a kind of whole; and therefore a part that has been cut off is alive. Yet in the case of perfect animals, in which the shape of a part would differ greatly from the shape of the whole, a part does not receive the soul as would something whole and primarily perfectible, so as to be alive when cut off; it does nevertheless receive the soul in relation to the whole, so as to be alive when united to the whole.

          <td>1 For Origen says in I <i>Peri Archon</i> [VI, PG XI, 170]: "It is proper to God alone, that is, to the Father, to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost that... He be understood to exist without any addition of a corporeal union." Therefore no created spiritual substance can exist that is not united to a body.

          <td>3 Furthermore, Bernard in <i>Super Canticum</i> [sermo V, PL CLXXXIII, 800] says: "It is clear that every created spirit... needs bodily comfort." Now it is obvious that, since nature does not fall short in what is necessary, much less does God. Therefore no created spirit is found without a body.

Quod autem potest in non esse deficere, non omnino est supra tempus; potest enim nunc esse, et in alio nunc non esse. Non est ergo possibile aliquas creatas substantias absque corporibus esse.
          <td>4 Furthermore, if any created spiritual substance is entirely dissociated from a body, it must be above time, for time does not go beyond corporeal things. But created spiritual substances are not entirely above time. For since they have been created from nothingness and consequently take their beginning from change, they must be subject to change in such a way that they can lapse into non-being unless held together by some other being. Now that which can lapse into non-being is not wholly above time. For it can be at one time and not be at another. Therefore it is not possible for any created substances to be without bodies.

Since, then, being moved locally presupposes sensation and life, as is clear from II <i>De Anima</i> [2-3], it would seem that the bodies assumed by angels have sensation and life, and so they are naturally united to bodies; and yet as regards the angels it would seem that they especially are free from bodies. Therefore there is no created spiritual substance which is not united to a body.

          <td>6 Furthermore, an angel is naturally more perfect than a soul. Now that which lives and gives life is more perfect than that which merely lives.

Cognoscunt igitur Angeli singularia per formas particulares, quae requirunt organa corporalia sibi unita in quibus recipiantur. Ergo Angeli habent organa corporalia sibi unita; et sic nullus spiritus creatus videtur esse omnino a corpore absolutus.
          <td>7 Furthermore, it is obvious that angels know singular things; otherwise it would be pointless to assign them to men as guardians. Now they cannot know singular things through universal forms, because in that event their knowledge would be the same with reference to the past and to the future, and this in spite of the fact that to know the future belongs to God alone. Accordingly angels know singular things through particular forms, which require corporeal organs wherein they may be received. Therefore angels have corporeal organs united to themselves; and thus it would seem that no created spirit is entirely free from a body.

Now angels are individuals of a sort; otherwise they would not have actions of their own; for to act is characteristic of particular individuals.

          <td>9 Furthermore, since created spirits are finite substances, they must be in a definite genus and species. Accordingly there is to be found in them the universal nature of a species. Now they do not receive their individuation from this universal nature itself. Therefore there must be something additional whereby they are individuated. Now this cannot be anything material which would enter into the composition of an angel, since angels are immaterial substances, as was said above. It must be the case, therefore, that some corporeal matter is added to them, whereby they are individuated; and thus we reach the same conclusion as before.

It would seem, therefore, that created spiritual substances are united to corporeal matter.

Quos etiam secuti videntur Manichaei haeretici, qui Deum lucem quamdam corpoream per infinita distensam spatia esse existimabant.

          <td>It must be said that, because our knowledge has its beginning from sensation and sensation belongs to corporeal things, from the beginning men searching out the truth were able to grasp only corporeal nature, to such an extent that the first natural philosophers used to think that nothing existed but bodies; and hence they also used to say that the soul itself is a body. The Manichaean heretics, who thought that God is a kind of corporeal light extended over infinite space, also seem to have followed them. So too the Anthropomorphites, who fabricated God as a being formed with the features of the human body, surmised that nothing existed beyond bodies.

Et hoc vocabat intellectum distinguentem et moventem omnia, quem nos dicimus Deum. Plato vero est alia via usus ad ponendum substantias incorporeas. Existimavit enim quod ante omne esse participans, necesse est ponere aliquid abstractum participatum. Unde cum omnia corpora sensibilia participent ea quae de ipsis praedicantur, scilicet naturas generum et specierum et aliorum universaliter de ipsis dictorum, posuit huiusmodi naturas abstractas a sensibilibus per se subsistentes, quas substantias separatas nominabat.
          <td>But later philosophers, transcending corporeal things in a rational way through the intellect, arrived at a knowledge of incorporeal substance. First among these was Anaxagoras who, because he asserted that from the beginning all corporeal things were mixed together, was forced to assert, in addition to the corporeal, something incorporeal and unmixed, which would differentiate and move corporeal things. And this he used to call "mind", which differentiates and moves all things, and we call it God. Plato, however, employed another way of asserting incorporeal substances. For he thought that prior to being which participates, something abstract and unparticipated should be asserted. And hence, since all bodies that can be sensed participate in those things which are predicated of themselves, namely, generic and specific natures and the natures of the other predicates universally applied to them, he asserted natures of this sort, abstracted from what is sensible and self-subsistent, and these he called "separated substances."

Si autem finis alicuius motus non semper eodem modo se habeat, sed moveatur per se vel per accidens, necesse est illum motum non semper uniformiter se habere; unde motus naturalis gravium et levium magis intenditur cum appropinquat ad hoc quod est esse in loco proprio. Videmus autem in motibus caelestium corporum semper uniformitatem servari; ex quo existimavit huius uniformis motus perpetuitatem. Oportebat igitur ut poneret finem huius motus non moveri nec per se nec per accidens. Omne autem corpus vel quod est in corpore, mobile est per se vel per accidens. Sic ergo necessarium fuit quod poneret aliquam substantiam omnino a corpore separatam, quae esset finis motus caelestis.
          <td>Aristotle, however [Met. XII, 8, 1073a], proceeded to assert separated substances as a result of the perpetuity of the movement of the heavens. For one must assign some ends for the movement of the heavens. Now, if the end of a given movement is not always constant in its mode of being, but it is moved of itself or accidentally, the movement must necessarily be lacking in uniformity. And hence the natural movement of heavy or of light bodies becomes stronger when it gets nearer to the state of "being in its proper place". Now we see that in the movements of heavenly bodies uniformity is always preserved, and from this he concluded to the perpetuity of the uniform movement. Accordingly he had to assert that the end of this particular movement was something that is not moved either of itself or accidentally. Now every body or anything else which is in a body is movable either of itself or accidentally. Thus, therefore, he had to posit some substance entirely separated from a body, which would be the end of the movement of the heavens.

          <td>In hoc autem videtur tres praedictae positiones differre, quod Anaxagoras non habuit necesse ponere secundum principia ab eo supposita nisi unam substantiam incorpoream. Plato autem necesse habuit ponere multas et ad invicem ordinatas, secundum multitudinem et ordinem generum et specierum et aliorum, quae abstracta ponebat; posuit enim primum abstractum, quod essentialiter esset bonum et unum, et consequenter diversos ordines intelligibilium et intellectuum. Aristoteles autem posuit plures substantias separatas. Cum enim in caelo appareant multi motus, quorum quemlibet ponebat esse uniformem et perpetuum; cuiuslibet autem motus oportet esse aliquem proprium finem, ex quo finis talis motus debet esse substantia incorporea, consequens fuit ut poneret multas substantias incorporeas ad invicem ordinatas secundum naturam et ordinem caelestium motuum. Nec ultra in eis ponendis processit, quia proprium philosophiae eius fuit a manifestis non discedere.
          <td>Now the three positions mentioned above seem to differ in this respect: that Anaxagoras, on the basis of the principles laid down by him, did not consider it necessary to posit more than one incorporeal substance. Plato, however, considered it necessary to posit many substances that were mutually ordered according to the number and order of genera and species and of the other things which he posited as abstracts. For he posited a first abstract, which would be essentially the good and the one, and after that the different orders of intelligible things and of intellects. As for Aristotle, he posited several separated substances. For, since there appear in the heavens many movements of which he asserted that every one was uniform and perpetual and for each and every movement there had to be a proper end, and since the end of a movement of this sort ought to be an incorporeal _substance, the consequence was that he posited many' incorporeal substances, mutually ordered according to the nature and order of the movements of the heavens. Nor did he proceed further in asserting them, because it was characteristic of his philosophy not to depart from obvious data.

          <td>But those ways are not very suitable for us, because we do not assert with Anaxagoras the mixing of sensible things, nor with Plato the separateness of universals, nor with Aristotle the perpetuity of movement.

          <td>Primo igitur apparet esse aliquas substantias omnino a corporibus absolutas ex perfectione universi. Talis enim videtur esse universi perfectio, ut non desit ei aliqua natura quam possibile sit esse; propter quod singula dicuntur bona, omnia autem simul valde bona. Manifestum est autem quod si aliqua duo sunt, quorum unum ex altero non dependeat secundum suam rationem, possibile est illud sine alio inveniri: sicut animal secundum suam rationem non dependet a rationali; unde possibile est inveniri animalia non rationalia. Est autem de ratione substantiae quod per se subsistat; quod nullo modo dependet a corporis ratione, cum ratio corporis quaedam accidentia, scilicet dimensiones, aliquo modo respiciat, a quibus non causatur subsistere. Relinquitur igitur quod post Deum, qui non continetur in aliquo genere, inveniantur in genere substantiae aliquae substantiae a corporibus absolutae.
          <td>First then it is apparent that there are some substances wholly free from bodies, in consequence of the perfection of the universe. For the perfection of the universe seems to be such that it does not lack any nature which can possibly exist, and this is why [Genesis I] each thing is said to be good, and all things together exceedingly good. Now it is obvious that if there are any two things, one of which does not depend on the other on the basis of its own character, it is possible for the one to be found apart from the other: thus, for instance, "animal" on the basis of its own character does not depend on "rational". And hence it is possible to find animals that are not rational. Now it is characteristic of substance to be self-subsistent, and it does not depend in any way on the character of "body", since the character of "body" is somehow related to certain accidents (namely, dimensions) by which subsistence is not caused. Therefore the only remaining alternative is that after God, Who is not included in any genus, there are to be found in the genus "substance" some substances which are free from bodies.

          <td>Secundo potest idem considerari ex ordine rerum, qui talis esse invenitur ut ab uno extremo ad alterum non perveniatur nisi per media: sicut sub corpore caelesti invenitur immediate ignis, sub quo aer, sub quo aqua, sub quo terra, secundum scilicet consequentiam nobilitatis et subtilitatis horum corporum. Est autem in summo rerum vertice id quod est omnibus modis simplex et unum, scilicet Deus. Non igitur possibile est quod immediate sub Deo collocetur corporalis substantia, quae est omnino composita et divisibilis. Sed oportet ponere multa media per quae deveniatur a summa simplicitate divina ad corpoream multiplicitatem; quorum mediorum aliqua sunt substantiae incorporeae corporibus non unitae, aliqua vero substantiae incorporeae corporibus unitae.
          <td>In the second place, the same consideration can be arrived at in consequence of the orderly arrangement of things, which is found to be such that we cannot go from one extreme to the other except through intermediates: thus, for instance, fire is found immediately beneath "heavenly body", and beneath this air, and beneath this water, and beneath this earth, following the sequence of the nobility and subtlety of these bodies. Now at the topmost summit of things there is a being which is in every way simple and one, namely, God. It is not possible, then, for corporeal substance to be located immediately below God, for it is altogether composite and divisible, but instead one must posit many intermediates, through which we must come down from the highest point of the divine simplicity to corporeal multiplicity. And among these intermediates, some are corporeal substances that are not united to bodies, while others, on the contrary, are incorporeal substances that are united to bodies.

          <td>Tertio, apparet idem ex proprietate intellectus. Manifestum est enim quod intelligere est operatio quae per corpus fieri non potest, ut probatur in III de anima. Unde oportet quod substantia cuius est haec operatio, habeat esse non dependens a corpore, sed supra corpus elevatum; sicut enim est unumquodque, ita operatur. Si ergo aliqua substantia intelligens corpori uniatur, hoc non erit ei in quantum est intelligens, sed secundum aliquid aliud; sicut supra dictum est, quod necessarium est, animam humanam uniri corpori, in quantum indiget operationibus per corpus exercitis ad complementum intellectualis operationis, prout intelligit a phantasmatibus abstrahendo. Quod quidem accidit intellectuali operationi, et pertinet ad imperfectionem ipsius, ut ex his quae sunt intelligibilia solum in potentia scientiam capiat; sicut est de imperfectione visus vespertilionis, quod necesse habeat videre in obscuro. Quod autem per accidens adiungitur alicui, non in omnibus cum eo invenitur. Oportet etiam quod ante esse imperfectum in aliquo genere, inveniatur id quod est perfectum in genere illo; quia perfectum est naturaliter prius imperfecto, sicut actus potentia. Relinquitur igitur quod oportet ponere aliquas substantias incorporeas corpori non unitas, utpote non indigentes aliquo corpore ad intellectualem operationem.
          <td>Thirdly, the same is apparent from the special character of the intellect. For understanding is obviously an activity which cannot take place by means of the body, as is proven in III De Anima [4, 429ab]. And hence the substance whereof this is an activity must have actual being that does not depend on the body, but is raised above the body, for the activity of each thing corresponds to its being. If, therefore, some understanding substance is united to a body, it will not be so united insofar as it understands, but on some other basis; thus it was said above that it is necessary for the human soul to be united with a body insofar as it lacks the activities which are exercised through the body to make its intellectual activity complete, seeing that it understands by abstracting from phantasms. Actually this latter is something accidental to intellectual activity, and it pertains to its imperfection to get knowledge from things which are intelligible only in potency; just as it pertains to the imperfection of the sight of the bat that it has need to see in the dark. Now whatever is accidentally connected with a thing is not found with it in all cases. Besides, it must be the case that, prior to an imperfect being in a given genus, there is to be found a perfect being in that genus, because the perfect is naturally prior to the imperfect, as act is prior to potency. The only remaining alternative, then, is that one must posit some incorporeal substances that are not united to a body, as not needing a body for intellectual activity."

And as for the statement that created spiritual substance can be changed into non-being ( <i>non esse</i> ), this has no reference to any potency existing in them, but to a power of the agent. For, just as before they existed they were able to exist only through the power of an agent, so, when they do exist, they can cease to exist only through the power of God, Who can take away His conserving hand. But in them there is no potency for non-being, such that they may be measured by time in the way in which things that can be moved, even though they are not moved, are measured by time.

But on the other hand, either there is another substantial form in the human body beside the rational soul, which gives actual being to the body, or there is not. If there is not, but the soul itself gives actual substantial being to a body: since the soul is the noblest of forms, it will follow that the form through which the human body is a body is more noble than the form through which a heavenly body is a body. But if there should be another substantial form in man which gives actual being to the body besides a rational soul, it is obvious that through that form a human body is able to take on a rational soul. Now that which is able to take on perfect goodness is better than that which is not, as is said in II <i>De Caelo et Mundo</i> [12, 292b]. If, therefore, a heavenly body is not able to take on a rational soul, it will still follow that the form through which the human body is a body is more noble than the form through which the heavenly body is a 'body; which seems incongruous.

Now nothing violent can go on forever. Therefore the heavens are not forever at rest after the day of judgment as we assert according to faith.

          <td>10 Furthermore, as the Commentator says on XI <i>Metaphysica</i> [XII, comm. 48], the separated substances are in the best disposition in which they can possibly be: and this means that each one of them moves a heavenly body both as an agent and as an end. Now this could not be the case unless they were somehow united to them. Therefore incorporeal substances are united to the heavenly bodies; and thus the heavenly bodies would seem to be animate.

          <td>Utraque autem opinio rationem probabilitatis habet. Consideratio enim nobilitatis corporum caelestium inducit ad ponendum ea esse animata, cum in rerum genere viventia omnibus non viventibus praeferantur; sed consideratio nobilitatis substantiarum spiritualium ad contrarium nos inducit. Non enim superiores spirituales substantiae habere possunt de operibus animae, nisi quae pertinent ad intellectum: quia aliae operationes vitae sunt actus animae in quantum est forma corporis corruptibilis et transmutabilis; cum quadam enim transmutatione et alteratione corporali sunt; nec intellectus superiorum substantiarum indigere videtur ut a sensibilibus cognitionem accipiat, sicut intellectus noster. Si ergo nulla est in eis de operationibus vitae nisi intelligere et velle, quae non indigent organo corporali, earum dignitas unionem ad corpus excedere videtur. Harum autem duarum considerationum, secunda efficacior est quam prima. Unio enim corporis et animae non est propter corpus, ut corpus scilicet nobilitetur; sed propter animam, quae indiget corpore ad sui perfectionem, sicut supra dictum est.
          <td>Both opinions, however, have the character of probability. For the consideration of the nobility of the heavenly bodies leads to asserting that they are animate, since in the genus of "things" living things are preferred to all non-living things. But the consideration of the nobility of spiritual substances leads us to the contrary view. For higher spiritual substances cannot have any of the activities of the soul except those which pertain to the intellect: because the other activities of life are the acts of the soul insofar as it is the form of a corruptible and changeable body; for these activities take place along with a certain change and corporeal alteration. Nor does the intellect of higher substances seem to need to get knowledge from sensible things, as our intellect does. If, therefore, none of the activities of life are in them except understanding and willing, which do not need a corporeal organ, their dignity would seem to exceed union with a body. Of these two considerations, however, the second is more effective than the first. For the union of soul and body does not take place for the sake of the body, namely, that the body may be ennobled, but for the sake of the soul; which needs the body for its own perfection, as was said above [Art. II, Obj. 5].

Non enim potest dici quod motus corporis caelestis consequatur aliquam formam corpoream, sicut motus sursum consequitur formam ignis. Manifestum est enim quod una forma naturalis non inclinat nisi ad unum. Ratio autem motus repugnat unitati, quia de ratione motus est quod aliquid aliter se habeat nunc et prius; unde non inclinat forma naturalis ad motum propter ipsum motum, sed propter esse in aliquo ubi, quo adepto quiescit motus; et sic accideret in motu caeli, si consequeretur aliquam formam naturalem. Oportet igitur dicere, quod motus caeli sit ab aliqua substantia intelligente. Nam finis huius motus non potest esse nisi quoddam bonum intelligibile abstractum, propter quod movet substantia intelligens quae movet caelum, ut scilicet assequatur eius similitudinem, in operando, et ut explicet in actu id quod virtute continetur in illo intelligibili bono; et praecipue completio numeri electorum, propter quos omnia alia esse videntur.
          <td>Now, if one studies the matter more closely, he will perhaps find that there is either little or no discrepancy between these two opinions; and this is to be understood as follows. For it cannot be said that the movement of a heavenly body is a consequence of some corporeal form, as movement upwards is a consequence of the form "fire". For it is obvious that a single natural form tends toward but one thing. Now the character of movement is at variance with oneness, because it is of the essence of movement that a thing should be otherwise in the present and at a previous time. And hence a natural form does not tend toward movement for the sake of the movement itself but for the sake of being in some place, and when this has been reached the movement ceases; and this is what would happen in the case of the movement of the heavens if it were a consequence of some natural form. One should say then that the movement of the heavens comes from some intelligent substance. For the end of this movement can only be a certain abstract intelligible good, for the sake of which the intelligent substance which moves the heavens does its moving, namely, in order that it may take on a likeness of that good in its working and in order that what is virtually contained in that intelligible good may be made explicit in act; and especially the filling up of the number of the Elect, for whose sake all other things seem to exist.

          <td>Sic igitur erit duplex ordo substantiarum spiritualium. Quarum quaedam erunt motores caelestium corporum, et unientur eis sicut motores mobilibus, sicut et Augustinus dicit in III de Trinitate, quod omnia corpora reguntur a Deo per spiritum vitae rationalem; et idem a Gregorio habetur in IV dialogorum. Quaedam vero erunt fines horum motuum, quae sunt omnino abstractae, et corporibus non unitae. Aliae vero uniuntur corporibus caelestibus per modum quo motor unitur mobili. Et hoc videtur sufficere ad salvandum intentionem Platonis et Aristotelis. Et de Platone quidem manifestum est; Plato enim, sicut supra dictum est, etiam corpus humanum non dixit aliter animatum, nisi in quantum anima unitur corpori ut motor. Ex dictis vero Aristotelis manifestum est quod non posuit in corporibus caelestibus de virtutibus animae nisi intellectivam. Intellectus vero, secundum ipsum, nullius corporis actus est. Dicere autem ulterius, quod corpora caelestia hoc modo sint animata sicut inferiora corpora quae per animam vegetantur et sensificantur, repugnat incorruptibilitati caelestium corporum. Sic igitur negandum est corpora caelestia esse animata eo modo quo ista inferiora corpora animantur. Non est tamen negandum corpora caelestia esse animata, si per animationem nihil aliud intelligatur quam unio motoris ad mobile. Et istos duos modos videtur Augustinus tangere in super Gen. ad litteram. Dicit enim: solet quaeri, utrum caeli luminaria ista conspicua corpora sola sint, aut habeant rectores quosdam spiritus suos; et si habent, utrum ab eis etiam vitaliter inspirentur, sicut animantur carnes per animas animalium. Sed licet ipse sub dubio utrumque relinquat, ut per sequentia patet, secundum praemissa dicendum est quod habent rectores spiritus, a quibus tamen non sic animantur sicut inferiora animalia a suis animabus.
          <td>Thus, then, there will be two orders of spiritual substances. Some of these will be movers of the heavenly bodies and are united to them as movers are to movable things, as Augustine also says in III <i>De Trinitate</i> [IV, 9] that all bodies are ruled by God through the rational spirit of life; and the same view is held by Gregory in IV <i>Dialogi</i> [VI, PL LXXVII, 329]. But some substances will be ends of these movements, and these are wholly abstracted and not united to bodies; but others are united to heavenly bodies in the way in which a mover is united to a mobile thing. This seems to suffice for preserving the meaning of Plato and of Aristotle. With respect to Plato, this point is obvious; for Plato, as has been said above, did not say that even the human body is animate in any other sense except insofar as the soul is united to the body as a mover. But from the statements of Aristotle it is obvious that he did not assert in the heavenly bodies any of the virtues of the soul save the intellectual. But the intellect according to him is not the act of any body. Now to say further that heavenly bodies are animate in this way, like lower bodies which grow and sense through a soul, is contrary to the incorruptibility of the heavenly bodies. Thus, then, it must be denied that heavenly bodies are animate in the way in which lower bodies are animate. But it must not be denied that the heavenly bodies are animate, if by animation nothing else is meant than the union of a mover to a mobile thing. Augustine seems to touch on these two ways in II <i>Super Genesi ad Litteram</i> [XVIII]; for he says: "It is usually asked whether the stars of the heavens are those conspicuous bodies alone, or whether they have certain ruling spirits of their own; and if they have, whether they are also vitally inspired by them, as bodies are animated by the souls of animals." But although he himself leaves both suppositions doubtful, as is clear from what follows, it must be said according to the above considerations that they have ruling spirits, by which nevertheless they are not animated in the same fashion as lower animals are animated by their souls.

Unde ipsum corpus actu existens est materia, nec indiget forma quae det ei esse, cum sit ens actu, sed quae det ei motum solum.

          <td>As to the second, it must be said that according to Averroes' view the heavens are composed of matter and form, just as an animal is among lower beings. But "matter" is nevertheless used equivocally in both instances: for in higher things it is not a potency toward actual being as in lower things, but only toward place. Hence an actually existing body is itself matter, and does not need a form to give it actual being, since it is actually a being (ens actu), but only to give it motion. And so a heavenly body has a more noble form than a human body, but in another way. If, however, it be said, as others say, that a heavenly body is itself composed of matter and corporeal form, then one will still be able to say that that corporeal form will be the most noble, inasmuch as it is a form and an act which fulfils the whole potentiality of matter, so that there does not remain in it a potentiality to another form.

Si tamen supra imperium voluntatis addatur etiam influxus virtutis, non propter hoc sequitur fatigatio ex finitate virtutis; quaelibet enim virtus superioris ordinis, licet sit finita in se et respectu sui superioris, est tamen infinita respectu suorum inferiorum; sicut etiam virtus solis est infinita respectu generabilium et corruptibilium, per quorum productionem, etiamsi in infinitum esset, non minoraretur.

          <td>As to the eighth, it must be said that there is probability in the statement that a spiritual substance moves a heavenly body by a command of the will. For although in regard to a change of form corporeal matter does not obey a created spirit according to the will of the latter, but obeys only God, as Augustine says in III De Trinitate [viii, 13], yet the fact that it can obey such a spirit according to its will in regard to a change of place is evident even in the case of ourselves, in whom, immediately after a command of the will, there follows a movement of our bodily members. If nevertheless over and above a command of the will there should be added also the influence of some power, there is not on this account any fatigue that follows from the limited character of the power; for every power of a higher order, although it is limited in itself and in relation to something higher than itself, is nevertheless unlimited in relation to its own inferiors, as, for instance, the power of the sun also is unlimited in relation to things capable of generation and corruption, and through the production of these things, even if it were to go on forever, it would not be lessened; and similarly the virtue of the intellect is unlimited in relation to sensible forms. And so too the power of a spiritual substance which moves the heavens is unlimited in relation to corporeal movement; and hence fatigue in it does not follow.

Sed moveri per accidens attribuitur motori inferioris orbis non ratione sui ipsius, sed ratione mobilis; in quantum scilicet inferior orbis movetur per accidens, ut delatus motu superioris. Motor vero superioris orbis neutro modo per accidens movetur; quia orbis eius non defertur, sed alios defert.

And hence being moved accidentally is attributed to the soul of a corruptible animal by reason of its very self. For when the body with which it is one in being is moved, it must itself be moved accidentally. But being moved accidentally is attributed to the mover of a lower sphere, not by reason of its very self, but by reason of the mobile thing, insofar, that is, as the lower sphere is moved accidentally, as having been brought downward by the movement of the higher sphere. But the mover of a higher sphere is not moved accidentally in either way, because its sphere is not brought downward but brings others downward.

          <td>Ad decimum dicendum quod super hoc invenitur Averroes varie locutus. In libro enim de substantia orbis dixit, quod idem est quod movet corpora caelestia ut agens et finis; quod quidem est valde erroneum, praesertim secundum eius opinionem qua ponit quod prima causa non est supra substantias moventes primum caelum. Sic enim sequitur quod Deus sit anima prima caeli, secundum quod substantiam quae movet primum caelum ut agens, dicitur anima eius. Et ratio qua hoc dixit est valde insufficiens: quia enim in substantiis separatis a materia est idem intellectus et intellectum, existimavit quod sit idem desiderans et desideratum; quod non est simile. Nam cognitio cuiuslibet rei fit secundum quod cognitum est in cognoscente; desiderium autem fit secundum conversionem desiderantis ad rem desideratam. Si autem bonum desideratum inesset desideranti ex seipso, non competeret ei quod moveret ad consequendum bonum desideratum. Unde oportet dicere quod bonum desideratum, quod movet ut finis, est aliud a desiderante, quod movet ut agens. Et hoc etiam idem dicit Commentator in XI Metaph.; ponit enim ibi duos motores: unum coniunctum, quem vocat animam, et alium separatum, qui movet ut finis. Tamen ex toto hoc non habetur amplius quam quod substantia spiritualis unitur corpori caelesti ut motor.
          <td>As to the tenth, it must be said on this point we find that Averroes has expressed different views. For in the book <i>De Substantia Orbis</i> [1, post med.], he said that what moves the heavenly bodies as agent and as end is one and the same; and this is surely quite erroneous, particularly in relation to the view whereby he asserts that the first cause is not above the substances that move the first heaven? For on this view it follows that God is the soul of the first heaven, inasmuch as the substance which moves the first heaven as agent is called its soul. And the argument on which he made this statement is very inadequate: for because in the case of substances separated from matter the thing that understands and the thing that is understood are the same, he thought that the thing which desires and the thing which is desired are the same; and there is no parallel here. For knowledge of anything whatever takes place according as the thing known is in the knower; but desire takes place by way of a turning of the desirer toward the thing desired. Now if the good desired were present in the desirer of its very self, it would not be proper to it to do any moving toward the attainment of the desired good. And hence one should say that the desired good, which moves as an end, is something other than the desirer, which moves as an agent. And this, too, is the very same statement which the Commentator makes on XI <i>Metaphysica</i> [XII, comm. 38; 41]; for there he asserts two movers: one conjoined, which he calls the soul, and the other separated, which moves as an end. Nevertheless from all this we get nothing more than the fact that a spiritual substance is united to a heavenly body as its mover.

Nec hoc potest referri ad vitam avium, quia aves ad modicum spatium aeris supra terram elevantur; nec videtur conveniens quod totum aliud spatium aeris vacuum vita remaneret.

But in the region of heavenly bodies life is found, according to those who assert that the heavenly bodies are animate; and in the region of earth life is found in animals and in plants. Therefore in the middle region also, that of the air, life is found. Nor can this have reference to bird life, because birds are raised above the earth a little distance in the air, and it would not seem fitting that all the other air space should remain devoid of life. One must then assert, as it seems, that some ethereal living beings exist in it, from which it follows that some spiritual substances are united to an ethereal body.

          <td>5 Furthermore, in the case of things which agree more closely, union is easier. But "air" seems to agree more with "soul" than does a mixed body, such as man's body is; because, as Augustine says in <i>Super Genesi ad Litteram</i> [VII, 15 and 19], the soul manages the body through air. Therefore the soul is naturally more apt to be united to an ethereal body than even to a mixed body.

          <td>Primo quidem, quia inter omnia alia corpora, corpora simplicia elementorum sunt imperfectiora, cum sint materialia respectu omnium aliorum corporum; unde non est conveniens secundum rationem ordinis rerum, quod aliquod simplex corpus elementare spirituali substantiae uniatur ut forma.
          <td>In the first place, because among all other bodies the simple bodies of elements are the more imperfect, since they are like matter in relation to all other bodies. And hence it is not consistent with the scheme of things for some simple elementary body to be united to a spiritual substance as a form.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secunda ratio est, quia aer est corpus simile in toto et in omnibus suis partibus; unde si alicui parti aeris unitur aliqua spiritualis substantia, eadem ratione et toti aeri unietur, et similiter cuilibet alteri elemento; quod videtur absurdum.
          <td>The second reason is that air is a body, which is homogeneous as a whole and in all its parts. Hence if some spiritual substance is united to any one part of the air, for the same reason it will also be united to the whole air, and likewise to every other element, which seems absurd.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Tertia ratio est, quia substantia spiritualis dupliciter alicui corpori invenitur uniri. Uno modo ad exhibendum corpori motum; sicut dictum est, quod corporibus caelestibus spirituales substantiae uniuntur. Alio modo ut substantia spiritualis per corpus iuvetur ad propriam suam operationem, quae est intelligere; sicut anima humana unitur corpori, ut per sensus corporeos scientias acquirat. Aeri autem substantia spiritualis non potest uniri neque ratione motus, quia aeri est connaturalis motus quidam, qui consequitur formam eius naturalem; nec invenitur aliquis motus aut in toto aere aut in aliqua eius parte, qui non possit reduci in aliquam causam corporalem. Unde ex motu eius non apparet quod aliqua substantia spiritualis et uniatur. Neque etiam unitur spiritualis substantia corpori aereo propter perfectionem intellectualis operationis: corpus enim simplex non potest esse instrumentum sensus, ut probatur in libro de anima.
          <td>The third reason is that a spiritual substance is found to be united to a given body in two ways: in one way, in order to furnish movement to a body, as, for instance, it was said that spiritual substances are united to the heavenly bodies; in another way, in order that a spiritual substance may be helped by a body as regards its own proper activity, which is understanding, as a human soul, for instance, is united to a body in order that it may acquire a store of knowledge through the bodily senses. But a spiritual substance cannot be united to the air; not by reason of movement, because air has a certain connatural movement which is a consequence of its natural form, nor is there to be found any movement in the whole air or in any part thereof which cannot be referred back to some bodily cause; and hence from its movement it does not appear that a spiritual substance is united to it. Nor yet is a spiritual substance united to an ethereal body for the perfection of intellectual activity: for a simple body cannot be an instrument of sense, as is proven in <i>De Anima</i> [III, 12, 434b 10].

          <td>As to the first argument, therefore, it must be said that wherever Augustine says that demons have ethereal bodies, he does not say so as an assertion of his own belief, but according to the opinion of others. And hence he himself says in XII <i>De Civitate Dei</i> [X, 1]: "Even demons have a kind of body of their own, as learned men have thought, of that thick and humid air...

Et sic patet quod vita magis potest esse in suprema et infima regione quam in media: praesertim cum in istis inferioribus tanto paratius est corpus ad vitam, quanto propinquius fuerit aequalitati complexionis.
          <td>As to the third, it must be said that the place for the mixing of the elements is in the lower region, namely, that around the earth. Now mixed bodies, the closer they come to an equal mixture, the farther do they recede from the extremes of contraries; and thus they acquire a kind of likeness to the heavenly bodies, which are without contrariety. And so it is clear that life is more able to exist in the highest and in the lowest region than in the middle one; especially when, in the case of those lower ones, the body is all the more prepared for life the nearer it comes to an equality of constituency.

          <td>As to the fourth, it must be said that the body "air" is more noble than the body "earth." But a body of equal constituency is more noble than both, because it is more distant from contrariety; and this kind of body only is found to be united to a spiritual substance. In it, nevertheless, the lower element must be materially more abundant in order to constitute equality, on account of the excess of active power in the other elements.

          <td>1 Augustine says in his <i>Enchiridion</i> [XXIX]: "The rational creaturehood which was in men, since by reason of sins and penalties... it had wholly perished" deserved "in part to be renewed." And from this it is argued as follows. If all angels were different from one another in their specific nature, then, since many angels fell irreparably, many natures would have irreparably perished. But Divine Providence does not allow any rational nature to perish entirely, as is clear from the passage quoted. Therefore not all angels differ from one another in specific nature.

But beings which differ numerically and specifically are more different from one another than are those which differ numerically and agree specifically. Since, therefore, men do not differ specifically, but only numerically, it would seem that angels too do not differ specifically.

Now in angels their very existence serves as the formal element with regard to the angel's essence, as has been said above. Since then all angels agree in existence but differ in essence, it would seem that angels differ, not specifically, but only numerically.

Angelus autem est substantia creata subsistens. Sive igitur sit compositus ex materia et forma, sive simplex, oportet quod contineatur sub aliqua natura speciei. Sed naturae speciei non derogat quod possit habere plura supposita; similiter etiam nec individuo sub ea existenti derogat, si habeat aliquod secum compar in eadem specie. Ergo videtur quod possibile sit esse plures Angelos unius speciei. In perpetuis autem non differunt esse et posse, ut dicitur in III Physic. Ergo in Angelis sunt plura individua unius speciei.
          <td>4 Furthermore, every subsisting created substance is an individual, included under some nature common to a species in such a way that if the individual be a composite, the specific nature will be predicated of it according to its character as a composite, but if the individual is simple, the specific nature will be predicated of it in consideration of its simple characteristics. Now an angel is a subsisting created substance. Whether, then, it be composed of matter and form or whether it be simple, it must be included under some specific nature. But the fact that it can have many supposites does not detract from a specific nature; so too the fact of having something like itself in the same species does not detract from an individual existing under such a nature. Therefore it would seem to be possible that there are many angels belonging to one species. But in the case of eternal beings there is no difference between "actual" and "possible", as is said in III <i>Physica</i> [4, 203b 30]. Therefore, among the angels there are many individuals of a single species.

          <td>Prima sumitur ex conditione substantiae eorum. Necesse est enim dicere, quod vel sint formae simplices subsistentes absque materia, ut supra habitum est; vel sint formae compositae ex materia et forma. Si autem Angelus est forma simplex abstracta a materia, impossibile est etiam fingere quod sint plures Angeli unius speciei: quia quaecumque forma, quantumcumque materialis et infima, si ponatur abstracta vel secundum esse vel secundum intellectum, non remanet nisi una in specie una. Si enim intelligatur albedo absque omni subiecto subsistens, non erit possibile ponere plures albedines; cum videamus quod haec albedo non differt ab alia nisi per hoc quod est in hoc vel in illo subiecto. Et similiter si esset humanitas abstracta, non esset nisi una tantum. Si vero Angelus sit substantia ex materia et forma composita, necesse est dicere quod materiae diversorum Angelorum sint aliquo modo distinctae. Distinctio autem materiae a materia non invenitur nisi duplex. Una secundum propriam rationem materiae, et haec est secundum habitudinem ad diversos actus: cum enim materia secundum propriam rationem sit in potentia, potentia autem ad actum dicatur, necesse est quod secundum ordinem actuum attendatur distinctio in potentiis et materiis. Et hoc modo materia inferiorum corporum, quae est potentia ad esse, differt a materia caelestium corporum, quae est potentia ad ubi. Secunda distinctio materiae est secundum divisionem quantitatis; prout materia existens sub his dimensionibus distinguitur ab ea quae est sub aliis dimensionibus. Et prima quidem materiae distinctio facit diversitatem secundum genus: quia, secundum philosophum in V Metaph., genere differunt secundum materiam diversa. Secunda autem distinctio materiae facit diversitatem individuorum in eadem specie. Haec autem secunda distinctio materiae non potest esse in diversis Angelis, cum Angeli sint incorporei, et omnino absque dimensionibus quantitativis. Relinquitur ergo, quod si sint plures Angeli compositi ex materia et forma, quod sit in eis distinctio materiarum secundum primum modum; et ita sequitur quod non solum specie, sed etiam genere differunt.
          <td>The first reason is derived from the makeup of their substance. For it is necessary to say either that they are simple forms subsisting apart from matter, as was held above, or that they are forms that are composed of matter and form. Now if an angel is a simple form set apart from matter, it is impossible even to conceive several angels of one species; because any form whatever, however material and low, if it be set down as abstract either in actual being or in the intellect, remains but one form in one species. For let "whiteness" be understood as something subsisting apart from every subject and it will not be possible to posit many whitenesses, since we see that "this whiteness" does not differ from "that whiteness" save through the fact that it is in this or in that subject. In similar fashion, if there were an abstract "human nature", there would be but one only. But if an angel is a substance that is composed of matter and form, it is necessary to say that the matters of different angels are somehow distinct. Now the distinction of matter from matter is found to be one of only two kinds: one according to the proper character of matter, and this is according to its relationship (habitudo) to different acts: for, since matter according to its proper character is in potency, whereas potency is spoken of in relation to act, a distinction among potencies and matters is made from the standpoint of the order of acts. And in this way the matter of lower bodies, which is a potency to actual being, differs from the matter of the heavenly bodies, which is a potency to place. The second distinction of matter, however, is based on quantitative division, inasmuch as matter which exists under these particular dimensions is distinguished from that which is under other dimensions. And the first distinction of matter causes a generic diversity because, according to the Philosopher in, V <i>Metaphysica</i> [28, 1024b 10], different things are generically different on a basis of matter. The second distinction of matter, however, causes a diversity of individuals within the same species. Now this second distinction of matter cannot exist among different angels, since angels are incorporeal and entirely without quantitative dimensions. The only remaining alternative; therefore, is that if there be many angels that are composed of matter and form, there is a distinction of matters among them according to the first mode: and thus it follows that they differ not only specifically but also generically.

          <td>Secunda ratio sumitur ex ordine universi. Manifestum est enim quod duplex est bonum universi: quoddam separatum, scilicet Deus, qui est sicut dux in exercitu; et quoddam in ipsis rebus, et hoc est ordo partium universi, sicut ordo partium exercitus est bonum exercitus. Unde apostolus dicit Rom. XIII: quae a Deo sunt, ordinata sunt. Oportet autem quod superiores universi partes magis de bono universi participent, quod est ordo. Perfectius autem participant ordinem ea in quibus est ordo per se, quam ea in quibus est ordo per accidens tantum. Manifestum est autem quod in omnibus individuis unius speciei non est ordo nisi secundum accidens: conveniunt enim in natura speciei, et differunt secundum principia individuantia, et diversa accidentia, quae per accidens se habent ad naturam speciei. Quae autem specie differunt, ordinem habent per se et secundum essentialia principia. Invenitur enim in speciebus rerum una abundare super aliam, sicut et in speciebus numerorum, ut dicitur in VIII Metaph. In istis autem inferioribus, quae sunt generabilia et corruptibilia, et infima pars universi, et minus participant de ordine, invenitur non omnia diversa habere ordinem per se; sed quaedam habent ordinem per accidens tantum, sicut individua unius speciei.

          <td>The second reason is derived from the order of the universe. For it is obvious that the good of the universe is of two kinds: something that is separate, namely, God, Who is, as it were, the leader in an army; and a certain something in things themselves, and this is the order of the parts of the universe, just as the order of the parts of the army is the good of the army. Hence the Apostle says in Romans XIII [1]: "The things which are from God are ordered." Now the higher parts of the universe must have a greater share in the good of the universe, which is order. But those things in which there is order of themselves have a more perfect share in order than do those in which there is order only accidentally. Now it is obvious that among all the individuals of one species there is no order except accidentally: for they agree in the nature of the species and differ according to individuating principles and different accidents, which are related in an accidental way to the nature of the species. But things which differ in species have order of themselves and on a basis of their essential principles. For among the species of things, one is found to be greater than another, as is also the case in the species of numbers, as is said in VIII <i>Metaphysica</i> [3, 1043b 36].7 However, in the case of those lower things which are subject to generation and corruption and make up the lowest part of the universe and have a lesser share in order, not all different things are found to have order of themselves, but certain ones have order only accidentally as, for example, the individuals of one species. But in the higher part of the universe, namely, among the heavenly bodies, order is not found accidentally but only essentially, since all heavenly bodies differ from one another in species, and there are not among them several individuals of one species, but one sun only, and one moon, and so of the others. Much more so, therefore, in the highest part of the universe there are not to be found any beings that are ordered accidentally and not essentially. And so the only remaining alternative is that all angels differ from one another in species, according to a greater and a less perfection of simple forms, as a result of a greater or a less nearness to God, Who is pure act and of infinite perfection.

Unde et tota natura speciei concluditur sub uno individuo; et similiter est de aliis corporibus caelestibus. Multo ergo magis in suprema parte rerum creatarum, quae est Deo propinquissima, scilicet in Angelis, haec perfectio invenitur ut uni individuo nihil desit eorum quae ad totam speciem pertinent; et sic non sunt plura individua in una specie. Deus vero, qui est in summo perfectionis, cum nullo alio convenit non solum in specie, sed nec in genere nec in alio praedicato univoco.
          <td>But the third reason is derived from the perfection of the angelic nature. For each individual thing is said to be perfect when it lacks none of those things which pertain to it. And in fact the degree of this perfection can be calculated from the extremes of things. For to God, Who is at the apex of perfection, none of the things which belong to the character of actual being as a whole is lacking; for He has beforehand in Himself absolutely and in the highest degree all the perfections of things, as Dionysius says [De Divinis Nominibus, V, lec. 1]. But an individual in the lowest part of the world which contains beings that are subject to generation and corruption is found to be perfect from the fact that it has whatever pertains to itself, according to its own individual character, but not whatever pertains to its own specific nature, since its own specific nature is also found in other individual beings. And this quite obviously pertains to imperfection, not only in the case of animals that are subject to generation, among which one animal needs another of its own species for common life, but also in the case of all animals that are generated in any way whatever from semen, in which the male needs the female of its own species in order to generate; and further, in the case of all beings that are subject to generation and corruption, wherein a group of individuals of one species is necessary in order that the specific nature, which cannot be perpetually conserved in one individual being because of its corruptibility, may be conserved in many. But in the higher part of the universe a higher degree of perfection is found, wherein one individual being, such as the sun, is so perfect that it lacks none of the things that pertain to its own species, and hence also the whole matter of the species is contained in one individual being; and the same is true of the other heavenly bodies. Much more so, therefore, this perfection is found in the highest part of created things which is nearest to God, namely, among the angels: that one individual lacks none of the things which pertain to a whole species, and thus there are not several individuals in one species. But God, Who is at the summit of perfection, does not agree with any other being, not only in species but not even in genus, nor in any other univocal predicate.

          <td>As to the fourth, it must be said that just as a form, which is in a subject or in matter, is individuated by the fact that it is in this particular thing, so a separated form is individuated by the fact that it is not naturally such as to exist in anything. For, just as actually being in this particular thing excludes the commonness of a universal, which is predicated of many individuals, so does not being able to exist in some subject. Accordingly, just as "this particular whiteness" is not prevented from having many individuals under it in consequence of the fact that it is whiteness, which pertains to its specific character, but in consequence of the fact that it is in "this particular subject", which pertains to its individual character, so the nature of "this particular angel" is not prevented from existing in many in consequence of the fact that it is a nature in a given order of things, which pertains to its specific character, but in consequence of the fact that this nature has not a natural capacity for being received in a given subject, which pertains to the character of an individual.

          <td>Ad quintum dicendum quod, cum affectio sequatur cognitionem, quanto cognitio est universalior, tanto affectio eam sequens magis respicit commune bonum; et quanto cognitio est magis particularis, tanto affectio ipsam sequens magis respicit privatum bonum; unde et in nobis privata dilectio ex cognitione sensitiva exoritur, dilectio vero communis et absoluti boni ex cognitione intellectiva. Quia igitur Angeli quanto sunt altiores, tanto habent scientiam magis universalem, ut Dionysius dicit, XII cap. Angel. Hierar., ideo eorum dilectio maxime respicit commune bonum. Magis igitur diligunt se invicem, si specie differunt, quod magis pertinet ad perfectionem universi, ut ostensum est, quam si in specie convenirent, quod pertineret ad bonum privatum unius speciei.
          <td>As to the fifth, it must be said that, since affection follows knowledge, the more universal knowledge is, so much the more does the affection which follows it look toward the common good; and the more particular the knowledge is, so much the more does the affection which follows it look toward a private good; and hence among us too, individual love arises as a consequence of sense knowledge, but the love of the common and absolute good arises as a consequence of intellectual knowledge. Accordingly, because the angels, in proportion as they are higher, possess a more universal knowledge, as Dionysius says in the twelfth chapter of <i>De Caelesti Hierarchia</i> [2, PG I, 298], so does their love, as a consequence, look especially to the common good. Consequently they love one another more if they differ in species, which pertains rather to the perfection of the universe, as has been shown, than if they were to agree in species, which would pertain to the private good of a single species.

          <td>Ad sextum dicendum quod substantias separatas non potest anima nostra corpori unita secundum essentias earum intelligere, ut sciat de eis quid sunt; quia earum essentiae excedunt genus sensibilium naturarum et earum proportionem, ex quibus intellectus noster cognitionem capit. Et ideo substantiae separatae non possunt definiri a nobis proprie, sed solum per remotionem, vel aliquam operationem ipsarum. Et hoc modo Damascenus definit Angelum non definitione pertinente ad speciem specialissimam, sed ad genus subalternum, quod est genus et species, unde definiri potest.
          <td>As to the sixth, it must be said that our soul when it is united to the body cannot understand separated substances in their essences, so as to know of them what they are; because their essences are above the genus of sensible natures and out of proportion to them, and from these our intellect gets its knowledge. And consequently separated substances cannot be defined by us in the strict sense, but only through negation or through some activity of these same substances. And in this way Damascene defines an angel, not by a definition belonging to the most specific species, but to a subordinate genus, which is a genus and a species, and hence a definition is possible.

In another sense, "more and less" is used with reference to a degree of different forms; thus, for instance, something white is said to be more bright than red or green; and in this sense "more and less" do constitute a specific difference; and in this way angels differ in natural spiritual gifts on a basis of "more and less".

Sed et in plantis et animalibus est maxima diversitas specierum. Ut tamen huius rei veritas investigetur, considerandum est quod Dionysius Platonicis contrariam sententiam proferre videtur. Dicunt enim Platonici quod substantiae quo sunt primo uni propinquiores, eo sunt minoris numeri. Dionysius vero dicit in XIV cap. angelicae hierarchiae, quod Angeli omnem materialem multitudinem transcendunt. Utrumque autem verum esse aliquis potest ex rebus corporalibus percipere; in quibus quanto corpus aliquod invenitur superius, tanto minus habet de materia, sed in maiorem quantitatem extenditur. Unde cum numerus quodammodo sit causa quantitatis continuae, secundum quod punctum constituit unitas, et punctus lineam, ut more Platonicorum loquamur: ita est etiam in tota rerum universitate, quod quanto aliqua sunt superiora in entibus, tanto plus habent de formali multitudine, quae attenditur secundum distinctionem specierum: et in hoc salvatur dictum Dionysii: minus autem de multitudine materiali quae attenditur secundum distinctionem individuorum in eadem specie; in quo salvatur dictum Platonicorum. Quod autem est una sola species animalis rationalis, multis existentibus speciebus irrationalium animalium, ex hoc provenit, quia animal rationale constituitur ex hoc quod natura corporea attingit in sui supremo naturam substantiarum spiritualium in sui infimo. Supremus autem gradus alicuius naturae, vel etiam infimus, est unus tantum: quamvis posset dici plures esse species rationalium animalium, si quis poneret corpora caelestia animata.
          <td>As to the tenth, it must be said that it does not seem to be universally true that a more imperfect generic difference is multiplied into several species. For "body" is divided into "animate body" and "inanimate body"; yet there would seem to be more species of animate bodies than of inanimate, particularly if the heavenly bodies are animate, and if all the stars differ from one another in species. But both in plants and in animals there is a very great diversity of species. Still, in order that the truth of this matter may be investigated, it must be borne in mind that Dionysius would seem to present a view that is contrary to the Platonists. For the Platonists say that the nearer substances are to the primary one, the less numerous they are. But Dionysius says in the fourteenth chapter of <i>De Caelesti Hierarchia</i> [PG I, 322] that angels transcend all material manyness. Now, that both these statements are true, anyone can perceive from corporeal objects, among which the higher a given body is found to be, the less matter it has, but the greater is its quantitative extent. And hence, since number is, in a way, the cause of continuous quantity, seeing that unity constitutes a point and a point constitutes a line (speaking after the fashion of the Platonists), so also is it the case in the whole universe that the higher some things are among beings, the more do they have of formal manyness, which is reckoned according to a distinction of species, and in this sense the saying of Dionysius is saved; whereas they have less of material manyness, which is reckoned according to a distinction between individuals within the same species: and in this sense the saying of the Platonists is saved. Now the fact that there is only one species of rational animal, although many species of irrational animals exist, arises from the fact that "rational animal" is constituted on this basis: that corporeal nature at its highest point touches the nature of spiritual substances at its lowest point. Now the highest level of any nature, or even the lowest level, is one only. Although it might be said that there are many species of rational animals, if one were to hold that the heavenly bodies are animate.

Ex hoc autem est aliquid intelligibile in actu, quod est a materia separatum; et ideo dicit quod in his quae sunt sine materia, idem est intellectus et quod intelligitur.

Hence Empedocles [Aristotle, I De An., 2, 404b 13] said that "We know the earth through earth and the water through water." But to rule this out, Aristotle [III De An., 4, 429a 21] asserted that the knowing power in us, according as it is in potency, is void of the nature of the things that can be known; thus, the pupil of the eye, for instance, is void of color. But yet the sense in act is the thing sensed in act, inasmuch as the sense is put in act through being informed by the sensible species; and by the same reasoning the intellect in act is the thing understood in act, inasmuch as it is informed by the intelligible species: "for a stone does not exist in the soul, but the species of a stone", as he himself says [III De An., 8, 431b 29]. Now the reason why something is intelligible in act is that it is separated from matter; and consequently he says [III De An., 4, 430a 2] that "In those things which are without matter, the understanding subject and the thing which is understood are the same." Therefore the understanding angel need not be the same in substance as the understood angel, if they are immaterial; but the understanding of the one must be informed by a likeness of the other.

For if a pupil has the knowledge that he learns before he learns it, learning is remembering. But if he does not have it previously, either he acquires it as something that exists previously in another, namely, in the teacher; or as something that does not exist previously in another; and in that case it would have to be caused in him anew by another. Now these three things are impossible. For, since knowledge is an accident, the numerically same knowledge cannot pass over from subject to subject, because, as Boethius says [In Categ. I, PL LXIV, 173], accidents can he corrupted but they cannot be transmuted. Similarly, also, it is impossible for the knowledge of the teacher to cause knowledge in the pupil, not only because knowledge is not an active quality but also because the words which the teacher utters only stimulate the pupil to understanding, as Augustine says in the book De Magistro [passim]. Moreover, the statement that learning is remembering is contrary to the Philosopher in I Posteriora [ 1, 71a]. Therefore, there are not different possible intellects in all men.

          <td>Respondeo. Dicendum quod ad evidentiam huius quaestionis, oportet praeintelligere quid intelligatur nomine intellectus possibilis et agentis. Sciendum est autem, quod Aristoteles, processit ad considerandum de intellectu per similitudinem sensus. Ex parte autem sensus, cum inveniamur quandoque sentientes in potentia, quandoque in actu, oportet ponere in nobis aliquam virtutem sensitivam per quam simus sentientes in potentia; quam oportet esse in potentia ad species sensibilium, et nullam earum habere actu in sua essentia; alioquin si sensus haberet in actu sensibilia, sicut antiqui philosophi posuerunt, sequeretur quod semper essemus sentientes in actu. Similiter cum inveniamur quandoque intelligentes in actu, quandoque in potentia, necesse est ponere aliquam virtutem per quam simus intelligentes in potentia, quae quidem in sua essentia et natura non habet aliquam de naturis rerum sensibilium, quas intelligere possumus, sed sit in potentia ad omnia; et propter hoc vocatur possibilis intellectus; sicut et sensus, secundum quod est in potentia, posset vocari sensus possibilis. Sensus autem qui est in potentia, reducitur in actum per sensibilia actu, quae sunt extra animam; unde non est necesse ponere sensum agentem. Et similiter non esset necesse ponere intellectum agentem, si universalia quae sunt intelligibilia actu, per se subsisterent extra animam, sicut posuit Plato. Sed quia Aristoteles posuit ea non subsistere nisi in sensibilibus, quae non sunt intelligibilia actu, necesse habuit ponere aliquam virtutem quae faceret intelligibilia in potentia esse intelligibilia actu, abstrahendo species rerum a materia et conditionibus individuantibus; et haec virtus vocatur intellectus agens.
          <td>It must be said that to make this question clear it is necessary to understand in advance what is meant by the term "possible intellect" and "agent intellect". Now it must be noted that Aristotle [III, 4, 429a 13] went on to a study of the intellect by way of a comparison with the senses. Now as regards the senses, since we find ourselves sometimes sensing in potency and sometimes in act, it is necessary to posit in us some sense power whereby we may be sensing in potency, and this power must be in potency to the species of sensible things, and not have any of these species actually in its own essence; otherwise, if the senses were to possess sensible things in act, as the ancient philosophers asserted, it would follow that we would always be sensing in act. Similarly, since we find ourselves sometimes understanding in act and sometimes in potency, it is necessary to posit some power whereby we may be understanding in potency, and this power does not have in its own essence and nature any of the natures of sensible things which we can understand, but it should be in potency to all things; and on this account it is called the possible intellect; just as the sense power too, according as it is in potency, might be called the "possible sense." Now a sense which is in potency is reduced to act through objects that are actually sensible, which are outside the. soul, and hence it is not necessary to posit an agent sense. And similarly it would not be necessary to posit an agent intellect if the universals which are actually intelligible subsisted of themselves outside the soul, as Plato asserted. But because Aristotle asserted that these universals do not subsist except in sensible objects, which are not actually intelligible, he necessarily had to posit some power, which would make the objects that are intelligible in potency to be actually intelligible, by abstracting the species of things from matter and from individuating conditions; and this power is called the agent intellect.

Now that this assertion is contrary to faith is easy to see: for it takes away the rewards and punishments of a future life. But it must be shown that this assertion is in itself impossible according to the true principles of philosophy. Now it was shown above [Art. II] when we were discussing the union of a spiritual substance with a body that on this view it would follow that no particular man would understand anything. But granted, for the sake of argument, that some particular man would be able to understand through an intellect that is so separated, three incongruities follow if it be asserted that there is one possible intellect for all men, whereby they all understand.

Now it happens that two men at one and the same time may understand one and the same intelligible thing. If, then, they both understand through one possible intellect, it would follow that they both have numerically one and the same intellectual activity; thus, for instance, if two men were to see by means of a single eye, it would follow that the same act of seeing belongs to both. It is clear that this is utterly impossible. Nor can it be said that my act of understanding is different from your act of understanding by reason of the diversity of the phantasms; because a phantasm is not a thing that is understood in act, but this latter is something abstracted from it, which is held to be a word. Hence the diversity of the phantasms is extrinsic to intellectual activity, and thus cannot cause differences in it."

          <td>Secundo, quia impossibile est esse unum numero in individuis eiusdem speciei illud per quod speciem sortiuntur. Si enim duo equi convenirent in eodem secundum numerum quo speciem equi haberent, sequeretur quod duo equi essent unus equus; quod est impossibile. Et propter hoc in VII Metaph. dicitur, quod principia speciei, secundum quod sunt determinata, constituunt individuum; ut si ratio hominis est ut sit ex anima et corpore, de ratione huius hominis est quod sit ex hac anima et ex hoc corpore. Unde principia cuiuslibet speciei oportet plurificari in pluribus individuis eiusdem speciei. A quo autem aliquid speciem sortiatur, cognoscitur a propria operatione speciem consequente. Diiudicamus enim esse verum aurum, quod habet propriam operationem auri. Propria autem operatio humanae speciei est intelligere; unde secundum hanc operationem ponit philosophus ultimam hominis felicitatem in X Ethic. Huius autem operationis principium non est intellectus passivus, id est vis cogitativa, vel vis appetitiva sensitiva, quae participat aliqualiter ratione; cum hae vires non habeant operationem nisi per organum corporale. Intelligere autem non potest esse per organum corporale, ut in III de anima probatur. Et sic relinquitur quod intellectus possibilis sit quo hic homo speciem humanam sortitur; non autem intellectus passivus, ut Averroes fingit. Relinquitur ergo quod impossibile sit unum intellectum possibilem in omnibus hominibus esse.
          <td>The second is that it is impossible for that whereby individuals obtain their species to be numerically one in the individuals of the same species. For if two horses should agree in that numerically same reality whereby they obtained their species "horse", it would follow that two horses are one horse, which is impossible. And on this account it is said in VII <i>Metaphysica</i> [10, 1035b 30] that the principles of a species, once they are determinate, constitute an individual: thus, if the essence of man is that he be composed of soul and body, it is of the essence of "this man" that he be composed of "this soul" and "this body". Hence the principles of every species must be multiplied in the several individuals of the same species. Now that from which a thing obtains its species is known through some proper activity that is a consequence of the species. For we judge that to be true gold which has the proper activity of gold. Now the proper activity of the human species is understanding; and hence, in accordance with this activity the Philosopher in X <i>Ethica</i> [7] sets forth the ultimate happiness of man. Now the principle of this activity is not the passive intellect, that is, the cogitative power or the sense-appetite which somehow participates in reason, since these powers have no activity except through a corporeal organ; whereas the act of understanding cannot take place through a corporeal organ, as is proven in III <i>De Anima</i> [4]. And thus the only remaining alternative is that the possible intellect is that whereby this particular man obtains his human species, and not the passive intellect, as Averroes imagines [In III De An., comm. 20]. The only remaining alternative, therefore, is that it is impossible that there be one possible intellect in all men.

Ex quo ulterius sequeretur quod si nos sumus intelligentes et scientes per intellectum possibilem, quod scire in nobis non sit nisi reminisci. Quamvis et hoc ipsum secundum se inconveniens videatur, quod intellectus possibilis, si sit substantia separata secundum esse, efficiatur in actu per phantasmata, cum superiora in entibus non indigeant inferioribus ad sui perfectionem. Sicut enim inconveniens esset dicere quod corpora caelestia perficiantur in actu accipiendo a corporibus inferioribus; similiter, et multo amplius, est impossibile quod aliqua substantia separata perficiatur in actu, accipiendo a phantasmatibus.
          <td>Thirdly, it would follow that the possible intellect would not receive any species that are abstracted from our phantasms, if one intellect belongs to all those who are and who have been. Because, now that many men who knew many things have already gone before us, it would follow that with respect to all those things which they knew the possible intellect would be in act and not in potency to receive them, because nothing receives what it already has. And from this it would further follow that if we are made understanding and knowing through the possible intellect, knowing in our case is nothing but remembering. And yet too this very thing in itself would seem incongruous: that the possible intellect if it be an existentially separated substance should be reduced to act through the phantasms, since the higher things among beings do not need lower things for their own perfection. For just as it would be incongruous to say that heavenly bodies are perfected in act by receiving something from lower bodies, similarly (and all the more so) it is impossible for a separated substance to be perfected in act by receiving something from phantasms.

          <td>It is also obvious that this assertion is opposed to the words of Aristotle. For when he begins his investigation of the possible intellect, right from the beginning he calls it a "part of the soul", saying [III De An., 4, 429a 10]: "Now about the part of the soul whereby the soul knows and perceives." But when he wishes to investigate the nature of the possible intellect, he first states a difficulty, namely, whether the intellectual part is separable from the other parts of the soul as a subsistent thing, as Plato asserted, or mentally only; and this is what he says [429a 11]: "Whether it be separable as an existing thing or inseparable spatially but mentally." From this it is clear that whichever of these assertions is made, the opinion which he had in mind concerning the possible intellect will still hold good." But it would not hold good that the possible intellect is separated only mentally, if the assertion that was mentioned before were a true one. Hence the opinion that was mentioned before is not the view of Aristotle. Afterwards he also adds [429a 23] that the possible intellect is "that whereby the soul forms opinions and understands", and many other things of this kind; and from these statements he manifestly gives us to understand that the possible intellect is something belonging to the soul and is not a separated substance.

          <td>As to the sixth, it must be said that Averroes seems to lay special stress on this argument [In III De An., comm. 5, f. 166], because it would follow, as he himself says, that if the possible intellect were not one in all men the thing that is understood would be individuated and counted by means of the individuation and counting of individual men; and thus it would be understood potentially and not in act. It must accordingly be shown that, first, those incongruities follow no less for those who assert that there is one possible intellect than for those who assert that it is multiplied in many. And first of all as regards individuation, it is obvious that a form that exists in some individual is individuated by that individual in the same way, whether it be the only individual in some one species, like the sun, or whether there be many in one species, like pearls: for in both cases the species "brightness" is individuated. For one must say that the possible intellect is a kind of singular individual thing; for acts belong to individuals. Whether, then, it is one in one species, or many, the thing that is understood will be individuated in it in the same way. But as regards multiplication, it is obvious that if there are not many possible intellects in the human species, there are nevertheless many intellects in the universe, and many of them understand one and the same thing. The same difficulty, therefore, will remain whether the thing that is understood is one or many in different men. Therefore it is not possible to prove his point by this means, because even after this stand has been taken, the same incongruities will still remain.

          <td>Et ideo ad huius solutionem considerandum est quod si de intellectu loqui oporteat secundum similitudinem sensus, ut patet ex processu Aristotelis in III de anima, oportet dicere quod res intellecta non se habet ad intellectum possibilem ut species intelligibilis, qua intellectus possibilis sit actu; sed illa species se habet ut principium formale quo intellectus intelligit. Intellectum autem, sive res intellecta, se habet ut constitutum vel formatum per operationem intellectus: sive hoc sit quidditas simplex, sive sit compositio et divisio propositionis. Has enim duas operationes intellectus Aristoteles assignat in III de anima. Unam scilicet quam vocat intelligentiam indivisibilem, qua videlicet intellectus apprehendit quod quid est alicuius rei, et hanc Arabes vocant formationem, vel imaginationem per intellectum. Aliam vero ponit, scilicet compositionem et divisionem intellectuum, quam Arabes vocant credulitatem vel fidem. Utrique autem harum operationum praeintelligitur species intelligibilis, qua fit intellectus possibilis in actu; quia intellectus possibilis non operatur nisi secundum quod est in actu, sicut nec visus videt nisi per hoc quod est factus in actu per speciem visibilem. Unde species visibilis non se habet ut quod videtur, sed ut quo videtur. Et simile est de intellectu possibili; nisi quod intellectus possibilis reflectitur supra seipsum et supra speciem suam, non autem visus.
          <td>And consequently, for the solution of this problem it must be borne in mind that if we have to speak of the intellect by way of a comparison with the senses, as is clear from the procedure of Aristotle in III <i>De Anima</i> , we must say that the thing which is understood is not related to the possible intellect as an intelligible species whereby the possible intellect is actuated, but that species is as a formal principle whereby the intellect understands. Now that which is understood, or the thing which is understood, is as something which is constituted or formed through the activity of the intellect, whether this thing be a simple quiddity or whether it be the composition and division of a proposition. For Aristotle specifies these two activities of the intellect in III <i>De Anima</i> [6], — the one activity, namely, which he calls "the understanding of indivisible things", whereby the intellect apprehends the essence of a given thing, and this the Arabs call "formation" or "imagination by the intellect", but he posits another activity, namely, the combining and separating of concepts, which the Arabs call "belief" or "faith". Now for both of these activities an intelligible species is presupposed, whereby the possible intellect is actuated; because the possible intellect does not act except according as it is in act, just as the sight does not see except through being actuated by a species which makes seeing possible. And hence the species which makes seeing possible is not as a thing which is seen, but as that whereby the object is seen. And the same is true of the possible intellect, except that the possible intellect reflects upon itself and upon its own species, whereas the sight does not.

          <td>Res igitur intellecta a duobus intellectibus est quodammodo una et eadem, et quodammodo multae: quia ex parte rei quae cognoscitur est una et eadem, ex parte vero ipsius cognitionis est alia et alia. Sicut si duo videant unum parietem, est eadem res visa ex parte rei quae videtur, alia tamen et alia secundum diversas visiones; et omnino simile esset ex parte intellectus, si res quae intelligitur subsisteret extra animam sicut res quae videtur, ut Platonici posuerunt. Sed secundum opinionem Aristotelis videtur habere maiorem difficultatem, licet sit eadem ratio, si quis recte inspiciat. Non enim est differentia inter Aristotelem et Platonem, nisi in hoc quod Plato posuit quod res quae intelligitur eodem modo habet esse extra animam quo modo eam intellectus intelligit, idest ut abstracta et communis; Aristoteles vero posuit rem quae intelligitur esse extra animam, sed alio modo, quia intelligitur abstracte et habet esse concrete. Et sicut secundum Platonem ipsa res quae intelligitur est extra ipsam animam, ita secundum Aristotelem: quod patet ex hoc quod neuter eorum posuit scientias esse de his quae sunt in intellectu nostro, sicut de substantiis; sed Plato quidem dixit scientias esse de formis separatis, Aristoteles vero de quidditatibus rerum in eis existentibus. Sed ratio universalitatis, quae consistit in communitate et abstractione, sequitur solum modum intelligendi, in quantum intelligimus abstracte et communiter; secundum Platonem vero sequitur etiam modum existendi formarum abstractarum: et ideo Plato posuit universalia subsistere, Aristoteles autem non. Sic igitur patet quomodo multitudo intellectuum non praeiudicat neque universitati, neque communitati, neque unitati rei intellectae.
          <td>Accordingly, a thing that is understood by two intellects is in a way one and the same thing, and in a way it is many things: because on the part of the object which is known it is one and the same thing; but on the part of the knowledge itself it is two different things. Thus, for instance, if two persons should see one wall, it is the same thing which is seen so far as the thing which is seen is concerned, yet it is two different things from the standpoint of the different acts of seeing; and there would be something exactly like this on the part of the intellect, if the thing which is understood subsisted outside the soul as does the thing which is seen, as the Platonists asserted. But according to the view of Aristotle there seems to be a greater difficulty, although the explanation is the same if one looks into the matter rightly. For there is no difference between Aristotle and Plato, except in this: that Plato asserted that the thing which is understood has actual being outside the soul in exactly the same way as the intellect understands it, that is, as something abstract and universal; but Aristotle asserted "that the thing which is understood is outside the soul, but in another way, because it is understood in the abstract and has actual being in the concrete. And just as, according to Plato, the thing itself which is understood is outside the soul itself, so it is according to Aristotle: and this is clear from the fact that neither of them asserted that the sciences have to do with those things which are in our intellect, as with substances; but whereas Plato said that the sciences have to do with separated forms, Aristotle said that they have to do with the quiddities of things that exist in those things. But the character of universality, which consists in commonness and abstractness, is merely the result of the mode of understanding, inasmuch as we understand things abstractly and universally; but according to Plato it is also the result of the mode of existence of the abstract forms: and consequently Plato asserted that universals subsist, whereas Aristotle did not. Thus then it is clear how the plurality of intellects does not militate against the universality, nor the generality, nor the unity of the thing that is understood.

For just as the principal healing force is one's interior nature, so the principle which chiefly causes knowledge is something intrinsic, namely, the light of the agent intellect, whereby knowledge is caused in us, when we descend through the application of universal principles to some special points, which we gain through experience in discovery. And similarly the teacher draws universal principles down to special conclusions; and hence Aristotle says in I <i>Posteriora</i> [2, 71b] that "a demonstration is a syllogism that causes knowledge."

Sed Aristoteles intendit quod intellectus possibilis est virtus animae, quae non est actus alicuius organi, quasi habeat operationem suam per organum corporale, sicut potentia visiva est virtus organi habens operationem per organum corporale; et quia non habet operationem intellectus possibilis per organum corporale, ideo non oportet quod cognoscat ea tantum quae habent affinitatem vel cum toto corpore, vel cum parte corporis.
          <td>As to the eighth, it must be said that in this reasoning Averroes also was deceived; for he thought that because Aristotle said that the possible intellect is something separate, it would be separated existentially, and as a consequence would not be multiplied in consequence of the multiplication of bodies. But Aristotle means that the possible intellect is a power of the soul, which is not an act of any organ, as though it were to have an activity of its own through some corporeal organ, just as the visual power is the power of an organ and has its activity through a corporeal organ. And because the possible intellect does not have its activity through a corporeal organ, it is consequently not necessary that it know only those things which have an affinity either with the whole body or with a part of the body.

Si enim anima esset forma corporis secundum formam suam tantum, sequeretur quod una et eadem forma perficeret diversas materias diversorum generum, scilicet materiam spiritualem animae et materiam corporalem; quod est impossibile, cum proprius actus sit propriae potentiae. Et praeterea illud compositum ex materia et forma non esset anima, sed forma eius. Cum enim dicimus animam, intelligimus id quod est corporis forma. Si vero forma animae esset forma corporis mediante materia propria, sicut color est actus corporis mediante superficie, ut sic tota anima possit dici corporis forma, hoc est impossibile: quia per materiam intelligimus id quod est in potentia tantum; quod autem est in potentia tantum, non potest esse alicuius actus, quod est esse formam.

          <td>As to the ninth, it must be said that the opinion which holds that the soul is composed of matter and form is entirely false and unprovable. For it could not be the form of the body if it were composed of matter and form. For if the soul were the form of the body in view of its own form only, it would follow that one and the same form would perfect the different kinds of matter of different genera, namely, the spiritual matter of the soul and corporeal matter; and this is impossible since a proper potency has its own proper act. And furthermore, that thing composed of matter and form would not be the soul, but the form of the soul. For whenever we say "soul" we mean that which is the form of the body. But if the form of the soul were the form of the body through the medium of its own matter, as color is an act of a body through the medium of the surface, so that in this way the whole soul could be called the form of the body, — this is impossible, because by "matter" we mean that which is in potency only; but what is in potency only cannot be the act of anything, that is, be a form. But if someone were to mean by the term "matter" a given act, we need not mind; because nothing prevents someone else from calling "matter" what we call "act"; just as, for instance, what we call "stone" someone else can call "ass".

But "to have material being" is incompatible with "being understood in act"; and consequently individual forms which are individuated by matter are not understood in act, but in potency only. Now the intellectual soul is not so individuated by matter as to become a material form, especially in view of its intellect, in consequence of which it transcends its relationship to corporeal matter; but in this sense it is individuated on the basis of corporeal matter, as has been said, namely, inasmuch as it has an aptitude for being the form of "this particular body". And hence it is not thereby impossible for the possible intellect of "this particular man" to be understood in act, and the same applies to those things which are received in the intellect.

          <td>It must be said that, as has been mentioned before [Art. IX], it is necessary for Aristotle to posit the agent intellect; because he did not assert that the natures of sensible things have a subsistence of their own apart from matter, so as to be actually intelligible, and consequently there had to be some power to make them actually intelligible, by abstracting from individual matter; and this power is called the agent intellect. Some have asserted that this is a sort of separated substance, not multiplied in correspondence with the number of men; but others have asserted that it is in itself a sort of power of the soul, and is multiplied in many men. And both of these assertions are true in a sense.

Anima autem humana est intellectiva per participationem; non enim secundum quamlibet sui partem intelligit, sed secundum supremam tantum. Oportet igitur esse aliquid superius anima quod sit intellectus secundum totam suam naturam, a quo intellectualitas animae derivetur, et a quo eius intelligere dependeat. Secundo, quia necesse est quod ante omne mobile inveniatur aliquid immobile secundum motum illum: sicut supra alterabilia est aliquid non alterabile, ut corpus caeleste; omnis enim motus causatur ab aliquo immobili. Ipsum autem intelligere animae humanae est per modum motus; intelligit enim anima discurrendo de effectibus in causas, et de causis in effectus, et de similibus in similia, et de oppositis in opposita. Oportet igitur esse supra animam aliquem intellectum cuius intelligere sit fixum et quietum absque huiusmodi discursu. Tertio, quia necesse est quod, licet in uno et eodem potentia sit prior quam actus, tamen simpliciter actus praecedat potentiam in altero; et similiter ante omne imperfectum necesse est esse aliud perfectum. Anima autem humana invenitur in principio in potentia ad intelligibilia, et invenitur imperfecta in intelligendo; quia nunquam consequetur in hac vita omnem intelligibilium veritatem. Oportet igitur supra animam esse aliquem intellectum semper in actu existentem, et totaliter perfectum intelligentia veritatis.
          <td>For it must be the case that above the human soul there is some intellect on which its understanding depends; and this can be made evident on three grounds. First of all, because every thing that belongs to a thing in a partial way is previously in something in a substantial way; thus, for instance, if a piece of iron is fiery hot, there must be something among things which is "fire" in its own nature and substance. Now the human soul is intellectual in a partial way: for it does not understand in every part of itself, but in its highest part only. There must then be something higher than a soul, which is intellect in its whole nature, from which the intellectuality of the soul is derived and upon which its act of understanding depends. Secondly, because it is necessary that prior to everything that is movable there must be something that is immovable in relation to that movement, just as above the things that are subject to alteration there is something not subject to alteration, like a heavenly body; for every movement is caused by something that is immovable. Now the very understanding of the human soul takes place as a movement; for the soul understands by reasoning discursively from effects to causes, and from causes to effects, and from likes to likes, and from opposites to opposites. There must, then, be above the soul some intellect whose power of understanding is fixed and at rest without discursive thinking of this sort. Thirdly, because it is necessary that, although in one and the same being a potency is prior to an act, nevertheless, absolutely speaking, some act is prior to any potency in another being; and similarly, prior to every imperfect thing there must be something that is perfect. Now the human soul at the outset is in potency to intelligible things; and it is found to be imperfect in understanding because never in this life will it attain the truth of all intelligible things. There must be, then, above the soul some intellect that always exists in act and is wholly perfect in its understanding of truth.

          <td>Non autem potest dici quod iste intellectus superior faciat intelligibilia actu in nobis immediate, absque aliqua virtute quam ab eo anima nostra participet. Hoc enim communiter invenitur etiam in rebus corporalibus, quod in rebus inferioribus inveniuntur virtutes particulares activae ad determinatos effectus, praeter virtutes universales agentes; sicut animalia perfecta non generantur ex sola universali virtute solis, sed ex virtute particulari quae est in semine; licet quaedam animalia imperfecta generentur absque semine ex virtute solis: quamvis etiam in horum generatione non desit actio particularis virtutis alterantis et disponentis materiam. Anima autem humana est perfectissima eorum quae sunt in rebus inferioribus. Unde oportet quod praeter virtutem universalem intellectus superioris participetur in ipsa aliqua virtus quasi particularis ad hunc effectum determinatum, ut scilicet fiant intelligibilia actu. Et quod hoc verum fit experimento apparet. Unus enim homo particularis, ut Socrates vel Plato, facit cum vult intelligibilia in actu, apprehendendo scilicet universale a particularibus, dum secernit id quod est commune omnibus individuis hominum, ab his quae sunt propria singulis. Sic igitur actio intellectus agentis, quae est abstrahere universale, est actio huius hominis, sicut et considerare vel iudicare de natura communi, quod est actio intellectus possibilis. Omne autem agens quamcumque actionem, habet formaliter in seipso virtutem quae est talis actionis principium. Unde sicut necessarium est quod intellectus possibilis sit aliquid formaliter inhaerens homini, ut prius ostendimus; ita necessarium est quod intellectus agens sit aliquid formaliter inhaerens homini. Nec ad hoc sufficit continuatio per phantasmata, ut Averroes fingit, sicut etiam supra de intellectu possibili ostensum est. Et hoc manifeste videtur Aristotelem sensisse, cum dicit quod necesse est in anima esse has differentias, scilicet intellectum possibilem et agentem; et iterum dicit quod intellectus agens est sicut lumen, quod est lux participata. Plato vero, ut Themistius dicit in commento de anima, ad intellectum separatum attendens et non ad virtutem animae participatam, comparavit ipsum soli.
          <td>However, it cannot be said that that higher intellect makes things actually intelligible in us immediately, apart from some power from it in which our soul has a share. For it is quite generally true even in the case of corporeal things, that in lower things there are to be found particular powers that are active in respect to definite effects, besides the universal active powers; thus, for instance, perfect animals are not generated as a result of the universal power of the sun only, but as a result of the particular power which is in the semen; although some imperfect animals are generated without semen as a result of the power of the sun, and yet even in their generation there is not lacking the action of a particular power that alters and disposes the matter. Now the human soul is the most perfect of those beings which exist among inferior things. Hence it must be the case that in addition to the universal power of the higher intellect, there should be imparted to it some power that is, as it were, particular in respect to this definite effect, namely, that things become actually intelligible. And it is clear from experience that this is true; for one particular man, such as Socrates or Plato, makes things intelligible in act when he pleases, that is, by apprehending a universal form from particulars, when he separates that which is common to all individual men from those things which are peculiar to each. Thus then the action of the agent intellect, which is to abstract the universal, is an action of "this particular man", as is also the act of considering or judging about a common nature, which is the action of the possible intellect. Now every agent that does any action has within itself by way of a form the power which is the principle of this kind of action. Hence, just as it is necessary that the possible intellect be something that is formally inherent in man, as we showed above, so it is necessary that the agent intellect be something that is formally inherent in man. A connection by way of phantasms does not suffice for this, as Averroes imagines, as was also shown above in regard to the possible intellect [Art. II and IX]. And it seems clear that Aristotle realized this when he said [III De An., 5, 430a 13] that "there must be these differences in the soul," namely, the agent and the possible intellects; and again he says [430a 15] that the agent intellect is "as it were, a brightness which is a participated light." But Plato, as Themistius says in his <i>Commentum de Anima</i> [III, 5], considering the intellect apart and not considering the participated power of the soul, compared the intellect to the sun.

          <td>But we must consider what that separated intellect is, upon which the human soul's understanding depends. For some have said that this intellect is the lowest of the separated substances, which is connected with our souls by its own light. But this is contrary to the truth of faith in many respects. First of all because, since this intellectual light pertains to the nature of the soul, it comes from Him alone by Whom the nature of the soul is created. Now God alone is the creator of the soul, and not some separated substance which we call an angel; hence it is said significantly in Genesis I [II, 7] that God Himself "breathed into the face of man the breath of life." Hence the only remaining alternative is that the light of the agent intellect is not caused in the soul by any other separated substance, but is caused immediately by God. Secondly, because the ultimate perfection of each individual agent is that it can attain to its own principle. Now the ultimate perfection or beatitude of man is based on intellectual activity, as the Philosopher also says in Ethica X [7]. If, then, the principle and cause of the intellectuality of men were some other separated substance, it would have to be the case that the ultimate beatitude of man would be situated in that created substance; and those who hold this view clearly assert this: for they assert that the ultimate felicity of man is to be connected with the agent intelligence. Now the true faith asserts that the ultimate beatitude of man is in God alone, according to this quotation from John XVII [3]: "This is the eternal life, that they may know Thee, the only true God"; and that in participating in this beatitude, men are "equal to the angels," as is held by Luke XX [36]. Thirdly, because if man were to have a share in the intellectual light from an angel, it would follow that man as regards his mind would not be made to the image of God Himself, but to the image of angels, contrary to what is said in Genesis I [26]: "Let us make man to our image and likeness," that is, to the common image of the Trinity, not to the image of the angels.

          <td>And hence we say that the light of the agent intellect, of which Aristotle is speaking, is impressed upon us immediately by God, and by this light we discern truth from falsity, and good from evil. And concerning this it is said in the Psalms [IV, 6, 7]: "Many say, Who shows us good things? The light of Thy countenance, 0 Lord, is signed upon us," i.e., by which good things are shown to us. Thus, then, that which makes things actually intelligible in us after the manner of a participated light is a part of the soul, and is multiplied along with the number of souls and of men. But that which makes things intelligible after the manner of the sun, which illuminates, is something that is one and separate, which is God. Hence Augustine says in I <i>Soliloquia</i> [VI, 12]: "Reason promises... to show God to my mind as the sun is shown to the eyes; for the eyes of the mind, so to speak, are the senses of the soul. But all the most certain branches of learning are of such a nature as things illumined by the sun, so that they can be seen... and God Himself is the one who illumines." Now this one separate principle of our knowledge cannot be understood to be the agent intellect of which the Philosopher is speaking, as Themistius says [In De An. III, 5], because God is not in the nature of the soul; but the agent intellect is the name given by Aristotle to the light that is received in our soul from God. And in view of this it remains to be said without qualification that the agent intellect is not one in all men.

Sed visus in actu est in ipso videre actu; et hoc est quod dicit: sed non aliquando quidem intelligit, aliquando autem non. Et postmodum subdit: separatum autem hoc solum quod vere est; quod non potest intelligi nec de intellectu agente, nec de intellectu possibili cum utrumque supra dixerit separatum; sed oportet quod intelligatur de omni eo quod requiritur ad intellectum in actu, idest de tota parte intellectiva. Unde et subdit: et hoc solum immortale et perpetuum est; quod si exponatur de intellectu agente, sequetur quod intellectus possibilis sit corruptibilis, ut Alexander intellexit. Sed hoc est contra ea quae Aristoteles superius dixerat de intellectu possibili. Haec autem verba Aristotelis hic exponere necessarium fuit, ne esset alicui occasio errandi.
          <td>As to the third, it must be said that Aristotle does not make that statement about the agent intellect, but about the intellect in act. For first he spoke of the possible intellect, and afterwards of the agent intellect, and finally he begins to speak of the intellect in act, when he says [III De An., 5, 430a 20]: "Actual knowledge of a thing is identical with its object." And he distinguishes the intellect in act from the intellect in potency in three ways. First of all, because the intellect in potency is not the thing that is understood in potency, but the intellect in act, or knowledge in act, is the thing that is understood or known in act. So too he had said of the senses that the sense in potency and the thing that can be sensed in potency are different. Secondly, he compares the intellect in act to the intellect in potency, because the intellect in potency is temporally prior in one and the same man to the intellect in act; for temporally an intellect is in potency before it is in act. But naturally act is prior to potency; and speaking in an absolute sense, we must posit some intellect in act prior even in time to an intellect in potency, which is reduced to act through some intellect in act. And this is what he adds [430a 21]: "And this in potency is temporally prior in one individual; but in general it is not prior even temporally." And he employs this comparison between potency and act also in IX Metaphysica [8, 1049b] and in many other places. Thirdly, he points out a difference in this respect, that the intellect in potency or the possible intellect is sometimes to be found understanding and sometimes not; but this cannot be said of the intellect in act. Just as the visual power sometimes sees and sometimes does not see; but the sight in act consists in actually seeing. And this is what he says [430a 22]: "But it is not true that it sometimes understands and sometimes does not;" and afterwards he adds: "But that thing only is separate which truly is;" and this cannot be understood either of the agent intellect or of the possible intellect, since above he has called both separate; but it must be understood of every thing which is required for the intellect in act, that is, of the whole intellectual part. And hence also he adds [430a 23]: "And this alone is immortal and eternal;" and if this be explained as referring to the agent intellect, it will follow that the possible intellect is corruptible, as Alexander understood; but this is contrary to what Aristotle had said above about the possible intellect. Now it has been necessary to explain 'these words of Aristotle here in order that they may not be an occasion of error to anyone.

          <td>Ad quartum dicendum quod nihil prohibet aliqua duo ad invicem comparata sic se habere quod utrumque sit et ut potentia et ut actus respectu alterius secundum diversa; sicut ignis est potentia frigidus et actu calidus, aqua vero e converso; et propter hoc agentia naturalia simul patiuntur et agunt. Si igitur comparetur pars intellectiva ad phantasmata; quantum ad aliquid se habebit in potentia, et quantum ad aliquid in actu respectu eorum. Phantasma actu quidem habet similitudinem determinatae naturae; sed illa similitudo determinatae speciei est in phantasmate in potentia abstrahibilis a materialibus conditionibus. In parte vero intellectiva est e converso: nam non habet actu similitudines distinctarum rerum; sed tamen actu habet lumen immateriale habens virtutem abstrahendi quae sunt abstrahibilia in potentia. Et sic nihil prohibet in eadem essentia animae inveniri intellectum possibilem, qui est in potentia respectu specierum quae abstrahuntur a phantasmatibus, et intellectum agentem, qui abstrahit speciem a phantasmatibus. Et esset simile, si esset aliquod unum et idem corpus, quod esset diaphanum, existens in potentia ad omnes colores, et cum hoc haberet lucem, qua posset illuminare colores; sicut aliquo modo apparet in oculo cati.
          <td>As to the fourth, it must be said that nothing prevents any two things that are related to each other from being such that each of them is both a potency and an act as regards the other, on different grounds; thus fire, for instance, is potentially cold and actually hot, but water the opposite; and for this reason natural agents are at the same time passive and active. If, then, the intellectual part be compared to the phantasms, in one respect it will be in potency and in another it will be in act with reference to them. A phantasm actually contains a likeness of a definite nature; but this likeness of a definite species is in the phantasm in potency, able to be abstracted from material conditions. But on the intellectual side the opposite is the case; for it does not actually possess likenesses of distinct things; but yet it actually possesses an immaterial light which has the power of abstracting those things which are able to be abstracted in potency. And thus nothing prevents there being found in the same essence of the soul a possible intellect, which is in potency with respect to the species which are abstracted from the phantasms, and an agent intellect, which abstracts the species from the phantasms. We should have something similar if there were one and the same body which would be transparent, being in potency to all colors; and if along with this it would have a light whereby it could illuminate colors, as is somehow apparent in the eye of a cat.

          <td>As to the sixth, it must be said that this very fact that the light of the agent intellect is not an act of any corporeal organ through which it acts is sufficient for its being able to separate intelligible species from phantasms; since the separateness of intelligible species, which are received in the possible intellect, is not greater than the separateness of the agent intellect.

          <td>Ad septimum dicendum quod ratio illa magis concluderet de intellectu possibili quam de intellectu agente. Hoc enim philosophus inducit de intellectu possibili, quod cum intellexerit maximum intelligibile, non minus intelliget minimum. De quocumque tamen intelligatur, non sequitur ex hoc quod virtus intellectus quo intelligimus sit infinita simpliciter, sed quod sit infinita respectu alicuius generis. Nihil enim prohibet aliquam virtutem quae in se finita est, non habere terminum in aliquo genere determinato; sed tamen habet terminum in quantum ad superius genus se extendere non potest: sicut visus non habet terminum in genere coloris, quia si in infinitum multiplicarentur, omnes possent a visu cognosci; non tamen potest cognoscere ea quae sunt superioris generis sicut universalia. Similiter intellectus noster non habet terminum respectu intelligibilium sibi connaturalium, quae a sensibus abstrahuntur; sed tamen terminum habet, quia circa superiora intelligibilia, quae sunt substantiae separatae, deficit: habet enim se ad manifestissima rerum sicut oculus noctuae ad lucem solis, ut dicitur in II Metaph.
          <td>As to the seventh, it must be said that that argument would be more conclusive as regards the possible intellect than the agent intellect. For the Philosopher brings in this point concerning the possible intellect, that when it has understood the most intelligible thing it will not less understand the least intelligible thing. But no matter what this refers to, it does not follow that the power of the intellect by means of which we understand is infinite in an absolute sense, but that it is infinite with reference to some genus. For nothing prevents a power, which is in itself finite, from not having a limit in some definite genus, but nevertheless it does have a limit inasmuch as it cannot extend itself to a higher genus: thus sight does not have a limit in the genus "color" because, if colors were multiplied to infinity, they could all be known by the sight; but yet the sight cannot know those things which belong to a higher genus, as, for instance, the universals. Similarly our intellect does not have a limit in respect to the intelligible things which are connatural to itself, which are abstracted from things that can be sensed; but nevertheless it has a limit, because, in regard to higher intelligible things, which are separated substances, it fails; for it is related to the most manifest of things "as the eye of the owl to the light of the sun", as is said in II <i>Metaphysica</i> [1, 993b 9].

Non enim illud quod est mutabile, vel quod habet similitudinem falsi, potest esse infallibilis regula veritatis. Alio modo dicimur aliquo iudicare de veritate aliqua, sicut virtute iudicativa; et hoc modo per intellectum agentem iudicamus de veritate.
          <td>As to the eighth, it must be said that that argument is not to the point. For to pass judgment on a truth "by means of" something is used in two senses. In one sense, as "through the medium of"; thus we pass judgment on conclusions "by means of" principles, and on things that are regulated "by means of" a rule. And this seems to be the sense in which Augustine's arguments are carried on. For that which is changeable or that which has a likeness to the false cannot be an infallible rule of truth. But in another sense, to pass judgment on some truth "by means of something" is used thus: "by means of our power of judging," and in this sense we pass judgment on a truth by means of the agent intellect.

          <td>Sed tamen ut profundius intentionem Augustini scrutemur, et quomodo se habeat veritas circa hoc, sciendum est quod quidam antiqui philosophi, non ponentes aliam vim cognoscitivam praeter sensum, neque aliqua entia praeter sensibilia, dixerunt, quod nulla certitudo de veritate a nobis haberi potest; et hoc propter duo. Primo quidem, quia ponebant sensibilia semper esse in fluxu, et nihil in rebus esse stabile. Secundo, quia inveniuntur circa idem aliqui diversimode iudicantes, sicut aliter vigilans et aliter dormiens; et aliter infirmus, aliter sanus. Nec potest accipi aliquid quo discernatur quis horum verius existimet, cum quilibet aliquam similitudinem veritatis habeat. Et hae sunt duae rationes quas Augustinus tangit, propter quas antiqui dixerunt veritatem non posse cognosci a nobis. Unde et Socrates, desperans de veritate rerum capessenda, totum se ad moralem philosophiam contulit. Plato vero discipulus eius consentiens antiquis philosophis quod sensibilia semper sunt in motu et fluxu, et quod virtus non habet certum iudicium de rebus, ad certitudinem scientiae stabiliendam, posuit quidem ex una parte species rerum separatas a sensibilibus et immobiles, de quibus dixit esse scientias; ex alia parte posuit in homine virtutem cognoscitivam supra sensum scilicet mentem vel intellectum illustratum a quodam superiori sole intelligibili, sicut illustratur visus a sole visibili.
          <td>But yet in order to examine more searchingly the meaning of Augustine and what the truth is on this point, it must be noted that certain ancient philosophers, who did not assert any way of knowing except sensation nor any entities besides sensible things, declared that no certainty concerning truth could be had by us; and this for two reasons. First of all, because they asserted that sensible things are always in flux and that there is nothing stable in things. Secondly, because some people are to be found who make different judgments about the same thing; thus, for instance, someone who is awake judges in one way and one who is asleep in another, and one who is sick judges in one way and he who is well in another. Nor can anything be had to determine which of them has the truer estimate, since every one of them has some appearance of truth. And these are the the two reasons which Augustine touches on, because of which the ancients said that truth cannot be known by us. And hence too, Socrates, despairing of grasping the truth of things, devoted himself entirely to moral philosophy. But Plato, his disciple, agreeing with the ancient philosophers that sensible things are always in flux and that the sense power has no certain judgment of things, in order to establish the certainty of scientific knowledge posited on the one hand species of things separated from sensible things and immovable, and he said that the sciences are about these; on the other hand he posited in man a knowing power higher than sense, namely, the mind or intellect, illumined by a kind of higher intelligible sun, as the sight is illumined by the visible sun.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Augustinus autem, Platonem secutus quantum fides Catholica patiebatur, non posuit species rerum per se subsistentes; sed loco earum posuit rationes rerum in mente divina, et quod per eas secundum intellectum illustratum a luce divina de omnibus iudicamus: non quidem sic quod ipsas rationes videamus, hoc enim esset impossibile, nisi Dei essentiam videremus; sed secundum quod illae supremae rationes imprimunt in mentes nostras. Sic enim Plato posuit scientias de speciebus separatis esse, non quod ipsae viderentur; sed secundum eas mens nostra participat, de rebus scientiam habet. Unde et in quadam Glossa super illud: diminutae sunt veritates a filiis hominum, dicitur, quod sicut ab una facie resplendent multae similitudines in speculis, ita ex una prima veritate resultant multae veritates in mentibus nostris. Aristoteles autem per aliam viam processit. Primo enim, multipliciter ostendit in sensibilibus esse aliquid stabile. Secundo, quod iudicium sensus verum est de sensibilibus propriis, sed decipitur circa sensibilia communia, magis autem circa sensibilia per accidens. Tertio, quod supra sensum est virtus intellectiva, quae iudicat de veritate, non per aliqua intelligibilia extra existentia, sed per lumen intellectus agentis, quod facit intelligibilia. Non multum autem refert dicere, quod ipsa intelligibilia participentur a Deo, vel quod lumen faciens intelligibilia participetur.
          <td>Augustine, however, following Plato as far as the Catholic Faith allowed, did not posit species of things with a subsistence of their own, but instead of them he posited ideas of things in the divine mind and said that through these, by an intellect that is illumined by divine light, we form judgments about all things; not indeed in such a way that we see the ideas themselves, for this would be impossible unless we were to see the essence of God, but according to what these supreme ideas imprint upon our minds. For Plato held that the sciences were concerned with the separate species in this sense: not that these latter could be seen themselves; but according as our mind participates in them it has knowledge of things. And hence too in a certain gloss on this passage: "Truths are lessened by the sons of men" [August., Enarr. in Psalm XI, 1], it is said that just as from one face many likenesses shine forth in mirrors, so from the one primary truth there result many truths in our minds. Aristotle, however, proceeded along another way. For first he showed in many ways that there is something stable in sensible things. Secondly, that the judgment of the sense is true concerning proper objects of sense, but that it is mistaken about common objects of sense, and more so about things that can be sensed by accident. Thirdly, that above the sense there is an intellectual power which makes judgments concerning truth, not through any intelligible things that exist outside, but through the light of the agent intellect, which makes things intelligible. Now it does not matter much if we say that intelligible things themselves are participated in from God, or that the light which makes them intelligible is participated in from God.

But that whereby we judge a given thing to be better than another, as by a knowing power, need not be better than both.

But on the other hand, everything that is intermediate must be distinguished from both extremes. If, then, the powers of the soul are intermediate between an essence and an accident, it must be the case that they are differentiated from an essence as well as from an accident. But nothing can be differentiated from a thing by something that is common to both. Since, then, to flow from the principles of a substance, which is the reason why the powers are said to be essential, is an attribute even of accidents, it would seem that the powers of the soul are not differentiated from accidents; and so it would seem that there is no intermediate between substance and accident.

For it is obvious that different acts belong to different things; for an act is always proportioned to the thing whereof it is an act. Now just as actual being itself is a kind of actuality of an essence, so acting is an actuality of an active power or virtue. For on this basis both of these are in act: the essence in regard to actual being, and the power in regard to acting. And hence, since in no creature is its own activity its own actual being, but this is proper to God alone, it follows that the active power of no creature is its essence; but to God alone is it proper that His essence is His power.

          <td>Secondly, this appears impossible for a special reason in the case of the soul, on three counts. First of all, because an essence is one; whereas in regard to powers we must assert manyness because of the diversity of acts and objects. For powers must be diversified on the basis of their acts, since a potency is so called in relation to an act. Secondly, the same thing is apparent as a result of the diversity of powers, whereof certain ones are acts of certain parts of the body, as are all powers of the sensitive and the nutritive part; but certain powers are not acts of any part of the body, as, for instance, the intellect and the will.

Uno modo, secundum quod condividitur substantiae, et continet sub se novem rerum genera. Sic autem accipiendo accidens, positio est impossibilis. Non enim inter substantiam et accidens potest esse aliquid medium, cum substantia et accidens dividant ens per affirmationem et negationem; cum proprium substantiae sit non esse in subiecto, accidentis vero sit in subiecto esse.

Alio modo accipitur accidens, secundum quod ponitur ab Aristotele unum de quatuor praedicamentis in I topicorum, et secundum quod a Porphyrio ponitur unum quinque universalium. Sic enim accidens non significat id quod commune est novem generibus, sed habitudinem accidentalem praedicati ad subiectum, vel communis ad ea quae sub communi continentur.

Cum accidentali vero praedicato convenit in hoc quod nec est essentia rei, nec pars essentiae, sed aliquid praeter ipsam. Differt autem ab accidentali praedicato, quia accidentale praedicatum non causatur ex principiis essentialibus speciei, sed accidit individuo sicut proprium speciei; quandoque tamen separabiliter, quandoque inseparabiliter.

          <td>Some, granting this, say that they are not an accident of the soul either, but are its essential or natural properties. This opinion, in fact, if understood in one sense, can be maintained, but in another sense it is impossible. As evidence of this we must bear in mind that "accident" is taken in two senses by philosophers. In one sense, as that which is the opposite of "substance" and includes under itself nine categories of things. Now taking "accident" in this sense the position is impossible. For between a substance and an accident there cannot be anything intermediate, since substance and accident are divisions of being by way of affirmation and denial: since it is proper to a substance not to be in a subject, but to an accident to be in a subject. And hence, if the powers of the soul are not the very essence of the soul (and it is obvious that they are not other substances), it follows that they are accidents included under one of the nine categories. For they are in the second species of quality, which is called natural power or natural impotence. "Accident" is taken in another sense as being one of the four predicates put down by Aristotle in I <i>Topica</i> [4, 101b 17], and as being one of the five universals put down by Porphyry [ <i>Isagoge</i> , IV]. For in this sense an accident does not signify that which is common to the nine categories, but the accidental relationship of a predicate to a subject, or the relationship of a universal to those things which are included under the universal. For if this meaning of accident were the same as the first, since accident in this sense is opposed to genus and species, it would follow that nothing which is in the nine categories could be called either a genus or a species; and it is clear that this is false, since color is the genus of whiteness, and number the genus of "couple". Taking accident in this sense, then, there is something intermediate between substance and accident, that is, between a substantial predicate and an accidental predicate; and this is a property. A property is like a substantial predicate, inasmuch as it is caused by the essential principles of a species; and consequently a property is demonstrated as belonging to a subject through a definition that signifies the essence. But it is like an accidental predicate in this sense, that it is neither the essence of a thing, nor a part of the essence, but something outside of the essence itself. Whereas it differs from an accidental predicate, because an accidental predicate is not caused by the essential principles of a species, but it accrues to an individual thing as a property accrues to a species, yet sometimes separably, and sometimes inseparably. So, then, the powers of the soul are intermediate between the essence of the soul and an accident, as natural or essential properties, that is, as properties that are a natural consequence of the essence of the soul.

Now it is obvious that the knowledge and love of which Augustine speaks in that passage do not designate powers, but acts or habits. And hence Augustine does not mean to say that knowledge and love are the very essence of the soul, but that they are in it, and substantially or essentially. To understand this, we must notice that Augustine in that passage is speaking of the mind according as it knows and loves itself. From this viewpoint, then, knowledge and love can be related to the mind, either as to the mind that loves and knows, or as to the mind that is loved and known. And Augustine is speaking here in this second sense; for the reason why he says that knowledge and love exist substantially or essentially in the mind or in the soul is that the mind loves its essence, or knows its substance. And hence he later adds [De Trin. IX, 4, 7]: "How those three things are not of the same essence I do not see, since the mind loves itself, and itself knows itself."

Unum universale, quod adest cuilibet parti secundum totam suam essentiam et virtutem; unde proprie praedicatur de suis partibus, ut cum dicitur: homo est animal. Aliud vero est totum integrale, quod non adest alicui suae parti neque secundum totam essentiam neque secundum totam suam virtutem; et ideo nullo modo praedicatur de parte, ut dicatur: paries est domus. Tertium est totum potentiale, quod est medium inter haec duo: adest enim suae parti secundum totam suam essentiam, sed non secundum totam suam virtutem. Unde medio modo se habet in praedicando: praedicatur enim quandoque de partibus, sed non proprie. Et hoc modo quandoque dicitur, quod anima est suae potentiae, vel e converso.
          <td>As to the second, it must be said that the book <i>De Spiritu et Anima</i> is apocryphal," since its author is unknown; and there are in it many things falsely or inaccurately stated, because he who wrote the book did not understand the sayings of the saints from whom he tried to quote. Yet if the objection has to be met, we must note that there are three kinds of wholes. One is a universal whole, which is present to every part in its whole essence and power; it is properly predicated of its parts, as when one says: Man is an animal. But another whole is an integral whole, which is not present to any part of itself, either in its whole essence or its whole power; and consequently there is no way in which it is predicated of a part. as if one were to say: A wall is a house. The third whole is a potential whole, which is intermediate between these two: for it is present to a part of itself in its whole essence, but not in its whole power. And hence it stands in an intermediate position as a predicate: for it is sometimes predicated of its parts, but not properly, and in this sense it is sometimes said that the soul is its own powers, or vice versa.

          <td>Ad tertium dicendum quod formae substantiales per seipsas sunt ignotae; sed innotescunt nobis per accidentia propria. Frequenter enim differentiae substantiales ab accidentibus sumuntur, loco formarum substantialium, quae per huiusmodi accidentia innotescunt; sicut bipes et gressibile et huiusmodi; et sic etiam sensibile et rationale ponuntur differentiae substantiales. Vel potest dici, quod sensibile et rationale, prout sunt differentiae, non sumuntur a ratione et a sensu secundum quod nominant potentias, sed ab anima rationali, et ab anima sensitiva.
          <td>As to the third, it must be said that because substantial forms in themselves are unknown but become known to us by their proper accidents, substantial differences are frequently taken from accidents instead of from the substantial forms which become known through such accidents; as, for example, "biped" and "able to walk" and the like; and so also "sensible" and "rational" are put down as substantial differences. Or it may be said that "sensible" and "rational", insofar as they are differences, are not derived from reason and sense according as these are names of powers, but from the rational soul and from the sentient soul.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad quartum dicendum quod ratio illa procedit de accidente secundum quod est commune ad novem genera, et sic nihil est medium inter substantiam et accidens; sed alio modo, ut dictum est.
          <td>As to the fourth, it must be said that that argument is based on "accident" in the sense of what is common to the nine categories; and in this sense there is nothing intermediate between substance and accident; but in another sense, as has been said, there is.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad quintum dicendum quod potentiae animae dici possunt proprietates essentiales, non quia sint partes essentiae, sed quia causantur ab essentia; et sic non distinguuntur ab accidente quod est commune novem generibus: sed distinguuntur ab accidente, quod est accidentale praedicatum et non causatur a natura speciei.
          <td>As to the fifth, it must be said that the powers of the soul can be called essential properties, not because they are essential parts, but because they are caused by the essence; and in this respect they are not differentiated from "accident" that is common to the nine categories; but they are differentiated from "accident" that is an accidental predicate which is not caused by the specific nature.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Unde patet solutio ad sextum.
          <td>And hence the solution to the sixth is clear.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad septimum dicendum quod duplex est operatio intellectus, sicut dicitur in III de anima. Una qua intelligit quod quid est, et tali operatione intellectus potest intelligi essentia rei et sine proprio et sine accidente, cum neutrum eorum ingrediatur rei essentiam; et sic procedit ratio. Alia est operatio intellectus componentis et dividentis; et sic potest substantia intelligi sine accidentali praedicato, etiamsi secundum rem sit inseparabile: sicut potest intelligi corvus esse albus. Non enim est ibi repugnantia intellectuum, cum oppositum praedicati non dependeat ex principiis speciei, quae signatur nomine in subiecto posito. Hac vero operatione intellectus non potest intelligi substantia sine proprio: non enim potest intelligi quod homo non sit risibilis, vel triangulus non habeat tres angulos aequales duobus rectis: hic enim est repugnantia intellectuum, quia oppositum praedicati dependet ex natura subiecti. Sic igitur potest intelligi prima operatione intellectus essentia animae, ut scilicet intelligatur quod quid est absque potentiis; non autem secunda operatione, ita scilicet quod intelligatur non habere potentias.
          <td>As to the seventh, it must be said that there are two activities of the intellect," as is said in III <i>De Anima</i> [6, 430a 26]. One whereby it understands what a thing is: and by this sort of activity of the intellect the essence of a thing can be known, both apart from a property and apart from an accident, since neither of these enters into the essence of a thing; and this is the sense on which the argument is based. The other is an activity of the intellect that combines and separates; and in this way a substance can be understood apart from an accidental predicate, even if it is really inseparable: thus, "a crow is white" is intelligible; for there is no repugnance of concepts there, since the opposite of the predicate does not depend on the principles of the species which is designated by the word put down as the subject. But by this activity of the intellect a substance cannot be understood without its property; for it cannot be understood that "man has not the power of laughing", or that "a triangle does not have three angles equal to two right angles"; for here there is repugnance of concepts, because the opposite of the predicate depends upon the nature of the subject. So, then, by the first sort of activity of the intellect the essence of the soul can be understood, in such a way, that is, that its essence is understood apart from its powers; but not by the second kind of activity, i.e., so that it is understood not to have powers.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad octavum dicendum quod illa tria dicuntur esse una vita, una essentia, vel secundum quod comparantur ad essentiam ut ad obiectum, vel eo modo quo totum potentiale praedicatur de partibus.
          <td>As to the eighth, it must be said that those three things are said to be one life, one essence, either on the ground that they are related to the essence as to an object, or in the way in which a potential whole is predicated of its parts.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad nonum dicendum quod tota anima est forma substantialis totius corporis, non ratione totalitatis potentiarum, sed per ipsam essentiam animae, ut supra dictum est. Unde non sequitur quod ipsa potentia visiva sit forma substantialis oculi, sed ipsa essentia animae, secundum quod est subiectum vel principium talis potentiae.
          <td>As to the ninth, it must be said that the whole soul is the substantial form of the whole body, not by reason of the totality of its powers, but by the very essence of the soul, as was said above [Art. IV]. And hence it does not follow that the power of sight itself is the substantial form of the eye, but that the very essence of the soul is, according as it is the subject or principle of this power.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad decimum dicendum quod forma accidentalis, quae est principium actionis, ipsamet est potentia vel virtus substantiae agentis; non autem proceditur in infinitum, ut cuiuslibet virtutis sit alia virtus.
          <td>As to the tenth, it must be said that an accidental form, which is a principle of action, is itself a power or a virtue of an active substance; but there is no going on to infinity, as though for every virtue there were another virtue."
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad undecimum dicendum quod essentia est maius donum quodammodo quam potentia, sicut causa est potior effectu. Potentiae etiam sunt quodammodo potiores, in quantum sunt propinquiores actibus, quibus anima suo fini inhaeret.
          <td>As to the eleventh, it must be said that an essence is in a sense a greater gift than a power, just as a cause is, more important than an effect. But powers are more important, in a sense, inasmuch as they are nearer to the acts whereby the soul holds fast to its end.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad duodecimum dicendum quod ex hoc contingit quod ab essentia animae aliqua potentia fluat quae non est actus corporis, quia essentia animae excedit corporis proportionem, ut supra dictum est. Unde non sequitur quod potentia sit immaterialior quam essentia; sed ex immaterialitate essentiae sequitur immaterialitas potentiae.
          <td>As to the twelfth, it must be said that the reason why it happens that a power which is not an act of the body flows from the essence of the soul is that the essence of the soul transcends the limitations, of the body, as was said above [Art. II; Art. IX, ad 15]. And hence it does not follow that a power is more immaterial than the essence; but from the immaterial nature of the essence there follows the immaterial nature of the power.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad decimumtertium dicendum quod accidentium unum est alio subiecto propinquius, sicut quantitas est propinquior substantiae quam qualitas; et ita substantia recipit unum accidens alio mediante; sicut colorem mediante superficie, et scientiam mediante potentia intellectiva. Eo igitur modo potentia animae est susceptiva contrariorum sicut superficies albi et nigri, in quantum scilicet substantia suscipit contraria secundum praedicta.
          <td>As to the thirteenth, it must be said that among accidents one is nearer than another to a subject; thus quantity is nearer to a substance than quality; and so a substance receives one accident by means of another; thus, for instance, it receives color by means of a surface, and knowledge by means of the intellectual power. In this way, then, a power of the soul is able to take on contraries, as a surface is able to take on white and black, inasmuch, namely, as the substance receives contraries in the way spoken of above.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad decimumquartum dicendum quod anima, in quantum est forma corporis secundum suam essentiam, dat esse corpori, in quantum est forma substantialis; et dat sibi huiusmodi esse quod est vivere, in quantum est talis forma, scilicet anima; et dat ei huiusmodi vivere, scilicet intellectuali natura, in quantum est talis anima, scilicet intellectiva. Intelligere autem quandoque sumitur pro operatione, et sic principium eius est potentia vel habitus; quandoque vero pro ipso esse intellectualis naturae, et sic principium eius quod est intelligere, est ipsa essentia animae intellectivae.
          <td>As to the fourteenth, it must be said that the soul, insofar as it is the form of the body by its own essence, gives actual being to the body, inasmuch as it is a substantial form; and it gives to it being of a certain sort, i.e., life, inasmuch as it is this kind of form, namely, a soul; and it gives it life of a certain sort, namely, in an intellectual nature, inasmuch as it is this kind of a soul, namely, intellectual. Now "understanding" sometimes means an activity, and in this sense its principle is a power or a habit; but sometimes it means precisely the actual being of an intellectual nature, and in this case the principle of understanding is the very essence of the intellectual soul.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad decimumquintum dicendum quod potentia materiae non est ad operari, sed ad esse substantiale; et ideo potentia materiae potest esse in genere substantiae, non autem potentia animae quae est ad operari.
          <td>As to the fifteenth, it must be said that the potency of matter is not a potency for acting, but for substantial being. And consequently the potency of matter can be in the genus "substance", but not the potency of the soul, which is a potency for acting.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad decimumsextum dicendum quod, sicut supra dictum est, Augustinus comparat notitiam et amorem ad mentem, secundum quod cognoscitur et amatur; et si secundum hanc habitudinem notitia et amor essent in mente vel in anima sicut in subiecto, sequeretur quod pari ratione essent sicut in subiecto in omnibus cognitis et amatis: et sic accidens transcenderet suum subiectum; quod est impossibile. Alioquin, si Augustinus intenderet probare quod haec essent ipsa essentia animae, nulla esset eius probatio. Non enim minus verum est de essentia rei quod non est extra rem; quam de accidente quod non est extra subiectum.
          <td>As to the sixteenth, it must be said that, as was said above [ad 1], Augustine relates knowledge and love to the mind inasmuch as the mind is known and is loved; and if, because of this relationship, knowledge and love were in the mind or in the soul as in a subject, it would follow that by a parallel argument they would be in all things that are known and loved as in a subject: and in that case an accident would transcend its own subject, which is impossible. Otherwise, if Augustine were intending to prove that these were the very essence of the soul, his would be no proof. For it is no less true of the essence of a thing that it does not exist outside the thing than it is true of an accident that it does not exist outside its subject.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad decimumseptimum dicendum quod ex hoc ipso quod anima est immunis a materia secundum suam substantiam, sequitur quod habeat virtutem intellectivam; non autem ita quod eius virtus sit sua substantia.
          <td>As to the seventeenth, it must be said that from the very fast that the soul is free from matter by its own substance, it follows that it has an intellectual power, but not in such a way that its power is its own substance.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad decimumoctavum dicendum quod intellectus non solum est potentia intellectiva, sed multo magis substantia per potentiam; unde intelligitur non solum potentia, sed etiam substantia.
          <td>As to the eighteenth, it must be said that the intellect is not only an intellectual power, but much rather a substance because of its power; hence it is understood not only as a power but also as a substance.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad decimumnonum dicendum quod potentiae animae dicuntur partes non essentiae animae, sed totalis virtutis eius; sicut si diceretur quod potentia ballivi est pars totius potestatis regiae.
          <td>As to the nineteenth, it must be said that the powers of the soul are called parts, not of the essence of the soul, but of its total power; just as if one were to say that the power of a bailiff is a part of the royal power as a whole.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad vicesimum dicendum quod potentiarum animae plures non sunt in anima sicut in subiecto, sed in composito; et huic multiplicitati potentiarum competit multiformitas partium corporis. Potentiae vero quae sunt in sola substantia animae sicut in subiecto, sunt intellectus agens et possibilis et voluntas. Et ad hanc multiplicitatem potentiarum sufficit quod in substantia animae est aliqua compositio actus et potentiae, ut supra dictum est.
          <td>As to the twentieth, it must be said that many of the powers of the soul are not in the soul as in a subject, but in the composite; and the multiformity of the parts of the body fits in with this multiplicity of powers. But the powers, which are in the substance of the soul alone as in a subject, are the agent intellect and the possible intellect, and the will. And for this multiplicity of powers it is sufficient that in the substance of the soul there is some composition of act and of potency, as was said above [Art. I].
