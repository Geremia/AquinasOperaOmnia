        Dicit enim Athanasius quod sicut anima rationalis et caro unus est homo;
        ita Deus et homo unus est Christus. Sed anima rationalis et caro
        uniuntur in unam naturam humanam. ergo Deus et homo uniuntur in unam

        Objection 1: For Athanasius says (On the Creed) that "just as the
        rational soul and the body are one man, so God and man are one Christ".
        But the rational soul and the body are united into one human nature.
        Therefore, God and man are united into the one nature of Christ.

        heretics, because they say the nature and the hypostasis are the same".
        But this does not seem to be false, because in anything simple, and
        especially in God, suppositum and nature are the same. Therefore what
        the heretics say, that if the union was brought about in the person, it
        was brought about in the nature, is not false.

        Sed si unio humanae naturae ad verbum non est facta in natura humana,

        Objection 4: Besides, in all those things in which the suppositum
        possesses something beyond the nature of the species, either an accident
        or an individual nature, it is necessary that the suppositum differ from
        the nature, as is clear from the Philosopher in book 7 of the
        Metaphysics (com. n. 20-21). But if the union of human nature to the
        Word did not occur in the human nature it will not belong to the nature
        of the species of the Word itself. Therefore, it would follow that the
        suppositum of the Word would be different from the divine nature, which
        is impossible. Therefore, it seems that the union was brought about in

        origin is entailed in the person of the Word, but not in the nature.
        But, the Word is not related to human nature through the relation of
        origin, but to the Father. Therefore the Word and the Word's nature are
        related to the assumed nature in the same way. If, therefore, the union

        so the form of a whole is compared to a suppositum. But the form of a
        part cannot exist except in its own matter. Therefore, the form of the
        whole, which is the nature, cannot exist except in its own suppositum,
        which is a human person. And by the same reason the divine nature also
        exists in the divine person. Therefore, if there were two natures there,

        for the person of the Word. If, therefore, the union was brought about

        and there would be two persons. For every substance added to another
        retains its own singularity, as the garment which has been put on or the
        horse which is being ridden. Therefore, human nature comes to the Word
        essentially as though pertaining to the essence or nature of the Word.

        nature, hence it is called a thing of nature. In this way, the
        individual is included under a species, just as the species is included
        under a genus. So since the Word is the suppositum of the divine nature,

        praedictae nativitatis. Et quia huiusmodi nativitatis principium
        intrinsecum est, ulterius derivatum est nomen naturae ad significandum
        interius principium motus, secundum quod dicitur in ii Physic., quia
        natura est principium motus in quo est, per se, non secundum accidens.
        Et quia motus naturalis praecipue in generatione terminatur ad essentiam
        speciei, ulterius essentia speciei, quam significat definitio, natura
        vocatur. Unde et Boetius dicit in libro De Duabus Naturis, quod natura

      <td style="text-align: justify">
        Therefore, it should be known that the name "nature" is taken from being
        born (nascendo). Hence, nature, or "about to be born", was first said of
        the actual birth of living things, namely of plants and animals. Next
        the name nature was transferred to the principle of the aforementioned
        nativity. And since the principle of this kind of nativity is interior,
        the name nature was further extended to signifying a more interior
        principle of motion, according to what is said in II Physics (com. 1),
        that nature is a principle of motion in which [motion] is per se, not
        accidental. Since natural motion especially in generation is terminated
        at the essence of a species, we may say further, the essence of a
        species, which a definition signifies, is called a nature. Hence
        Boethius also says in "
        <i>Concerning the Two Natures</i>
        " that nature is the specific difference informing each and every thing.
        And it is in this way that nature is taken here.

        Ad intelligendum autem quid sit persona, considerandum est quod si

        speciei erit per se individualiter subsistens. Et sic in huiusmodi re
        idem esset realiter suppositum et natura, sola ratione differens; in
        quantum scilicet natura dicitur prout est essentia speciei, suppositum
        vero in quantum per se subsistit. Si vero aliqua res sit intra quam
        praeter essentiam speciei, quam significat definitio, sit aliquid aliud,
        vel accidens vel materia individualis; tunc suppositum non erit omnino
        idem quod natura, sed habebit se per additionem ad naturam. Sicut
        apparet praecipue in his quae sunt ex materia et forma composita. Et
        quod dictum est de supposito, intelligendum est de persona in rationali
        natura: cum persona nihil aliud sit quam suppositum rationalis naturae,

        However, in order to understand what a person is, it must be considered
        that if there is some thing in which there is nothing other than the
        essence of the species, the essence of the species itself will be
        subsisting individually through itself. Thus, in a thing of this kind
        nature and suppositum would be really the same, differing only by
        reason; that is, the thing is called a nature insofar as it is the
        essence of the species, but it is called a suppositum insofar as it
        subsists through itself. But, if there were anything within a thing
        beyond the essence of the species, which the definition signifies, it
        would be something other, either an accident or the matter of an
        individual. Then the suppositum will not be entirely the same as that
        nature, but it will be constituted by an addition to the nature, as is
        most evident in those things which are composed of matter and form. And
        what was said concerning the suppositum must be understood concerning
        the person in a rational nature, since a person is nothing other than a
        suppositum of a rational nature according to what Boethius says in the
        book
        <i>Concerning the Two Natures</i>, that person is an individual
        substance of a rational nature.

        of a rational nature can have something which does not pertain to the
        nature of a species and this is united to it personally, not naturally.
        Therefore, in this manner it must be taken that the human nature was
        united to the Word of God in the person, not in the nature: since if it
        does not pertain to the divine nature, nevertheless it pertains to his
        person, insofar as the person of the Word joined human nature to himself
        by assuming it. But concerning the manner of this kind of conjunction
        doubt and discord occurs. For we see in creatures that something comes

        persona verbi; et quod esset alius filius hominis, et alius Filius Dei.
        Unde Beatam Virginem non confitebatur matrem Dei, sed matrem hominis.-
        Sed hoc est omnino absurdum. primo quidem, quia Sacra Scriptura aliter
        loquitur de hominibus in quibus verbum dei habitavit per gratiam, et
        aliter de Christo. Nam de aliis dicit quod factum est verbum Domini ad
        talem prophetam, sed de Christo dicit: verbum caro factum est, id est
        homo; quasi ipsum verbum personaliter sit homo. Secundo, quia apostolus
        ad Philipp. hanc unionem exinanitionem Filii Dei vocat. Manifestum est
        autem quod inhabitatio gratiae non sufficit ad rationem exinanitionis.
        Alioquin exinanitio competeret non solum Filio, sed etiam Patri et
        Spiritui Sancto, de quo Dominus dicit Ioan. xiv: apud vos manebit, et in

        faciemus. Propter hoc igitur et multa alia, praedictus error damnatus

        Therefore, Nestorius, and Theodorus Mopsuestenus before him, posited
        that the human nature was conjoined to the Word accidentally; namely
        according to the indwelling of grace: positing that the Word of God had
        been united to the man Christ as if by dwelling in him as in his temple.
        But we see that every substance accidentally conjoined to another
        retains its own proper singularity separately, as when clothes are put
        on by man or a house contains an inhabitant. Hence it follows that man
        will have a proper singularity which is his personality. Therefore,
        according to Nestorius it followed that the person of man in Christ was
        a distinct person from the person of the Word, and that one was the son
        of man and the other the Son of God. Hence the Blessed Virgin was not
        acknowledged as the mother of God, but the mother of a man. -- But this
        is entirely absurd. First, indeed, because Sacred Scripture speaks in
        one way concerning men in whom the Word of God dwelled through grace,
        and in another way concerning Christ. For concerning other men it says
        that the Word of the Lord was brought to a given prophet, but concerning
        Christ it says "The Word was made flesh", that is a man; as if the Word
        itself were personally a man. Second, since the Apostle in the letter to
        the Philippians calls this union an emptying of the Son of God. But it
        is clear that the indwelling of grace is not adequate to the notion of
        emptying. Otherwise emptying would belong not only the Son, but also to
        the Father and the Holy Spirit, concerning which the Lord says "He will
        remain with you, and he will be in you" and concerning himself and the
        Father: "We will come to him and make a home with him". Therefore, on
        account of this and many other things, the aforesaid error was condemned
        in the Council of Ephesus.

        essentialiter advenire; ut quasi conflaretur una natura, sive essentia,

        femina sumpta sed facta de verbo in carnem mutato atque converso. Hoc
        autem est maxime impossibile: quia verbum Dei, cum sit vere Deus, est
        immutabile omnino. Unde propter haec dogmata damnatus est Apollinaris in

        But others took the other side, positing that human nature was joined to
        the Word essentially; so that it is as if one nature or essence was
        produced out of the divine and human nature. And on this point indeed
        Apollinaris made three claims, as Pope Leo says in a certain letter to
        the Constantinopolians. First, he posited that a soul was not united to
        Christ, but that the Word had come to the flesh in place of the soul. As
        a result, one nature was produced from the Word and the flesh, just as
        in us one nature is produced from the soul and the body. In which
        doctrine Apollinaris also followed Arius. But since the evangelical
        Scriptures explicitly speak about the soul of Christ, according to that
        passage of John: (10:18) "I have power of laying down my soul," he fell
        into the second opinion, so that he even posited that there was a
        sensitive soul in Christ, but not a rational soul; rather he posited
        that the Word took the place of the intellect in the man Christ. But
        this is unfitting because according to this the Word did not assume a
        human, but a bestial nature, as Augustine argued against him in the book
        <i>Eighty-Three Questions</i>. His third teaching was that the flesh of
        Christ was not taken from a woman but made from the Word changed into
        flesh and even conversely. But this is most impossible, because the Word
        of God, since he is truly God, is completely immutable. For these
        doctrines of Apollinaris were condemned in the Council of
        Constantinople, as was that of Eutyches, who followed his third
        teaching, in the Council of Chalcedeon.

        numeri, in quibus addita vel subtracta unitate variant speciem, ut

        impossibile est quod recipiat alterius naturae additionem. Vel, si

        So, therefore, if the union was not made in the person, but only
        according to inhabiting, as Nestorius claimed, nothing new happened in
        the incarnation of Christ. But, that the union occurred in the nature,
        as Apollinaris and Eutyches claimed, is completely impossible. For since
        the species of things are like numbers in which added and subtracted
        units vary the species, as is said in book 8 of the
        <i>Metaphysics,</i>
        it is impossible that whatever nature is complete in itself should
        receive the addition of another nature. (cf. William of Auxerre) Or if
        it did receive, it would not be the same nature, but another one. But
        the Divine nature is most complete. Similarly, even the human nature has
        the completion of its own species. Hence it is impossible that one
        [nature] should be joined to another in a natural union. Even if it were
        possible, then surely that which was produced from both would be neither
        a human nature nor a divine nature; and thus Christ would be neither man
        nor God, which is unfitting. Therefore, it remains that the human nature
        was united to the Word neither accidentally, nor essentially, but
        substantially; insofar as substance signifies a hypostasis, and
        hypostatically or even personally.

        because the Word cannot be a form in matter; but in the way that the
        body is the instrument of the soul, not indeed an extrinsic and foreign
        instrument, but its own and a conjoined one. Hence Damascene said that
        the human nature is the implement of the Word. However, we would find a
        closer example Augustine says in
        <i>Contra Felicianus</i>, if we suppose, as very many want, that there

        Nevertheless, all examples of this kind are deficient: because the union

        itself and his own being, so also he is unity itself through [his]
        essence. And thus, as his power is not limited to these modes of
        goodness and being which are in creatures, but is able to make new kinds
        of goodness and being unknown to us; so also he was able to make a new
        kind of union through the infinity of his own power, in order for human
        nature to be united to the Word personally, but not accidentally,
        although no adequate example for this can be found in creatures. Hence
        Augustine speaking of this mystery in the epistle
        <i>to Volusianus</i>
        (3) "If a reason is sought, it is not wonderful; if an example is
        demanded, it is not unique. We must grant that something is possible for
        God, which we confess that we cannot investigate; for in such things the
        entire reason for the thing made is the power of maker." And Dionysius

        8: The person of the Son of God can be considered in two ways. In one
        way according to the common character of a person, as it signifies
        something subsisting; and according to this, the union occurred in the
        person according to the character of a person, as was said above. In
        another way, that which is proper to the person of the Son can be
        considered in the person of the Son, namely, the relation by which he is
        referred to the Father. And the union of the two natures is not
        considered according to the character of this relation.

        9: As the incarnation adds nothing of goodness to the divine person, so
        also it adds nothing of lovability to Him. Hence the person of the Word
        incarnate should not be more loved than the person of the Word simply,
        although it must be loved according to another aspect, which aspect,
        nevertheless, is understood as falling under the universal goodness of
        the Word. On account of this also it does not follow, if the union of
        the incarnation occurred in one person and not in another that on
        account of this one person must be loved more than another.

        incarnate Word is one on the part of the subsisting person, but not on

        Ad undecimum dicendum quod non eodem modo se habet natura ad suppositum,
        sicut se habet forma ad materiam. materia enim non constituitur in esse
        nisi per formam; et ideo forma requirit determinatam materiam, quam
        faciat esse in actu. Sed suppositum non solum constituitur per naturam
        speciei, sed etiam alia quaedam potest habere. Et ideo nihil prohibet
        naturam aliquam attribui supposito alterius naturae.

      <td style="text-align: justify">
        11: Nature is not related to suppositum in the same way as form is
        related to matter. For matter is not constituted in being except through
        a form; and thus form requires determinate matter which it [i.e. the
        form] may make to exist actually. But a suppositum is constituted not
        only through the nature of a species, but it can also have certain other
        things. Thus, nothing prevents some nature being attributed to a
        suppositum of another nature.

        divinam, sed magis accipit quod est infra. Unde dicitur Ad Philipp. ii,
        quod cum in forma Dei esset Dei Filius, semetipsum exinanivit; non

        14: The person of the Word is included under the nature of the Word, nor
        can it extend itself to something beyond. But the nature of the Word, by
        reason of its own infinity, includes every finite nature. Thus, when the
        person of the Word assumes human nature, it does not extend itself
        beyond the divine nature, but the greater receives what is beneath it.
        Hence, it is said in
        <i>Philippians</i>
        (2:6-7) that "while" the Son of God "was in the form of God, he emptied
        his very self." Not only laying aside the greatness of the form of God,
        but also assuming the smallness of human nature.

        15: Just as the nature of the Word is infinite, so too the person of the

        equally to the person of the Word in itself from an equality. But, human
        nature corresponds to the Word inasmuch as it was made man. Hence, it is
        not necessary that the nature is simpler and more formal than that man
