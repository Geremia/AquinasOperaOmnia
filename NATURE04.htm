      Natural science seeks the causes of motion. These causes are found in the
      nature of things and in outside factors. One baffling question is whether
      everything that happens has a cause, since some things happen by chance,
      which seems to be the absence of any rational explanation or cause.
    </p>
    <p><strong>4.1 What is chance?</strong> (Book 2, Lessons 7-10)</p>
    <p><strong>4.1.1 Opinions on the subject</strong></p>
    <p>
      There are two opposite extremes among opinions regarding chance. The first
      is to deny chance altogether and attribute everything to
      <strong>determined</strong> causes. Thus if a man went to market to buy a
      suit and there met a debtor who paid him an old debt, this encounter is
      attributed to good luck --yet it had a determinate cause: the deliberate
      intention to buy a suit, which was also the cause of finding the debtor.
      Thus chance as a cause is fictitious.
    </p>
    <p>
      The opposite opinion is that <strong>everything</strong> happens by
      chance: Aristotle states that certain men stated chance to be the cause of
      the heavens and of all the parts of the world. And they said that the
      revolution of the world and all the consequent seasons and happenings on
      this earth are from chance. Thus Democritus held that from the concurrence
      of atoms movable of themselves the heavens and the whole world were
      constituted by chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      A third opinion makes chance a divine reason which we cannot understand,
      something like divine providence. But the arrangement of things by God
      cannot be called chance, since such events are reasoned and ordered.
    </p>
    <p><strong>4.1.2 Distinctions needed for defining chance</strong></p>
    <p>
      Some things happen always or regularly in the same way, while other
      things, like having six fingers, are exceptional. Chance is something that
      is exceptional to the rule; since such exceptions occur, it is not right
      to say that everything is determined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regularity is a characteristic of things that happen by nature, since
      nature always acts in the same way unless impeded. Human behaviour, coming
      from free, will is not necessarily regular, but the will, like nature,
      acts for a purpose, unlike what happens by chance. Chance results are
      unintended and unforeseen in the case of volitional acts, and exceptional
      in the case of natural causality; both the will and nature are accidental
      causes of what happens by chance.
    </p>
    <p><strong>4.1.3 Definition of chance</strong></p>
    <p>
      Chance may now be defined as: "the accidental cause of exceptional or
      unintended results of choice or nature acting for another purpose". Thomas
      uses "chance" as a generic term, and "fortune" (or "luck") for unintended
      results of human choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chance and fortune are termed <strong>good</strong> or
      <strong>bad</strong> according to their effect on people. Also, just as
      chance applies to something that <strong>happens</strong> without being
      intended, it can likewise be applied to what does
      <strong>not happen</strong>, i.e. to missing what was intended, as when we
      say someone worked in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      To what genus of cause is chance reduced? Since it pertains to what
      happens by nature or by intellect (and will), and these are causes "whence
      comes the beginning of motion", chance is reducible to the
      <strong>efficient</strong> cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>4.2 Natural science demonstrates through all four causes</strong>
      (Book 2, Lesson 11)
    </p>
    <p>
      Chapter 1 noted how all four causes apply to natural science, and Chapter
      2 defined each of these causes. As for the
      <strong>material</strong> cause, a scientist may demonstrate that because
      something is composed of contraries it will necessarily corrupt. As for
      the <strong>efficient</strong> cause, a scientist may demonstrate that as
      the sun's position moves to the north the rainy season comes, but as it
      goes back south the dry season follows. But both material and efficient
      causes can be impeded from having their normal effects, and the presence
      of these causes does not necessarily demand that their effects follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>formal</strong> cause is used in a hypothetical demonstration
      stating: "If such-and-such a thing is to be produced, then such-and-such
      material is necessarily required." As for <strong>final</strong> cause, a
      natural scientist may demonstrate that something is so because that is
      <strong>more fitting</strong>, for example, "The front teeth are sharp
      because they are better thus for biting food, and nature does that which
      is better." Nevertheless this does not mean that nature always does what
      is better absolutely speaking, but as befits the substance or nature of
      each thing --otherwise it would give every animal a rational soul, since
      that is better than an irrational soul.
    </p>
    <p><strong>4.3 Nature acts for an end</strong> (Book 2, Lesson 12)</p>
    <p>
      Nature is among the number of causes which act for the sake of something.
      And this is important with reference to the problem of providence. For
      things which do not know the end do not tend toward the end unless they
      are directed by one who does know, as the arrow is directed by the archer.
      Hence if nature acts for an end, it is necessary that it be ordered by
      someone who is intelligent. This is the work of providence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who attack final causality reject the supposition that nature is
      always seen to do what is best and most fitting, e.g. that a foot is made
      the way it is for the sake of walking. Arguing against this they would say
      that the good or utility which comes about from an operation of nature
      simply <strong>happens</strong> (by chance), while the process itself is
      determined by the necessity of matter. Thus it is the necessity of matter
      whereby the sun's heat causes water to evaporate and become clouds, which
      later cool, condense and fall as rain. The rain may
      <strong>happen</strong> to fall on crops and help them grow, but it may
      equally well <strong>happen</strong> to fall on ripe grain and spoil it.
    </p>
    <p>
      They argue the same way when speaking of the parts of animals: Front teeth
      were not made sharp and back teeth broad for the convenience of eating,
      but they simply <strong>happened</strong> that way and the utility
      followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the objection that such usefulness follows always or for the most part,
      and as such must be intended by nature, they answer that in the beginning
      many non-viable forms came and went and only the fit survived.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      They state that in the foundation of the world the four elements came
      together to constitute natural things, and there were many and various
      dispositions of natural things. Now wherever everything came together in
      just the way that is suitable for some utility, as if they had been made
      for the sake of this, such things alone were preserved --since they had a
      disposition apt for preservation not from any agent intending an end, but
      from that which is "per se in vain", i.e. from chance. Whatever things did
      not have such a disposition were destroyed and do not exist today. Thus
      Empedocles stated that in the beginning there were certain beings
      generated which were part-oxen and part-men.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      After stating this position (the essentials of later Darwinism) Aristotle
      gives several arguments against "natural selection by chance":
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.25in">
      What happens always or for the most part (regularly) is not from chance.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.25in">
      Nature always acts as though for and <strong>end</strong>. This is clear
      from the similarity between nature and art; just as art proceeds towards a
      definite end with determinate means, so does nature. Thus medicine tries
      to imitate natural processes.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.25in">
      The purposiveness of nature is most evident in animal behaviour, such as
      the activity of spiders and bees, which appear so intelligent. Yet they do
      not act from intelligence, but through nature, as is evident from the fact
      that they always act in the same way. For every swallow makes its nest in
      a similar way, and every spider makes its web in a similar way --which
      would not be the case if they were acting from intellect and art, for
      every builder does not make a house in a similar way, since the artisan is
      able to decide on the form of the artifact and can vary it.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.25in">
      The form of a new life is the <strong>end</strong> of generation, and the
      nature of an end is that other things be done for the sake of it.
      Therefore the process of generation is for the sake of an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      In reply to objections against nature's acting for an end, Aristotle
      declares:
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.25in">
      The "sins of nature", such as monstrosities, are not evidence that nature
      is not purposeful, because (1) like art, the recognition of errors
      supposes that there is a right way for achieving a certain end. (2) The
      determined principles and determined order of development, as in the case
      of an embryo, indicate that nature acts for a determinate end. (3) Both
      animals and plants have their own specific seed to produce their like and
      not indiscriminate offspring.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.25in">
      The <strong>agent</strong> and the <strong>matter</strong> are not
      sufficient reasons for the way a thing develops, because nature always
      proceeds from the same principle to the same end, unless there is some
      impediment. Just as when a man has a habit of going to a particular place
      at a particular time it is because of an abiding intention, such as to buy
      something, so the regularity of nature is for a specific purpose.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.25in">
      The fact that nature does not <strong>deliberate</strong> is no argument
      that it does not act for a purpose, because even <strong>art</strong> does
      not deliberate.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      The artisan does not deliberate in so far as he possesses the art, but in
      so far as he fails from the certitude of the art --whence the most certain
      arts do not deliberate, as the writer does not deliberate as to how he
      should form the letters. Even those artisans who do deliberate, once they
      have found the certain principle of the art, do not deliberate in carrying
      it out. Thus the harpist, if he should deliberate before touching each
      string, would be considered most inexperienced.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      From this it is evident that not to deliberate occurs to some agents, not
      because they do not act for an end, but because they have determined means
      by which they act. Whence nature, since it has determinate means through
      which it acts, for this reason does not deliberate.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      For in no other respect does nature seem to differ from art except that
      nature is an intrinsic principle, and art is an extrinsic principle. For
      if the art of ship-making were intrinsic in the wood, the ship would be
      made by nature in the same way that it is now made by art...
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      Whence it is evident that nature is nothing but a certain kind of art,
      i.e. the divine art, impressed upon things, by which these things are
      moved to a determinate end. It is as if the shipbuilder were able to give
      to timbers that by which they would move themselves to take the form of a
      ship.

      We ought then to regard the present state of the universe as the effect of
      its anterior state and as the cause of the one which is to follow. Given
      for one instant an intelligence which could comprehend all the forces by
      which nature is animated, and the respective situation of human beings who
      compose it {an intelligence sufficiently vast to submit these data to
      analysis} it would embrace in the same formula the movements of the
      greatest bodies of the universe and those of the lightest atom; for it,
      nothing would be any more uncertain, and the future and the past would be
      present to its eyes. The human mind offers, in the perfection which it has
      been able to give to astronomy, a feeble idea of this intelligence. Its
      discoveries in mechanics and geometry, added to that of universal gravity,
      have enabled it to comprehend in the same analytical expressions the past
      and the future states of the system of the world. Applying the same method
      to some other objects of its knowledge, it has succeeded in referring to
      general laws observed phenomena and in foreseeing those which given
      circumstances ought to produce.

      How is it that the varieties, which I have called incipient species,
      become ultimately converted into good and distinct species which in most
      cases obviously differ from each other far more than do the varieties of
      the same species? How do these groups of species, which constitute what
      are called distinct genera, and which differ from each other more than do
      the species of the same genus, arise? All these results follow from the
      struggle for life. Owing to this struggle, variations, however slight and
      from whatever cause proceeding, if they be in any degree profitable to the
      individuals of a species, in their infinitely complex relations to other
      organic beings and to their physical conditions of life, will tend to the
      preservation of such individuals, and will generally be inherited by the
      offspring. The offspring, also, will thus have a better chance of
      surviving, for, of the many individuals of any species which are
      periodically born, but a small number can survive. I have called this
      principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the
      term Natural Selection, in order to mark its relation to man's power of
      selection. But the expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer of the
      Survival of the Fittest is more accurate, and is sometimes equally
      convenient. We have seen that man by selection can certainly produce great
      results, and can adapt organic beings to his own uses, through the
      accumulation of slight but useful variations, given to him by the hand of
      Nature. But Natural Selection, as we shall hereafter see, is a power
      incessantly ready for action, and is as immeasurably superior to man's
      feeble efforts, as the works of Nature are to those of Art.

    <p>
      As we said, since any moved thing, in as much as it is moved, tends to the
      divine likeness so that it may be perfected in itself, and since a thing
      is perfect in so far as it is actualized, the intention of everything
      existing in potency must be to tend through motion toward actuality. And
      so, the more posterior and more perfect an act is, the more fundamentally
      is the inclination of matter directed toward it. Hence, in regard to the
      last and most perfect act that matter can attain, the inclination of
      matter whereby it desires form must be inclined as toward the ultimate end
      of generation. Now, among the acts pertaining to forms, certain gradations
      are found. Thus, prime matter is in potency, first of all, to the form of
      an element. When it is existing under the form of an element it is in
      potency to the form of a mixed body; that is why the elements are matter
      for the mixed body. Considered under the form of a mixed body, it is in
      potency to a vegetative soul, for this sort of soul is the act of a body.
      In turn, the vegetative soul is in potency to a sensitive soul, and a
      sensitive one to an intellectual one... After this last type of form no
      more noble form is found in the order of generable and corruptible things.
      Therefore, the ultimate end of the whole process of generation is the
      human soul, and matter tends toward it as toward an ultimate form. So
      elements exist for the sake of mixed bodies; these latter exist for the
      sake of living bodies, among which plants exist for animals, and animals
      for men. Therefore, man is the end of the whole order of generation.
    </p>
    <p>
      And since a thing is generated and preserved in being by the same reality,
      there is also an order in the preservation of things, which parallels the
      foregoing order of generation. Thus we see that mixed bodies are sustained
      by the appropriate qualities of the elements; plants, in turn, are
      nourished by mixed bodies; animals get their nourishment from plants; so,
      those that are more perfect and more powerful from those that are more
      imperfect and weaker. In fact, man uses all kinds of things for his own
      advantage: some for food, others for clothing. That is why he was created
      nude by nature, since he is able to make clothes for himself form other
      things; just as nature also provided him with no appropriate nourishment
      except milk, because he can obtain food for himself from a variety of
      things. Other things he uses for transportation, since we find man the
      inferior of many animals in quickness of movement and in the strength to
      do work; other animals being provided, as it were, for his assistance.
      And, in addition to this, man uses all sense objects for the perfection of
      intellectual knowledge. Hence it is said of man in the Psalms (8:8) in a
      statement directed to God: "You have put all things under his feet". And
      Aristotle says, in <em>Politics</em> I, that man has natural dominion over
      all animals.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, if the motion of the heavens is ordered to generation, and if the
      whole of generation is ordered to man as a last end within this genus, it
      is clear that the end of celestial motion is ordered to man, as to an
      ultimate end in the genus of generable and mobile beings.
