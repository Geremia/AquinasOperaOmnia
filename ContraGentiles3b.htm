              [1] From the things set forth earlier it is immediately evident
              that celestial bodies cannot be causes of events which go on in
              the understanding. Indeed, we have already shown that the order of
              divine providence requires the lower things to be ruled and moved
              by the higher ones. But the understanding surpasses all bodies in
              the order of nature, as is also clear from what we have said
              before. So, it is impossible for celestial bodies to act directly
              on the intellect. Therefore, they cannot be the direct cause of
              things that pertain to understanding.

              [2] Again, no body acts except through motion, as is proved in
              <i>Physics</i> VIII [6]. But things that are immovable are not
              caused by motion, for nothing is caused by the motion of an agent,
              unless the agent moves a passive subject during the motion. So,
              things that are utterly apart from motion cannot be caused by the
              celestial bodies. But things that are in the area of understanding
              are entirely apart from motion, properly speaking, as is evident
              from the Philosopher, in <i>Physics</i> VII [3]. On the contrary,
              “through being undisturbed by motions, the soul becomes prudent
              and knowing” as is stated in the same place. Therefore, it is
              impossible for celestial bodies to be the direct cause of things
              that pertain to understanding.

              [3] Besides, if nothing is caused by a body unless the body is
              moved while the motion is going on, it is necessary for everything
              that receives an impression from a body to be moved. Now, nothing
              is so moved except a body, as is proved in <i>Physics</i> VI [4].
              So, everything that receives an impression from a body must be a
              body, or some power of a body. Now, we showed in Book Two that the
              intellect is neither a body nor a bodily power. Therefore, it is

              mover must be in some way actual, in regard to the effects to
              which the passive and movable subject is in potency. Now, the
              celestial bodies are not actually intelligible, for they are
              certain individual, sensible things. And so, since our intellect

              15] Furthermore, the proper operation of a thing depends on its
              nature, which, in things that are generated, is acquired, along
              with the proper operation, through the process of generation. This
              is clear in the case of heavy and light things, which immediately
              at the end of the process that generates them possess their proper
              motion unless there be some impediment. Because of this the
              generating agent is called a mover. So, that which in regard to
              the beginning of its nature is not subject to the actions of
              celestial bodies cannot be subject to them in regard to its
              operation. Now, man’s intellectual nature is not caused by any
              corporeal principles, but is of completely extrinsic origin, as we
              proved above. Therefore, the operation of the intellect does not
              come directly under the celestial bodies.

              intellectu. Et propter hoc dixerunt quod, cum transmutatio
              inferiorum corporum sequatur transmutationem corporum superiorum,
              intellectualis operatio sequatur corporum caelestium motus:
              secundum illud Homeri: talis est intellectus in diis et hominibus
              terrenis qualem in die ducit pater virorum deorumque: idest sol;
              vel magis Iupiter, quem dicebant summum Deum, intelligentes per
              ipsum totum caelum, ut patet per Augustinum, in libro de civitate
              Dei.

              [9] Furthermore, our confidence in this view will be increased if
              we consider the statements of the philosophers on the point. As a
              matter of fact, the ancient natural philosophers, like Democritus,
              Empedocles, and those of similar persuasion, claimed that
              understanding does not differ from sense perception, as is evident
              from
              <i>Metaphysics</i> IV [5] and from Book III of
              <i>On the Soul</i> [3]. And so, the conclusion was made that,
              since sensation is a bodily power depending on changes in bodies,
              the same thing is also true of understanding. For this reason,
              they said that intellectual operation results from the motion of
              the celestial bodies, because change in lower bodies results from
              change in the higher bodies. According to a passage in Homer: “So
              understanding in gods and in earthly men is like the daylight
              which the father of men and gods brings down”; the reference is to
              the sun, or, better, to Jupiter, whom they called the highest god,
              understanding him to be the whole heavens, as is clear from
              Augustine in his <i>City of God</i> [IV, 11].

              Hinc etiam processit Stoicorum opinio, qui dicebant cognitionem

              [10] Next came the opinion of the Stoics, who said that
              intellectual knowledge is caused by the fact that the images of
              bodies are impressed on our minds, as a sort of mirror or as a
              page receives the letters imprinted on it without its doing
              anything; as Boethius reports in Book V of the <i>Consolation</i>.
              According to their view, it followed that intellectual notions are
              impressed on us chiefly by an impression from the celestial
              bodies. Hence, the Stoics were the ones who especially asserted
              that the life of man is directed by a fatal necessity.

              However, this theory appeared false, as time went on, as Boethius
              says in the same place, for the understanding combines and
              separates, compares the highest things with the lowest, and knows
              universals and simple forms that are not found in bodies. So, it
              is obvious that the understanding is not simply receptive of
              bodily images, but has a power higher than bodies, since external
              sensation which is only receptive of bodily images does not
              encompass the actions mentioned above.

              [14] However, we should note that, though celestial bodies cannot
              be directly the causes of our understanding, they may do something
              indirectly in regard to it. For, although the understanding is not
              a corporeal power, the operation of understanding cannot be
              accomplished in us without the operation of corporeal powers: that
              is, the imagination, the power of memory, and the cogitative
              power, as is evident from preceding explanations. And as a result,
              if the operations of these powers are blocked by some
              indisposition of the body, the operation of the intellect is
              impeded, as is evident in demented and sleeping persons, and in
              others similarly affected. And that is why even the good
              disposition of the human body makes one able to understand well,
              for, as a result of this, the aforesaid powers are in a stronger
              condition. Thus it is stated in Book II of
              <i>On the Soul</i>
              [9] that we observe that “men with soft flesh are well endowed
              mentally.”

              Dispositio autem corporis humani subiacet caelestibus motibus.

              Now, the condition of the human body does come under the influence
              of celestial motions. In fact, Augustine says, in the
              <i>City of God</i>
              V, that “it is not utterly absurd to say that certain influences
              of the stars are able to produce differences in bodies only.” And
              Damascene says, in Book II [
              <i>De fide orthodoxa</i>
              ], that “different planets establish in us diverse temperaments,
              habits and dispositions.”“So, the celestial bodies work indirectly
              on the good condition of understanding. Thus, just as physicians
              may judge the goodness of an intellect from the condition of its
              body, as from a proximate disposition, so also may an astronomer
              judge from the celestial motions, as the remote cause of such
              dispositions. In this way, then, it is possible that there is some
              truth in what Ptolemy says in his
              <i>Centiloquium</i>: “When, at the time of a man’s birth, Mercury
              is in conjunction with Saturn and is itself in a strong condition,
              it gives inwardly to things the goodness of understanding.”

              [9] Moreover, celestial bodies make no direct impression, except

              choice, this will be either because they influence our bodies, or
              because they influence external things. But in neither way can
              they be an adequate cause of our act of choice. In fact, it is not
              an adequate cause of our choice, for some corporeal things to be
              externally presented to us; for it is clear that on encountering
              some pleasurable object, say an item of food or a woman, the
              temperate man is not moved to choose it, but the intemperate man
              is moved. Likewise, whatever change might take place in our body
              as a result of the influence of a celestial body, it would not
              suffice to cause our choice, because there are no other results
              from this in us than certain passions, more or less strong. But
              passions, whatever their strength, are not an adequate cause for
              choice, since by the same passions an incontinent man is led to
              follow them by choice, while a continent man is not so induced.
              Therefore, it cannot be said that celestial bodies are the causes
              of our acts of choice.

              [11] Again, man is naturally a political animal, or a social one.
              This is apparent, indeed, from the fact that one man is not
              sufficient unto himself if he lives alone, because nature provides
              but few things that are sufficient for man. Instead, it gives him
              reason whereby he may make ready all the things needed for life,
              such as food, clothing, and the like; one man is not sufficient to
              do all these things. So, to live in society is naturally implanted
              in man. But the order of providence does not take away from a
              thing what is natural to it, but provides for each thing in accord
              with its nature, as is evident from what we have said. Therefore,

              life is taken away. Now, it would be removed if our acts of choice

              [15] But this argument is not adequate if celestial bodies are
              claimed to be the direct cause of our choices, in the sense that
              they make direct impressions on the intellect and will. For the
              impression of a universal cause is received in any being according
              to the mode of that being. So, the influence of a star, that
              impels toward the pleasure associated with the generative act will
              be received in any being according to its own mode. Thus we
              observe that different animals have different times and various
              ways of reproducing, according to what befits their nature, as
              Aristotle says in his treatise on the
              <i>History of Animals</i>
              [V, 8]. So, intellect and will are going to receive the influence
              of this star according to their own mode. But, when an object is
              desired in accordance with the mode of intellect and reason, there
              is no sin in the choice; in fact, a choice is bad, always because
              it is not in accord with right reason. Therefore, if celestial
              bodies were the cause of our choices, there would never be a bad
              choice for us.

              [19] By this conclusion the theory of the Stoics is also refuted,
              for they claimed that all our acts, and even our choices, are
              ordered by the celestial bodies. This is also said to have been
              the position of the ancient Pharisees among the Jews. The
              Priscillianists, too, shared this error, as is stated in the book

              [21] Yet we should note that, though celestial bodies are not
              directly the cause of our choices, in the sense of directly making
              impressions on our wills, some occasion for our choices may be
              indirectly offered by them, because they do make an impression on
              bodies, and in a twofold sense. In one way, the impressions of the
              celestial bodies on external bodies are for us the occasion of a
              certain act of choice; for instance, when the atmosphere is
              disposed to severe cold by the celestial bodies, we choose to get
              warmed near a fire or to do other such acts which suit the
              weather. In a second way, they make an impression on our bodies;
              when a change occurs in them, certain movements of the passions
              arise in us; or we are made prone by their impressions to certain
              passions, as the bilious are prone to anger; or again, some bodily
              disposition that is an occasion for an act of choice may be caused
              in us by their impression, as when, resulting from our illness, we
              choose to take medicine. At times, too, a human act may be caused
              by the celestial bodies, in the sense that some people become
              demented as a result of a bodily indisposition and are deprived of
              the use of reason. Strictly speaking, there is no act of choice
              for such people, but they are moved by a natural instinct, as are
              brutes.

              [22] Moreover, it is plain and well known by experience that such
              occasions, whether they are external or internal, are not the
              necessary cause of choice, since man is able, on the basis of
              reason, either to resist or obey them. But there are many who
              follow natural impulses, while but few, the wise only, do not take
              these occasions of acting badly and of following their natural
              impulses. This is why Ptolemy says, in his
              <i>Centiloquium</i>: “the wise soul assists the work of the
              stars”; and that “the astronomer could not give a judgment based
              on the stars, unless he knew well the power of the soul and the
              natural temperament”; and that “the astronomer should not speak in
              detail on a matter, but in general.” That is to say, the
              impression from the stars produces its result in most people who
              do not resist the tendency that comes from their body, but it is
              not always effective, for, in one case or another a man may
              resist, perhaps, the natural inclination by means of reason.

              remote causes, whereas the proximate causes of lower effects are
              the active and passive powers in these lower things, which are not
              necessary causes, but contingent, for they may fail in a few
              instances. So, effects in these lower bodies do not follow of
              necessity from the motions of the celestial bodies.

              esse moriturum est necessarium, quia secundum horum ex causa sua
              de necessitate sequitur, non autem primum. Si ergo ex motibus
              caelestibus de necessitate sequitur quod eorum effectus sint
              quandoque futuri, tollitur possibile et contingens quod necessario
              opponitur.

              [9] As a matter of fact, we do not have to defend this meaning of
              possible against the statement that effects are caused by
              necessity, but, rather, the possible that is opposed to the
              necessary, in the sense that the possible is called that which can
              be, and also not be. Now, a thing is not called possible, or
              contingent, in this way from the sole fact that it is at one time
              in potency and at another time in act, as the preceding answer
              takes it. In fact, in that preceding sense there is possibility
              and contingency even in celestial motions, for there is not always
              an actual conjunction or opposition of the sun or moon. Rather, it
              is sometimes actually so, sometimes potentially so; yet these
              events are necessary, for demonstrations of such events may be
              given. But the possible, or contingent, that is opposed to the
              necessary has this characteristic: it is not necessary for it to
              happen when it is not. This is indeed so, because it does not
              follow of necessity from its cause. Thus, we say that Socrates
              will sit is a contingent fact, but that he. will die is necessary,
              because the second of these facts follows necessarily from its
              cause, whereas the first does not. So, if it follows necessarily
              from the celestial motions that their effects will occur at some
              time in the future, then the possible and contingent that is
              opposed to the necessary is thereby excluded.

              Sciendum est autem quod ad probandum effectus caelestium corporum

              tali ratione. Si aliquis effectus caelestium corporum impeditur,
              oportet quod hoc sit per aliquam causam voluntariam vel naturalem.

              [10] Moreover, we should note that, in order to prove that the
              effects of the celestial bodies come about by necessity, Avicenna
              uses an argument like this in his
              <i>Metaphysics</i> [X, 1]. If any effect of the celestial bodies
              is blocked, this must be due to some voluntary or natural cause.
              But every voluntary or natural cause is reducible to some
              celestial source. Therefore, even the blocking of the effects of
              the celestial bodies results from some celestial sources. So, if
              the entire order of celestial things be taken together, it is
              impossible for its effect ever to fail to come about. Hence he
              concludes that the celestial bodies produce necessarily the
              effects which must occur in these lower bodies, both the voluntary
              and the natural ones.

            <td>
              [12] He answers this argument, in
              <i>Metaphysics</i>
              VI [2-3], by denying two propositions which the argument uses. One
              of these is: “if any cause be granted, it is necessary to grant
              its effect.” Indeed, this is not necessary in the case of all
              causes, for a certain cause, though it may be the direct, proper
              and sufficient cause of a given effect, may be hindered by the
              interference of another cause so that the effect does not result.
              The second proposition that he denies is: “not everything that
              exists in any way at all has a direct cause, but only those things
              that exist of themselves; on the other hand, things that exist
              accidentally have no cause.” For instance, there is a cause within
              a man for the fact that he is musical, but there is no cause for
              the fact that he is at once white and musical. As a matter of
              fact, whenever plural things occur together because of some cause
              they are related to each other as a result of that cause, but
              whenever they occur by accident they are not so related to each
              other. So, they do not occur as a result of a cause acting
              directly; their occurrence is only accidental. For instance, it is
              an accident to the teacher of music that he teaches a white man;
              indeed, it is quite apart from his intention; rather, he intends
              to teach someone who is capable of learning the subject.

              motions of the celestial bodies are also the causes of our acts of
              choice, not simply as occasions, as was said above, but directly.
              For he claims that the celestial bodies are animated. Hence, since
              celestial motion is from a soul and is the motion of a body,
              therefore, just as it is a bodily motion with the power of causing
              change in bodies, so as a motion from the soul it must have the
              power to make an impression on our souls. And thus, the celestial
              motion is the cause of our acts of will and choice. On this point

              [2] But this theory is not reasonable. Every effect proceeding
              through an instrument from an efficient cause must be
              proportionate to the instrument, as also to the agent, for we
              cannot use just any instrument for any effect. Hence, a result
              cannot be accomplished by means of an instrument if the action of
              the instrument in no way covers the result. Now, the action of a
              body in no way extends to the production of a change of
              understanding and will, as we showed, unless, perchance, by
              accident, through a change in the body, as we said before. So, it
              is impossible for the soul of a celestial body, if it be animated,
              to make an impression on the intellect and will by means of the
              motion of a celestial body.

              [3] Again, a particular agent cause, when acting, bears a likeness
              to the universal agent cause and is patterned on it. But, if a
              human soul were to impress another human soul through a corporeal
              operation, as when it reveals its thought by means of meaningful
              speech, the bodily action initiated by one soul does not reach the
              other soul without the mediation of its body. In fact, the spoken
              word moves the auditory organ, and then, having been so perceived
              by the sense power, it extends its message to the understanding.
              So, if the celestial soul makes an impression on our souls through
              bodily movement, that action will not reach our soul without
              making a change in our body. Now, this is not a cause of our acts
              of choice, but simply an occasion, as is clear from the foregoing.
              Therefore, celestial motion will not be a cause of our act of
              choice, except as a mere occasion.

              Item. Cum movens et motum oporteat esse simul, ut probatur in VII
              Phys., oportet quod a primo movente perveniat motus usque ad
              ultimum quod movetur, quodam ordine: ut scilicet movens per id
              quod est sibi proximum, moveat illud quod est ab eo distans.
              Corpori autem caelesti, quod moveri ponitur ab anima sibi

              [4] Besides, since the mover and the thing moved must be
              simultaneous, as is proved in
              <i>Physics</i> VII the motion must extend in a definite order,
              from the first mover to the last thing that is moved; that is,
              such that the mover moves what is far away from it by means of
              what is near to it. Now, our body is nearer than our soul is to
              the celestial body which is asserted to be moved by a soul joined
              to it, for our soul has no relation to a celestial body except
              through our body. This is evident from the fact that separate
              intelligences have no relation to a celestial body, unless,
              perhaps, that of a mover to a thing moved. So, a change in a
              celestial body, initiated by its soul, does not reach our soul
              except through the mediation of our body. But our soul is not
              moved when our body is moved, except accidentally; nor does choice
              result from a change in our body, except by way of occasion, as we
              said. Therefore, celestial motion, by virtue of the fact that it
              is from a soul, cannot be the cause of our act of choice.

              Praeterea. Secundum positionem Avicennae, et quorundam aliorum

              quae quidem agit in animas nostras inquantum facit intellecta in
              potentia esse intellecta in actu. Hoc autem fit per abstractionem
              ab omnibus materialibus dispositionibus: ut patet ex his quae
              dicta sunt in secundo. Quod igitur agit directe in animam, non
              agit in eam per motum corporeum, sed magis per abstractionem ab
              omni corporeo. Anima igitur caeli, si sit animatum, non potest

              [5] Moreover, according to the theory of Avicenna and some other
              philosophers, the agent intellect is a separate substance that
              acts on our souls by making potentially understood things to be
              actually understood. Now, this is done by abstraction from all
              material conditions, as is evident from our explanations in Book
              Two. So, that which acts directly on the soul does not act on it
              through corporeal motion, but, rather, through abstraction from
              everything corporeal. Therefore, the soul of the heavens, if it be
              animated, cannot be the cause of our acts of choice or
              understanding through the motion of the heavens.

              [2] For the actions of all creatures are embraced under the order

              it is the law of providence that everything be moved immediately
              by its proximate cause. So, unless such an order were obeyed, a
              superior created cause could neither move nor do anything. Now,
              the proximate mover of the will is the good as apprehended, which
              is its object, and it is moved by it, just as sight is by color.

              Amplius. Violentum, ut dicitur in III Ethic., est cuius principium

              [5] Moreover, the violent, as is said in
              <i>Ethics</i> III [1], is “that whose principle is outside; the
              patient making no contribution of force.” So, if the will is moved
              by some external principle, the motion will be violent. Now, I am
              talking about being moved by some external principle which moves
              in the way of an agent, and not in the way of an end. But the
              violent is incompatible with the voluntary. So, it is impossible
              for the will to be moved by an extrinsic principle as by an agent;
              rather, every movement of the will must proceed from within. Now,
              no created substance is joined to the intellectual soul in regard
              to its inner parts, but only God, Who is alone the cause of its
              being and Who sustains it in being. Therefore, by God alone can
              voluntary movement be caused.

              voluntary movement, because both of the latter must arise from an
              intrinsic source. The only way in which an external agent moves a
              thing naturally is by causing an intrinsic principle of motion
              within the movable thing. Thus, a generating agent, which gives
              the form of weight to a heavy generated body, moves it downward in
              a natural way. No other extrinsic being can move a natural body
              without violence, except perhaps accidentally, by removing an
              impediment, and this uses a natural motion, or action, rather than
              causes it. So, the only agent that can cause a movement of the
              will, without violence, is that which causes an intrinsic
              principle of this movement, and such a principle is the very power
              of the will. Now, this agent is God, Who alone creates a soul, as
              we showed in Book Two. Therefore, God alone can move the will in
              the fashion of an agent, without violence.

              could cause a movement of the will in us without prejudice to
              freedom of will, have tried to explain these texts in a wrong way.

              no thing can act by its own power unless it acts through His
              power, as we showed above. So, man cannot use the power of will
              that has been given him except in so far as he acts through the
              power of God. Now, the being through whose power the agent acts is
              the cause not only of the power, but also of the act. This is
              apparent in the case of an artist through whose power an
              instrument works, even though it does not get its own form from
              this artist, but is merely applied to action by this man.
              Therefore, God is for us the cause not only of our will, but also
              of our act of willing.

              Aristotle, in Book VIII of the
              <i>Eudemian Ethics</i>, as follows. There must be a cause for the
              fact that a person understands, deliberates, chooses, and wills,
              for every new event must have some cause. But, if its cause is
              another act of deliberation, and another act of will preceding it,
              then, since one cannot go on to infinity in these acts, one must
              reach something that is first. Now, a first of this type must be
              something that is better than reason. But nothing is better than
              intellect and reason except God. Therefore, God is the first
              principle of our acts of counsel and of will.

              love consists especially in this, “that the lover wills the good
              for his loved one.” So, the more that God loves things, the more
              do they fall under His providence. Moreover, Sacred Scripture also
              teaches this in the Psalm (144:20) when it states: “The Lord keeps
              all those who love Him.” And the Philosopher, also, supports this
              view, in <i>Ethics</i> X [8], when he says that God takes greatest
              care of those who love understanding, as He does of His friends.
              It may, then, be gathered from this, that He loves intellectual
              substances best. Therefore, their acts of will and choice fall
              under His providence.

              death and evil” (Deut. 30:15). But these words are brought forward
              to show that man is possessed of free choice, not that his choices

              [4] It is clear that our acts of choice have the character of
              multiplicity, since choices are made of different things, by
              different people, in different ways. They are also mutable, both
              because of the instability of the mind, which is not firmly fixed
              on the ultimate end, and also because of the fluctuating character
              of the things which provide our circumstantial environment. That
              they are defectible, of course the sins of men testify. But the
              divine will is uniform, because by willing one object it wills all
              else, and it is immutable and without defect, as we showed in Book
              One. So, the movement of all wills and choices must be traced back
              to the divine will, and not to any other cause, for God alone is
              the cause of our acts of will and choice.

              [5] Likewise, our understanding has the quality of multiplicity,
              since we gather, as it were, intelligible truth from many sense
              objects. It is also mutable, for it advances by discursive
              movement from one thing to another, proceeding from known things
              to unknown ones. It is, moreover, defectible, because of the
              admixture of imagination with sensation, as the errors of mankind
              show. On the other hand, the cognitive acts of the angels are
              uniform: for they receive the knowledge of truth from one fount of
              truth; namely, God. Their cognition is also immutable, because
              they see directly the pure truth about things by a simple
              intuition, not by a discursive movement from effects to their
              causes or the reverse. It is even incapable of defect, since they
              directly intuit the very natures, or quiddities, of things, and
              understanding cannot err in regard to such objects, just as sense
              cannot err in regard to proper sensibles. We, however, make
              guesses as to the quiddities of things from their accidents and
              effects. Therefore, our intellectual knowledge must be regulated
              by means of the angels' knowledge.

              [6] Again, in regard to human bodies and the external things that
              men use, it is obvious that there is in them a multiplicity of
              admixture and contrariety; and that they are not moved uniformly,
              since their motions cannot be continuous; and that they are
              defectible through alteration and corruption. In contrast, the
              celestial bodies are uniform in the way of simple beings with no
              contrariety in their constitution. Their motions are also uniform,
              continuous, and always in the same condition. Nor can there be
              corruption or alteration in them. Hence, it is necessary for our

              [2] In fact, we say that some good fortune has befallen a man
              “when something good happens to him, without his having intended
              it.” For example, a man digging in a field may find a treasure for
              which he was not looking. Now, something may happen to a certain
              agent which is not intended by him as he is doing his job, but
              which is not unintended by the superior under whom he is working.
              Suppose, for instance, a master orders a servant to go to a
              certain place to which the master has already sent another
              servant, unknown to the first one; the encounter with his fellow
              servant is not intended by the servant who has been sent, but it
              is not unintended by the master who sent him. And so, though the
              meeting is fortuitous and a matter of chance to this servant, it
              is not so to the master, but has been a planned event. So, since
              man is ordered in regard to his body under the celestial bodies,
              in regard to his intellect under the angels, and in regard to his
              will under God—it is quite possible for something apart from man’s
              intention to happen, which is, however, in accord with the
              ordering of the celestial bodies, or with the control of the
              angels, or even of God. For, though God alone directly works on
              the choice made by man, the action of an angel does have some
              effect on man’s choice by way of persuasion, and the action of a
              celestial body by way of disposition, in the sense that the
              corporeal impressions of celestial bodies on our bodies give a
              disposition to certain choices. So, when as a result of the
              influence of higher causes in the foregoing way a man is inclined
              toward certain choices that are beneficial to him, but whose
              benefit he does not know by his own reasoning, and when besides
              this his intellect is illuminated by the light of intellectual
              substances so that he may do these things, and when his will is
              inclined by divine working to choose something beneficial to him
              while he is ignorant of its nature, he is said to be favored by
              fortune. And, on the contrary, he is said to be subject to
              misfortune when his choice is inclined to contrary results by
              higher causes, as is said of a certain man: “Write this man
              barren, a man that shall not prosper in his days” (Jer. 22:30).

              [3] But, on this point, a difference is to be noted. The
              impressions of celestial bodies on our bodies cause natural
              dispositions of our bodies within us. Thus, as a result of a
              disposition left by a celestial body in our body, a man is called
              not merely fortunate or unfortunate, but also well or ill favored
              by nature, and it is in this way that the Philosopher says, in his
              <i>Magna Moralia</i>, that a man favored by fortune is also
              favored by nature. Indeed, this fact, that one man chooses things
              beneficial to him, whereas another man chooses things harmful to
              him, apart from their proper reasoning, cannot be understood as
              resulting from differences of intellectual nature, because the
              nature of intellect and will is one in all men. In fact, a formal
              diversity would lead to a difference according to species, whereas
              a material diversity leads to a numerical difference. Hence, in so
              far as man’s intellect is enlightened for the performance of some
              action, or as his will is prompted by God, the man is not said to
              be favored by birth, but, rather, well guarded or well governed.

            <td>
              [4] Again, another difference on this matter is to be observed. As
              a matter of fact, the operation of an angel and of a celestial
              body is merely like something disposing toward choice; while God’s
              operation is like something perfecting. Now, since a disposition
              which results from a quality of the body, or from an intellectual
              persuasion, does not bring necessity to the act of choice, a man
              does not always choose what his guardian angel intends, or that
              toward which a celestial body gives inclination. But a man does
              choose in all cases the object in accord with God’s operation
              within his will. Consequently, the guardianship of the angels is
              sometimes frustrated, according to this text: “We would have cured
              Babylon, but she is not healed” (Jer. 51:9); and still more is
              this true of the inclination of the celestial bodies, but divine
              providence is always steadfast.

              Est etiam et alia differentia consideranda. Nam cum corpus
              caeleste non disponat ad electionem nisi inquantum imprimit in

              per odium vel amorem, vel iram, vel aliquid huiusmodi. Ab Angelo
              vero disponitur aliquis ad eligendum per modum intelligibilis
              considerationis, absque passione. Quod quidem contingit
              dupliciter. Quandoque enim illuminatur intellectus hominis ab
              Angelo ad cognoscendum solum quod aliquid est bonum fieri, non
              autem instruitur de ratione propter quam est bonum, quae sumitur
              ex fine. Et ideo quandoque homo aestimat quod aliquid sit bonum
              fieri, si tamen quaereretur quare, responderet se nescire. Unde,
              quando perveniet in finem utilem quem non praeconsideravit, erit
              sibi fortuitum. Quandoque vero per illuminationem Angeli
              instruitur et quod hoc sit bonum, et de ratione quare est bonum,
              quae pendet ex fine. Et sic, quando perveniet ad finem quem
              praeconsideravit, non erit fortuitum. Sciendum est etiam quod vis
              activa spiritualis naturae, sicut est altior quam corporalis, ita
              etiam est universalior. Unde non ad omnia ad quae se extendit
              humana electio, se extendit dispositio caelestis corporis.

              [5] Moreover, there is still another difference to be considered.
              Since a celestial body does not dispose to a choice, unless it
              makes an impression on our body by which man is stimulated to
              choose in the way that passions induce one to choose, every
              disposition to choice which results from the celestial bodies
              works by means of some passion, as when a person is led to choose
              something by means of hatred, or love, or anger, or some similar
              passion. But a person is disposed to an act of choice by an angel,
              by means of an intellectual consideration, without passion. In
              fact, this happens in two ways. Sometimes, a man’s understanding
              is enlightened by an angel to know only that something is a good
              thing to be done, but it is not instructed as to the reason why it
              is a good, since this reason is derived from the end. Thus, at
              times, a man thinks that something is a good thing to be done,
              “but, if he be asked why, he would answer that he does not know.
              Hence, when he reaches a beneficial end, to which he has given no
              thought before, it will be fortuitous for him. But sometimes he is
              instructed by angelic illumination, both that this act is good and
              as to the reason why it is good, which depends on the end. And if
              this be so, when he reaches the end which he has thought about
              before, it will not be fortuitous. We should also note that, just
              as the active power of a spiritual nature is higher than a
              corporeal one, so also is it more universal. Consequently, the
              disposition resulting from a celestial body does not extend to all
              the objects which human choice covers.

              [6] Still another point: the power of the human soul, or also of
              an angel, is particularized in comparison with divine power which,
              in fact, is universal in regard to all beings. Thus, then, some
              good thing may happen to a man which is apart from his own
              intention, and apart from the inclination given by celestial
              bodies, and apart from the enlightenment coming from the
              angels—but not apart from divine providence, which is regulative,
              just as it is productive, of being as such, and, consequently,
              which must include all things under it. Thus, some good or evil
              may happen to man that is fortuitous in relation to himself, and
              in relation to the celestial bodies, and in relation to the
              angels, but not in relation to God. Indeed, in relation to Him,
              nothing can be a matter of chance and unforeseen, either in the
              sphere of human affairs or in any matter.

              [8] Moreover, man may obtain from higher causes still another help
              in regard to the outcome of his actions. For, since a man has both
              the ability to choose and to carry out what he chooses, he may at
              times be assisted by higher causes in regard to both or he may
              also be hindered. In regard to choice, of course, as we said, man
              is either disposed by the celestial bodies to choose something, or
              he is enlightened by the guardianship of the angels, or even he is
              inclined by divine operation. But in regard to the carrying out of
              the choice man may obtain from a higher cause the strength and
              efficacy needed to accomplish what he has chosen. Now, this can
              come not only from God and the angels, but also from the celestial
              bodies, to the extent that such efficacy is located in his body.
              For it is obvious that inanimate bodies also obtain certain powers
              and abilities from the celestial bodies, even beyond those which
              go along with the active and passive qualities of the elements,
              which, doubtless, are also subject to the celestial bodies. Thus,
              the fact that a magnet attracts iron is due to the power of a
              celestial body, and so have certain stones and herbs other hidden
              powers. So, nothing prevents a man, too, from getting, as a result
              of the influence of a celestial body, a certain special efficiency
              in doing some bodily actions, which another man does not possess:
              for instance, a physician in regard to healing, a farmer in regard
              to planting, and a soldier in regard to fighting.

              of choosing, God is said to direct man, whereas in regard to the
              second kind of help He is said to strengthen man. And these two
              forms of help are touched on together in the Psalms (26:1), where
              it is said in regard to the first: “The Lord is my light and my
              salvation, whom shall I fear?” and in regard to the second: “The

              [10] But there are two differences between these two helps. First,
              man is assisted by the first kind of help, both in regard to
              things subject to the power of man, and also in regard to other
              things. But the second sort of help extends only to things of
              which man’s power is capable. Indeed, the fact that a man digging
              a grave discovers a treasure results from no power of man; so, in
              regard to such an outcome, man may be helped by the fact that be
              is prompted to look in the place where the treasure is, not,
              however, in the sense that he is given any power to find treasure.
              But, in the case of the physician healing, or the soldier winning
              a fight, he may be helped in regard to the end, and also in the
              sense that he may carry out the choice efficaciously, by means of
              a power acquired from a higher cause. Hence, the first kind of
              help is more universal. The second difference is that the second
              help is given to carry out efficaciously what he intends.
              Consequently, since fortuitous events are apart from one’s
              intention, man cannot, properly speaking, be called fortunate as a
              result of such help, as he can be from the first, as we showed

              which the chooser has not thought of before, and in so far as he

              per accidens: quia non habent aliquem ordinem ad invicem. Unde
              virtus caelestis corporis non potest per se inclinare ad hoc

              aliquis per intellectum agens potest esse causa inclinationis in

              etiam quod etiam homo qui sciret thesaurum esse ibi, posset alium
              ignorantem mittere ad fodiendum sepulcrum in loco eodem, ut,
              praeter intentionem suam, inveniret thesaurum. Sic ergo huiusmodi
              fortuiti eventus, reducti in causam divinam, amittunt rationem
              fortuiti: reducti vero in causam caelestem, nequaquam.

              This becomes evident, as follows. In fact, an event does not lose
              its fortuitous character unless it may be referred back to a
              direct cause. But the power of a celestial body is an agent cause,
              not by way of understanding and choice, but as a nature. Now, it
              is proper for a nature to tend to one objective. So, if an effect
              is not simply one result, then its direct cause cannot be a
              natural power. But, when two things are combined with each other
              accidentally, they are not truly one, but only accidentally so.
              Hence, there can be no direct, natural cause for this union. Let
              us suppose, then, that a certain man is prompted to dig a grave by
              the influence of a celestial body, working by way of a passion as
              we said. Now, the grave and the location of the treasure are one
              only accidentally, for they have no relation to each other. Hence,
              the power of the celestial body cannot directly give an
              inclination toward this entire result: that this man should dig
              this grave and that it should be done at the place where the
              treasure is. But an agent working through understanding can be the
              cause of an inclination to this entire result, for it is proper to
              an intelligent being to order many things into one. It is clear,
              indeed, that even a man who knew where the treasure was might send
              another man who did not know to dig a grave in that same place and
              thus to find a treasure unintentionally. So, in this way,
              fortuitous events of this kind, when referred to their divine
              cause, lose their fortuitous character, but when referred to a
              celestial cause, they do not.

              [13] It is also apparent by the same reasoning that a man cannot
              be universally favored by fortune through the power of a celestial
              body, but only in regard to this or that incident. I say
              universally, meaning that a man might have the ability in his
              nature, resulting from the influence of a celestial body, to
              choose always, or in most cases, objects to which certain
              advantages or disadvantages are accidentally connected. For nature
              is ordered to one result only. But these factors, in terms of
              which good or bad fortune befalls a man, are not reducible to any
              one thing; rather, they are indeterminate and indefinite, as the
              Philosopher teaches in
              <i>Physics</i>
              II, and as is clear to our senses. So, it is not possible for a
              man to have the ability in his nature to choose always those
              objects from which advantageous results accidentally follow. But
              it is possible that, by celestial influence, he may be inclined to
              choose one thing to which an advantage is accidentally attached;
              then, from another inclination to another advantage; and from a
              third to a third advantage; but not in such a way that all such
              advantages would follow from one inclination. However, from one
              divine disposition a man can be directed to all results.

              [5] On the other hand, some men have desired to reduce to the
              control of divine providence all things whatsoever that appear to
              happen by chance in these lower beings. Hence, they said that all
              things are done by fate, meaning by fate the ordering which is
              found in things as a result of divine providence. Thus, Boethius
              says [ <i>De consol. phil.</i> IV, 6]: “fate is a disposition
              inherent in mutable things, whereby providence connects each thing
              with His orders.” In this description of fate, “disposition” is
              used for ordering; while the phrase “inherent in things” is used
              to distinguish fate from providence; since the ordering, as
              present in the divine mind and not yet impressed on things, is
              providence, but, as already unfolded in things, it is called fate.
              Moreover, he speaks of “mutable things” to show that the order of
              providence does not take away contingency and mobility from
              things, as some men have claimed.

              Secundum hanc ergo acceptionem, negare fatum est providentiam

              communia, ne ex consortio nominum possit sumi erroris occasio;
              nomine fati non est a fidelibus utendum, ne videamur illis
              assentire qui male de fato senserunt, omnia necessitati siderum
              subiicientes. Unde Augustinus dicit, in V de civitate Dei: si quis
              voluntatem vel potestatem Dei fati nomine appellat, sententiam
              teneat, linguam corrigat. Et Gregorius, secundum eundem
              intellectum, dicit: absit a fidelium mentibus ut fatum aliquid
              esse dicant.
            </td>
            <td>
              [6] So, according to this meaning, to deny fate is to deny
              providence. But, since we should not even have names in common
              with unbelievers, lest occasion for error could be taken from the
              association of names, the name fate is not to be used by the
              faithful lest we appear to agree with those who have held a wrong
              opinion about fate, by subjecting all things to the necessitation
              of the stars. Consequently, Augustine says, in Book V of the
              <i>City of God</i>: “If any man calls the will, or power, of God
              by the name, fate, let him hold his view, but correct his way of
              speaking.” And also Gregory, in accord with the same understanding
              of it, says: “Far be it from the minds of the faithful to say that
              there is any fate.”

              utrum sit occidendus a latronibus, huius effectus praecedit causa
              occursus latronum; hunc autem effectum iterum praecedit alia

              sitis; et haec causatur ex comestione salsorum; quod iam est vel
              fuit. Si ergo, causa posita, necesse est effectum poni, necesse

              exit domum, quod occurrant ei latrones; et si occurrunt, quod
              occidatur. Ergo, de primo ad ultimum, necesse est hunc comedentem

            <td>
              [2] In fact, the Philosopher shows in the
              <i>Metaphysics</i> [V, 3] that, if we assert that every effect has
              a direct cause, and again that, given any direct cause we must
              necessarily grant its effect, it follows that all future events
              come about by necessity. For, if each effect has a direct cause,
              then any future effect will be reducible to a present or past
              cause. Thus, if we ask whether a certain man is to be killed by
              robbers, the cause preceding this effect is his encounter with the
              robbers; and, in turn, another cause precedes this effect, namely,
              the fact that he went out of his home; still another precedes
              this, that he wished to look for water; and a cause precedes this,
              namely, his thirst; and this was caused by the eating of salted
              foods; and this eating is going on now, or was done in the past.
              Therefore, if it be so, that, granted the cause, the effect must
              be granted, then necessarily, if he cats salt foods, he must get
              thirsty; and if he is thirsty, he must desire to get water; and if
              he desires to get water, he must go out of his home; and if he
              leaves his home, the robbers must encounter him; and if they
              encounter him, he must be killed. So, from the first to the last,
              it is necessary for this eater of salty foods to be killed by
              robbers. Therefore, the Philosopher concludes that it is not true
              that, granted the cause, the effect must be granted; since there
              are some causes which can fail. Again, it is not true that every
              effect has a direct cause, for something that comes about
              accidentally, for instance, that this man who wishes to look for
              water encounters the robbers, has no cause.

              eius ponatur. Et sic providentia non est certa. Aut est
              necessarium quod omnia ex necessitate contingant. Providentia enim
              non solum est in praesenti tempore vel praeterito, sed aeterno:

              [3] Now, by this reasoning it appears that all effects that may be
              reduced to some direct cause, present or past, which when granted
              requires that the effect be granted must of necessity happen.
              Either, then, we must say that not all effects are subject to
              divine providence and, thus, that providence does not apply to
              all—but we showed earlier that it does; or else it is not
              necessarily so, that, granted providence, its effect must be
              granted, and thus providence is not certain; or, finally, it is
              necessary for all things to happen by necessity. For providence is
              not only in present or past time, but in eternity, since nothing
              can be in God that is not eternal.

              happen. Now, the antecedent of this conditional proposition is
              necessary, for He is eternal. Therefore, the consequent is
              necessary, for every consequent in a conditional proposition must
              be necessary when the antecedent is necessary. So, the consequent
              is like the conclusion of the antecedent, and whatever follows
              from a necessary proposition must be necessary. Therefore, it
              follows that, if divine providence is certain, all things must
              occur by necessity.

              possible that be will not rule, then it is impossible for him not
              to rule; therefore, it is necessary for him to rule. However, if

              Item. Argumentatur sic Tullius, in libro de divinatione. Si omnia

              the order of causes is certain. But, if this is true, all things
              are done by fate. And if all things are done by fate, nothing is
              within our power, there is no volitional choice. Therefore, it
              follows that free choice is taken away if divine providence be
              certain. And in the same way it will follow that all contingent
              causes are taken away.

              [10] Now, two things must be considered in the case of any
              provident agent—namely, premeditation of the order, and the
              establishment of the premeditated order—in the things that are
              subject to providence. The first of these pertains to the
              cognitive power, while the second belongs to the operative.
              Between the two there is this difference: in the act of
              premeditating the order, the more perfect that providence is, the
              more can the order of providence be extended to the smallest
              details. The fact that we are not able to think out, ahead of
              time, the order of all particular events in regard to matters to
              be arranged by us stems from the deficiency of our knowledge,
              which cannot embrace all singular things. However, the more a
              person is able to think ahead about a plurality of singular
              things, the more adroit does he become in his foresight, while the
              man whose foresight is restricted to universals only participates
              but little in prudence. Now, a similar consideration can be made
              in regard to all the operative arts. But, in regard to imposing
              the premeditated order on things, the providence of a governing
              agent is more noble and perfect the more universal it is and the
              more it accomplished his premeditated plan by means of a plurality
              of ministers, because this controlling of ministers occupies an
              important place in the order that pertains to foresight.

              Oportet autem quod divina providentia in summo perfectionis

              Moreover, divine providence must consist in the highest position,
              since He is absolutely and universally perfect, as we showed in
              Book One. So, in the function of providential foresight, by means
              of the sempiternal meditative act of His wisdom, He orders all
              things, no matter how detailed they may appear; and whatever
              things perform any action, they act instrumentally, as moved by
              Him. And they obediently serve as His ministers in order to unfold
              in things the order of providence, which has been thought out, as
              I might say, from eternity. But, if all things able to act must
              serve as ministers to Him in their actions, it is impossible for
              any agent to block the execution of divine providence by acting in
              opposition to it. Nor is it possible for divine providence to be
              hindered by the defect of any agent or patient, since every active
              and passive power is caused in things in accord with divine
              disposition. It is also impossible for the execution of divine
              providence to be impeded by a change in the provident Agent, since
              God is altogether immutable, as we showed above. The conclusion
              remains, then, that divine foresight is utterly incapable of being
              frustrated.

              [11] Next, we must consider that every agent intends the good and
              the better, in so far as he can, as we showed above. But the good
              and the better are not considered in the same way, in the whole
              and in the parts. For, in the whole, the good is integrity, which
              is the result of the order and composition of its parts.
              Consequently, it is better for there to be an inequality among the
              parts of the whole, without which the order and perfection of the
              whole cannot be, than for all its parts to be equal, even if each
              of them were to exist on the level of the most important part.
              However, if the parts are considered in themselves, each part of a
              lower grade would be better if it were on the level of the higher
              part. This is exemplified in the human body: in fact, the foot
              would be a more worthy part if it possessed the beauty and power
              of the eye, but the whole body would be more imperfect if it
              lacked the functioning of the foot.

              Therefore, the intention of a particular agent tends toward a
              different objective from that of the universal agent. Indeed, the
              particular agent tends to the good of the part without
              qualification, and makes it the best that it can, but the
              universal agent tends to the good of the whole. As a result, a
              defect which is in accord with the intention of the universal
              agent may be apart from the intention of the particular agent.
              Thus, it is clear that the generation of a female is apart from
              the intention of a particular nature, that is, of the power which
              is in this semen which, as much as possible, tends to a perfect
              result of conception; but it is in accord with the intention of
              the universal nature, that is, of the power of the universal agent
              for the generation of inferior beings, that a female be generated;
              for without a female the generation of a number of animals could
              not be accomplished. Similarly, corruption, decrease, and every
              defect pertain to the intention of the universal nature, but not
              of the particular nature, for each thing avoids defect, and tends
              to perfection, to the extent that it can. So, it is evident that
              the intention of the particular agent is that its effect become as
              perfect as is possible in its kind, but the intention of the
              universal nature is that this individual effect become perfect in
              a certain type of perfection, say in male perfection, while
              another would become so in female perfection.

              Now the primary perfection among the parts of the whole universe
              appears on the basis of the contingent and the necessary. For the
              higher beings are necessary and incorruptible and immobile, and
              the more they fall short of this condition, the lower the level on
              which they are established. Thus, the lowest things may be
              corrupted even in regard to their being, whereas they are changed
              in regard to their dispositions, and they produce their effects
              not necessarily but contingently. So, any agent that is a part of
              the universe intends as much as possible to persevere in its
              actual being and natural disposition, and to make its effect
              stable. However, God, Who is the governor of the universe, intends
              some of His effects to be established by way of necessity, and
              others contingently. On this basis, He adapts different causes to
              them; for one group of effects there are necessary causes, but for
              another, contingent causes. So, it falls under the order of divine
              providence not only that this effect is to be, but also that this
              effect is to be contingently, while another is to be necessarily.
              Because of this, some of the things that are subject to providence
              are necessary, whereas others are contingent and not at all
              necessary.

              in the present, or in the past, indeed from eternity, it does not
              follow, as the first argument implies, that this individual effect
              will come about of necessity. For divine providence is the direct
              cause why this effect occurs contingently. And this cannot be
              prevented.

              occur in the way that God foresaw that it would be. Now, He
              foresaw that it would occur contingently. So, it follows that,

              contingent beings, it will be possible for it, considered in
              itself, not to be; for thus is it foreseen, as something that is
              contingent, as able not to be. Yet it is not possible for the
              order of providence to fail in regard to its coming into being
              contingently. Thus the third argument is answered. Consequently,
              it can be maintained that this man may not become a ruler if he be
              considered in himself, but not if he be considered as an object of
              divine foresight.

              [2] For we showed by reasoning that God fulfills the desires of a
              rational creature, to the extent that he desires the good. Now, it
              sometimes happens that what is sought in prayer is not a true, but
              an apparent, good; speaking absolutely, it is an evil. Therefore,
              such a prayer is not capable of being granted by God. Hence, it is
              said in James (4:3): “You ask and you receive not, because you ask
              amiss.”

              [3] Likewise, because God moves us to the act of desiring, we
              showed that it is appropriate for Him to fulfill our desires. Now,
              the thing that is moved is not brought to its end by the mover
              unless the motion be continued. So, if the movement of desire is
              not continued by constant prayer, it is not inappropriate for the
              prayer to fail to receive its expected result. Hence, the Lord
              says in Luke (18:1) “that we ought always to pray and not to
              faint”; also, the Apostle says, in 1 Thessalonians (5:17): “Pray
              without ceasing.”

              But one becomes near to Him through contemplation, devout
              affection, and humble but firm intention. So, the prayer which
              does not approach God in this way is not capable of being heard by
              God. Hence, it is said in the Psalm (101:18): “He has had regard
              to the prayer of the humble”; and in James (1:6): “Let him ask in

              [7] However, it happens at times that a person is refused because
              of friendship a petition which he asks of a friend, since he knows
              that it is harmful to him, or that the opposite is more helpful to
              him. Thus, a physician may deny sometimes the request of a sick
              person, having in mind that it is not beneficial to him in the
              recovery of his health. Consequently, since we showed that God,
              because of the love which He has for the rational creature,
              satisfies his desires when they are presented to Him through
              prayer, it is no cause for astonishment if at times He does not
              grant the petition, even of those whom He especially loves, in
              order to provide something that is more helpful for the salvation
              of the petitioner. For this reason, He did not withdraw the sting
              of the flesh from Paul, though he asked it thrice, for God foresaw
              that it was helpful to him for the preservation of humility, as is
              related in 2 Corinthians (12:7-9). Hence, the Lord says to certain
              people, in Matthew (20:22): “You do not know what you ask”; and it
              is said in Romans (8:26): “For we do not know what we should pray
              for as we ought.” For this reason, Augustine says in his letter to
              Paulinus and Therasia: “The Lord is good, for He often does not
              grant what we desire, so that He may give us what we desire even
              more.”

              [8] It is apparent, then, from the foregoing that the cause of
              some things that are done by God is prayers and holy desires. But
              we showed above that divine providence does not exclude other
              causes; rather, it orders them so that the order which providence
              has determined within itself may be imposed on things. And thus,
              secondary causes are not incompatible with providence; instead,
              they carry out the effect of providence. In this way, then,
              prayers are efficacious before God, yet they do not destroy the
              immutable order of divine providence, because this individual
              request that is granted to a certain petitioner falls under the
              order of divine providence. So, it is the same thing to say that
              we should not pray in order to obtain something from God, because
              the order of His providence is immutable, as to say that we should
              not walk in order to get to a place, or eat in order to be
              nourished; all of which are clearly absurd.

              [9] So, a double error concerning prayer is set aside as a result
              of the foregoing. Some people have said that prayer is not
              fruitful. In fact, this has been stated both by those who denied
              divine providence altogether, like the Epicureans, and by those
              who set human affairs apart from divine providence, as some
              Peripatetics do, and also by those who thought that all things
              subject to providence occur of necessity, as the Stoics did. From
              all these views, it follows that prayer is fruitless and,
              consequently, that all worship of the Deity is offered in vain.
              Indeed, this error is mentioned in Malachi (3:14), where it
              states: “You have said: He labors in vain who serves God. And what
              profit is it that we have kept His ordinances, and that we have

              it is said that Isaiah, at the command of the Lord, said to King
              Hezekiah: “Thus says the Lord: Take order with Your house, for You
              shall die, and shall not live”; and that, after the prayer of
              Hezekiah, “the word of the Lord came to Isaiah, saying: Go and say
              to Hezekiah... I have heard Your prayer... behold I will add to
              Your days fifteen years” (Is. 38:1-5). And again, it is said in
              the name of the Lord: “I will suddenly speak against a nation and
              against a kingdom to root out and to pull down and to destroy it.
              If that nation against which I have spoken shall repent of their
              evil, I will also repent of the evil that I have thought to do to
              them” (Jer. 18:7-8). And in Joel (2:13-14): “Turn to the Lord your
              God, for He is gracious and merciful... Who knows whether God will
              return and forgive?”

              be moved to repentance; for He is not a man that He should

              [14] Now, if a person carefully considers these statements, he
              will find that every error that occurs on these points arises from
              the fact that thought is not given to the difference between
              universal and particular order. For, since all effects are
              mutually ordered, in the sense that they come together in one
              cause, it must be that, the more universal the cause is, the more
              general is the order. Hence, the order stemming from the universal
              cause which is God must embrace all things. So, nothing prevents
              some particular order from being changed, either by prayer, or by
              some other means, for there is something outside that order which
              could change it. For this reason, it is not astonishing for the
              Egyptians who reduce the order of human affairs to the celestial
              bodies, to claim that fate, which depends on the stars, can be
              changed by certain prayers and ceremonies. Indeed, apart from the
              celestial bodies and above them is God, Who is able to impede the
              celestial bodies' effect which was supposed to follow in things
              here below as a result of their influence.

              But, outside the order that embraces all things, it is not
              possible for anything to be indicated by means of which the order
              depending on a universal cause might be changed. That is why the
              Stoics, who considered the reduction of the order of things to God
              to be to a universal cause of all things, claimed that the order
              established by God could not be changed for any reason. But, again
              on this point, they departed from the consideration of a universal
              order, because they claimed that prayers were of no use, as if
              they thought that the wills of men and their desires, from which
              prayers arise, are not included under that universal order. For,
              when they say that, whether prayers are offered or not, in any
              case the same effect in things follows from the universal order of
              things, they clearly isolate from that universal order the wishes
              of those who pray. For, if these prayers be included under that
              order, then certain effects will result by divine ordination by
              means of these prayers, just as they do by means of other causes.
              So, it will be the same thing to exclude the effect of prayer as
              to exclude the effect of all other causes. Because, if the
              immutability of the divine order does not take away their effects
              from other causes, neither does it remove the efficacy of prayers.
              Therefore, prayers retain their power; not that they can change
              the order of eternal control, but rather as they themselves exist
              under such order.

              [15] But nothing prevents some particular order, due to an
              inferior cause, from being changed through the efficacy of
              prayers, under the operation of God Who transcends all causes, and
              thus is not confined under the necessity of any order of cause; on
              the contrary, all the necessity of the order of an inferior cause
              is confined under Him as being brought into being by Him. So, in
              so far as something in the order of inferior causes established by
              God is changed through prayer, God is said to turn or to repent;
              not in the sense that His eternal disposition is changed, but that
              some effect of His is changed. Hence, Gregory says that “God does
              not change His plan, though at times He may change His judgment”;
              not, I say, the judgment which expresses His eternal disposition,
              but the judgment which expresses the order of inferior causes, in
              accord with which Hezekiah was to have died, or a certain people
              were to have been punished for their sins. Now, such a change of
              judgment is called God’s repentance, using a metaphorical way of
              speaking, in the sense that God is disposed like one who repents,
              for whom it is proper to change what he had been doing. In the
              same way, He is also said, metaphorically, to become angry, in the
              sense that, by punishing, He produces the same effect as an angry
              person.

              [2] Indeed, we showed that God, through His providence, orders all
              things to the divine goodness, as to an end; not, of course, in
              such a way that something adds to His goodness by means of things
              that are made, but, rather, that the likeness of His goodness, as
              much as possible, is impressed on things. However, since every
              created substance must fall short of the perfection of divine
              goodness, in order that the likeness of divine goodness might be
              more perfectly communicated to things, it was necessary for there
              to be a diversity of things, so that what could not be perfectly
              represented by one thing might be, in more perfect fashion,
              represented by a variety of things in different ways. For
              instance, when a man sees that his mental conception cannot be
              expressed adequately by one spoken word, he multiplies his words
              in various ways, to express his mental conception through a
              variety of means. And the eminence of divine perfection may be
              observed in this fact, that perfect goodness which is present in
              God in a unified and simple manner cannot be in creatures except
              in a diversified manner and through a plurality of things. Now,
              things are differentiated by their possession of different forms
              from which they receive their species. And thus, the reason for
              the diversity of forms in things is derived from this end.

              Metaphys., definitiones, per quas naturae rerum et formae

              [3] Moreover, the reason for the order of things is derived from
              the diversity of forms. Indeed, since it is in accord with its
              form that a thing has being, and since anything, in so far as it
              has being, approaches the likeness of God Who is His own simple
              being, it must be that form is nothing else than a divine likeness
              that is participated in things. Hence, Aristotle, where he speaks
              about form in
              <i>Physics</i> I [9], quite appropriately says that it is
              “something godlike and desirable.” But a likeness that is viewed
              in relation to one simple thing cannot be diversified unless by
              virtue of the likeness being more or less close or remote. Now,
              the nearer a thing comes to divine likeness, the more perfect it
              is. Consequently, there cannot be a difference among forms unless
              because one thing exists more perfectly than another. That is why
              Aristotle, in <i>Metaphysics</i> VIII [3], likens definitions,
              through which the natures of things and forms are signified, to
              numbers, in which species are varied by the addition or
              subtraction of unity; so, from this, we are made to understand
              that the diversity of forms requires different grades of
              perfection.

              This is quite clear to one who observes the natures of things. He
              will find, in fact, if he makes a careful consideration, that the
              diversity of things is accomplished by means of gradations.
              Indeed, he will find plants above inanimate bodies, and above
              plants irrational animals, and above these intellectual
              substances. And among individuals of these types he will find a
              diversity based on the fact that some are more perfect than
              others, inasmuch as the highest members of a lower genus seem
              quite close to the next higher genus; and the converse is also
              true; thus, immovable animals are like plants. Consequently,
              Dionysius says [
              <i>De div. nom.</i> VII, 3] “Divine wisdom draws together the last
              members of things in a first class, with the first members of
              things in a second class.” Hence, it is apparent that the
              diversity of things requires that not all be equal, but that there
              be an order and gradation among things.

              [4] Now, from the diversity of forms by which the species of
              things are differentiated there also results a difference of
              operations. For, since everything acts in so far as it is actual
              (because things that are potential are found by that very fact to
              be devoid of action), and since every being is actual through
              form, it is necessary for the operation of a thing to follow its
              form. Therefore, if there are different forms, they must have
              different operations.

              so perfect that they are self-subsistent and self-complete,
              requiring no sub-structure of matter. But other forms cannot
              perfectly subsist by themselves, and do require matter as a
              foundation, so that what does subsist is not simply form, nor yet
              merely matter, but a thing composed of both.

              to different forms. Hence, it develops that some forms need simple
              matter, while others need composite matter; and also, depending on
              the various forms, there must be a different composition of parts,
              adapted to the species of the form and to its operation.

              [10] So, it is evident from what we have said that, when various
              accidents, actions, passions, and arrangements are allotted things
              by divine providence, this distribution does not come about
              without a rational plan. Hence, Sacred Scripture ascribes the
              production and governance of things to divine wisdom and prudence.
              Indeed, it is stated in Proverbs (3:19-20): “The Lord by wisdom
              bath founded the earth; He has established the heavens by
              prudence. By His wisdom the depths have broken out, and the clouds
              grow thick with dew.” And in Wisdom (8:1) it is said of the wisdom
              of God that “it reaches from end to end mightily, and orders all
              things sweetly.” Again, it is said in the same book: “You have
              ordered all things in measure, and number, and weight” (Wis.
              11:21). Thus, we I may understand by measure: the amount, or the
              mode, or degree, of perfection pertaining to each thing; but by
              number: the plurality and diversity of species resulting from the
              different degrees of perfection; and by weight: the different
              inclinations to proper ends and operations, and also the agents,
              patients, and accidents which result from the distinction of
              species.

              [11] Now, in the aforesaid order, in which the rational Plan of
              divine providence is observed, we have said that first place is
              occupied by divine goodness as the ultimate end, which is the
              first principle in matters of action. Next comes the numerical
              plurality of things, for the constitution of which there must be
              different degrees in forms and matters, and in agents and
              patients, and in actions and accidents. Therefore, just as the
              first rational principle of divine providence is simply the divine
              goodness, so the first rational principle in creatures is their
              numerical plurality, to the establishment and conservation of
              which all other things seem to be ordered. Thus, on this basis it
              seems to have been reasonably stated by Boethius, at the beginning
              of his
              <i>Arithmetic</i>, that: “All things whatever that have been
              established, at the original coming into being of things, seem to
              have been formed in dependence on the rational character of
              numbers.

              Est autem considerandum quod operativa ratio et speculativa partim

              [12] Moreover, we should consider the fact that operative and
              speculative reason partly agree and partly disagree. They agree,
              indeed, on this point: just as speculative reason starts from some
              principle and proceeds through intermediaries to the intended
              conclusion, so does operative reason start from something that is
              first, and go through certain intermediaries to the operation, or
              to the product of the operation, which is intended. But the
              principle in speculative matters is the form and that which is;
              while in operative matters it is the end, which at times is the
              form, at other times something else. Also, the principle in
              speculative matters must always be necessary, but in operative
              matters it is sometimes necessary and sometimes not. Indeed, it is
              necessary for a man to will felicity as his end, but it is not
              necessary to will to build a house. Likewise, in matters of
              demonstration the posterior propositions always follow of
              necessity from the prior ones, but it is not always so in
              operative reasoning; rather, it is only so when there can be only
              this single way of reaching the end. For instance, it is necessary
              for a man who wishes to build a house to get some lumber, but the
              fact that he tries to get lumber made of fir depends solely on his
              own will, and not at all on the reason for building the house.

              takes its origin from the rational character of divine goodness,

              the reason why there are different creatures, but it does not
              necessarily follow that they are differentiated on the basis of
              this or that measure of perfection, or according to this or that
              number of things. On the other hand, if we grant that, as a result
              of an act of divine will, He wills to establish this particular
              number of things, and this definite measure of perfection for each
              thing, then as a result one finds the reason why each thing has a
              certain form and a certain kind of matter. And the same conclusion
              is obvious in regard to the things that follow.

              the first principle of all things, as we have already said above.
              Such a text is that of the Psalm (134:6): “All things whatsoever
              the Lord hath willed, He hath done”; again in Job (9:12): “Who can
              say to Him: Why dost You so?” Also in Romans (9:19): “Who resists
              His will?” And Augustine says: “Nothing but the will of God is the
              first cause of health and sickness, of rewards and punishments, of
              graces and retributions.”

              [17] And so, when we ask the reason why,” in regard to a natural
              effect, we can give a reason based on a proximate cause; provided,
              of course, that we trace back all things to the divine will as a
              first cause. Thus, if the question is asked: “Why is wood heated
              in the presence of fire?” it is answered: “Because heating is the
              natural action, of fire”; and this is so “because beat is its
              proper accident.” But this is the result of its proper form, and
              so on, until we come to the divine will. Hence, if a person
              answers someone who asks why wood is heated: “Because God willed
              it,” he is answering it appropriately, provided he intends to take
              the question back to a first cause; but not appropriately, if he
              means to exclude all other causes.

              [1] Moreover, from the foregoing, consideration can be made of a
              twofold order: one depends on the first cause of all, and
              consequently takes in all things; while the other is particular,
              since it depends on a created cause and includes the things that
              are subject to it. The second is also of many types, depending on
              the diversity of causes that are found among creatures. Yet, one
              order is included under another, just as one cause stands under
              another. Consequently, all particular orders are contained under
              the universal order, and they come down from that order which is
              present in things by virtue of their dependence on the first
              cause. An illustration of this may be observed in the political
              area. As a matter of fact, all the members of a family, with one
              male head of the household, have a definite order to each other,
              depending on their being subject to him. Then, in turn, both this
              bead of the family and all other fathers who belong to his state
              have a certain order in regard to each other, and to the governor
              of the state; and again, the latter, together with all other
              governors who belong in the kingdom, have an order in relation to
              the king.

              Now, we showed in Book Two’. that these things which are
              subordinated to God do not come forth from Him, as from one who
              acts by natural necessity, or any other kind of necessity, but
              from His simple will, especially as regards the original
              establishment of things. The conclusion remains, then, that apart
              from the things that fall under the order of divine providence God
              can make other things, for His power is not tied down to these
              things.

              [3] But, if we were to consider the foregoing order in relation to
              the rational plan which depends on the principle, then God cannot
              do what is apart from that order. For that order derives, as we
              showed, from the knowledge and will of God, ordering all things to
              His goodness as an end. Of course, it is not possible for God to
              do anything that is not willed by Him, since creatures do not come
              forth from Him by nature but by will, as has been shown. Nor,
              again, is it possible that something be done by Him which is not
              comprehended in His knowledge, since it is impossible for anything
              to be willed unless it be known. Nor, further, is it possible for
              Him to do anything in regard to creatures which is not ordered to
              His goodness as an end, since His goodness is the proper object of
              His will. In the same way, since God is utterly immutable, it is
              impossible for Him to will something which He has previously
              rejected with His will; or for Him to begin to know something new;
              or to order it to His goodness in a new way.

              [2] Indeed, there is an order divinely instituted in things to the
              effect that lower things are moved through higher ones by God, as
              we said above. Now, God can act apart from this order; for
              instance, He may Himself produce an effect in lower things, with
              nothing being done, in this case, by a higher agent. In fact,
              there is a difference on this point between an agent that acts by
              natural necessity and one that acts according to will; an effect
              cannot result from one that acts by natural necessity except
              according to the mode of the active power—so, an agent that has
              very great power cannot directly produce a small effect, but it
              produces an effect in proportion to its power. But, in this
              effect, there is sometimes less power than in the cause, and so,
              by means of many intermediaries, there finally comes to be a small
              effect from the highest cause. However, the situation is not the
              same in the case of an agent working through will. For one who
              acts through will is able at once to produce without an
              intermediary any effect that does not exceed its power. For
              instance, the very perfect artisan can produce any kind of work
              that the less perfect artisan could make. Now, God operates
              through will, and not through natural necessity, as we showed
              above. Therefore, He can produce immediately, without special
              causes, the smaller effects that are produced by lower causes.

              [3] Again, the divine power is related to all active powers as a
              universal power in regard to particular powers, as is evident from
              our earlier statements. Now, universal active power can be limited
              in two ways for the purpose of producing a particular effect. One
              way is by means of a particular intermediate cause: thus, the
              active power of a celestial body is limited to the effect of
              generating human beings, by the particular power which is in the
              semen; so, too, in syllogisms, the force of the universal
              proposition is limited to a particular conclusion, by the
              inclusion of a particular premise. Another way is by means of
              understanding, which apprehends a definite form and produces it in
              the effect. But the divine understanding is capable of knowing not
              only the divine essence which is like a universal active power,
              and also not only of knowing universal and first causes, but all
              particular ones, as is clear from the things said above.
              Therefore, it is able to produce immediately every effect that any
              particular agent can bring about.

              [4] Besides, since accidents result from the substantial

              substance of a thing must be able immediately to cause, in
              relation to this thing, anything whatever that results from the
              thing’s substance. For instance, the generating agent, because it
              gives the form, gives all the properties and resultant motions.
              Now, we showed above that God, at the first establishment of
              things, brought all things immediately into being by creation.
              Therefore, He is able immediately to move anything to any effect
              without intermediate causes.

              [5] Moreover, the order of things flows forth from God into

              the citizens an order that is preconceived within himself. But the
              divine understanding is not determined by necessity to this
              particular order, in the sense that He can understand no other
              order; because even we can apprehend intellectually another order.
              For instance, it can be understood by us that God may form a man
              from the earth without the use of semen. Therefore, God can bring
              about the proper effect of these causes without lower causes.

              body, as its form, but God surpasses all proportion to creation.
              Now, as a result of the soul imagining something and being moved
              by strong emotion in regard to it, there follows at times a change

              [9] Now, if someone says that, since God did implant this order in
              things, the production in things of an effect independently of its
              proper causes, and apart from the order established by Him, could
              not be done without a change in this order, this objection can be
              refuted by the very nature of things. For the order imposed on
              things by God is based on what usually occurs, in most cases, in
              things, but not on what is always so. In fact, many natural causes
              produce their effects in the same way, but not always. Sometimes,
              indeed, though rarely, an event occurs in a different way, either
              due to a defect in the power of an agent, or to the unsuitable
              condition of the matter, or to an agent with greater strength—as
              when nature gives rise to a sixth finger on a man. But the order
              of providence does not fail, or suffer change, because of such an
              event. Indeed, the very fact that the natural order, which is
              based on things that happen in most cases, does fail at times is
              subject to divine providence. So, if by means of a created power
              it can happen that the natural order is changed from what is
              usually so to what occurs rarely—without any change of divine
              providence—then it is more certain that divine power can sometimes
              produce an effect, without prejudice to its providence, apart from
              the order implanted in natural things by God. In fact, He does
              this at times to manifest His power. For it can be manifested in
              no better way, that the whole of nature is subject to the divine
              will, than by the fact that sometimes He does something outside
              the order of nature. Indeed, this makes it evident that the order
              of things has proceeded from Him, not by natural necessity, but by
              free will.

              mover is to what is moved, and as the active is to what is in
              potency. Now, considering a thing that is in potency in the
              natural order to a certain agent, if some impression is made on it
              by that agent, this is not contrary to nature in an absolute

              [3] Again, since God is the primary agent as we showed above, all
              things that come after Him are like instruments for Him. But
              instruments are made for the purpose of subserving the action of
              the principal agent, while being moved by him. Consequently, the
              matter and form of an instrument should be such that they are
              suitable for the action which the principal agent intends. This is
              why it is not contrary to the nature of an instrument for it to be
              moved by a principal agent, but, rather, is most fitting for it.
              Therefore, it is not contrary to nature when created things are
              moved in any way by God; indeed, they were so made that they might
              serve Him.

              [4] Besides, even among corporeal agents it may be observed that
              the motions that go on in lower bodies, as a result of the action
              of higher ones, are not violent or contrary to nature, though they
              may not seem to be in agreement with the natural motion which the
              lower body has in accord with the particular character of its
              form, For instance, we do not say that the tidal ebb and flow of
              the sea is a violent motion, because it results from the influence
              of a celestial body; even though the natural motion of water is
              only in one direction, toward the center. Therefore, it is much
              more impossible to say that whatever is done in any creature by
              God is violent or contrary to nature.

              cause of being in all things. Now, since a judgment concerning
              anything is based on its measure, what is natural for anything
              must be deemed what is in conformity with its measure. So, what is
              implanted by God in a thing will be natural to it. Therefore, even

              not contrary to nature.

              [1] Things that are at times divinely accomplished, apart from the
              generally established order in things, are customarily called
              miracles; for we admire with some astonishment a certain event
              when we observe the effect but do not know its cause. And since
              one and the same cause is at times known to some people and
              unknown to others, the result is that of several who see an effect
              at the same time, some are moved to admiring astonishment, while
              others are not. For instance, the astronomer is not astonished
              when he sees an eclipse of the sun, for he knows its cause, but
              the person who is ignorant of this science must be amazed, for he
              ignores the cause. And so, a certain event is wondrous to one
              person, but not so to another. So, a thing that has a completely
              hidden cause is wondrous in an unqualified way, and this the name,
              miracle, suggests; namely, what is of itself filled with admirable
              wonder, not simply in relation to one person or another. Now,
              absolutely speaking, the cause hidden from every man is God. In
              fact, we proved above that no man in the present state of life can
              grasp His essence intellectually. Therefore, those things must
              properly be called miraculous which are done by divine power apart
              from the order generally followed in things.

              Indeed, the highest rank among miracles is held by those events in
              which something is done by God which nature never could do. For
              example, that two bodies should be coincident; that the sun
              reverse its course, or stand still; that the sea open up and offer
              a way through which people may pass. And even among these an order
              may be observed. For the greater the things that God does are, and
              the more they are removed from the capacity of nature, the greater
              the miracle is. Thus, it is more miraculous for the sun to reverse
              its course than for the sea to be divided.

              in which God does something which nature can do, but not in this
              order. It is a work of nature for an animal to live, to see, and
              to walk; but for it to live after death, to see after becoming
              blind, to walk after paralysis of the limbs, this nature cannot
              do—but God at times does such works miraculously. Even among this
              degree of miracles a gradation is evident, according as what is
              done is more removed from the capacity of nature.

              divine power from a fever which could be cured naturally, and it
              may rain independently of the working of the principles of nature.

              potentia in actum determinatum nisi per agens aliquod
              determinatum: requiritur enim agens diversimode ad reducendum in
              diversum actum; nam, cum aer sit potentia ignis et aqua, alio
              agente fit actu ignis, et actu aqua. Similiter etiam patet quod
              materia corporalis in actum aliquem perfectum non reducitur a sola
              virtute universali agente, sed oportet esse aliquod agens
              proprium, per quod determinetur impressio universalis virtutis ad
              determinatum effectum; in actum autem minus perfectum potest
              reduci materia corporalis sola virtute universali, absque
              particulari agente: animalia enim perfecta non generantur ex sola
              virtute caelesti, sed requiritur determinatum semen; ad
              generationem vero quorundam imperfectorum animalium sola virtus
              caelestis sufficit, sine semine. Effectus igitur qui in his
              inferioribus fiunt, si sint nati fieri a causis superioribus
              universalibus sine operatione causarum particularium inferiorum,
              non est miraculum si sic fiant: sicut non est miraculum quod
              animalia ex putrefactione sine semine nascantur. Si autem non sunt
              nati fieri per solas causas superiores, requiruntur ad eorum
              complementum causae inferiores particulares. Cum autem aliquis
              effectus producitur ab aliqua causa superiori mediantibus propriis
              principiis, non est miraculum. Nullo igitur modo virtute
              superiorum creaturarum aliqua miracula fieri possunt.

              [5] Moreover, the subject in which an action goes on has a
              relation both to the agent that reduces it from potency to act and
              to the act to which it is reduced. Hence, just as a certain
              subject is in potency to some definite act, and not to merely any
              act, so also is it impossible for it to be reduced from potency to
              some definite act except by means of some definite agent. Indeed,
              a different kind of agent is required to reduce to different types
              of act. For instance, since air is potentially either fire or
              water, it is actually made into fire by one agent and into water
              by a different one. Likewise, it is clear that corporeal matter is
              not brought to the condition of perfect actuality by the sole
              power of a universal agent; rather, there must be a particular
              agent by which the influence of the universal power is limited to
              a definite effect. Of course, corporeal matter may be brought to
              less perfect actuality by universal power alone, without a
              particular agent. For example, perfect animals are not generated
              by celestial power alone, but require a definite kind of semen;
              however, for the generation of certain imperfect animals,
              celestial power by itself is enough, without semen. So, if the
              effects that are accomplished in these lower bodies are naturally
              capable of being done by superior universal causes without the
              working of particular lower causes, such accomplishment is not
              miraculous. Thus, it is not miraculous for animals to be
              originated from putrefaction, independently of semen. But, if they
              do not naturally come about through superior causes alone, then
              particular lower causes are needed for their development. Now,
              when some effect is produced by a higher cause through the
              mediation of proper principles, there is no miracle. Therefore, no
              miracles can be worked in any way by the power of the higher
              creatures.

              [6] Furthermore, it seems to pertain to the same rational
              principle for a thing to be produced from a subject; for that to
              which the subject is in potency to be produced; and for an orderly
              action to be produced through definite intermediate stages.
              Indeed, a subject is not advanced to proximate potency unless it
              has become actual in regard to the intermediate stages; thus, food
              is not immediately potential flesh, but only when it has been
              changed into blood. Now, every creature must have a subject, in
              order to make something, nor can it make anything to which the
              subject is not in potency, as we showed. So, it cannot make
              anything unless the subject is brought to actuality through
              definite intermediate stages. Miracles, then, which result from
              the fact that an effect is produced, but not according to the
              order in which it can be accomplished naturally, cannot be worked
              by the power of a creature.

              [7] Again, a certain order may be observed in the types of motion.
              The primary motion is local movement, and so it is the cause of
              the other kinds, since the first in any genus is the cause of the
              subsequent items in that genus. Now, every effect that is produced
              in these lower things must be produced by some generation or
              alteration. So, this must occur by means of something that is
              moved locally if it be accomplished by an incorporeal agent,
              which, strictly speaking, cannot be moved locally. Now, the
              effects that are produced by incorporeal substances through
              corporeal instruments are not miraculous, since bodies only work
              naturally. Therefore, created incorporeal substances cannot work
              any miracles by their own power, and much less can corporeal
              substances whose every action is natural.

              things here below—for instance, rain, or the healing of a sick

              [2] He took an indication of this from our soul. For, when it is
              possessed of a strong imagination, its body may be changed by an
              act of cognition alone. For example, when a man is walking over a
              beam placed at some height, he falls quite easily because, through
              fear, he imagines his fall. But he would not fall if the beam were
              placed on the earth, where there would be no possibility of
              fearing a fall. It is also obvious that, simply as a result of the
              cognitive act of the soul, the body becomes hot, as happens in
              those who are prone to concupiscence, or anger; or it may also
              grow cold, as happens in those subject to fear. Sometimes, too, it
              is moved by a strong cognitive act toward some illness, such as
              fever, or even leprosy. And on this basis, he says that, if the
              soul be pure, not subject to bodily passions, and strong in its
              cognitive functioning, then not only its own body, but even
              external bodies, obey its act of apprehension. So much so, that on
              the occurrence of its act of apprehension a sick person may be
              cured, or some similar result may occur. And he claims that this
              is the explanation of the casting of a spell by fascination;
              namely, that the soul of a person strongly moved by malevolence
              has the power to inflict an injury on someone, particularly a
              child, who is quite susceptible to impressions, because of the
              tender condition of his body. Consequently, Avicenna favored the
              notion that it is much more likely that the cognitive functions of
              separate substances, which he regarded as the souls or movers of
              the spheres, result in certain effects in lower bodies, without
              the action of any corporeal agent.

              prepare matter to receive the impression of a separate agent. Of
              course, this is not true, according to the teaching of Aristotle,
              who proves, in the <i>Metaphysics</i> [VI, 8], that the forms
              which are in matter do not come from separate forms, but from
              forms which are in matter; in this way, in fact, the likeness
              between the maker and the thing made is discovered.

              attached to the apprehension some sort of emotion, such as joy or
              fear, or lust, or some other passion. Now, passions of this kind
              occur along with a definite motion of the heart, from which there
              results later a change of the whole body, either in the way of
              local motion or of alteration. Consequently, it still remains true
              that the act of apprehension in a spiritual substance does not

              spiritualis creatae, ut corpus obediat sibi ad motum localem.
              Movendo autem localiter aliquod corpus, adhibet aliqua naturaliter
              activa ad effectus aliquos producendos: sicut etiam ars fabrilis
              adhibet ignem ad mollificationem ferri. Hoc autem non est
              miraculosum, proprie loquendo. Unde relinquitur quod substantiae
              spirituales creatae non faciant miracula propria virtute.

              [6] So, with the exception of the use of the local motion of some
              body, a created spiritual substance cannot by its, own power
              produce any form in bodily matter, in the sense that matter would
              be directly subject to it in order to become actual in terms of a
              form. Of course, there is this capacity within the power of a
              spiritual substance: a body is obedient to it in regard to local
              motion. But, to move any body locally, it makes use of any
              naturally active power in order to produce its effects, just as
              the art of metal working makes use of fire in order to soften the
              metal. Now, this is not miraculous, properly speaking. So, the
              conclusion stands, that created spiritual substances do not work
              miracles by their own power.

              power. This may be seen from the fact that one order of angels is
              specially assigned, as Gregory says, to the working of miracles.
              He even says that some of the saints “work miracles by their
              power,” and not merely through intercession.

              [8] However, we should bear in mind the fact that, when either
              angels or demons make use of natural things in order to produce
              definite effects, they use them as instruments, just as a
              physician uses certain herbs as instruments of healing. Now, there
              proceeds from an instrument not merely an effect corresponding to
              the power of the instrument, but also an effect beyond its power,
              in so far as it acts through the power of the principal agent. For
              instance, a saw or an axe could not make a bed unless they worked
              as things moved by the art adapted to such a product. Nor could
              natural heat generate flesh without the power of the vegetative
              soul which uses it as a sort of instrument. So, it is appropriate
              that certain higher effects result from these natural things, due
              to the fact that spiritual substances use them as instruments.

              [9] So, then, although such effects cannot be called miracles
              without qualification, since they do result from natural causes,
              they remain wonderful to us, in two senses. In one way, this is
              ‘because such causes are applied by spiritual substances to the
              Production of their effects, in a fashion that is strange to us.
              As a consequence, the works of clever artisans appear wondrous
              because it is not evident to other people how they are produced.
              In a second way, this is due to the fact that natural causes which
              are applied to the production of certain effects receive a
              particular power as a result of their being instruments of
              spiritual substances. This latter way comes rather close to the
              notion of a miracle.

              not performed by spiritual substances but by the power of
              celestial bodies. An indication of this is seen in the fact that
              the precise position of the stars is carefully noted by those who
              perform these works. Moreover, they make use of certain herbs, and
              other corporeal things, as aids in the preparation, as it were, of
              low-grade matter for the reception of the influence of celestial

              corporeal principles, as we proved above, it is impossible for
              effects peculiar to intellectual nature to be caused by the power
              of a celestial body. Now, among these workings of the magicians
              some events appear which are the proper functions of a rational
              nature. For instance, answers are given concerning things removed
              by theft, and concerning other such matters, and this could be
              done only through understanding. So, it is not true that all
              effects of this kind are caused solely by the power of celestial
              bodies.

              who exercise their external senses freely. So, it is not possible

              intellectual knowledge beyond the natural or acquired ability of
              the intellect to come to a person. This is clear even in the case
              of dreams, in which, though there may be some premonition of
              future events, not everyone who experiences dreams is able to
              understand their meaning. But, through these visions or auditory
              messages which appear in the performances of magicians,
              intellectual knowledge of things which surpass the capacity of his
              understanding often comes to a person. Examples are the revealing
              of hidden treasures, the showing of future events, and sometimes
              true answers are given concerning scientific demonstrations. So,
              it must be that either these apparitions and vocal messages are
              not grasped through the imagination only, or, at least, that this
              case of a man being brought to a knowledge of such matters through
              imaginary presentations of this kind is done by the power of a
              higher understanding, and is not done solely by the power of

              <i>On the Soul</i>. But it is impossible for a thing to receive a
              new substantial form without losing the form which it previously
              possessed, “for the generation of one thing is the corruption of
              another thing.” Now, in the process of making a statue no
              substantial form is ejected; rather, what is accomplished is a
              change of shape only, and this is accidental; the form of copper,
              or other material, remains. So, it is not possible for these
              statues to receive a principle of life.

              generated from putrefaction, and they are the lower type of

              [2] As a matter of fact, in their performances they use certain
              significant words in order to produce given effects. But a word,
              as endowed with meaning, has no force except as derived from some
              understanding: either from the understanding of the speaker or
              from the understanding of the one to whom it is spoken. As an
              example of such dependence on the understanding of the speaker,
              suppose an intellect is of such great power that a thing can be
              caused by its act of conception, and that the function of the
              spoken word is to present, in some way, this conception to the
              effects that are produced. As an example of dependence on the
              understanding of the person to whom the speech is directed, take
              the case of a listener who is induced to do something, through the
              reception in his intellect of the meaning of the word. Now, it
              cannot be claimed that these meaningful words spoken by magicians
              get their efficacy from the understanding of the speaker. Indeed,
              since power results from essence, a diversity of power manifests a
              diversity of essential principles. But the intellect of men in
              general is so disposed that its knowledge is caused by things,
              instead of it being able to cause things by its act of conception.
              So, if there be any men who, by their own power, can change things
              by the words which express their intellectual thought, they will
              belong to a different species and will be called men in an
              equivocal sense.

              [8] Now, if someone says that some figures are proper to certain
              celestial bodies, and so lower bodies are marked by certain
              figures for the reception of the influences of the celestial
              bodies, this does not seem a reasonable answer. In fact, a patient
              is not ordered to the reception of the influence of an agent,
              unless it be because it is in potency. So, only those things
              whereby a thing becomes potential, in some way, determine it to
              receive a special impression. But matter is not disposed by
              figures so that it is in potency to any form, because figure,
              according to its rational meaning, abstracts from all sensible
              matter and form, for it is a mathematical object. Therefore, a
              body is not determined by figures or symbols for the reception of
              any influence from a celestial body.

              characters or figures like the effects of celestial bodies.

              [10] Furthermore, as we have shown, natural matter is not in any
              way disposed toward form by figures. So, the bodies on which these
              figures are put have the same readiness to receive the celestial
              influence as any other bodies of the same species. Now, the fact
              that a thing acts on one of a group of things equally disposed,
              because of something specially assigned to that agent which is to
              be found on that object and not on another, is not indicative of
              an agent which acts by natural necessity, but, rather, of one
              which acts through will. It is clear, then, that arts of this sort
              which use figures to produce certain effects do not get their
              efficacy from a natural agent, but from some intellectual
              substance that acts through understanding.

              objects, some person could say that nothing prevents the
              construction of a figure, which specifies an image, as result of
              some power due to celestial influence, not as a figure, but as it
              specifies the artifact which obtains its power from the stars.
              However, concerning the letters with which something is written on
              an image, and the other characters, nothing else can be said than
              that they are signs. Hence, they are directed only to some
              intellect. This is also shown by the offerings, prostrations, and
              other similar practices which they use, for they can be nothing
              but signs of reverence addressed to some intellectual nature.

              [2] A thing does not tend accidentally, but essentially, to the
              objective to which it inclines by its nature, as, for instance, a
              heavy body tends downward. But, if intellectual substances of this
              kind are evil in their nature, they tend to evil naturally.
              Therefore, they do not tend accidentally, but essentially, to
              evil. But this is impossible, for we showed above that all things
              essentially tend to the good, and that nothing tends to evil,
              except accidentally. Therefore, these intellectual substances are
              not evil in their nature.

              [3] Again, whatever is present in things must be either a cause or
              a thing caused; otherwise, it would have no relation to other
              things. So, these substances are either causes only or they are
              also caused. Now, if they are causes, and if evil cannot be the
              cause of anything, except accidentally, as we showed above, but if
              everything that is accidental must be traced back to what is
              essential, then there must be something in them prior to their
              malice, something by which they may be causes. Now, first in each
              thing is its nature and essence. Therefore, substances of this

              caused accidentally cannot be according to nature, since every

              [7] Besides, it is impossible for anything to be which is wholly
              deprived of participation in the good. For, since the desirable
              and the good are the same thing, if something were utterly devoid
              of goodness it would have nothing desirable in it; but to each
              thing its own being is desirable. Therefore, it is necessary that,
              if anything is called evil in its nature, then this is not evil in
              the absolute sense, but evil in relation to a particular thing or
              in some particular way. Thus, poison is not an unqualified evil,
              but only to this individual for whom it is harmful. Hence, “what
              is one man’s poison is another man’s meat.” Now, this happens
              because the particular good that is proper to this individual is
              contrary to the particular good that is proper to another
              individual. Thus, heat, which is good for fire, is the contrary to
              and is destructive of cold, which is good for water. Now,
              something which is by its nature ordered to the good that is not
              particular, but absolute, cannot be called evil naturally, even in
              this sense. But every intellect is such, for its good is found in
              its proper operation, which is concerned with universals and with
              things that exist without qualification. So, it is impossible for
              any intellect to be evil in its own nature, either absolutely or
              relatively so.

              impossible for an intellectual substance to have a will evil in
              its nature unless its intellect naturally errs in regard to the
              judgment of the good. But no intellect can be like that, for false
              judgments in the area of intellectual operations are like monsters
              among natural things; they are not in accord with nature, but
              apart from nature. In fact, the good of the intellect, and its
              natural end, is the knowledge of truth. Therefore, it is
              impossible for any intellect to exist which is naturally deceived

              [13] Also disposed of is the view which Porphyry reports, in his
              <i>Letter to Anebontes</i>, where he says: “Some people are of the
              opinion that there is a kind of spirits whose function is to hear
              the requests of the magicians, spirits who are false by nature,
              having every form, taking on the appearance of gods and demons and
              the souls of the dead. And this is the kind that produces all
              these apparitions, whether good or bad. Moreover, as regards the
              things that are truly good, no help is given by them; or, better,
              they do not even know them. Instead, they advise evil things, and
              blame and frequently binder zealous followers of virtue; and they
              are full of boldness and pride; they take pleasure in frothy
              exhalations and are overcome by false praises.” Indeed, these
              words of Porphyry quite plainly express the evil character of the
              demons whose help the magic arts employ. The only point in which
              his words are objectionable is his statement that this evil is
              naturally present in them.

              [2] Indeed, it was shown in Book Twos that no intellectual
              substance is naturally united to a body except the human soul, or
              also, according to some thinkers, the souls of celestial bodies.
              But, in regard to the latter, it is not appropriate to think that
              they are evil, since the motion of the celestial bodies is most
              orderly, and in a way is the source of the entire order of nature.
              Now, every other cognitive potency besides the intellect uses
              animated bodily organs. So, it is not possible for there to be in
              substances of this kind any cognitive power other than
              understanding. Hence, whatever they know, they understand. Now,
              one does not err in regard to the object which one understands,
              since all error arises from a failure to understand. Therefore,
              there can be no error in such substances' knowledge. Moreover, no
              sin can occur in the will without error, since the will always
              tends toward the good as apprehended. Consequently, unless there
              is an error in the apprehension of the good, there cannot be a sin
              in the will. Therefore, it seems that there can be no sin in the
              will of these substances.

              [3] Again, in our case, as regards the things of which we possess
              universal knowledge, sin occurs in our will because the judgment
              of reason is impeded on a particular point by some passion which
              shackles the reason. But these passions cannot occur in demons,
              because such passions belong to the sensitive part of the soul,
              which cannot operate without a bodily organ. So, if separate
              substances of this kind have right knowledge on the universal
              level, it is impossible for their will to incline to evil because
              of a defect of knowledge on the particular level.

              Amplius. Nulla virtus cognoscitiva circa proprium obiectum

              substantiis intellectualibus corpori non unitis: quia phantasmata
              non possunt esse absque corpore. Non est igitur possibile quod in

              [4] Besides, no cognitive power is deceived in regard to its
              proper object, but only in regard to something foreign to it. For
              instance, sight is not deceived in judging color, but, when a man
              judges by sight concerning the taste or species of a thing,
              deception may occur in that case. But the proper object of
              understanding is the quiddity of a thing. Hence, in the cognitive
              act of an intellect, provided it apprehend pure quiddities,
              deception cannot occur. Rather, all intellectual deception seems
              to happen because it apprehends the forms of things mixed together
              with phantasms, as happens in our case. But such a mode of knowing
              is not found in intellectual substances that are not united with a
              body, since phantasms cannot be without a body. Therefore, it is
              not possible for cognitive error to occur in separate substances;
              neither, then, can sin be in their will.

              Item. In nobis falsitas accidit in operatione intellectus
              componentis et dividentis, ex hoc quod non absolute rei
              quidditatem apprehendit, sed rei apprehensae aliquid componit. In
              operatione autem intellectus qua apprehendit quod quid est, non
              accidit falsum nisi per accidens, secundum quod in hac etiam

              primo apprehendimus animal, et dividentes per oppositas
              differentias, altera relicta, unam generi apponimus, quousque
              perveniamus ad definitionem speciei. In quo quidem processu potest
              falsitas accidere, si accipiatur ut differentia generis quod non
              est generis differentia. Sic autem procedere ad cognoscendum de

              ad aliud. Quod non competit substantiis intellectualibus
              separatis, ut supra ostensum est. Non videtur igitur quod possit
              aliquis error accidere in cognitione huiusmodi substantiarum. Unde
              nec in voluntate earum peccatum accidere potest.
            </td>
            <td>
              [5] Moreover, falsity occurs in our case in the intellectual
              operation of composing and dividing, as a result of the fact that
              it does not apprehend the quiddity of a thing simply, but, rather,
              combines something with the thing that is apprehended. Of course,
              in the operation of the intellect, whereby it apprehends that
              which is, no falsity occurs except accidentally, by virtue of
              mixing, even in this operation, some part of the operation of the
              intellect composing and dividing. Indeed, this happens because our
              intellect does not immediately attain the knowledge of the
              quiddity of a thing, but with a certain order in the process of
              inquiry. For example, we first apprehend animal, then we divide it
              into the opposed differences, and, leaving one aside, we put the
              other with the genus, until we come to the definition of the
              species. Now, falsity may occur in this process if something is
              taken as a difference in the genus which is not a difference in
              the genus. Of course, to proceed in this way to the quidditative
              knowledge of something pertains to an intellect reasoning
              discursively from one thing to another. This is not proper to
              separate intellectual substances, as we showed above. Hence, it
              does not seem that any error can occur in the knowledge of these
              substances. Consequently, neither can sin occur in their will.

              Praeterea. Cum nullius rei appetitus tendat nisi in proprium

              [6] Furthermore, since in no case does the appetite of a thing
              tend to anything other than its proper good, it seems impossible
              for that for which there is uniquely but one sole good to err in
              its appetite. For this reason, though something wrong may happen
              in natural things because of a contingent defect in the working of
              the appetite, such wrong never occurs in natural appetite; thus, a
              stone always tends downward, whether it achieves its goal or is
              stopped. But sin does occur in our act of appetition, because,
              since our nature is composed of the spiritual and the corporeal,
              there are several goods for us. Our good in regard to
              understanding is indeed different from what it is according to
              sensation, or even according to the body. Now, there is a certain
              order of these various things that are man’s goods, based on the
              fact that what is less primary is subordinated to what is more
              primary. Hence, a sin occurs in our will when, failing to observe
              this order, we desire what is only relatively good for us, in
              opposition to what is absolutely good. However, such a complexity
              and diversity of goods is not found in the separate substances; on
              the contrary, every good for them is according to the
              understanding. Therefore, it is not possible for there to be a sin
              in the will for them, as it would seem.

              [7] Again, in us sin occurs in the will, as a result of excess or
              defect, and virtue consists in the mean between these. So, in
              things which do not admit of excess or defect, but only of the
              mean, it is not possible for the will to sin. For instance, no one
              can sin by desiring justice, for justice is itself a certain mean.
              Now, separate intellectual substances cannot desire anything
              except intellectual goods; indeed, it is ridiculous to say that
              those who are incorporeal in their nature desire corporeal goods,
              or that those without sense power desire sensible goods. But among
              intellectual goods one can find no excess, for these goods are in
              themselves means between excess and defect; just as the true is a
              mean between two errors, one of which goes too far, the other not
              far enough. Consequently, both sensible and corporeal goods
              achieve the mean, to the extent that they are in accord with
              reason. So, it does not seem that separate intellectual substances
              can sin by their will.

              Si quis autem sequi vellet Platonicorum positiones, facilis esset
              via ad solvendum praedicta. Dicunt enim Daemones esse animalia
              corpore aerea: et sic, cum habeant sibi corpora unita, potest in
              eis etiam esse pars sensitiva. Unde et passiones, quae nobis sunt
              causa peccati, eis attribuunt, scilicet iram, odium, et alia
              huiusmodi: propter quod dicit Apuleius quod sunt animo passiva.

              [2] Moreover, if anyone wished to follow the views of the
              Platonists, that would be an easy way to answer the arguments
              stated above. For they say that demons are animals with an aerial
              body; and so, since they have bodies united to them, there can
              also be in them a sensitive part. Hence, they also attribute
              passions to them, which are for us a cause of sin; namely, anger,
              hate, and others of like kind. This is why Apuleius says that they
              are passive in their mind.

              [3] Also, apart from this contention that they are united to
              bodies according to the views of Plato, it might perhaps be
              possible to claim another kind of knowledge in them, other than
              that of the intellect. For, according to Plato, the sensitive soul
              is also incorruptible. Hence, it must have an operation in which
              the body does not share. Thus, nothing is to prevent the operation
              of the sensitive soul and, consequently, passions from taking
              place in any intellectual substance, even though it is not united
              with a body. And so, there remains in them the same source of
              sinful action that is found in us.

              Moreover, that the operations of the sensitive soul cannot go on
              without the body is apparent from the fact that, with the
              corruption of any organ of sensation, the operation of one sense
              is corrupted. For instance, if the eye be destroyed, vision fails.
              For this reason, when the organ of touch is corrupted, without
              which an animal cannot exist, the animal must die.

              [5] So, for the clarification of the aforesaid difficulty, we must
              give some consideration to the fact that, as there is an order in
              agent causes, so also is there one in final causes, so that, for
              instance, a secondary end depends on a principal one, just as a
              secondary agent depends on a principal one. Now, something wrong
              happens in the case of agent causes when a secondary agent departs
              from the order of the principal agent. For example, when the leg
              bone fails because of its crookedness in the carrying out of the
              motion which the appetitive power has commanded, limping ensues.
              So, too, in the case of final causes, when a secondary end is not
              included under the order of the principal end, there results a sin
              of the will, whose object is the good and the end.

              [7] But in any other kind of volitional agent, whose proper good
              must be included under the order of another good, it is possible
              for sin of the will to occur, if it be considered in its own
              nature. Indeed, although natural inclination of the will is
              present in every volitional agent to will and to love its own
              perfection so that it cannot will the contrary of this, yet it is
              not so naturally implanted in the agent to so order its perfection
              to another end, that it cannot fail in regard to it, for the
              higher end is not proper to its nature, but to a higher nature. It
              is left, then, to the agent’s choice, to order his own proper
              perfection to a higher end. In fact, this is the difference
              between those agents who have a will, and those things which are
              devoid of will: the possessors of will order themselves and their
              actions to the end, and so they are said to be free in their
              choice; whereas those devoid of will do not order themselves to
              their end, but are ordered by a higher agent, being moved by
              another being to the end, not by themselves.

              [8] Therefore, it was possible for sin to occur in the will of a
              separate substance, because it did not order its proper good and
              perfection to its ultimate end, but stuck to its own good as an
              end. And because the rules of action must be derived from the end,
              the consequence is that this separate substance tried to arrange
              for the regulation of other beings from himself wherein he had
              established his end, and thus his will was not regulated by
              another, higher one. But this function belongs to God alone. In
              terms of this, we should understand that “he desired to be equal
              to God” (Is. 14:14). Not, indeed, that his good would be equal to
              the divine good, for this thought could not have occurred in his
              understanding, and in desiring such a thing he would have desired
              not to exist, since the distinction of species arises from the
              different grades of things, as is clear from previous statements.

              [9] We should also consider that, when an agent’s proper good is
              related to several higher goods, the volitional agent is free to
              depart from the order of one superior and free not to abandon the
              order of another, whether it be higher or lower. Thus, a soldier
              who is subordinate to the king and to the leader of the army can
              order his will to the leader’s good and not to the king’s, or vice
              versa. But, if the leader departs from the order of the king, the
              will of the soldier who abandons the will of the leader and
              directs his will to the king is going to be good, whereas the will
              of the soldier who follows the will of the leader against the will
              of the king is going to be bad, for the order of a lower principle
              depends on the order of a higher one. Now, separate substances are
              not only subordinated to God, but one of them is subordinated to
              another, from the first to the last, as we showed in Book Two. And
              since in each volitional agent under God there can be a sin of the
              will, if he were considered in his own nature, it was possible for
              some of the higher ones, or even the highest of all, to sin in his
              will. And, in fact, this is probably what happened, for he would
              not have been satisfied with his own good as an end unless his
              good were quite perfect. So, it possibly happened in this way:
              some of the lower ones, through their own will, ordered their good
              to his, and departing from the divine order they sinned in like
              fashion; others, however, observing in the movement of their will
              the divine order, rightly departed from the order of the sinful
              one, even though he was a superior in the order of nature. But how
              the will of both kinds perseveres immutably in goodness, or in
              evil, will be shown in Book Four, for this has to do with the
              punishments and rewards of the good and the evil.

              [10] But there is this difference between man and a separate
              substance: in one man there are several appetitive powers, one
              subordinated to the other. Now, this is not the case in separate
              substances, though one of these substances stands under another.
              Now, sin occurs in the will when in any way the lower appetite
              rebels. So, just as sin could occur in the separate substances,
              either by being turned away from the divine order, or by one of
              the lower ones being turned aside from the order of a superior one
              which continues under the divine order, so also, in one man, sin
              may occur in two ways. One way is due to the fact that the human
              will does not order its proper good to God; in fact, this kind of
              sin is common both to man himself and to the separate substance.
              Another way is due to the good of the lower appetite not being
              ruled in accord with the higher appetite; for example, we may
              desire the pleasures of the flesh to which the concupiscible
              appetite inclines, in discord with the order of reason. Now, this
              latter kind of sin cannot occur in separate substances.

              [5] Nor, indeed, is it a necessary conclusion that, if no defect
              can be present in higher bodies, for this reason sin cannot occur
              in separate substances. For bodies and all things devoid of reason
              are only moved to action; they do not act of themselves, for they
              do not have control over their acts. Consequently, they cannot
              depart from the primary rule which actuates and moves them, except
              in the sense that they cannot adequately receive the regulation of
              the primary rule. Of course, this is so due to the indisposition
              of matter. For this reason, the higher bodies, in which this
              indisposition of matter has no place, never can fall short of the
              rightness of the primary rule. But rational substances, or
              intellectual ones, are not merely acted upon; rather, they also
              move themselves to their proper acts. Indeed, the more perfect
              their nature is, the more evident is this characteristic in them,
              for, the more perfect their nature is, the more perfect is their
              power to act. Consequently, perfection of nature does not preclude
              the possibility of sin occurring in them in the aforesaid way:
              namely, because they fasten upon themselves, and pay no attention
              to the order of a higher agent.

              For they do stand out above other creatures, both in natural
              perfection and in the dignity of their end. In the order of
              natural perfection, only the rational creature holds dominion over
              his acts, moving himself freely in order to perform his actions.
              Other creatures, in fact, are moved to their proper workings
              rather than being the active agents of these operations, as is
              clear from what has been said. And in the dignity of their end,
              for only the intellectual creature reaches the very ultimate end
              of the whole of things through his own operation, which is the
              knowing and loving of God; whereas other creatures cannot attain
              the ultimate end except by a participation in its likeness. Now,
              the formal character of every work differs according to the
              diversity of the end and of the things which are subject to the
              operation; thus, the method of working in art differs according to
              the diversity of the end and of the subject matter. For instance,
              a physician works in one way to get rid of illness and in another
              way to maintain health, and he uses different methods for bodies
              differently constituted. Likewise, in the government of a state, a
              different plan of ordering must be followed, depending on the
              varying conditions of the persons subject to this government and
              on the different purposes to which they are directed. For soldiers
              are controlled in one way, so that they may be ready to fight;
              while artisans will be managed in another way, so that they may
              successfully carry out their activities. So, also, there is one
              orderly plan in accord with which rational creatures are subjected
              to divine providence, and another by means of which the rest of
              creatures are ordered.

              [1] First of all, then, the very way in which the intellectual
              creature was made, according as it is master of its acts, demands
              providential care whereby this creature may provide for itself, on
              its own behalf; while the way in which other things were created,
              things which have no dominion over their acts, shows this fact,
              that they are cared for, not for their own sake, but as
              subordinated to others. That which is moved only by another being
              has the formal character of an instrument, but that which acts of
              itself has the essential character of a principal agent. Now, an
              instrument is not valued for its own sake, but as useful to a
              principal agent. Hence it must be that all the careful work that
              is devoted to instruments is actually done for the sake of the
              agent, as for an end, but what is done for the principal agent,
              either by himself or by another, is for his own sake, because he
              is the principal agent. Therefore, intellectual creatures are so
              controlled by God, as objects of care for their own sakes; while
              other creatures are subordinated, as it were, to the rational
              creatures.

              one who is acted upon by another, under necessity, is subject to

              only the intellectual creature is by nature free. Now, under every
              sort of government, provision is made for free men for their own
              sakes, but for slaves in such a way that they may be at the

              is made for intellectual creatures on their own account, but for
              the remaining creatures for the sake of the intellectual ones.

              [3] Besides, whenever things are ordered to any end, and some of
              these things cannot attain the end through their own efforts, they
              must be subordinated to things which do achieve the end and which
              are ordered to the end for their own sakes. Thus, for instance,
              the end of an army is victory, and this the soldiers may achieve
              through their own act of fighting; that is why only soldiers are
              needed for their own sake in an army. All others, who are assigned
              to different tasks—for instance, caring for the horses and
              supplying the weapons—are needed for the sake of the soldiers in
              the army. Now, from what has been seen earlier, it is established
              that God is the ultimate end of the whole of things; that an
              intellectual nature alone attains to Him in Himself, that is, by
              knowing and loving Him, as is evident from what has been said.
              Therefore, the intellectual nature is the only one that is
              required in the universe, for its own sake, while all others are
              for its sake.

              of its parts, but, rather, the parts are for the whole. Now,
              intellectual natures have a closer relationship to a whole than do
              other natures; indeed, each intellectual substance is, in a way,
              all things. For it may comprehend the entirety of being through
              its intellect; on the other hand, every other substance has only a
              particular share in being. Therefore, other substances may
              fittingly be providentially cared for by God for the sake of
              intellectual substances.

              [6] Again, as a thing is acted upon in the course of nature, so is
              it disposed to action by its natural origin. Now, we see that
              things do go on in the course of nature in such a way that
              intellectual substance uses all others for itself: either for the
              perfecting of its understanding, since it contemplates the truth
              in them; or for the exercise of its power and the development of

              which he always desires, for that which is, because of itself,

              something else is not necessarily always desired; rather, the

              Now, the being of things flows forth from the divine will, as is
              shown in our earlier considerations. Therefore, those things which

              [8] Nor is what was shown in earlier arguments opposed to this,

              perfection of the whole, inasmuch as one is made to serve another.
              Thus, in the human body it is apparent that the lungs contribute

              [1] It is evident, as a result, that only the rational creature is
              directed by God to his actions, not only in accord with what is
              suitable to the species, but also in accord with what is suitable
              to the individual. Each thing appears to exist for the sake of its
              operation; indeed, operation is the ultimate perfection of a
              thing. Therefore, each thing is ordered to its action by God
              according to the way in which it is subordinated to divine
              providence. Now, a rational creature exists under divine
              providence as a being governed and provided for in himself, and
              not simply for the sake of his species, as is the case with other
              corruptible creatures. For the individual that is governed only

              direction from God in their acts, not only for the species, but

              [2] Again, whenever beings are directed in their acts, solely on
              the basis of what pertains to the species, the capacity to act or
              not to act is not present in them. For things that are associated
              with the species are common and natural to all individuals
              contained in the species. Now, natural functions are not within
              our power to control. So, if man were able to direct his acts only
              in accord with what is suitable to the species, he would not have
              within him the capacity to act or not to act. Rather, he would
              have to follow the natural inclination common to the whole
              species, as is the case with all irrational creatures. Therefore,
              it is obvious that a rational creature has the ability to direct
              his acts, not only in accord with the species, but also in accord
              with the individual.

              such actions are not alike in all, but differ in various cases.

              is also able to know the rational plan of providence in some way.
              Hence, it is appropriate for him to exercise providence and

              of being subordinated to it. Through this possession of the
              capacity to exercise providence one may also direct and govern his

              providence, not only by being governed passively, but also by
              governing actively, for he governs himself in his personal acts,
              and even others. Now, all lower types of providence are

              [3] Again, as we have said, law is a rational plan of divine
              providence, in its governing capacity, proposed to the rational
              creature. But the governance of God, as providence, conducts
              individual beings to their own ends. Therefore, man is chiefly
              ordered to his end by the divinely given law. Now, the end for the
              human creature is to cling to God, for his felicity consists in
              this, as we have shown above. So, the divine law primarily directs
              man to this end: that he may cling to God.

              [2] Now, it is quite clear that man chiefly clings to God through
              love. For there are two things in man by which he is enabled to
              cling to God, namely, intellect and will. For by means of the
              lower parts of his soul he cannot cling to God, but only to
              inferior things. Now, the union which is effected through the
              intellect is completed by the union which pertains to the will,
              because through his will man in some way rests in that which the
              intellect apprehends. But the will adheres to a thing, either
              because of love or because of fear, but not in the same way. For,
              if one clings to something because of fear, he clings because of
              something else, for instance, to avoid an evil which threatens
              unless he clings to that thing. But, if one clings to a thing
              because of love, he does so for the sake of that thing. Now, what
              is valued for its own sake is of greater importance than what is
              for the sake of something else. Therefore, the adherence to God in
              love is the best possible way of clinging to Him. So, this is what
              is chiefly intended in the divine law.

              [3] Again, the end of every law, and above all of divine law, is
              to make men good. But a man is deemed good from his possession of
              a good will, through which he may put into act whatever good there
              is in him. Now, the will is good because it wills a good object,
              and especially the greatest good, which is the end. So, the more
              the will desires such a good, the more does a man advance in
              goodness. But a man has more desire for what he wills because of
              love than for what he wills because of fear only, for what he
              loves only from a motive of fear is called an object of mixed
              involuntariness. Such is the case of the man who wills to throw
              his merchandise into the sea because of fear. Therefore, the love
              of the highest good, namely, God, above all else makes men good,
              and is chiefly intended in the divine law.

              virtues. But it is a condition of virtue that the virtuous man

              [6] Furthermore, divine law is offered to man as an aid to natural

              the aid of any man in need, even if he does not know him. For

              naturally the familiar and friend of every man. Therefore, mutual

              [4] Besides, whoever is in error regarding something that is of
              the essence of a thing does not know that thing. Thus, if someone
              understood irrational animal with the notion that it is a man, he
              would not know man. Now, it would be a different matter if he
              erred concerning one of man’s accidents. However, in the case of
              composite beings, the person who is in error concerning one of
              their essential principles does know the thing, in a relative way,
              though he does not know it in an unqualified sense. For instance,
              he who thinks that man is an irrational animal knows him according
              to his genus. But this cannot happen in reference to simple
              beings; instead, any error at all completely excludes knowledge of
              the being. Now, God is most simple. So, whoever is in error
              concerning God does not know God, just as the man who thinks that
              God is a body does not know God at all, but grasps something else
              in place of God. However, the way in which a thing is known
              determines the way in which it is loved and desired. Therefore, he
              who is in error about God can neither love God nor desire Him as
              an end. So, since the divine law intends this result, that man
              love and desire God, man must be bound by divine law to bold a
              right faith concerning God.

              [6] Now, the cult of God is said to consist in these bodily
              manifestations to God. For we are said to cultivate those things
              to which we devote effort through our works. Indeed, we show our
              zeal in regard to God by our activity, not, of course, to benefit
              Him (as we are said to do, when we cultivate other things by our
              actions), but because we approach more closely to God by such
              acts. And since we directly tend toward God through interior acts,
              we therefore properly give cult to God by interior acts. Yet
              exterior acts also pertain to the cult of God, according as our
              mind is lifted up to God by such acts, as we have said.

              [7] Also, this cult of God is called religion, because in some way
              man binds' himself by such acts, so that he will not wander away
              from God, and also because man feels that he is obligated by some
              sort of natural prompting to pay, in his own way, reverence to
              God, from Whom comes the beginning of man's being and of all good.

              [1] There have been some who have thought that the cult of latria
              should be offered not only to the first principle of things, but
              even to all creatures which exist above man. Hence, some, though

              of things, have nevertheless thought that latria should be
              offered, first of all, after the highest God, to celestial
              intellectual substances whom they called gods, whether they were
              substances completely separated from bodies or whether they were

              aerial bodies; and these they called daemons. Yet, because they
              believed them to be above men, as an aerial body is above a
              terrestrial body, they claimed that even these substances are to
              be honored with divine cult by men. And in relation to men they
              said that those substances are gods, being intermediaries between
              men and the gods. Moreover, because the souls of good men, through
              their separation from the body, have passed over into a state
              higher than that of the present life, they held the opinion in
              their belief that divine cult should be offered to the souls of
              the dead, whom they called heroes, or manes.

              For we render cult to God, as we have said, not because He needs
              it, but so that a true opinion concerning God may be strengthened
              in us, even by means of sensible things. But an opinion on the
              point that God is one, exalted above all things, cannot be
              established in us through sensible things unless we honor Him with
              something unique, which we call divine cult. So, it is evident

              a lord is properly and truly one who gives precepts of action to
              others and who takes his own rule of action from no one else. On
              the other hand, one who carries out what has been ordered by a
              superior is more a minister than a lord. But God, Who is the
              highest principle of reality, disposes all things to their proper
              actions through His providence, as we showed above. Hence, in
              Sacred Scripture both angels and celestial bodies are said to
              minister to God, Whose order they carry out; and also to us, for
              it is to our advantage that their actions accrue (Ps. 13.2:21;
              Heb. 1:14). Therefore, the cult of <i>latria</i> which is owed to
              the highest Lord is not to be offered except to the highest
              principle of things.

              [10] Again, among other items which pertain to
              <i>latria</i>, sacrifice may be seen to have a special place, for
              genuflections, prostrations, and other manifestations of this kind
              of honor may also be shown to men, though with a different
              intention than in regard to God. But it is agreed by any man that
              sacrifice should be offered to no person unless he is thought to
              be God or unless one pretends to think so. Now, external sacrifice
              is representative of true, interior sacrifice, by which the human
              mind offers itself to God. Indeed, our mind offers itself to God
              as the principle of its creation, the author of its actions, the
              end of its happiness. These attributes are, in fact, appropriate
              to the highest principle of things only. For we have showed above
              that the creative cause of the rational soul is the highest God
              alone; moreover, He alone is able to incline the will of man to
              whatever He wishes, as was shown above; so also it is evident from
              our preceding considerations” that man’s ultimate felicity
              consists solely in the enjoyment of Him. Therefore, man ought to
              offer sacrifice and the cult of <i>latria</i> only to the highest
              God, and not to any other kind of spiritual substances.

              [11] Now, though the theory which claims that God is nothing but
              the world soul is a departure from the truth, as we showed above,
              while the other position is true which maintains that God is a
              separate being and that all other intellectual substances depend
              on Him for their existence, whether separated from, or joined to,
              a body—still, the first theory provides a more rational basis for
              offering the cult of
              <i>latria</i> to different things. For, in offering the cult of
              <i>latria</i> to a variety of things one appears to be offering it
              to the one highest God, since, according to their theory, the
              different parts of the world are related to Him as the different
              members of the human body are to the human soul. But reason is
              also opposed to this view. For they say that the cult of
              <i>latria</i> should not be offered to the world by reason of its
              body, but because of its soul, which they assert to be God. Thus,
              though the bodily part of the world is divisible into different
              parts, the world soul is, however, indivisible. So, the cult of
              divinity ought not be offered to a variety of things, but to one
              only.

              [12] Besides, if the world be supposed to have a soul which
              animates the whole and all its parts, this cannot be understood as
              a nutritive or sensitive soul, because the operations of these
              parts of the soul are not suitable to all parts of the universe.
              And even granting that the world might have a sensitive or
              nutritive soul, the cult of
              <i>latria</i>
              would not be due it because of such souls, for this cult is not
              due to brute animals or to plants. The conclusion remains, then,
              that their assertion that God, to Whom
              <i>latria</i> is owed, is the world soul must be understood of the
              intellectual soul. In fact, this soul is not the perfection of
              individually distinct parts of the body, but in some way has
              reference to the whole. This is even evident in the case of our
              soul which is less noble, for the intellect has no corporeal
              organ, as is proved in Book III of
              <i>On the Soul</i>
              [4]. Therefore, even on the basis of their theory, the cult of
              divinity should not be offered to the various parts of the world,
              but to the entire world because of its soul.

              not termed God except on account of the soul, then there will be
              but one God. And thus the cult of divinity will be owed to one
              being only. On the other hand, if there be but one soul for the

              the Lord Your God, and shall serve Him only.” And in Romans
              (1:72-73) it is said of the Gentiles: “For, professing themselves
              to be wise, they became fools, and they changed the glory of the
              incorruptible God into the likeness of the image of a corruptible
              man and of birds, and of four-footed beasts and of creeping
              things”; and later (verse 25): “Who changed the truth of God into
              a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the
              Creator, Who is God above all blessed for ever.”

              [25] Therefore, since this is the chief intent of divine law: that
              man be subject to God and that he should offer special reverence
              to Him, not merely in his heart, but also orally and by bodily
              works, so first of all, in Exodus 20, where the divine law is
              promulgated, the cult of many gods is forbidden when it is said:
              “You shall not have strange gods before me” and “You shall not
              make to Yourself a graven thing, nor any likeness” (20:3-4).
              Secondly, it is forbidden man to pronounce vocally the divine name
              without reverence, that is, in order to lend support to anything
              false; and this is what is said: “You shall not take the name of
              God in vain” (20:7). Thirdly, rest is prescribed at certain times
              from outward works, so that the mind may be devoted to divine
              contemplation; and thus it is stated: “Remember that You keep holy
              the Sabbath day” (20:8).

              [4] Hence, we must look for a solution in our earlier
              considerations. We have said that God exercises care over every
              person on the basis of what is good for him. Now, it is good for
              each person to attain his end, whereas it is bad for him to swerve
              away from his proper end. Now, this should be considered
              applicable to the parts, just as it is to the whole being; for
              instance, each and every part of man, and every one of his acts,
              should attain the proper end. Now, though the male semen is
              superfluous in regard to the preservation of the individual, it is
              nevertheless necessary in regard to the propagation of the
              species. Other superfluous things, such as excrement, urine,
              sweat, and such things, are not at all necessary; hence, their
              emission contributes to man’s good. Now, this is not what is
              sought in the case of semen, but, rather, to emit it for the
              purpose of generation, to which purpose the sexual act is
              directed. But man’s generative process would be frustrated unless
              it were followed by proper nutrition, because the offspring would
              not survive if proper nutrition were withheld. Therefore, the
              emission of semen ought to be so ordered that it will result in
              both the production of the proper offspring and in the upbringing
              of this offspring.

              man. And if this be done deliberately, it must be a sin. Now, I am
              speaking of a way from which, in itself, generation could not
              result: such would be any emission of semen apart from the natural
              union of male and female. For which reason, sins of this type are
              called contrary to nature. But, if by accident generation cannot
              result from the emission of semen, then this is not a reason for
              it being against nature, or a sin; as for instance, if the woman
              happens to be sterile.

              [6] Likewise, it must also be contrary to the good for man if the
              semen be emitted under conditions such that generation could
              result but the proper upbringing would be prevented. We should
              take into consideration the fact that, among some animals where
              the female is able to take care of the upbringing of offspring,
              male and female do not remain together for any time after the act
              of generation. This is obviously the case with dogs. But in the
              case of animals of which the female is not able to provide for the
              upbringing of offspring, the male and female do stay together
              after the act of generation as long as is necessary for the
              upbringing and instruction of the offspring. Examples are found
              among certain species of birds whose young are not able to seek
              out food for themselves immediately after hatching. In fact, since
              a bird does not nourish its young with milk, made available by
              nature as it were, as occurs in the case of quadrupeds, but the
              bird must look elsewhere for food for its young, and since besides
              this it must protect them by sitting on them, the female is not
              able to do this by herself. So, as a result of divine providence,
              there is naturally implanted in the male of these animals a
              tendency to remain with the female in order to bring up the young.
              Now, it is abundantly evident that the female in the human species
              is not at all able to take care of the upbringing of offspring by
              herself, since the needs of human life demand many things which
              cannot be provided by one person alone. Therefore, it is
              appropriate to human nature that a man remain together with a
              woman after the generative act, and not leave her immediately to
              have such relations with another woman, as is the practice with
              fornicators.

              [8] Again, we must consider that in the human species offspring
              require not only nourishment for the body, as in the case of other
              animals, but also education for the soul. For other animals
              naturally possess their own kinds of prudence whereby they are
              enabled to take care of themselves. But a man lives by reason,
              which he must develop by lengthy temporal experience so that he
              may achieve prudence. Hence, children must be instructed by
              parents who are already experienced people. Nor are they able to
              receive such instruction as soon as they are born, but after a
              long time, and especially after they have reached the age of
              discretion. Moreover, a long time is needed for this instruction.
              Then, too, because of the impulsion of the passions, through which
              prudent judgment is vitiated, they require not merely instruction
              but correction. Now, a woman alone is not adequate to this task;
              rather, this demands the work of a husband, in whom reason is more
              developed for giving instruction and strength is more available
              for giving punishment. Therefore, in the human species, it is not
              enough, as in the case of birds, to devote a small amount of time
              to bringing up offspring, for a long period of life is required.
              Hence, since among all animals it is necessary for male and female
              to remain together as long as the work of the father is needed by
              the offspring, it is natural to the human being for the man to
              establish a lasting association with a designated woman, over no
              short period of time. Now, we call this society matrimony.
              Therefore, matrimony is natural for man, and promiscuous
              performance of the sexual act, outside matrimony, is contrary to
              man’s good. For this reason, it must be a sin.

              [9] Nor, in fact, should it be deemed a slight sin for a man to
              arrange for the emission of semen apart from the proper purpose of
              generating and bringing up children, on the argument that it is
              either a slight sin, or none at all, for a person to use a part of
              the body for a different use than that to which it is directed by

              use his feet for something usually done with the hands) because

              the inordinate emission of semen is incompatible with the natural
              good; namely, the preservation of the species. Hence, after the
              sin of homicide whereby a human nature already in existence is
              destroyed, this type of sin appears to take next place, for by it
              the generation of human nature is precluded.

              [4] Again, it seems obviously inappropriate for a woman to be able
              to put away her husband, because a wife is naturally subject to
              her husband as governor, and it is not within the power of a
              person subject to another to depart from his rule. So, it would be
              against the natural order if a wife were able to abandon her
              husband. Therefore, if a husband were permitted to abandon his
              wife, the society of husband and wife would not be an association
              of equals, but, instead, a sort of slavery on the part of the
              wife.

              [5] Besides, there is in men a certain natural solicitude to know
              their offspring. This is necessary for this reason: the child
              requires the father’s direction for a long time. So, whenever
              there are obstacles to the ascertaining of offspring they are
              opposed to the natural instinct of the human species. But, if a
              husband could put away his wife, or a wife her husband, and have
              sexual relations with another person, certitude as to offspring
              would be precluded, for the wife would be united first with one
              man and later with another. So, it is contrary to the natural
              instinct of the human species for a wife to be separated from her
              husband. And thus, the union of male and female in the human
              species must be not only lasting, but also unbroken.

              [7] It should be considered, further, that generation is the only
              natural act that is ordered to the common good, for eating and the
              emission of waste matters pertain to the individual good, but
              generation to the preservation off the species. As a result, since
              law is established for the common good, those matters which
              pertain to generation must, above all others, be ordered by laws,
              both divine and human. Now, laws that are established should stem
              from the prompting of nature, if they are human; just as in the
              demonstrative sciences, also, every human discovery takes its
              origin from naturally known principles. But, if they are divine
              laws, they not only develop the prompting of nature but also
              supplement the deficiency of natural instinct, as things that are
              divinely revealed surpass the capacity of human reason. So, since
              there is a natural prompting within the human species, to the end
              that the union of man and wife be undivided, and that it be
              between one man and one woman, it was necessary for this to be
              ordered by human law. But divine law supplies a supernatural
              reason, drawn from the symbolism of the inseparable union between
              Christ and the Church, which is a union of one spouse with another
              (Eph. 5:24-32). And thus, disorders connected with the act of
              generation are not only opposed to natural instinct, but are also
              transgressions of divine and human laws. Hence, a greater sin
              results from a disorder in this area than in regard to the use of
              food or other things of that kind.

              [8] Moreover, since it is necessary for all other things to be
              ordered to what is best in man, the union of man and wife is not
              only ordered in this way because it is important to the generating
              of offspring, as it is in the case of other animals, but also
              because it is in agreement with good behavior, which right reason
              directs either in reference to the individual man in himself, or
              in regard to man as a member of a family, or of civil society. In
              fact, the undivided union of husband and wife is pertinent to good
              behavior. For thus, when they know that they are indivisibly
              united, the love of one spouse for the other will be more
              faithful. Also, both will be more solicitous in their care for
              domestic possessions when they keep in mind that they will remain
              continually in possession of these same things. As a result of
              this, the sources of disagreements which would have to come up
              between a man and his wife’s relatives, if he could put away his
              wife, are removed, and a more solid affection is established among
              the relatives. Removed, also, are the occasions for adultery which
              are presented when a man is permitted to send away his wife, or
              the converse. In fact, by this practice an easier way of arranging
              marriage with those outside the family circle is provided.

              [1] It seems, too, that we should consider bow it is inborn in the
              minds of all animals accustomed to sexual reproduction to allow no
              promiscuity; hence, fights occur among animals over the matter of
              sexual reproduction. And, in fact, among all animals there is one
              common reason, for every animal desires to enjoy freely the
              pleasure of the sexual act, as he also does the pleasure of food;
              but this liberty is restricted by the fact that several males may
              have access to one female, or the converse. The same situation
              obtains in the freedom of enjoying food, for one animal is
              obstructed if the food which he desires to eat is taken over by
              another animal. And so, animals fight over food and sexual
              relations in the same way. But among men there is a special
              reason, for, as we said, man naturally desires to know his
              offspring, and this knowledge would be completely destroyed if
              there were several males for one female. Therefore, that one
              female is for one male is a consequence of natural instinct.

              [2] But a difference should be noted on this point. As far as the
              view that one woman should not have sexual relations with several
              men is concerned, both the aforementioned reasons apply. But, in
              regard to the conclusion that one man should not have relations
              with several females, the second argument does not work, since
              certainty as to offspring is not precluded if one male has
              relations with several women. But the first reason works against
              this practice, for, just as the freedom of associating with a
              woman at will is taken away from the husband, when the woman has
              another husband, so, too, the same freedom is taken away from a
              woman when her husband has several wives. Therefore, since
              certainty as to offspring is the principal good which is sought in
              matrimony, no law or human custom has permitted one woman to be a
              wife for several husbands. This was even deemed unfitting among
              the ancient Romans, of whom Maximus Valerius reports that they
              believed that the conjugal bond should not be broken even on
              account of sterility.

              [3] Again, in every species of animal in which the father has some
              concern for offspring, one male has only one female; this is the
              case with all birds that feed their young together, for one male
              would not be able to offer enough assistance to bring up the
              offspring of several females. But in the case of animals among
              whom there is no concern on the part of the males for their
              offspring, the male has promiscuous relations with several females
              and the female with plural males. This is so among dogs, chickens,
              and the like. But since, of all animals, the male in the human
              species has the greatest concern for offspring, it is obviously

              the other hand, for a man to have several wives, for the

              servile. And this argument is corroborated by experience, for
              among husbands having plural wives the wives have a status like
              that of servants.

              what is generally required by law, in view of what is necessary in
              any particular case. For, if the law be a human one, it can be
              dispensed by men who have such power. But, if the law be divinely

              Old Law, permission seems to have been granted by dispensation to
              have several wives and concubines and to put away one’s wife.

              [4] Moreover, a sinful defect may be transferred from the soul to
              the body, but not conversely, for we call something sinful
              according as there is a deordination of the will. Now, food
              pertains immediately to the body, not to the soul. So, the taking
              of food cannot be a sin in itself unless, of course, it be
              incompatible with rectitude. It could be so, in one way, by virtue
              of incompatibility with the proper end of food: thus, for the sake
              of the pleasure associated with eating food a man might eat food
              which works against the health of his body, either because of the
              kind of food or the quantity. This could be so in another way,
              because it is opposed to the situation of the person who uses the
              food or of those with whom he lives; for instance, a man might eat
              finer foods than his circumstances could well provide and in a
              manner different from the customs of the people with whom he
              lives. It is possible in a third way, by virtue of food being
              prohibited by law for some special reason: thus, in the Old Law,
              certain kinds of food were prohibited for a symbolic reason; and
              in Egypt the eating of the flesh of the ox was prohibited in olden
              times so that agriculture would not be hindered; or even because
              certain rules prohibit the use of certain foods, with a view to
              the restraint of concupiscence.

              [7] Now, since the use of food and sexual capacities is not
              illicit in itself, but can only be illicit when it departs from
              the order of reason, and since external possessions are necessary
              for the taking of food, for the upbringing of offspring and the
              support of a family, and for other needs of the body, it follows
              also that the possession of wealth is not in itself illicit,
              provided the order of reason be respected. That is to say, a man
              must justly possess what he has; he must not set the end of his
              will in these things, and he must use them in a fitting way for
              his own and others’ benefit. Hence, the Apostle does not condemn
              the rich, but he gives them a definite regulation for the use of
              their wealth, when he says: “Charge the rich of this world not to
              be high-minded, nor to trust in the uncertainty of riches, but...
              to be rich in good works, to give easily, to communicate to
              others” (1 Tim. 6:17-18); and in Ecclesiasticus (31:8): “Blessed
              is the rich man that is found without blemish, and that hath not
              gone after gold, nor put his trust in money nor in treasure.”

              cognitione veritatis; et unus alium provocat ad bonum, et retrahit
              a malo. Unde Prov. 27-17 dicitur: ferrum ferro acuitur, et homo
              exacuit faciem amici sui. Et Eccle. 4 dicitur: 9 melius est duos
              esse quam unum: habent enim emolumentum societatis; si unus
              ceciderit, ab altero fulcietur. Vae soli: qui cum ceciderit, non
              habet sublevantem. Et si dormierint duo, fovebunt se mutuo: unus
              quomodo calefiet? Et si quis praevaluerit contra unum, duo
              resistunt ei. Oportuit igitur lege divina ordinari societatem
              hominum ad invicem.

              [2] Again, the end of divine law is for man to cling to God. But
              one man may be aided to this end by another man, both in regard to
              knowledge and to love. For men are of mutual assistance to each
              other in the knowing of truth, and one man may stimulate another
              toward the good, and also restrain him from evil. Hence it is
              said: “Iron sharpens iron, so a man sharpens the countenance of
              his friend” (Prov. 27:17). And it is said in Ecclesiastes
              (4:9-12): “It is better therefore that two should be together than
              one, for they have the advantage of their society; if one fall, he
              shall be supported by the other. Woe to him who is alone; for,
              when he falls, he has no one to lift him up. And if two lie
              together, they shall warm one another. How shall one alone be
              warmed? And if a man prevails against one, the two shall withstand
              him.” Therefore, it was necessary for the society of men, in their
              mutual interrelations, to be ordered by divine law.

              [3] Besides, divine law is a certain plan of divine providence for

              order, in such a way that each may take its proper place and
              level. Therefore, divine law so orders men in regard to each other
              that each man may keep his order. This is for men to be at peace
              with each other, for “peace among men is nothing but ordered
              concord,” as Augustine says.

              [7] Moreover, among men a person is most in debt to his parents.
              And so, among the precepts of the law ordering us in regard to our
              neighbor, Exodus (20:12-17) Puts first: “Honor Your father and
              Your mother.” In this text it is understood to be commanded that
              each man must render what he owes, both to his parents and to
              other persons, in accord with another text: “Render to all men
              their dues” (Rom. 13:7). Next to be put down are the precepts
              commanding abstinence from causing various sorts of harm to one’s
              neighbor. For instance, that we must not offend him by any deeds
              against his person; thus it was said: “You shall not kill”; nor
              against a person associated with him, for it was written: “You
              shall not commit adultery”; nor against his external goods, for it
              was written: “You shall not steal.” We are also prohibited from
              offending our neighbor by words that are contrary to justice, for
              it was written: “You shall not bear false witness against Your
              neighbor.” And since God is the judge, even of our hearts, we are
              prohibited from offending our neighbor in our heart, “by desiring
              his wife” or any of his goods.

              Ad huiusmodi autem iustitiam observandam, quae lege divina

              [8] Now, that he may observe this kind of justice which is
              prescribed by divine law man is impelled in two ways: in one, from
              within; in the other way, from without. From within, of course,
              man is voluntary in regard to observing what divine law
              prescribes. In fact, this is accomplished by man’s love of God and
              his neighbor, for he who loves a person gives him his due
              spontaneously and joyfully, and he even adds something in excess
              by way of liberality. So, the complete fulfillment of the law
              depends on love, according to the text of the Apostle: “Love is
              the fulfilling of the law” (Rom. 13:10). And the Lord says that,
              “on these two commandments,” that is, on the love of God and of
              neighbor, “depends the whole law” (Mat. 22:40). But since some
              people are not so disposed internally that they will do
              spontaneously what the law orders, they must be forced from
              without to fulfill the justice of the law. Of course, since this
              is done only from fear of punishments, they do not fulfill the law
              in freedom, but in servility. Hence it is said in Isaiah (26:9):
              "When You make Your judgments on the earth," that is, by punishing
              the wicked, "all the inhabitants of the world shall learn
              justice."

              they have charity which impels them in place of law and makes them
              act with liberality. So, it was not necessary to promulgate an
              external law for their sake, but for the sake of those who are not
              inclined of themselves toward the good. Hence it is said in 1
              Timothy (1:9): “The law is not made for the just man, but for the
              unjust.” This should not be understood as if the just were not
              obliged to obey the law, as some have badly understood it, but
              that these people are inclined of themselves to do what is just,

              endowment, he may use lower things for the needs of his life. Now,
              there is a definite measure according to which the use of the
              aforesaid things is proper to human life, and if this measure is
              set aside the result is harmful to man, as is evident in the

              [7] Again, according to the natural order, the body of man is for
              the sake of his soul and the lower powers of the soul are for the
              sake of reason, just as in other things matter is for the sake of
              form and instruments are for the sake of the principal agent. But,
              because of one thing being ordered to another, it ought to furnish
              help to that other, and not offer it any hindrance. So, it is
              naturally right for the body and the lower powers of the soul to
              be so managed by man that thereby his activity of reason, and his
              good, are least hindered and are, instead, helped. But, if it
              happens otherwise, the result will naturally be sinful. Therefore,
              drinking bouts and feastings, and inordinate sexual activities
              through which rational activity is hindered, and domination by the
              passions which do not permit free judgment of reason—these are
              naturally evil things.

              [1] Since the best thing for man is to become attached in his mind
              to God and divine things, and since it is impossible for man
              intensively to busy himself with a variety of things in order that
              man’s mind may be applied to God with greater liberty, counsels
              are given in the divine law whereby men are withdrawn from the
              busy concerns of the present life as far as is possible for one
              who is living an earthly life. Now, this detachment is not so
              necessary to man for justice that its absence makes justice
              impossible; indeed, virtue and justice are not removed if man uses
              bodily and earthly things in accord with the order of reason. And
              so, divine law admonitions of this kind are called counsels, not
              precepts, inasmuch as man is urged to renounce lesser goods for
              the sake of better goods.

              [2] Moreover, in the general mode of human life, human concern is
              devoted to three items: first, to one’s own person, what he should
              do, or where he should spend his time; second, to the persons of
              those connected with him, chiefly his wife and children; and
              third, to the acquisition of external things, which a man needs
              for the maintenance of life. So, to cut off solicitude for
              external things the counsel of poverty is given in the divine law,
              that is to say, so that one may cast off the things of this world
              with which his mind could be involved with some concern. Hence,
              the Lord says: “If You would be perfect, go sell what you have and
              give to the poor... and come, follow me” (Mat. 19:21). And to cut
              off concern for wife and children there is given man the counsel
              of virginity or continence. Hence, it is said in 1 Corinthians
              (7:25): “Now, concerning virgins, I have no commandment of the
              Lord, but I give counsel.” And giving the reason for this counsel,
              he adds: “He who is without a wife is solicitous for the things
              that belong to the Lord: how he may please God. But he who is with
              a wife is solicitous for the things of the world: how he may
              please his wife, and he is divided” (1 Cor. 7:32-33). Finally, to
              cut off man’s solicitude even for himself there is given the
              counsel of obedience, through which man hands over the control of
              his own acts to a superior. Concerning which it is said: “Obey
              your prelates and be subject to them. For they watch as being
              ready to render an account of your souls” (Heb. 13:17).

              nihil computabit eam. Et Matth. 13-45 simile est regnum caelorum

              pretiosa margarita, abiit et vendidit omnia quae habuit, et
              comparavit eam. Et Philipp. 3-7 quae mihi aliquando fuerunt lucra,

              14] They may also be called the effects and signs of perfection.
              When the mind becomes attached to a thing with intense love and
              desire, the result is that it sets aside other things. So, from
              the fact that man’s mind is fervently inclined by love and desire
              to divine matters, in which it is obvious that perfection is
              located, it follows that he casts aside everything that might hold
              him back from this inclination to God: not only concern for
              things, for wife, and the love of offspring, but even for himself.
              And the words of Scripture suggest this, for it is said in the
              Canticle of Canticles (8:7): “if a man should give all the
              substance of his house for love, he will account it as nothing”;
              and in Matthew (13:45): “the kingdom of heaven is like to a
              merchant seeking good pearls, who, when he found one pearl of
              great price, went his way and sold all that he had and bought it”;
              and also in Philippians (3:7-8): “the things that were gain to
              me... I counted as dung, that I might gain Christ.”

              [1] There have been some people who, in opposition to the teaching
              of the Gospel, have disapproved the practice of voluntary poverty.
              The first of these to be found is Vigilantius, whom, however, some
              others have followed later, calling themselves teachers of the
              law, understanding neither the things they say, nor whereof they
              affirm” (1 Tim. 1:7). They were led to this view by these and
              similar arguments.

              Naturalis enim appetitus requirit ut unumquodque animal sibi

              illo tempore quo inveniri possunt, et ea conservant; sicut patet
              de apibus et formicis. Homines autem ad suae vitae conservationem

              [2] Natural appetite requires every animal to provide for itself
              in regard to the necessities of its life; thus, animals that are
              not able to find the necessities of life during every period of
              the year, by a certain natural instinct gather the things needed
              for life during the season when they can be found, and they keep
              them; this practice is evident in the case of bees and ants. But
              men need many things for the preservation of life which cannot be
              found in every season. So, there is a natural tendency in man to
              gather and keep things necessary to him. Therefore, it is contrary
              to natural law to throw away, under the guise of poverty, all that
              one has gathered together.

              [3] Again, all have a natural predilection for the things whereby
              their being may be preserved, because all things desire to be. But
              man’s life is preserved by means of the substance of external
              goods. So, just as each man is obliged by natural law to preserve
              his life, so is he obliged to preserve external substance.
              Therefore, as it is contrary to the law of nature for a man to
              injure himself, so, too, is it for a man to deprive himself by
              voluntary poverty of the necessities of life.

              help can be given others, render themselves by this practice
              unable to give help. Therefore, it is against natural instinct,

              teaching. For it is stated in 2 Thessalonians (3:8-10): “Neither
              did we eat any man’s bread for nothing, but in labor and toil we
              worked night and day, lest we should be chargeable to any of you.
              Not as if we had not power, but that we might give ourselves a
              pattern unto you, to imitate us. For also, when we were with you,
              this we declared to you, that, if any man will not work, neither
              let him eat.” But even this way of living does not seem to be
              appropriate.

              capable of being moved, from which something would be available to
              provide for the needs of life. Therefore, to live by the labor of
              one’s hands does not seem to be suitable to the intention of those

              wisdom, but who have been reared in wealth and comfort, which they
              have left behind for the sake of Christ. It is also possible for

              [23] Furthermore, paupers who are supported by the gifts of others
              have to reveal their needs to others and beg for necessities. Now,
              this kind of begging makes mendicants objects of contempt, and
              even nuisances. In fact, men think themselves superior to those
              who have to be supported by them, and many give with reluctance.
              But those who embrace perfection of life should be held in
              reverence and love, so that men may more readily imitate them and
              emulate their state of life. Now, if the opposite happens, even
              virtue itself may be held in contempt. Therefore, to live by
              begging is a harmful way of life for those who embrace poverty
              voluntarily for the sake of perfect virtue.

              like that; but it is not praised for contemning the loftiness of

              contribute to the bad repute of humility if anyone in the name of
              humility did anything derogatory to the higher character of
              virtue. But mendicancy is derogatory to it: both because “it is

              the appearance of something disgraceful, as we said. Therefore,

              Ut autem circa praemissa veritas manifestetur, quid de paupertate

              [1] So, then, in order to show the truth in regard to the
              foregoing arguments, and what view we should take regarding
              poverty, we shall make a consideration of riches. As a matter of
              fact, external riches are necessary for the good of virtue; since
              by them we support our body and give assistance to other people.
              Now, things that are means to an end must derive their goodness
              from the end. So, external riches must be a good for man; not, of
              course, the principal one, but as a secondary good. For the end is
              the principal good, while other things are good because they are
              ordered to the end. This is why it has seemed to some people that
              the virtues are the greatest goods for man, while external riches
              are his least important goods. Now, things that are means to an
              end must be measured in accord with the requirements of the end.
              Therefore, riches are good, to the extent that they advance the
              practice of virtue, but if this measure is departed from, so that
              the practice of virtue is hindered by them, then they are not to
              be numbered among goods, but among evils. Hence, it happens to be
              a good thing for some people to possess riches, for they use them
              for the sake of virtue, but for others it is a bad thing to have
              them, for these people are taken away from virtue by them, either
              through too much solicitude or affection for them, or also because
              of mental pride resulting from them.

              [2] However, since there are virtues of the active and the
              contemplative life, both types have a different need for external
              riches. For the contemplative virtues need them only for the
              support of nature, but the active virtues need them for this, and
              also for the helping of others with whom one must live. Hence, the
              contemplative life is more perfect, even on this point, for it
              needs fewer things. Now, it seems proper to this kind of life for
              a man to devote himself entirely to divine things, which
              perfection the teaching of Christ urges on man. Hence, for
              followers of this type of perfection a very small amount of
              external riches suffices, that is, just the amount needed to
              support nature. And so, the Apostle says, in 1 Timothy (6:8):
              “Having food and wherewith to be covered, with these we are
              content.”

              [3] So, poverty is praiseworthy according as it frees man from the
              vices in which some are involved through riches. Moreover, in so
              far as it removes the solicitude which arises from riches, it is
              useful to some, namely, those disposed to busy themselves with
              better things. However, it is harmful to others, who, being freed
              from this solicitude, fall into worse occupations. Hence, Gregory
              says: “Often, those who have lived a life of human activities have
              been well occupied, but have been killed by the sword of their own
              retirement.” However, in so far as poverty takes away the good
              which results from riches, namely, the assisting of others and the
              support of oneself, it is purely an evil; except in the case where
              the temporal help that is offered to neighbors can be compensated
              for by a greater good, that is, by the fact that a man who lacks
              riches can more freely devote himself to divine and spiritual
              matters. But the good of supporting oneself is so necessary that
              it can be compensated for by no other good, since no man should
              take away from himself the support of life, under the pretext of
              obtaining another good.

              quanto paupertas fuerit maior. Non enim paupertas secundum se bona
              est: sed inquantum liberat ab illis quibus homo impeditur quominus
              spiritualibus intendat. Unde secundum modum quo homo per eam
              liberatur ab impedimentis praedictis, est mensura bonitatis
              ipsius. Et hoc est commune in omnibus exterioribus, quod in tantum
              bona sunt in quantum proficiunt ad virtutem, non autem secundum
              seipsa.

              [4] And so, such poverty is praiseworthy when a man is freed by it
              from earthly concerns and devotes himself more freely to divine
              and spiritual things, provided, of course, that the ability
              remains along with it in man to support himself in a lawful
              manner, for which support not many things are needed. Thus, the
              less one’s way of living in poverty requires of solicitude, the
              more praiseworthy it is. For poverty in itself is not good, but
              only in so far as it liberates from those things whereby a man is
              hindered from intending spiritual things. Hence, the measure of
              its goodness depends on the manner in which man is freed by means
              of it from the aforementioned obstacles. And this is generally
              true of all external things: they are good to the extent that they
              contribute to virtue, but not in themselves.

              [2] Although there is naturally present in man a desire to gather
              the things necessary for life, as the first argument suggested, it
              is not, however, such that every man must be occupied with this
              work. Indeed, not even among the bees do all have the same
              function; rather, some gather honey, others build their homes out
              of wax, while the rulers are not occupied with these works. And
              the same should hold in the case of man. In fact, since many
              things are needed for man’s life, for which one man could not
              suffice of himself, it is necessary for different jobs to be done
              by different people. For some should be farmers, some caretakers
              of animals, some builders, and so on for the other tasks. And
              since the life of man requires not only corporeal but, even more,
              spiritual goods, it is also necessary for some men to devote their
              time to spiritual things, for the betterment of others; and these
              must be freed from concern over temporal matters. Now, this
              division of various tasks among different persons is done by
              divine providence, inasmuch as some people are more inclined to
              one kind of work than to another.

              labors, or from the benefactions of others, whether they take them
              as common possessions or for daily need. Thus, indeed, “what we

              the Philosopher says [ <i>Ethics</i> III, 3], and so, what is

              any of them, when they do not come within man's use in accord with
              the rule of reason. Yet they are not to be judged evil in
              themselves; rather, the use of them may be evil. And so, neither
              is poverty to be cast aside because of certain vices which may be

              Hinc etiam considerandum est quod medium virtutis non accipitur
              secundum quantitatem exteriorum quae in usum veniunt, sed secundum
              regulam rationis. Unde quandoque contingit quod illud quod est
              extremum secundum quantitatem rei exterioris, secundum regulam
              rationis est medium. Neque enim est aliquis qui ad maiora tendat
              quam magnanimus, vel qui in sumptibus magnificum magnitudine
              superet. Medium ergo tenent non quantitate sumptus, aut alicuius
              huiusmodi, sed inquantum non transcendunt regulam rationis, nec ab
              ea deficiunt. Quae quidem regula non solum metitur quantitatem rei
              quae in usum venit, sed conditionem personae, et intentionem eius,
              opportunitatem loci et temporis, et alia huiusmodi quae in actibus
              virtutum requiruntur. Non igitur aliquis per voluntariam
              paupertatem contrariatur virtuti, quamvis omnia deserat. Nec hoc
              prodigaliter facit: cum hoc faciat debito fine, et aliis debitis

              tamen aliquis per virtutem fortitudinis operatur debitas
              circumstantias servans, quam omnia sua relinquere debito fine. Et

            </td>
            <td>
              [7] Hence, we must consider that the mean of virtue is not taken
              according to the amount of exterior goods that come into use, but
              according to the rule of reason. So, it sometimes happens that
              what is excessive in relation to the quantity of an external thing
              may be moderate in relation to the rule of reason. For no one
              inclines to greater things than does the magnanimous man; nor is
              there anyone who surpasses in greatness of expenditures the
              magnificent man. So, they adhere to a mean that does not consist
              in the amount of expense, or anything like that, but in so far as
              they neither exceed the rule of reason, nor fall short of it.
              Indeed, this rule measures not only the size of a thing that is
              used, but also the circumstances of the person, and his intention,
              the fitness of place and time, and other such things that are
              necessary in acts of virtue. So, no one runs counter to virtue
              through voluntary poverty, even if he abandons everything. Nor
              does he do this wastefully, since he does it with a proper end,
              and with due attention to other circumstances. For it is a greater
              thing to risk one's life, which, of course, a person may do under
              the virtue of fortitude if he observes the proper circumstances,
              than to abandon all his goods for a due end. And so, the sixth
              argument is answered.

              necessities of life. For He did not say: “Do not work,” but,
              rather: “Be not solicitous.” This He proves from a weaker case.
              For, if birds and lilies are sustained by divine providence,
              things which are of lower estate and unable to labor at those
              tasks whereby men gain their living, it is much more likely that
              He will provide for men who are of more worthy estate and to whom
              He has given the capacity to seek their livelihood through their
              own labors. Thus, it is not necessary to be afflicted by anxious
              concern for the needs of this life. Hence, it is evident that
              there is nothing derogatory to this way of life in the words of
              the Lord which were cited.

              [11] Nor, in fact, can this way of living be rejected because it
              is inadequate. The fact that in a few cases a man may be unable to
              gain what suffices for the needs of life by manual labor alone is
              due either to sickness or some like disability. However, an
              arrangement is not to be rejected because of a defect which occurs
              rarely, for such things happen in nature and in the order of
              voluntary acts. Nor is there any way of living whereby things may
              be so arranged that failure cannot occur at times, for even riches
              can be taken away by theft or robbery; so, also, the man who lives
              from the work of his hands can grow feeble. Yet there is a remedy
              in connection with the way of life that we are talking about;
              namely, that help be given him whose labor is not enough to
              provide his living, either by other men in the same society who
              can do more work than is necessary for them or else by those who
              have riches. This is in accord with the law of charity and natural
              friendship whereby one man comes to the assistance of another who
              is in need. Hence, while the Apostle said, in 2 Thessalonians
              (3:10): “if any man will not work, neither let him eat”—for the
              sake of those who are not able to gain a living by their own
              labor—he adds a warning to others, saying: “But you, brethren, be
              not weary in well doing” (2 Thes. 3:13).

              benefit of others should be supported by the gifts of these
              others. Indeed, unless this were so, human society could not

              [20] Nor is it unfitting for them to declare their needs and ask
              for what is necessary, whether for others or for themselves.
              Indeed, we read that even the Apostles did this: not only did they
              receive what was necessary from those to whom they preached, which
              was rather a matter of rightful authority than of mendicancy,
              because of the rule of the Lord that they who serve, “the gospel
              should live by the gospel” (1 Cor. 9:13-14), but they also did it
              for the poor who were in Jerusalem (Acts 9:27ff.; 2 Cor. 8 and 9)
              and who, having given up their possessions, were living in
              poverty, yet were not preaching to the Gentiles; rather, their
              spiritual manner of living entitled them to such support. Hence,
              the Apostle urges, not as a matter of obligation but of good will
              on the part of the givers (2 Cor. 9:7), the aiding of such people
              by means of alms; and this is nothing but begging. Now, this
              begging does not make men objects of contempt, provided it is done
              with moderation, for need and not to excess, and without undue
              insistence, with consideration for the circumstances of the
              persons from whom the request is made, and for the place and
              time—all of which must be observed by those devoted to perfection
              in life.

              [23] However, it is the mark of humility to accept humiliations
              without hesitation; not in all cases, of course, but when it is
              necessary. For, since humility is a virtue, it does not work
              without discretion. So, it is not proper to humility, but to
              stupidity, for a man to accept every kind of humiliation, but what
              must be done for the sake of virtue a person does not reject
              because of humiliation. For example, if charity demands that some
              humiliating duty be performed for a neighbor, one will not refuse
              it through humility. Therefore, if it is necessary for the
              adoption of the perfection of the life of poverty that a man beg,
              then to suffer this humiliation is proper to humility. Sometimes,
              too, it is virtuous to accept humiliations even though our job
              does not require it, in order by our example to encourage others
              who have such a burden, so that they may bear it readily. For, a
              general may at times serve like an ordinary soldier, in order to
              spur on others. Sometimes, moreover, we use humiliations
              virtuously for their medicinal value. For instance, if a man’s
              mind is prone to undue pride, he may make beneficial use, in due
              moderation, of humiliations, either self-imposed or caused by
              others, in order to restrain this tendency to pride, provided that
              through bearing these things he puts himself on a level, as it
              were, with even the lowliest men who perform low-grade tasks.

              [24] Now, the error of those who regard all solicitude for the
              gaining of a living for oneself as forbidden by God is altogether
              unreasonable. Indeed, every act requires solicitude. So, if a man
              ought to have no concern for corporeal things, then it follows
              that he ought not to be engaged in corporeal action, but this is
              neither possible nor reasonable. In fact, God has ordained
              activity for each thing in accord with the proper perfection of
              its nature. Now, man was made with a spiritual and bodily nature.
              So, he must by divine disposition both perform bodily actions and
              keep his mind on spiritual things. However, this way of human
              perfection is not such that one may perform no bodily actions,
              because, since bodily actions are directed to things needed for
              the preservation of life, if a man fail to perform them he
              neglects his life which every man is obliged to preserve. Now, to
              look to God for help in those matters in which a man can help
              himself by his own action, and to omit one’s own action, is the
              attitude of a fool and a tempter of God. Indeed, this is an aspect
              of divine goodness, to provide things not by doing them directly,
              but by moving others to perform their own actions, as we showed
              above. So. one should not look to God in the hope that, without
              performing any action by which one might help oneself, God will
              come to one’s aid, for this is opposed to the divine order and to
              divine goodness.

              [25] But since, in spite of our having the power to act, we do not
              have the power to guarantee the success of our actions in
              attaining their proper end, because of impediments which may
              occur, this success that may come to each man from his action lies
              within the disposition of divine providence. Therefore, the Lord
              commands us not to be solicitous concerning what pertains to God,
              namely, the outcome of our actions. But He has not forbidden us to
              be concerned about what pertains to us, namely, our own work. So,
              he who is solicitous about things that he can do does not act
              against the Lord’s precept. Rather, he does who is solicitous
              concerning the things which can result, even if he carries out his
              own actions, so that he omits the actions that are required to
              avoid these eventualities, against which we must rather place our
              hope in God’s providence, by which even the birds and the flowers
              are supported. To have solicitude of this kind seems to pertain to
              the error of the Gentiles who deny divine providence. This is why
              the Lord concludes that we must not be “solicitous for tomorrow.”
              He did not forbid us, by this injunction, from taking care in time
              of the things necessary for the future, but, rather, from being
              concerned about future events in despair of divine help. Or,
              perhaps, He forbade preoccupation today with the solicitude which
              one should have tomorrow, for each day has its own concerns;
              hence, He adds: “Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof” (Mat.

              [1] Now, just as in the case of the opposition to the perfection
              of poverty, so also have some perverse-minded men spoken against
              the good of continence. Some of them try to destroy the good of
              continence by these and like arguments.

              of the species. For the good of the species is more godlike than
              the good of the individual. Therefore, he who completely abstains
              from the act whereby the species is preserved commits a greater
              sin than he would if he abstained from an act by which the
              individual is preserved, such as eating and drinking and the like.

              concupiscence to fail to arise in a man, for they are natural.
              Now, to resist these feelings of concupiscence fully and, as it
              were, to wage a continuous fight against them produces more
              disturbance than if a man indulges moderately in concupiscent
              activities. Therefore, since mental disturbance is most
              incompatible with perfection of virtue, it appears to be opposed
              to virtue for a man to observe perpetual continence.

              [7] Such, then, seem to be the objections against perpetual

              Lord which, we read, was given to our first parents in Genesis
              (1:28; 9:1): “Increase and multiply, and fill the earth.” This was
              not revoked, but seems rather to have been confirmed by the Lord
              in the Gospel, where it is said: “What therefore God has joined
              together, let no man put asunder” (Mat. 19:6), when He speaks of
              the matrimonial union. But those who observe perpetual continence
              clearly act against this precept. So, it seems to be illicit to
              observe perpetual continence.

              actibus generationis vacent; sed quidam, ab his actibus

              [9] For we should keep in mind that one type of rational
              explanation is to be used for things which belong to the needs of
              the individual man, while a different one applies to the things
              that pertain to the needs of the group. In regard to things
              pertinent to the needs of the individual man, it is necessary to
              make provision for each person. Now, of this type are food and
              drink, and other goods having to do with the maintenance of the
              individual. Hence, each man must make use of food and drink. But,
              in the case of things that are necessary for the group, it is not
              necessary for the assignment to be given to each person in the
              group; indeed, this is not even possible. For it is clear that
              many things are needed by a group of men, such as food, drink,
              clothing, housing and the like, which cannot all be procured by
              one man. And so, different tasks must be given to different
              persons, just as different organs of the body are directed to
              different functions. So, since procreation is not a matter of the
              need of the individual but of the need of the whole species, it is
              not necessary for all men to devote themselves to acts of
              generation; instead, certain men, refraining from these acts,
              undertake other functions, such as the military life or
              contemplation.

            <td>
              [10] From this the answer to the second argument is clear. Indeed,
              the things that are necessary for the entire species are given man
              by divine providence, but it is not necessary for each man to use
              every one of them. For man has been given skill in building and
              strength for fighting, however, this does not mean that all men
              must be builders or soldiers. Likewise, though the generative
              power and things related to its act have been divinely provided,
              it is not necessary for each man to direct his intention to the
              generative act.

              Unde etiam patet solutio ad tertium. Ab his enim quae multitudini

              substantia spiritualis sit melior quam corporalis, non tamen esset
              melius universum in quo essent solae substantiae spirituales, sed
              imperfectius. Et quamvis sit melior oculus pede in corpore
              animalis, non tamen esset perfectum animal nisi haberet et oculum
              et pedem. Ita etiam nec multitudo humani generis haberet statum
              perfectum nisi essent aliqui intendentes generationis actibus, et
              aliqui ab his abstinentes et contemplationi vacantes.

            <td>
              [11] As a result, the answer to the third objection is also
              evident. Though it is better for some individuals to abstain from
              the things that are necessary for the group, it is not good for
              all to abstain. The same situation is apparent in the order of the
              universe, for, although spiritual substance is better than the
              corporeal, that universe in which there are spiritual substances
              only would not be better but more imperfect. And even though an
              eye is better than a foot in the body of an animal, the animal
              would not be perfect unless it had both eye and foot. So, too, the
              community of mankind would not be in a perfect state unless there
              were some people who direct their intention to generative acts and
              others who refrain from these acts and devote themselves to
              contemplation.

              [12] Moreover, what is objected fourthly, that virtue must lie in
              the mean, is answered by what was said above in regard to poverty.
              For the mean of virtue is not always taken according to the
              quantity of the thing that is ordered by reason, but, rather,
              according to the rule of reason which takes in the proper end and
              measures the appropriate circumstances. And so, to abstain from
              all sexual pleasures, without a reason, is called the vice of
              insensibility. But, if it be done in accord with reason, it is a
              virtue which surpasses man’s ordinary way of life, for it makes
              men share somewhat in the divine likeness; hence, virginity is
              said to be related to the angels (Mat. 22:30).

              continentiae propositum habent. Usus etiam corporalium

              [13] In regard to the fifth argument, it should be said that the
              solicitude and occupation which encumber those who are married,
              concerning their wives, children and the procuring of the
              necessities of life, are continuous. But the disturbance which a
              man suffers in the fight against concupiscent tendencies is for a
              limited time. For this decreases as a result of a man refusing to
              consent to it; in fact, the more a person indulges in pleasures,
              the more does the desire for pleasure grow in him. Thus,
              concupiscent feelings are weakened by acts of abstinence and other
              corporeal practices suitable to those who have the vow of
              continence. Moreover, the enjoyment of corporeal delights
              distracts the mind from its peak activity and hinders it in the
              contemplation of spiritual things much more than the disturbance
              that results from resisting the concupiscent desires for these
              pleasures, because the mind becomes very strongly attached to
              carnal things through the enjoyment of such pleasures, especially
              those of sex. For enjoyment makes the appetite become fixed on the
              thing that is enjoyed. And so, for those people who devote their
              attention to the contemplation of divine things and of every kind
              of truth, it is especially harmful to have been addicted to sexual
              pleasures and particularly beneficial to abstain from them. Now,
              this is not to suggest that, although it is generally better for
              the individual man to observe continence than to engage in
              matrimony, the latter may not be better in a particular case.
              Hence, the Lord, having mentioned continence, says: “All men take
              not this word, but they to whom it is given” (Mat. 19:11).

              [14] To what is asserted in the last objection, on the ground of
              the precept given to our first parents, the reply is evident from
              what has been said. Indeed, that precept is concerned with the
              natural inclination in man to preserve the species by the act of
              generation; however, this need not be carried out by all men, but
              by some, as we said.

              times, if the increase of the race requires matrimony: whether
              because of a lack of men, as in the beginning when the human race
              began to multiply; or because of the small number of the faithful,
              in which situation they should multiply by carnal generation, as
              was the case in the Old Testament. Thus, the counsel of practicing
              perpetual continence was reserved to the New Testament, when the
              faithful are multiplied by a spiritual generation.

              Jovinians. But the falsity of this error is quite apparent from
              the foregoing, since by continence man is made more skillful in
              raising his mind to spiritual and divine matters, and so he is
              placed, in a way, above the level of a man and in a certain
              likeness to the angels.

              [2] Now, these men seem to ignore the meaning of necessity. In
              fact, there are two kinds of necessity. One is that of coaction.
              This kind decreases the value of virtuous acts, because it is
              contrary to the voluntary, for what is done under coaction is what
              is against the will. But there is another necessity that results
              from interior inclination. This does not diminish the value of a
              virtuous act, but increases it, for it makes the will incline more
              intensely toward an act of virtue. Indeed, it is evident that the
              more perfect a habit of virtue is, I the more forcefully does it
              make the will tend to the good of virtue, and less likely to fall
              short of it. So that, if it reaches the end of perfection, it
              confers a certain necessity of acting well, as in the case of the
              blessed who are not able to sin, as will appear later. Yet,
              because of this, neither is any freedom of will lost, nor goodness
              of the act.

              haec necessitas libertatem voluntatis diminuit, nec actuum

              [3] However, there is still another necessity resulting from the
              end, as when we say that someone must have a ship in order to
              cross the sea. Again it is evident that this necessity does not
              decrease freedom of will or the goodness of the acts. Rather, the
              fact that a man does something that is necessary for an end is
              praiseworthy in itself; and the better the end, the more
              praiseworthy it is.

              himself, is not the necessity of coaction or even that resulting
              from interior inclination, but it is from a relation to the end.
              For it is necessary for a person who takes a vow to do this or
              that thing if he is to fulfill the vow or practice obedience. So,
              since these ends are praiseworthy, inasmuch as by them man
              subjects himself to God, the aforesaid necessity in no way
              diminishes the value of virtue.

            <td>
              [5] We should further consider that the carrying out of things
              which a person has vowed, or the fulfilling of the orders of a man
              to whom the person has subjected himself for God’s sake, are
              actions worthy of greater praise and reward. It is possible, of
              course, for one act to pertain to two vices, provided the act of
              one vice be directed to the end of another vice. For instance,
              when a man steals so that he may fornicate, the act is
              specifically one of avarice, but by its intention it belongs to
              lust. In the same way, it also happens in the case of virtues that
              the act of one virtue is ordered to another virtue. Thus, when one
              gives away his possessions so that he may enjoy the friendship of
              charity with another man, this act specifically belongs to
              liberality, but from its end it pertains to charity. Now, acts of
              this kind acquire greater value from the greater virtue, that is,
              from charity rather than from liberality. Hence, though it loses
              its character as an exclusive act of liberality by virtue of its
              ordination to charity, it will be more praiseworthy and worthy of
              greater reward than if it were done liberally, with no relation to
              charity.

              [6] So, let us suppose a man performing some work of a definite

              continently from sexual pleasure—now, if he does this without a
              vow it will be an act of chastity or of abstinence, but if he does

              [7] Again, what is most important in virtue is a proper end, for
              the rational character of a good act stems chiefly from the end.
              So, if the end is more eminent, then, even if one is somewhat less
              than perfect in the act, it will be for him a more virtuous act.
              For example, take the case of a man who proposes to make a long
              journey for a virtuous purpose, while another man undertakes a
              short one; he who proposes to do more for the sake of virtue will
              be more praiseworthy, even though he makes slower progress on the
              trip. But suppose a man does something for God’s sake, offering
              this act to God: if he does this under a vow he offers God not
              only the act, but also his power. Thus, it is evident that his
              intention is to offer something greater to God. So, his act will
              be more virtuous by reason of his intention for a greater good,
              even if, in the execution of it, another man might appear more
              fervent.

              [8] Besides, the act of will which precedes an act continues in
              its power through the whole performance of the act, and renders it
              worthy of praise, even when the agent is not thinking during the
              execution of the work of the commitment of will from which the act
              began. In fact, it is not necessary for a man who undertakes a
              journey for God’s sake actually to think about God during every
              part of the trip. Now, it is clear that the man who vows that he
              will do a certain thing wills it more intensely than one who
              simply decides to do it, for the first man not only wills to do
              it, but he wills to strengthen himself so that he will not fail to
              act. So, by this act of voluntary intention there is produced a
              praiseworthy execution of the vow accompanied by a certain fervor,
              even when the will-act is not actually continued during the
              operation, or is continued in a slack way.

              good. Now, counsels are given in the divine law concerning
              poverty, continence, and other like things, as we said above. So,
              these are better than the practice of matrimony and the possession
              of temporal things, but it is possible to act virtuously according
              to these latter, provided the order of reason be observed, as we
              showed above. Therefore, not all acts of the virtues are equal.

              commensuration, the greater the departure from the proper
              measurement, the worse will it be. Thus, health consists in a

              of bodily members, while truth lies in a measured relation of the
              understanding, or of speech, to the thing. Now, clearly, the more
              inequality there is in the humors, the greater the sickness; and
              the greater the disorder in the members of the body, the greater
              is the ugliness; and the farther one departs from the truth, the
              greater is the falsity. For instance, the man who thinks that
              three is five is not as wrong as the one who thinks three is a

              commensuration, for there is a mean that is set up between opposed
              vices according to a proper judgment of the limiting
              circumstances. Therefore, the more it departs from this harmonious
              balance, the greater the evil is.

              [16] Moreover, it is not the same thing to transgress virtue and
              to trespass over boundaries set up by a judge. Virtue is, in fact,
              good in itself, and so to depart from virtue is an evil in itself.
              Hence, to go farther away from virtue is a greater evil. But to
              pass over a boundary line set up by a judge is not essentially
              evil, but accidentally so—to the extent, that is, that it is
              prohibited. But in the case of events that are accidental, it is
              not necessary that “if one event taken without qualification
              follows another event without qualification, then an increase in
              the first event is followed by an increase in the second.” This
              only follows in things which exist of themselves. For instance, it
              does not follow that, if a white man is musical, then a whiter man
              will be more musical, but it does follow that, if a white thing is
              a distinctive object of sight, a whiter thing is a more
              distinctive object for sight.

              Est autem hoc inter peccatorum differentias attendendum, quod

              [17] Yet there is this point to be noted regarding the differences
              among sins: that one kind is mortal and another venial. Now, the
              mortal is that which deprives the soul of spiritual life. The
              meaning of this life may be taken from two points in the
              comparison with natural life. In fact, a body is naturally alive
              because it is united to a soul which is the source of life for it.
              Moreover, a body that is made alive by a soul moves by itself, but
              a dead body either remains without movement or is only moved from
              outside. So, too, the will of man, when united by a right
              intention to its ultimate end, which is its object and, in a
              sense, its form, is also enlivened. And when it adheres to God and
              neighbor through love, it moves from an interior principle to do
              the right things. But when the intention and love of the ultimate
              end are removed, the soul becomes, as it were, dead, since it does
              not move of itself to do right actions, but either entirely ceases
              to do them or is led to do them solely by something external,
              namely, the fear of punishments. So, whatever sins are opposed to
              the intending and loving of the ultimate end are mortal. But, if a
              man is properly disposed in regard to them, yet falls somewhat
              short of the right order of reason, his sin will not be mortal but
              venial.

              [3] Again, wherever there is a proper order to an end, this order
              must lead to the end, while a departure from this order prevents
              the attainment of the end. For things which depend on the end
              derive their necessity from the end; that is to say, this means is
              necessary if the end is to be attained—and under these conditions,
              if there be no impediment, the end is achieved. Now, God has
              imposed on men’s acts a certain order in relation to the final
              good, as is evident from preceding statements. So, it must be, if

              rewarded; but those who depart from this order by means of sin

              [4] Besides, as things in nature are subject to the order of
              divine providence, so are human acts, as is clear from what was
              said earlier. In both cases, however, it is possible for the
              proper order to be observed or overlooked. Yet there is this
              difference: the observance or transgression of the due order is
              put within the control of the human will, but it is not within the
              power of things in nature to fall short of or to follow the proper
              order. Now, effects must correspond in an appropriate way with
              their causes. Hence, just as when natural things adhere to a due
              order in their natural principles and actions, the preservation of
              their nature and the good in them necessarily follows, while
              corruption and evil result when there is a departure from the
              proper and natural order—so also, in human affairs, when a man
              voluntarily observes the order of divinely imposed law, good must
              result, not as if by necessity, but by the management of the
              governor, and this is to be rewarded. On the contrary, evil
              follows when the order of the law has been neglected, and this is
              to be punished.

              Amplius. Ad perfectam Dei bonitatem pertinet quod nihil in rebus

              [5] Moreover, to leave nothing unordered among things pertains to
              the perfect goodness of God; as a result, we observe that every
              evil in things of nature is included under the order of something
              good. So, the corruption of air is the generation of fire and the
              killing of a sheep is the feeding of a wolf. Hence, since human
              acts are subject to divine providence, just as things in nature
              are, the evil which occurs in human acts must be contained under
              the order of some good. Now, this is most suitably accomplished by
              the fact that sins are punished. For in that way those acts which
              exceed the due measure are embraced under the order of justice
              which reduces to equality. But man exceeds the due degree of his
              measure when he prefers his own will to the divine will by
              satisfying it contrary to God’s ordering. Now, this inequity is
              removed when, against his will, man is forced to suffer something
              in accord with divine ordering. Therefore, it is necessary that
              human sins be given punishment of divine origin and, for the same
              reason, that good deeds receive their reward.

              [1] As we have just seen, since a reward is what is set before the
              will as an end whereby one is stimulated to good action,
              punishment, on the contrary, in the guise of some evil that is to
              be avoided, is set before the will to restrain it from evil. So,
              just as it is essential to a reward that it be a good that is
              agreeable to the will, so is it essential to punishment that it be
              an evil and contrary to will. Now, evil is a privation of the
              good. Hence, the diversity and order of punishments must depend on
              the diversity and order of goods.

              [4] However, because it is essential not only that punishment by a
              privation of the good, but also that it be contrary to the will,
              for not every man’s will regards good things as they really are,
              it happens at times that what deprives one of the greater good is
              less repugnant to the will and thus seems to be less punishing.
              Hence it is that a good many men who think better of and know more

              intellectual and spiritual goods have a greater fear of bodily

              [6] To people who consider the matter rightly this should not seem
              astonishing. For, since external goods are subordinated to
              internal goods, and body to soul, external and bodily goods are
              good for man to the extent that they contribute to the good of
              reason, but to the extent that they hinder the rational good they
              turn into evils for man. Now, God, the disposer of things, knows
              the measure of human virtue. Hence, He at times provides corporeal
              and external goods for the virtuous man as an aid to his virtue,
              and in this He confers a benefit on him. At other times, however,
              He takes away these things from man, because He considers such
              things to be for him a hindrance to virtue and divine enjoyment.
              Indeed, from the fact that external goods may turn into evils for
              man, as we said, their loss may consequently become, by the same
              reasoning, a good thing for man.

              So, if every punishment is an evil, and if it is not a bad thing

              punishment for a virtuous man if he be deprived of external goods
              as an aid to virtue. On the contrary, however, it will be for the
              punishment of evil men if external goods are granted them, for by
              them they are incited to evil. Hence it is said in Wisdom (14:11)
              that “the creatures of God are turned to an abomination, and a
              temptation to the souls of men, and a snare to the feet of the

              because they are naturally good must be taken away from man for
              the advancement of virtue arises from a disorder in man which is
              either a fault or the result of a fault. Indeed, it is obvious
              that some disorder in the affections of man is caused by a
              previous sin, and so afterwards he is more easily inclined to sin.
              So, man is not without fault, also, in the fact that he must be
              helped to the good of virtue by what is for him something of a
              punishment, inasmuch as it is absolutely against his will, even
              though it be desired sometimes, in a relative way, because reason
              looks to the end. But, we shall talk later about this disorder in
              human nature which results from original sin. However, it is now
              evident to what extent God punishes men for their sins, and that

              [3] Besides, rewards and punishments are set up by a lawmaker so
              that men may be drawn away from evil things and toward good
              things, as is evident from what was said above. But it is not only
              necessary for men to be attracted to goods and drawn away from
              evils, but also good men must be encouraged to better things and
              evil men discouraged from worse things. This could not be done if
              rewards and punishments were equal. Therefore, punishments and
              rewards must be unequal.

              [5] Furthermore, it is possible for variations of degree to apply
              to good and bad works in two ways: in one way, numerically, in the
              sense that one man has more good or bad works than another; in a
              second way, qualitatively, in the sense that one man accomplishes
              a better or worse work than another. Now, to the increase which
              depends on the number of works there must be a corresponding
              increase in rewards and punishments; otherwise, there would not be
              a compensation under divine justice for all the things that a
              person does, if some evils remained unpunished and some goods
              unrewarded. So, by equivalent reasoning, for the increase which

              [1] Now, it is obvious from the foregoing that it is possible to
              sin in two ways. One way is such that the mental intention is
              entirely broken away from the order to God, Who is called the
              ultimate end of all good people; and this is mortal sin. The
              second way is such that, while the ordering of the human mind to
              the ultimate end remains, some impediment is brought in whereby
              one is held back from freely tending toward the end; and this is
              called venial sin. So, if there must be a difference of
              punishments depending on a difference of sins, it follows that he
              who commits a mortal sin must be punished in such a way that he
              may be cut off from the end of man, but he who sins venially must
              not be punished so that he is cut off but so that he is retarded
              or made to suffer difficulty in acquiring the end. For, thus is
              the equality of justice preserved: in whatever way man voluntarily
              turns away from his end by sinning, in the same way in the order
              of punishment, involuntarily, he is impeded in regard to the
              attainment of his end.

              [2] Again, as will is in men, so is natural inclination in the
              things of nature. Now, if the inclination toward its end be taken
              away from a natural thing, it becomes altogether unable to reach
              its end. For example, when a heavy body loses its weight through
              corruption and becomes light, it will not reach its proper place.
              But, if there be an impediment to its motion, while its
              inclination to the end remains, then, when the obstacle is
              removed, it will reach its end. Now, in the man who commits a
              mortal sin, the intention of his will is completely turned away
              from his ultimate end; while in the man who commits a venial sin,
              his intention continues to be fixed on the end, but he is somewhat
              hindered in that he improperly fixes his intention on the means to
              the end. Therefore, for the one who sins mortally, this is the
              proper punishment: to be completely cut off from the attainment of
              the end. But for the one who sins venially, he must suffer some
              difficulty before he reaches the end.

              the end are not available, then the end will not occur. For, if

              non potest resolvi per corruptionem in aliquam praeiacentem
              materiam, ut iterum generetur aliud idem specie. Si igitur

              [3] Again, if there is a privation of something which is naturally
              required, it is impossible for this to be restored unless there be
              a breaking down of the subject to the underlying matter, so that
              another subject may again be generated anew, as is the case when
              an animal loses the power of sight or any other sense power. Now,
              it is impossible for what has been already generated to be again
              generated, unless it is first corrupted. In that case, from the
              same matter it is possible for another whole being to be
              generated, not the same numerically but in species. But spiritual
              things, such as a soul or an angel, cannot be broken down by
              corruption into an underlying matter so that another member of the
              same species may in turn be generated. So, if such a being is
              deprived of what it must have in its nature, then such a privation
              has to continue perpetually. But there is in the nature of a soul
              and of an angel an ordering toward the ultimate end Who is God.
              So, if it departs from this order by virtue of some punishment,
              this punishment will endure perpetually.

              deprived of the good against which he acts, for by this action he
              renders himself unworthy of such a good. So it is that, according
              to civil justice, he who offends against the state is deprived
              completely of association with the state, either by death or by
              perpetual exile. Nor is any attention paid to the extent of time
              involved in his wrongdoing, but only to what he sinned against.
              There is the same relation between the entirety of our present
              life and an earthly state that there is between the whole of
              eternity and the society of the blessed who, as we showed above,
              share in the ultimate end eternally. So, he who sins against the
              ultimate end and against charity, whereby the society of the
              blessed exists and also that of those on the way toward happiness,
              should be punished eternally, even though he sinned for but a
              short space of time.

              are done outwardly, so does God see the heart of men” (1 Sam.
              16:7). Now, he who has turned aside from his ultimate end for the
              sake of a temporal good, when he might have possessed his end
              throughout eternity, has put the temporal enjoyment of this
              temporal good above the eternal enjoyment of the ultimate end.
              Hence, it is evident that he much preferred to enjoy this temporal
              good throughout eternity. Therefore, according to divine judgment,
              he should be punished in the same way as if he had sinned
              eternally. But there is no doubt that an eternal punishment is due
              an eternal sin. So, eternal punishment is due to him who turns

              [9] This view seemed persuasive on the basis of human custom.
              Indeed, the punishments under human law are applied for the remedy
              of vices, and so they are like medicines. On the basis of reason,
              also, if a punishment were assigned by a punishing agent, not for
              the sake of something else, but for its own sake alone, it would
              follow that the agent takes pleasure in punishments for their own
              sake, which is not in keeping with divine goodness. So,
              punishments must be inflicted for the sake of something else. And
              there seems to be no other more suitable end than the correction
              of vices. So, it seems that all punishments may fittingly be said
              to be purgatorial and, consequently, requiring termination at some
              time, since what can be purged out is accidental to a rational
              creature and may be removed without consuming the substance.

              creatures, in which order the good of the universe consists. Now,
              this order of things demands that all things be divinely arranged
              in a proportionate way. This is why it is said in the Book of
              Wisdom (11:21) that God made all things, “in weight, number and

              [11] However, if one concede that all punishments are applied for
              the correction of behavior and not for anything else, one is still
              not forced by this admission to assert that all punishments are
              purgatorial and terminable. For even according to human laws some
              people are punished with death, not, of course, for their own
              improvement, but for that of others. Hence, it is said in Proverbs
              (19:75): “the wicked man being scourged, the fool shall be wiser.”
              Then, too, some people, in accord with human laws, are perpetually
              exiled from their country, so that, with them removed, the state
              may be purer. Hence, it is said in Proverbs (22:10): “Cast out the
              scoffer, and contention shall go with him, and quarrels and
              reproaches shall cease.” So, even if punishments are used only for
              the correction of behavior, nothing prevents some people,
              according to divine judgment, from having to be separated
              perpetually from the society of good men and to be punished
              eternally, so that men may refrain from sinning, as a result of
              their fear of perpetual punishment, and thus the society of good
              men may be made purer by their removal. As it is said in the
              Apocalypse (21:27): “There shall not enter it,” that is, into the
              heavenly Jerusalem, by which the society of good men is
              designated, “anything defiled or that works abomination or
              falsehood.”

              [3] Besides, if a man makes inordinate use of a means to the end,
              he may not only be deprived of the end, but may also incur some
              other injury. This is exemplified in the inordinate eating of
              food, which not only fails to maintain strength, but also leads to
              sickness. Now, the man who puts his end among created things does
              not use them as he should, namely, by relating them to his
              ultimate end. So, he should not only be punished by losing
              happiness, but also by experiencing some injury from them.

              countries whose duty it is to compel these people, by means of
              sensible and present punishments, to respect justice. It is
              obvious that these men do not sin when they punish the wicked, for
              no one sins by working for justice. Now, it is just for the wicked
              to be punished, since by punishment the fault is restored to
              order, as is clear from our statements above. Therefore, judges do

              to be rewarded and the evil to be punished, as is shown by our
              earlier remarks. Therefore, men who are in authority over others

              [9] Now, these arguments are frivolous. Indeed, in the law which
              says “You shall not kill” there is the later statement: “You shall
              not allow wrongdoers to live” (Exod. 22: 18). From this we are
              given to understand that the unjust execution of men is
              prohibited. This is also apparent from the Lord’s words in Matthew
              5. For, after He said: “You have heard that it was said to them of
              old: You shall not kill” (Mat. 5:21), He added: “But I say to you
              that whosoever is angry with his brother,” etc. From this He makes
              us understand that the killing which results from anger is
              prohibited, but not that which stems from a zeal for justice.
              Moreover, how the Lord’s statement, “Let both grow until the
              harvest,” should be understood is apparent through what follows:
              “lest perhaps, gathering up the cockle, you root up the wheat also
              together with it” (Mat. 13: 29). So, the execution of the wicked
              is forbidden wherever cannot be done without danger to the good.
              Of course, this often happens when the wicked are not clearly
              distinguished from the good by their sins, or when the danger of
              the evil involving many good men in their ruin is feared.

              [1] Since it is plain from earlier chapters that divine providence
              controls rational creatures in a different way from other things,
              because they differ from other things in the way that their own
              nature was established, it remains to be shown that, by virtue of
              the dignity of their end, a higher mode of governance is used by
              divine providence in their case.

              [2] Now, it is obvious that, according to what befits their
              nature, they achieve a higher participation in the end. In fact,
              since they have an intellectual nature, they are able by its
              operation to attain to intelligible truth, and this is not
              possible for other things that are devoid of understanding. And,
              of course, because they can reach intelligible truth by their
              natural operation, it is clear that divine provision is made for
              them in a different way than for other things. Inasmuch as man is
              given understanding and reason, by which he can both discern and
              investigate the truth; as he is also given sensory powers, both
              internal and external, whereby he is helped to seek the truth; as
              he is also given the use of speech, by the functioning of which he
              is enabled to convey to another person the truth that he conceives
              in his mind—thus constituted, men may help themselves in the
              process of knowing the truth, just as they may in regard to the
              other needs of life for man is “a naturally social animal.”

              [3] But, beyond this, man’s ultimate end is fixed in a certain
              knowledge of truth which surpasses his natural capacity: that is,
              he may see the very First Truth in Itself, as we showed above.
              Now, this is not granted to lower creatures, that is, the
              possibility of their reaching an end which exceeds their natural
              capacity. So, the different mode of governance in regard to men
              and in regard to other, lower creatures must be noted as a result
              of this end. For, the things that are related to an end must be
              proportionate to that end. So, if man is ordered to an end which
              exceeds his natural capacity, some help must be divinely provided
              for him, in a supernatural way, by which he may tend toward his
              end.

              light, becomes luminous by the power and action of the sun, and
              water, which is not hot of itself, becomes hot by the power and
              action of fire. Now, to see the very First Truth in Itself so
              transcends the capacity of human nature that it is proper to God

              Therefore, man is not able by his own operation to reach his
              ultimate end, which transcends the capacity of his natural powers,
              unless his operation acquires from divine power the efficacy to
              reach the aforesaid end.

              [6] Moreover, no instrument can achieve its ultimate perfection by
              the power of its own form, but only by the power of the principal
              agent, although by its own power it can provide a certain
              disposition to the ultimate perfection. Indeed, the cutting of the
              lumber results from the saw according to the essential character
              of its own form, but the form of the bench comes from the skilled
              mind which uses the tool. Likewise, the breaking down and
              consumption of food in the animal body is due to the heat of fire,
              but the generation of flesh, and controlled growth and similar
              actions, stem from the vegetative soul which uses the heat of fire
              as an instrument. Now, all intellects and wills are subordinated
              as instruments under a principal agent to God, Who is the first
              intellect and will. So, their operations must have no efficacy in
              regard to the ultimate perfection which is the attainment of final
              happiness, except through the divine power. Therefore, a rational
              nature needs divine help to obtain the ultimate end.

              [4] Besides, man is ordered to his end by his will, for the object
              of the will is the good and the end. Now, divine help is chiefly
              afforded us so that we may obtain our end. So, this help does not
              exclude from us the act of our will, but, rather, in a special
              way, produces this act in us. Hence, the Apostle says, in
              Philippians (2:13): “it is God Who works in you, both to will and
              to accomplish, according to good will.” But coaction excludes the
              act of the will in us, since we do under force that whose contrary
              we will. Therefore, God does not force us by His help to act
              rightly.

              [1] From what has been said it is quite manifest that man cannot
              merit divine help in advance. For everything is related as matter
              to what is above it. Now, matter does not move itself to its own
              perfection; rather, it must be moved by something else. So, man
              does not move himself so as to obtain divine help which is above
              him; rather, he is moved by God to obtain it.” Now, the movement
              of the mover precedes the movement of the movable thing in reason
              and causally. Therefore, divine help is not given to us by virtue
              of the fact that we initially move ourselves toward it by good
              works; instead, we make such progress by good works because we are
              preceded by divine help.

              [2] Again, an instrumental agent is not disposed to he brought to
              perfection by the principal agent, unless it acts by the power of
              the principal agent. Thus, the heat of fire no more prepares
              matter for the form of flesh than for any other form, except in so
              far as the heat acts through the power of the soul. But our soul
              acts under God, as an instrumental agent under a principal agent.
              So, the soul cannot prepare itself to receive the influence of
              divine help except in so far as it acts from divine power.
              Therefore, it is preceded by divine help toward good action,
              rather than preceding the divine help and meriting it, as it were,
              or preparing itself for it.

              as in things here below, all motion is preceded by celestial
              motion. But the human soul is subordinated to God as a particular
              agent under a universal one. So, it is impossible for there to be
              any right movement in it which divine action does not precede.
              Hence, the Lord says, in John (15:5): “without Me you can do

              [2] But there is another reason why the aforesaid help of God has
              taken the name grace. In fact, a person is said to be in the “good
              graces” of another because he is well liked by the other.
              Consequently, he who is loved by another is said to enjoy his
              grace. Now, it is of the essence of love that the ]over wishes
              good and does what is good for the object of his love. Of course,
              God wishes and does good things in regard to every creature, for
              the very being of the creature and all his perfection result from
              God’s willing and doing, as we showed above. Hence, it is said in
              Wisdom (11:25): “For You love all things that are, and hate none
              of the things which You have made.” But a special mark of divine
              love is observable in the case of those to whom He offers help so
              that they may attain a good which surpasses the order of their
              nature, namely, the perfect enjoyment, not of some created good,
              but of Himself. So, this help is appropriately called grace, not
              only because it is given gratis, as we showed, but also because by
              this help man is, through a special prerogative, brought into the
              good graces of God. Hence, the Apostle says, in Ephesians (1:5-6):
              “Who predestinated us to the adoption of children... according to
              the purpose of His will, to the praise of the glory of His grace,
              in which He hath graced us in His beloved Son.”

              [3] Now, this grace, within the man who is graced by it, must be
              something, a sort of form and perfection for that man. For, a
              thing that is directed toward an end must have a continual
              relation to it, because the mover continually moves the moved
              object, until the object comes to its end as a result of the
              motion. Therefore, since man is directed to the ultimate end by
              the help of divine grace, as we showed, man must continually enjoy
              this help until he reaches his end. Now, this would not be if man
              participated in the aforesaid help as a motion or passion and not
              as an enduring form which is, as it were, at rest in him. In fact,
              a motion and a passion would not be present in man except when he
              was actually converted to the end, and this act is not continually
              performed by man, as is especially evident in the case of sleeping
              man. Therefore, sanctifying grace is a form and perfection
              remaining in man even when he is not acting.

              [4] Again, God’s love is causative of the good which is in us,
              just as a man’s love is called forth and caused by some good thing
              which is in the object of his love. But man is aroused to love
              someone in a special way because of some special good which
              pre-exists in the person loved. Therefore, wherever there is found
              a special love of God for man, there must consequently be found
              some special good conferred on man by God. Hence, since in accord
              with the preceding explanation sanctifying grace marks a special
              love of God for man, it must be that a special goodness and
              perfection is marked, as being present in man, by this term.

              through the form of weight a likeness and conformity to the place
              toward which it is moved naturally. But we showed that sanctifying
              grace is a certain form in man whereby he is ordered to his
              ultimate end, Who is God. So, man achieves the likeness to God
              through grace. Now, likeness is the cause of love, for everything
              loves its like (See Sirach 13:19). Therefore, by grace man is made
              a lover of God.

              [4] Besides, whenever something is moved by an agent to what is
              proper to the agent, the thing moved must be, at the start,
              imperfectly subject to the impulsions of the agent, impulsions
              that remain somewhat foreign and improper to it, until at the end
              of the movement they do become proper to it. For example, wood is
              first heated by fire, and that heat does not belong to the wood
              but is apart from its nature; at the end, however, when the wood
              is now ignited, the heat becomes proper and connatural to it.
              Likewise, when a person is being taught by a teacher, he must at
              the start accept the teacher’s conceptions, not as one who
              understands them by himself, but by way of belief, as things which
              are beyond his capacity; but at the end, when he has become
              learned, he can understand them. Now, as is clear from what we
              have said, we are directed by the help of divine grace to our
              ultimate end. But the ultimate end is an open vision of the First
              Truth in Itself, as we showed above. Therefore, before it comes to
              this end, man’s intellect must be subject to God by way of belief,
              under the influence of divine grace which accomplishes this.

              [2] In fact, the love that a man has for others arises in man from
              the love that he has for himself, for a man stands in relation to
              a friend as he does to himself. But a person loves himself
              inasmuch as he wishes the good for himself, just as he loves
              another person by wishing him good. So, by the fact that a man is
              interested in his own good he is led to develop an interest in
              another person’s good. Hence, because a person hopes for good from
              some other person, a way develops for man to love that other
              person in himself, from whom he hopes to attain the good. Indeed,
              a person is loved in himself when the lover wishes the good for
              him, even if the lover may receive nothing from him. Now, since by
              sanctifying grace there is produced in man an act of loving God
              for Himself, the result was that man obtained hope from God by
              means of grace. However, though it is not for one’s own benefit,
              friendship, whereby one loves another for himself, has of course
              many resulting benefits, in the sense that one friend helps
              another as he helps himself. Hence, when one person loves another,
              and knows that he is loved by that other, he must get hope from
              him. Now, by grace man is so established as a lover of God,
              through the love of charity, that he is also instructed by faith
              that he is first loved by God: according to the passage found in 1
              John (4:10): “In this is charity: not as though we had loved God,
              but because He hath first loved us.” It follows, then, from the
              gift of grace that man gets hope from God. It is also clear from
              this that just as hope is a preparation of man for the true love
              of God, so also man is conversely strengthened in hope by charity.

              [3] Again, in every lover there is caused a desire to be united
              with his beloved, in so far as that is possible; as a result, it
              is most enjoyable to live with friends. So, if by grace man is
              made a lover of God, there must be produced in him a desire for
              union with God, according as that is possible. But faith, which is
              caused by grace, makes it clear that the union of man with God in
              the perfect enjoyment in which happiness consists is possible.
              Therefore, the desire for this fruition results in man from the
              love of God. But the desire for anything bothers the soul of the
              desirer, unless there be present some hope of attainment. So, it

              future happiness.

              [4] Besides, if some difficulty should emerge among things ordered
              to a desired end, hope of attaining the end provides solace. For
              instance, a person suffers but slightly from the bitterness of
              medicine because of his hope for good health. But in our process
              of working toward happiness, which is the end of all our desires,
              many difficulties present burdens to be borne, because virtue, by
              which one advances toward happiness, “is concerned with
              difficulties.” Therefore, in order that man may tend toward
              happiness smoothly and readily, it was necessary to provide him
              with the hope of obtaining happiness.

              something possible of attainment, and this is the feeling of hope.
              Therefore, since man is directed toward his ultimate end of
              happiness by grace, it was necessary for the hope of attaining
              happiness to be impressed on man’s power of feeling by means of

              [1] Since man can only know the things that he does not see

              faith is among the things we do not see, the knowledge of the

              [4] This revelation, then, is accomplished by means of a certain
              interior and intelligible light, elevating the mind to the
              perception of things that the understanding cannot reach by its
              natural light. For, just as the understanding by its natural light
              is made certain concerning things that it knows by that light (for
              instance, concerning first principles), so also does it acquire
              certitude concerning things which it apprehends by supernatural
              light. Now, this latter certitude is needed so that the things
              that are grasped by divine revelation may be offered to others,
              for we cannot present things to others with assurance if we have
              not certain knowledge of them. Now, accompanying this light that
              we have mentioned, which illumines the mind from within, there are
              at times in divine revelation other external or internal aids to
              knowledge; for instance, a spoken message, or something heard by
              the external senses which is produced by divine power, or
              something perceived internally through imagination due to God's
              action, or also some things produced by God that are seen by
              bodily vision, or that are internally pictured in the imagination.
              From these presentations, by the light internally impressed on the
              mind, man receives a knowledge of divine things. Consequently,
              without the interior light, these aids do not suffice for a
              knowledge of divine things, but the interior light does suffice
              without them.

              [7] But the things that man knows he cannot properly convey to the
              knowledge of another man, except by speech. So, since those who
              receive a revelation from God, according to the divinely
              established order, should instruct others, it was necessary for
              them also to be given the grace of speech, in keeping with what
              the benefit of those who were to be instructed demanded. Hence, it

              will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall
              not be able to resist and gainsay.” And also for this reason, when
              it was necessary for the truth of the faith to be preached by a
              few men to different peoples, some were divinely instructed to
              “speak with divers tongues,” as is said in Acts (2:4): “They were
              all filled with the Holy Spirit: and they began to speak with

              [8] But because oral teaching that is offered requires
              confirmation so that it may be accepted, unless it be evident in
              itself, and because things that are of faith are not evident to
              human reason, it was necessary for some means to be provided

              diiudicatur ab omnibus: occulta enim cordis eius manifesta fiunt,

              [9] But there was still another way of confirmation, in so far as
              the preachers of truth were found to speak true things about
              hidden events which could be made evident later, so that credit
              was given them as speakers of truths about matters which men were
              not able to experience. Hence, the a gift of prophecy was
              necessary, whereby they might know and reveal to others, through
              God’s revelation, future events and things generally concealed
              from men. Thus, in this way, when they were discovered to tell
              about true events, belief would be accorded them in regard to
              matters of faith. Hence, the Apostle says, in 1 Corinthians
              (14:24-25): “If all prophesy, and an unbeliever or an unlearned
              person comes in, he is convinced by all, he is judged by all; the
              secrets of his heart are made manifest; and so, falling down on
              his face, he will adore God, affirming that God is among you
              indeed.”

              [11] Of course, some contingent future events can also be
              foreknown by men; not, indeed, according as they are future, but
              inasmuch as they pre-exist in their causes. When these latter are
              known, either in themselves or through some of their evident
              effects, which are called signs, a foreknowledge of some future
              effects may be acquired by man. Thus, a physician foreknows future
              death or good health,from the condition of natural strength, which
              he knows from the pulse, the urine, and signs of this kind. Now,
              this kind of knowledge of future matters is partly certain, but
              partly uncertain. In fact, there are some pre-existing causes from
              which future events follow of necessity; for instance, if there be
              a pre-existing composition of contraries in an animal, death
              results necessarily. But, from some pre-existing causes future
              effects do not follow necessarily, but usually. For instance, in
              most cases a perfect human being results from the insemination of
              a mother by a man’s semen; sometimes, however, monsters are
              generated, because of some obstruction which overcomes the
              operation of the natural capacity. So, there is certain
              foreknowledge of the first kind of effects, but of those mentioned
              in the second case there is no infallibly certain foreknowledge.
              However, the foreknowledge that is acquired concerning future
              events from divine revelation, according to prophetic grace, is
              altogether certain, just as divine foreknowledge is also certain.
              Indeed, God does not merely foreknow future events as they are in
              their causes, but infallibly, as they are in themselves, as we
              showed earlier. And so, prophetic knowledge of future things is
              given man in the same way, with perfect certitude. Nor is this
              certitude opposed to the contingency of future events, any more
              than the certitude of divine knowledge is, as we showed above.

              prophets, not as they are in themselves, but as they are in their

              their effects, nothing prevents the prophetic forecast from being
              modified. Thus, Isaiah foretold to the ailing Hezekiah: “take
              order with Your house, for You shall die, and not live” (Is.
              38:1), but be was restored to health; and Jonah the Prophet
              foretold that “after forty days, Nineveh shall be destroyed”
              (Jonah 3:4), Yet it was not overturned. Hence, Isaiah made his
              prophecy of the coming death of Hezekiah according to the order of
              his bodily condition and of the lower causes in relation to this
              result, and Jonah prophesied the disruption of Nineveh according
              to the demands of its merits; however, in both cases, it turned
              out differently, in accord with the working of a free and
              health-giving God.

              event, as to how it is to be modified. For example, the healing of

              [14] But malign spirits strive to corrupt the truth of the faith,
              just as they make bad use of the working of wonders, in order to
              lead to error and weaken the proof of the true faith, even though
              they do not perform miracles in the proper sense, but things that
              appear wonderful to men, as we showed above—so also they abuse
              prophetic prediction, not, of course, prophesying, but foretelling
              certain things according to the order of causes hidden to man, so
              that they seem to know in advance future events in themselves.
              Now, though contingent effects come from natural causes, these
              spirits, as a result of the subtlety of their understanding, can
              know more than men as to when and bow the effects of natural
              causes may be obstructed. So, in foretelling future things, they
              appear to be more astonishing and more truthful than men, no
              matter how learned the latter may be. Of course, among natural
              causes, the highest and farthest removed from our knowledge are
              the powers of,the celestial bodies. That these are known to the
              spirits under discussion, in accord with what is proper to their
              nature, is evident from earlier explanations. Therefore, since all
              lower bodies are controlled through the powers and motions of the
              higher bodies, these spirits are far more able than any astronomer
              to foretell future winds and storms, changing conditions of the
              atmosphere, and other such things which occur in the changing of
              lower bodies as a result of the motion of the higher bodies. Also,
              though celestial bodies can make no impression directly on the
              intellectual part of the soul, as we showed above, a good many men
              follow the impulse of their bodily passions and tendencies, on
              which we have shown that the celestial bodies do have an
              influence. In fact, it is only possible for wise men, of whom the
              number is small, to resist this kind of passion by using their
              reason. So, the result is that many predictions can be made
              concerning man’s acts, although even these spirits fail at times
              in their predictions because of freedom of choice.

              spirits, some people have made efforts to explain the other ways
              in terms of natural causes. They say, in fact, that when a
              celestial body moves toward definite effects in these things here
              below, some signs of the result of the influence of the same body
              appear, because different things receive the celestial influence

              visions in people who are dreaming and in those who are out of
              their mind, and the flight and crying of birds, and the drawing of
              figures, when a person does not deliberate on how many points he
              should draw, are all the results of the influence of a celestial
              body. So, they say that things like these can be the signs of
              future effects that are caused by the motion of the heavens.

              [17] However, since this has little reason, it is better to think
              that the predictions that are made from signs of this kind take
              their origin from some intellectual substance, by whose power the
              aforesaid motions occurring without deliberation are controlled,
              in accord with what befits the observation of future events. And
              while these movements are sometimes controlled by the divine will,
              through the ministry of good spirits, since many things are
              revealed by God through dreams—as to Pharaoh (Gen. 41:25), and to
              Nebuchadnezzar (Dan. 2:28), and “lots that are cast into the lap,
              that are also at times disposed of by the Lord,” as Solomon says
              (Prov. 16:33).Yet most of the time they happen as a result of the
              working of evil spirits, as the holy Doctors say, and as even the
              Gentiles themselves agree. For Maximus Valerius says that the
              practice of auguries and dreams, and that sort of thing, belongs
              to the religion in which idols were worshiped. And so, in the Old
              Law, along with idolatry, all these practices were prohibited.
              Indeed, it is said in Deuteronomy (18:9-11): “beware lest you have
              a mind to imitate the abominations of those nations,” that is,
              those that serve idols; “neither let there be found among you
              anyone who expiates his son or daughter, making them to pass
              through the fire; or who consults soothsayers, or observes dreams
              and omens; neither let there be any wizard nor charmer, nor anyone
              who consults pythonic spirits, or fortune tellers, or who seeks
              the truth from the dead.”

              preached which took place in time, such as the birth of Christ,
              His passion and resurrection, and events of that kind. And lest

              [19] Following the degree of those who receive revelation directly
              from God, another degree of grace is necessary. In fact, since men
              receive revelation from God not only for their own time, but also
              for the instruction of all men that are to come, it was necessary
              that the things revealed to them not only be recounted orally to
              their contemporaries, but also that they be written down for the
              instruction of men to come. Consequently, there had to be some who
              would interpret this kind of writings. Now, this should be a
              divine grace, just as revelation was accomplished by the grace of
              God. Hence, it is said in Genesis (40:8): “Does not interpretation

              In praemissis autem gratiae effectibus consideranda est quaedam

              peccatoribus, qui non sunt Deo grati: sola autem dilectio est

              [24] Among the effects of grace that have been noted above there
              is a difference which must be observed. Though the name grace is
              suitable to all, since it is conferred gratis, without preceding
              merit, only the effect of love is further entitled to the name
              grace by virtue of the fact that it makes one in the good graces
              of God. For it is said in Proverbs (8:17): “I love them that love
              me.” Thus, faith and hope, and other things related to faith, can
              be present in sinners who are not in the good graces of God. But
              love alone is the special gift of the just, for “he who abides in
              charity abides in God, and God in him,” as is said in 1 John
              (4:16).

              Est autem et alia differentia in praedictis effectibus gratiae

            <td>
              [25] Moreover, there is still another difference to be considered
              in the preceding effects of grace. Some of them are necessary
              during the whole life of man, for without them he cannot be saved:
              for example, to believe, hope, love, and obey the commandments of
              God. So, in regard to these effects, there must be certain
              habitual perfections present in men, so that they may perform
              these acts when the occasion demands. But other effects are
              necessary, not for a whole life, but for definite times and
              places; for example, to work miracles, to foretell future events,
              and such actions. So, for these actions habitual perfections are
              not given, but certain impressions are made by God, which cease to
              exist as soon as the act stops, and these impressions have to be
              repeated when the act is again to be repeated. Thus, the mind of
              the Prophet is illumined for each revelation by a new light, and
              in each case of the working of miracles there must be a new
              influence of divine power.

              needs the help of divine grace. But the power of free choice does
              not extend to the effect of final perseverance in the good. This
              is evident as follows. In fact, the power of free choice applies
              to those things which fall within the scope of election. Now, what
              is chosen is some particular operation that can be performed. But
              such a particular operation is what is here and now present.
              Hence, that which falls under the power of free choice is
              something that is to be done now. But to persevere does not mean
              something as now operable, but the continuation of an operation
              throughout time. Now, this effect, of persevering in the good, is
              beyond the power of free choice. Therefore, man needs the help of
              divine grace to persevere in the good.

              [4] Besides, though man is the master of his action through will
              and free choice, he is not the master of his natural powers. So,
              while he is free to will or not to will something, he cannot by
              willing produce such a result that his will, by the very fact of
              willing, would be immovably fixed on what be wills or chooses. But
              this is what is required for perseverance; that is, the will must
              endure immovably in the good. So, perseverance is not within the
              scope of free choice. Therefore, the help of divine grace must be

              [5] Moreover, suppose that there are several agents in succession,

              movements of free choice tending toward the good, successively
              following each other up to the end. So, for this continuation in
              the good, which is perseverance, no one of these movements can be
              the cause, since none of them lasts forever. Nor can all of them

              caused by some higher being. Therefore, man needs the help of

              moved”; and in 2 Thessalonians (2:15-16): “May God, our Father,
              exhort your hearts and confirm you in every work and word.” This
              is also what is asked in the Lord’s Prayer, especially when one
              says, “Your kingdom come”; indeed, the kingdom of God will not
              come for us unless we have persevered in the good. Now it would be
              ridiculous to ask something from God if He were not the giver of
              it. So, man’s perseverance is from God.

              [10] However, we should note that even he who possesses grace asks
              God that he may persevere in the good. just as free choice is not
              sufficient without the external help of God, for this effect of
              persevering in the good, so neither is a habit infused in us
              enough for this purpose. For habits that are divinely infused in
              us during the present state of life do not take away entirely from
              free choice the possibility of being moved toward evil, even
              though free choice is somewhat fixed in the good by means of them.
              And so, when we say that man needs the help of grace to persevere
              unto the end, we do not understand that, in addition to habitual
              grace previously infused to assure good operation, another must
              further be infused for persevering; what we do understand is that,
              once possessed of all the gratuitous habits, a man still needs the
              help of divine providence externally governing him.

              [6] Furthermore, among the works of God, none is futile, as none
              is futile among the works of nature, for nature gets this
              characteristic from God. Now, it would be futile for something to
              be moved if it could not reach the end of its motion. It must be,
              then, that what is naturally moved toward an end is able to come
              to that end. But, after man has fallen into sin, for as long as he
              continues in the present state of life, there remains in him an
              aptitude to be moved toward the good. The signs of this are the
              desire for the good and sorrow for evil which still continue in
              man after sin. So, it is possible for man to again return after
              sin to the good which grace works in man.

              peccati.

            <td>
              [1] Since man cannot return to one member of a pair of contraries
              without moving away from the other extreme, he must, in order to
              return to the state of rectitude by means of grace, move away from
              the sin whereby he had swerved from rectitude. And because man is
              chiefly directed toward the ultimate end, and also turned away
              from it, through his will, it is not only necessary for man to
              abandon sin in the external act, but also to renounce it in his
              will, for the purpose of rising again from sin. Now, man renounces
              sin in his will provided he repents his past sin and forms the
              intention of avoiding it in the future. So, it is necessary that a
              man who is rising again from sin both repent for past sin and
              intend to avoid future sin. Indeed, if he would not make up his
              mind to refrain from sin, then sin in itself would not be against
              his will. But, if he did will to refrain from sin, but was not
              sorry for past sin, then this sin that he had committed would not
              be against his will. Now, the movement whereby one moves away from
              something is contrary to the movement whereby one approaches it;
              thus, whitening is contrary to blackening. Consequently, the will
              must abandon sin by moving in a contrary direction from those
              movements whereby it was inclined toward sin. Now, it was inclined
              toward sin by appetition and enjoyment in regard to lower things.
              Therefore, it must move away from sin by means of certain penances
              whereby it suffers some injury because of the sin that it has
              committed. For, just as the will was drawn toward consent to the
              sin by means of pleasure, so is it strengthened in the detestation
              of sin by means of penances.

              God’s justice, to some penalty for the sin that he has committed.
              Now, if he imposes this penalty on himself by his own will, he is
              said to make satisfaction to God by this: inasmuch as he attains

              punishing himself for the sin, which order he had transgressed by
              sinning through following his own will. But, if he does not exact

              providence cannot remain disordered, this penalty will be
              inflicted on him by God. Such a punishment is not called one of
              satisfaction, since it is not due to the choice of the one who
              suffers it; but it will be called purificatory, because through
              being punished by another he will be cleansed, as it were, until
              whatever disorder there was in him is brought back to proper
              order. Hence, there is this statement of the Apostle in 1
              Corinthians (11:31-32): “if we would judge ourselves, we should
              not be judged, but whilst we are judged, we are chastised by the
              Lord, that we be not condemned with this world.”

              [6] It should be kept in mind, however, that when the mind is
              turned away from sin the displeasure with sin can be so forceful,
              and the attachment of the mind to God so strong, that no
              obligation to punishment will remain. For, as may be gathered from
              things said earlier, the punishment that a person suffers after
              the remission of sin is necessary so that the mind may adhere more
              firmly to the good; since man is chastised by punishments, these
              punishments are, then, like remedies. It is also necessary so that
              the order of justice may be observed, in the sense that he who has
              sinned must stand the penalty. But love for God is enough to set
              the mind of man firmly in the direction of the good, especially if
              this love be strong; and displeasure for a past fault, when
              intense, brings great sorrow. Consequently, through the strength
              of one’s love for God, and of one’s hatred of past sin, there is
              removed the need for punishments of satisfaction or of
              purification. Moreover, if this strength be not great enough to
              set aside punishments entirely, nevertheless, the stronger it is,
              the smaller will be the punishment that suffices.

              [7] “But the things that we can accomplish through the efforts of
              our friends we seem to do ourselves,” for friendship makes two
              persons one in love, and especially in the love of charity. And
              so, just as a person can make satisfaction to God by himself, so
              also can he do it through another person, especially in case of
              necessity. Indeed, the punishment that a friend suffers for
              oneself one regards as if it were suffered by oneself. Thus, one
              does not escape punishment provided one suffer along with a
              suffering friend—and all the more so, the more one is the cause of
              his suffering. Besides, the love of charity in the person who
              suffers for a friend makes his satisfaction more acceptable to God
              than if he suffered for himself, for in the one case it is
              prompted by charity; in the other, by necessity. It may be taken
              from this that one person can make satisfaction for another
              provided both abide in charity. Hence, the Apostle says in
              Galatians (6:2): “Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so you shall
              fulfill the law of Christ.”

              [1]I As we gather from the foregoing, since one cannot be directed
              to the ultimate end except by means of divine grace, without which
              no one can possess the things needed to work toward the ultimate
              end, such as faith, hope, love, and perseverance, it might seem to
              some person that man should not be held responsible for the lack
              of such aids. Especially so, since he cannot merit the help of
              divine grace, nor turn toward God unless God convert him, for no
              one is held responsible for what depends on another. Now, if this
              is granted, many inappropriate conclusions appear. In fact, it
              follows that he who has neither faith, hope, nor love of God, nor
              perseverance in the good, is not deserving of punishment; whereas,
              it is clearly stated in John (3:36): “He who does not believe the
              Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.” And
              since no one reaches final happiness without the aids that we have
              mentioned, it follows that there are certain men who neither
              attain happiness nor suffer punishment from God. The contrary of
              this is shown from the statement in Matthew (25:34, 41) that to
              all who are present at the divine judgment, it will be said:
              “Come... possess you the kingdom prepared for you” or “Depart...
              into everlasting fire.”

              [2] To settle this difficulty, we ought to consider that, although
              one may neither merit in advance nor call forth divine grace by a
              movement of his free choice, he is able to prevent himself from
              receiving this grace: Indeed, it is said in Job(21:34): “Who have
              said to God: Depart from us, we desire not the knowledge of Your
              ways”; and in Job (24:13): “They have been rebellious to the
              light.” And since this ability to impede or not to impede the
              reception of divine grace is within the scope of free choice, not
              undeservedly is responsibility for the fault imputed to him who
              offers an impediment to the reception of grace. In fact, as far as
              He is concerned, God is ready to give grace to all; “indeed He
              wills all men to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the
              truth,” as is said in 1 Timothy (2:4).But those alone are deprived
              of grace who offer an obstacle within themselves to grace; just
              as, while the sun is shining on the world, the man who keeps his
              eyes closed is held responsible for his fault, if as a result some
              evil follows, even though he could not see unless he were provided
              in advance with light from the sun.

              Indeed, whenever man’s mind swerves away from the state of
              rectitude it is evident that he has departed from the order of his
              proper end. So, what should be the most important thing in his
              affection, the ultimate end, becomes a less important object of
              love than that object to which his mind is inordinately turned, as
              if to an ultimate end. So, whenever anything comes up that is in
              agreement with the inordinate end but incompatible with his proper
              end, it will be chosen, unless he is brought back to his proper
              end, so that be favors the proper end above all things, and this
              is the effect of grace. However, in so far as he chooses something
              that is incompatible with his ultimate end, he offers an
              impediment to grace, for grace gives the direction to the end. It
              is consequently obvious that after sin a man cannot refrain from
              all sin during the period preceding his being brought back to the
              proper order by grace.

              [2] Besides, when the mind is inclined toward some object it does
              not stand in a relation of impartiality toward contrary
              alternatives, but, instead, is more favorable to the object to
              which it is inclined. But unless it be drawn away from it by a
              certain concern arising from rational examination, the mind
              chooses the object to which it is more favorable; hence, in sudden
              actions, an indication of one’s inner state of character may be

              continually to maintain such vigilance that it can make a rational
              investigation of whatever he ought to will or do. Thus, it follows
              that the mind at times chooses what it is inclined to, provided
              the inclination be undisturbed, And so, if it be inclined toward

              Unde apparet stulta Pelagianorum opinio, qui dicebant hominem in

              avoid sin, without grace. The contrary to this is apparent from
              the petition in the Psalm (70:9): “When my strength shall fail, do
              not forsake me.” And the Lord teaches us to pray: “And lead us not

              [1] Now, although the man who sins puts an impediment in the way
              of grace, and as far as the order of things requires he ought not
              to receive grace, yet, since God can act apart from the order
              implanted in things, as He does when He gives sight to the blind
              or life to the dead—at times, out of the abundance of His
              goodness, He offers His help in advance, even to those who put an
              impediment in the way of grace, turning them away from evil and
              toward the good. And just as He does not enlighten all the blind,
              or heal all who are infirm, in order that the working of His power
              may be evident in the case of those whom He heals, and in the case
              of the others the order of nature may be observed, so also, He
              does not assist with His help all who impede grace, so that they
              may be turned away from evil and toward the good, but only some,
              in whom He desires His mercy to appear, so that the order of
              justice may be manifested in the other cases. Hence, the Apostle
              says, in Romans (9:22-23): “What if God, willing to show His wrath
              and to make His power known, endured with much patience vessels of
              wrath, fitted for destruction, that He might show the riches of
              His glory on the vessels of mercy which He has prepared unto
              glory?”

              [2] However, while God does indeed, in regard to men who are held

              while He suffers others or permits them to go ahead in accord with
              the order of things—there is no reason to ask why He converts the
              former and not the latter. For this depends on His will alone;
              just as it resulted from His simple will that, while all things
              were made from nothing, some were made of higher degree than

              some vessels for noble uses and others for ignoble purposes.
              Hence, the Apostle says, in Romans (9:21): “Or does not the potter
              have power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto

              also external guardianship, whereby the occasions of sinning are
              taken away from man by divine providence and whereby provocations
              to sin are suppressed. God also helps man in opposing sin by the
              natural light of reason and by the other natural goods which He
              accords man. So, when He takes away these aids from some,
              according to the merit of their action, as His justice demands, He
              is said to harden or to blind them, or to do any of the other
              things mentioned.

              Quia ergo ostensum est quod divina operatione aliqui diriguntur in
              ultimum finem per gratiam adiuti, aliqui vero, eodem auxilio
              gratiae deserti, ab ultimo fine decidunt; omnia autem quae a Deo
              aguntur, ab aeterno per eius sapientiam provisa et ordinata sunt,
              ut supra ostensum est: necesse est praedictam hominum
              distinctionem ab aeterno a Deo esse ordinatam. Secundum ergo quod
              quosdam ab aeterno praeordinavit ut dirigendos in ultimum finem,
              dicitur eos praedestinasse. Unde apostolus dicit ad Ephes. 1-5:
              qui praedestinavit nos in adoptionem filiorum, secundum propositum
              voluntatis suae. Illos autem quibus ab aeterno disposuit se
              gratiam non daturum, dicitur reprobasse, vel odio habuisse:
              secundum illud quod habetur Malach. 1-2 Iacob dilexi, Esau odio
              habui. Ratione vero ipsius distinctionis, secundum quod quosdam
              reprobavit et quosdam praedestinavit, attenditur divina electio:
              de qua dicitur Ephes. 1-4: elegit nos in ipso ante mundi
              constitutionem.

              [1] So, since we have shown that some men are directed by divine
              working to their ultimate end as aided by grace, while others who
              are deprived of the same help of grace fall short of their
              ultimate end, and since all things that are done by God are
              foreseen and ordered from eternity by His wisdom, as we showed
              above, the aforementioned differentiation of men must be ordered
              by God from eternity. According, then, as He has preordained some
              men from eternity, so that they are directed to their ultimate
              end, He is said to have predestined them. Hence, the Apostle says,
              in Ephesians (1:5): “Who predestinated us unto the adoption of
              children... according to the purpose of His will.” On the other
              hand, those to whom He has decided from eternity not to give His
              grace He is said to have reprobated or to have hated, in accord
              with what we find in Malachi (1:2-3): “I have loved Jacob, but
              have hated Esau.” By reason of this distinction, according to
              which He has reprobated some and predestined others, we take note
              of divine election, which is mentioned in Ephesians (1:4): “He
              chose us in Him, before the foundation of the world.”

              Sic igitur patet quod praedestinatio et electio et reprobatio est
              quaedam pars divinae providentiae, secundum quod homines ex divina
              providentia ordinantur in ultimum finem. Unde per eadem manifestum
              esse potest quod praedestinatio et electio necessitatem non
              inducunt, quibus et supra ostensum est quod divina providentia
              contingentiam a rebus non aufert.

              [2] Thus, it appears that predestination, election, and
              reprobation constitute a certain section of divine providence,
              according as men are ordered to their ultimate end by divine
              providence. Hence, it is possible to show that predestination and
              election impose no necessity, by the same reasoning whereby we
              showed above that divine providence does not take away contingency
              from things.

              Quod autem praedestinatio et electio causam non habent ex

              hoc quod gratia Dei, quae est praedestinationis effectus, meritis
              non praevenitur, sed omnia merita praecedit humana, ut ostensum
              est: sed etiam manifestari potest ex hoc quod divina voluntas et

              esse causa voluntatis et providentiae divinae, licet effectuum

              [3] Moreover, that predestination and election do not find their
              cause in any human merits can be made clear, not only from the
              fact that God’s grace which is the effect of predestination is not
              preceded by merits but rather precedes all human merits, as we
              showed, but it can also be shown from this, that the divine will
              and providence is the first cause of things that are done, but
              that there can be no cause of the divine will and providence,
              although, among the effects of providence, and likewise of
              predestination, one may be the cause of another.
