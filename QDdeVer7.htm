                          Quia Apocal. cap. XX, 12, super illud: alius liber
                          apertus est, qui est vitae, Glossa: id est Christus,
                          qui tunc apparebit potens, et suis dabit vitam. Sed
                          Christus in iudicio apparebit in forma humana, quae
                          non est aliquid increatum. Ergo liber vitae nihil
                          increatum dicit.

                          1. Explaining that line in the Apocalypse (20:12),
                          “and another book was opened, which was the book of
                          life,” the Gloss says: “The book of life is Christ,
                          who will then appear in His power and give life to His
                          own.”’ Now, at the final judgment, Christ will appear
                          in human form, which is not something uncreated.
                          Consequently, the book of life does not mean anything
                          uncreated.

                              Praeterea, Gregorius in moralibus dicit, quod
                              liber vitae dicitur ipse iudex venturus: quia
                              quisquis eum viderit, mox cuncta quae fecit, ad
                              memoriam revocabit. Sed Christo datum est iudicium
                              secundum humanam naturam, ut patet Ioannis cap. V,
                              vers. 27: potestatem dedit ei iudicium facere,
                              quia filius hominis est. Ergo Christus secundum
                              humanam naturam est liber vitae; et sic idem quod
                              prius.

                              2. Gregory says: “Our future judge Himself is
                              called the book of life, because whoever sees Him
                              will at once remember all he has done. Now,
                              judgment has been given to Christ as man. This is
                              clear from the words of John (5:2 7): “And he has
                              given him power to do judgment, because he is the
                              son of man.” Therefore, Christ as man is the book
                              of life, and the same must be said as before.

                                  Praeterea, liber dicitur ex hoc quod est
                                  receptivus Scripturae. Sed receptivum dicitur
                                  aliquid ex potentia materiali, quae in Deo
                                  esse non potest. Ergo liber vitae non dicit
                                  aliquid increatum.

                                  3. A thing is called a book because it has
                                  received writing. But a thing is said to be
                                  receptive in so far as it contains material
                                  potency, which cannot exist in God. Therefore,
                                  nothing uncreated is called the book of life.

                                      Praeterea, liber, cum importet quamdam
                                      collectionem, designat distinctionem et
                                      differentiam. Sed in natura increata, quae
                                      est simplicissima, nulla diversitas
                                      invenitur. Ergo liber ibi dici non potest.

                                      4. Since <i>book</i> means a kind of
                                      collection, it signifies distinction and
                                      difference. But, being most simple, an
                                      uncreated nature contains no diversity.
                                      Therefore, nothing in such a nature can be
                                      called a book.

                                          leguntur. Ideae autem quibus Deus res
                                          cognoscit, non sunt aliud quam divina
                                          essentia. Ergo ipsa natura increata
                                          liber dici non potest.

                                          5. In every book, the writing is
                                          something other than the book. Now,
                                          the writing in a book is made up of
                                          figures, and by means of these we know
                                          the things which are read in the book.
                                          However, the ideas by which God knows
                                          things do not differ from the divine
                                          essence. Consequently, His uncreated
                                          nature cannot be called a book.

                                              6. But it was said that even
                                              though there is no real difference
                                              in the divine nature, there is
                                              nevertheless a conceptual
                                              difference.—On the contrary, a
                                              merely conceptual difference
                                              exists only in our mind.
                                              Consequently, if the difference
                                              which this book involves is only a
                                              conceptual difference, the book of
                                              life must exist only in our
                                              intellects, and hence will not be
                                              something uncreated.

                                                  be God’s knowledge of those
                                                  who are to be saved. Moreover,
                                                  the knowledge of the elect is
                                                  contained in God’s knowledge
                                                  of vision. Now, since the soul
                                                  of Christ sees in the Word all
                                                  the things that God knows with
                                                  His knowledge of vision, it
                                                  seems that it also knows the
                                                  number of the elect and all
                                                  those who have been chosen.
                                                  Therefore, the soul of Christ
                                                  can be called the book of
                                                  life; hence, the book of life
                                                  means something created.

                                                      (24:32): “All these are

                                                      the Gloss on this passage
                                                      adds: “That is, the new
                                                      and old testament.” Now,

                          In Psalm. enim XXXIX, 9, dicitur: in capite libri
                          scriptum est de me; Glossa: apud patrem, qui est caput
                          mei. Sed nihil habet caput in divinis nisi quod habet
                          principium; quod autem habet principium, in divinis
                          dicitur personaliter. Ergo liber vitae personaliter
                          dicitur.

                          1. In the Psalms (39:8) we read: “In the head of the
                          book it is written of me...” and the Gloss explains:
                          “That is, in the Father, who is my head.” Now, in God
                          nothing has a head except that which has a principle.
                          But <i>that which has a Principle</i> is a personal
                          predicate in matters pertaining to God. Therefore, the
                          book of life is a personal predication.

                              procedentem, ita et liber, quia Scriptura libri a
                              scriptore procedit. Sed verbum, ratione praedicta,
                              dicitur personaliter in divinis. Ergo et liber

                              2. just as word signifies knowledge proceeding
                              from another, <i>book</i> also signifies this,
                              because the writing in a book proceeds from a
                              writer. Now, for the reason already given, word is
                              predicated personally of God. Consequently, the
                              book of life is also a personal predication.

                                  Sed dicebat, quod verbum importat processum
                                  realem, liber autem vitae processum rationis
                                  tantum.- Sed contra, nos non possumus nominare
                                  Deum nisi ex his quae apud nos sunt. Sed sicut
                                  apud nos verbum procedit a prolatore realiter
                                  distinctum ab eo, ita et liber a scriptore.
                                  Ergo eadem ratione utrumque importabit in
                                  divinis distinctionem realem.

                                  3. It was said, however, that word implies a
                                  real procession, whereas <i>book</i> implies a
                                  procession only according to our way of
                                  understanding.—On the contrary, we can name
                                  God only from the things that exist here
                                  below. But, in our experience, a word coming
                                  from a speaker is really distinct from him,
                                  and so is a book really distinct from its
                                  author. For this reason, therefore, both terms
                                  imply a real distinction in God.

                                      vocis. Si ergo verbum divinum, quod
                                      sumitur ad similitudinem verbi cordis, ut
                                      Augustinus dicit, realiter distinguitur a

                                      Scripturam importat.

                                      4. There is greater distance between one
                                      who speaks and his oral word than there is
                                      between him and the word within his heart;
                                      and an even greater distance is between
                                      him and a written word signifying the word
                                      within his heart. Consequently, if the
                                      divine Word, which, as Augustine says,
                                      resembles the word within the heart, is
                                      really distinct from the one who utters
                                      it, much more distinct will be a book,
                                      since this implies writing.

                          1. The book of life pertains to life. But life is
                          attributed in Scripture to the Holy Spirit, as, for
                          example, in John (6:64): “It is the spirit that
                          quickens.” Hence, the book of life should be
                          appropriated to the Holy Spirit, not to the Son.

                              patet in Psalmo XXXIX, 9: in capite libri scriptum
                              est de me. Ergo patri appropriari debet nomen

                              2. In everything, the beginning is the most
                              important. But the Father is called the head or
                              the beginning of the book, as is clear in the
                              Psalms (39:8), where we read: “In the head of the
                              book it is written of me...” Therefore, the term
                              <i>book</i> should be appropriated to the Father.

                                  proper nature of a book. Now, a thing is said
                                  to be written in the memory; hence, the memory
                                  has the nature of a book. But memory is
                                  appropriated to the Father, just as
                                  intelligence is to the Son, and will is to the
                                  Holy Spirit. Consequently, the book of life
                                  should be appropriated to the Father.

                                      4. The Father is the head of the book.
                                      But, as we read in the Psalms (39:8), in
                                      the head of the book there is writing
                                      about the Son. Consequently, the Father is
                                      the book of the Son. Therefore, the book
                                      [of life] should be appropriated to the
                                      Father.

                                              1. Augustine says that the book of
                                              life is God’s foreknowledge. But
                                              knowledge is appropriated to the
                                              Son: “...Christ, the power of God
                                              and the wisdom of God” (1
                                              Corinthians 1:24). Therefore, the
                                              book of life is also appropriated
                                              to the Son.

                                                          Holy Spirit, who
                                                          proceeds as love,
                                                          because goodness is
                                                          the object of love,
                                                          and so is appropriated
                                                          to the Holy Spirit.
                                                          Again, power is
                                                          appropriated to the
                                                          Father because power
                                                          as such is a

                                                          divinity is proper to
                                                          the Father. Similarly,

                                                          proper to the Son,
                                                          since the Son proceeds

                          Augustinus enim dicit, quod liber vitae est
                          praedestinatio eorum quibus debetur vita aeterna.

                          1. Augustine says’ that the book of life is the
                          predestination of those to whom eternal life is due.

                              cognoscimus. Sed idem est effectus
                              praedestinationis et libri vitae, scilicet finalis
                              gratia et gloria. Ergo idem est praedestinatio,
                              quod liber vitae.

                              2.We know God’s attributes through their effects.
                              But the effect of predestination is the same as
                              that of the book of life, namely, final grace and
                              glory. Therefore, predestination and the book of
                              life are the same.

                                  dictum. Sed liber vitae dicitur metaphorice in
                                  divinis ut ex dictis patet. Ergo oportet ad
                                  aliquid proprie dictum reducere. Sed non
                                  potest ad aliud reduci quam ad
                                  praedestinationem. Ergo liber vitae est idem

                                  3. Whatever is predicated metaphorically of
                                  God should be reduced to what is predicated
                                  literally. Now, the book of life is predicated
                                  metaphorically of God, as is clear from what
                                  has been said. Therefore, it should be reduced
                                  to something predicated literally of Him.
                                  However, it cannot be reduced to anything else
                                  except predestination. Therefore, the book of
                                  life is the same as predestination.

                                          1. A thing is called a book because
                                          something is written in it. But the
                                          notion of writing does not pertain to
                                          predestination. Consequently,
                                          predestination and the book of life
                                          are not the same.

                                              praedestinatio autem importat.
                                              Ergo praedestinatio non est idem
                                              cum libro vitae.

                                              2. A book, of its very nature,
                                              implies no causality regarding the
                                              things to which it is referred.
                                              Predestination, however, implies
                                              causality. Therefore, it is not
                                              the same as the book of life.

                                                      As is clear from what has
                                                      been said previously,
                                                      <i>the book of life</i> is
                                                      used of God because of its
                                                      resemblance to the
                                                      document which directs a
                                                      chief of state in
                                                      admitting persons to and
                                                      excluding them from
                                                      citizenship. Now, this
                                                      document lies between two
                                                      operations, for it is
                                                      subsequent to the decision
                                                      of the head of the state,
                                                      who selects those whom he
                                                      wishes to admit in
                                                      preference to those whom
                                                      he excludes, and it is
                                                      anterior to the admission
                                                      or exclusion. Moreover,
                                                      this document is merely a
                                                      kind of representation of
                                                      his antecedent decision.
                                                      Similarly, the book of
                                                      life is also nothing more
                                                      than an inscription in the
                                                      divine mind of God’s
                                                      predestination, for by
                                                      this act of predestining
                                                      God predetermines who are
                                                      to be admitted to the life
                                                      of glory. Moreover, His
                                                      knowledge of this
                                                      predestination is always
                                                      with Him; and His
                                                      knowledge that He has
                                                      predestined some is, as it

                                                      written in Him as in a
                                                      book of life.

                          Quia, ut Augustinus dicit, liber vitae est notitia
                          Dei. Sed Deus sicut cognoscit vitam alienam, ita
                          cognoscit suam. Ergo liber vitae respicit etiam vitam
                          increatam.

                          1. As Augustine says, the book of life is God’s
                          knowledge. But God knows His own life, just as He
                          knows that of others. Consequently, the book of life
                          concerns uncreated life also.

                              Praeterea, liber vitae est repraesentativus vitae.
                              Sed non vitae creatae: primum enim non
                              repraesentat secundum, sed e converso. Ergo liber
                              vitae est repraesentativus vitae increatae.
                            </td>
                            <td>
                              2. The book of life represents life, but not
                              created life; for what is first does not represent
                              what is second, but what is second represents what
                              is first. Consequently, the book of life
                              represents uncreated life.

                                  Praeterea, quod de pluribus dicitur, de uno
                                  per prius, de alio per posterius dictum,
                                  simpliciter intelligitur de eo quod per prius
                                  dicitur. Sed vita per prius de Deo dicitur
                                  quam de creaturis, quia eius vita omnis vitae
                                  est origo, ut ostendit Dionysius de divinis
                                  Nomin. Ergo cum in libro vitae, vita
                                  simpliciter nominetur, intelligi debet de vita
                                  increata.

                                  3. What is predicated of several, but
                                  predicated primarily of one and secondarily of
                                  the others, is understood simply in its
                                  primary predication. Now, life is predicated
                                  primarily of God rather than of creatures,
                                  because His life, as Dionysius has shown, is
                                  the origin of all life. Therefore, since
                                  <i>life is</i> used simply in the phrase
                                  <i>the book of life,</i> it should be
                                  understood as referring to uncreated life.

                                      figuris quibusdam repraesentet. Sed filius
                                      dicitur figura patris, ut patet Hebr. I,
                                      3. Ergo et filius potest dici liber
                                      respectu vitae patris.

                                      4. Just as a book implies a
                                      representation, so also does a figure,
                                      especially when a book represents
                                      something by means of figures. But the Son
                                      is said to be the <i>figure</i> of the
                                      Father (Hebrews 1:3). Therefore He can be
                                      said to be a book with respect to the life
                                      of the Father.

                                          scribitur de filio, iuxta illud in
                                          Psalmo XXXIX, 9: in capite libri
                                          scriptum est de me. Vita autem filii
                                          est increata. Ergo liber vitae potest
                                          respicere vitam increatam.

                                          5. Book is predicated as being in a
                                          relation to that about which the book
                                          is written. But the Son is written
                                          about in the book of life, for we read
                                          in the Psalms (39:8): “In the head of
                                          the book it is written of me...” Now,
                                          the life of the Son is not created.
                                          Hence, the book of life is concerned
                                          with uncreated life.

                                              there cannot be identical in

                                              creature is a book revealing God.
                                              Therefore, God cannot be a book

                                              book of life can be spoken of only
                                              in relation to uncreated life.

                                                  predicated primarily of the
                                                  divine essence rather than of
                                                  a creature, because, by
                                                  uttering Himself, the Father
                                                  utters all creatures.
                                                  Consequently, the book of life
                                                  is primarily concerned with
                                                  uncreated life rather than
                                                  with created life.

                          1. Natural life, as well as the life of glory, is
                          represented in God’s knowledge. Now, God’s knowledge
                          of the life of glory is called the book of life.
                          Therefore, His knowledge of natural life should be
                          similarly called.

                              Praeterea, divina notitia continet omnia per modum
                              vitae; quia, ut dicitur Ioan. I, 3, quod factum
                              est, in ipso vita erat. Ergo debet dici liber
                              vitae respectu omnium, et maxime viventium.

                            <td>
                              2. God’s knowledge contains all things according
                              to the manner of life, because we read in John
                              (1:3-4): “What was made, in Him was life...”
                              Therefore, His knowledge should be called the book
                              of life with respect to all things, especially
                              living things.

                                  vitam gloriae dicitur liber vitae, ut dictum
                                  est prius. Ergo et notitia praeordinationis ad
                                  vitam naturae dicitur liber vitae.

                                  3. Just as a person is preordained by God’s
                                  providence to the life of glory, so is he also
                                  preordained to natural life. Now, as mentioned
                                  previously, the knowledge of those preordained
                                  to the life of glory is called the book of
                                  life. Therefore, the knowledge of those
                                  preordained to natural life also is called the
                                  book of life.

                                      Praeterea, Apoc. III, 5, super illud: non

                                      dicitur respectu omnium; et ita etiam
                                      respectu vitae naturae.

                                      4. In its explanation of that verse in the
                                      Apocalypse (3:5), “I will not blot out his
                                      name out of the book of life,” the Gloss
                                      reads: “The book of life is God’s
                                      knowledge, in which all things are clear.”
                                      Consequently, the book of life is said to
                                      concern all things, hence, even natural
                                      life.

                                          cognoscatur vita naturae. Ergo liber

                                          naturae.

                                          5. The book of life is, as it were,
                                          knowledge of the life of glory. But
                                          the life of glory cannot be known
                                          unless natural life is also known.
                                          Therefore, the book of life likewise
                                          concerns natural life.

                                              magis respicit vitam naturae quam
                                              gloriae.

                                              6. The word <i>life</i> has been
                                              taken from natural life and
                                              applied to the life of glory. Now,
                                              a thing is said more truly of that
                                              of which it is said properly than
                                              of that to which it is merely
                                              applied. Therefore, the book of
                                              life concerns natural life more
                                              than it concerns the life of
                                              glory.

                                                  common is more noble. Now,
                                                  natural life is more permanent
                                                  than the life of glory or of
                                                  grace. Similarly, it is more
                                                  common, because natural life
                                                  continues with the life of
                                                  grace or of glory; but the
                                                  opposite is not true.
                                                  Therefore, natural life is
                                                  more noble than the life of
                                                  grace and glory. Hence, the
                                                  book of life concerns the life
                                                  of nature more than it
                                                  concerns the life of grace or
                                                  of glory.

                                                          the book of life is,

                          Quia quod est in effectu, nobilius invenitur in causa,
                          ut patet per Dionysium in libro de divinis nominibus.
                          Sed gloria est effectus gratiae. Ergo vita gratiae est
                          nobilior quam vita gloriae; ergo liber vitae
                          principalius respicit vitam gratiae quam vitam
                          gloriae.

                        <td>
                          1. As is evident from what Dionysius has written, what
                          is in the effect is found in a nobler manner in the
                          cause. Now, glory is the effect of grace.
                          Consequently, the life of grace is more noble than the
                          life of glory. Hence, the book of life concerns the
                          life of grace more than it does the life of glory.

                              5 huius quaest. dictum est. Sed praedestinatio est
                              communiter praeparatio gratiae et gloriae. Ergo et
                              liber vitae utramque vitam communiter respicit.

                            <td>
                              2. As mentioned earlier, the book of life is the
                              enrollment of those who are predestined. But
                              predestination, in general, is the preparation of
                              grace and glory. Therefore, the book of life
                              concerns, in general, the life of grace as well as
                              the life of glory.

                                  3. The book of life designates certain persons
                                  as citizens of that city in which there is
                                  life. But, just as some are made citizens of
                                  the heavenly Jerusalem through the life of
                                  glory, so some are made citizens of the Church
                                  militant through the life of grace. Therefore,
                                  the book of life concerns the life of grace as
                                  well as the life of glory.

                                      4. What is predicated of many is
                                      understood as predicated without
                                      qualification of that of which it is
                                      predicated first. Now, the life of grace
                                      is prior to the life of glory. Therefore,

                                      grace.

                                              grace. Therefore, the book of life
                                              is not concerned simply with the
                                              life of grace.

                                                  life of glory is the end of
                                                  grace. Therefore, it is more
                                                  noble. Consequently, when used
                                                  without qualification,
                                                  <i>life</i> should be

                                                          in something. Now, a
                                                          thing is said to be a
                                                          possession, properly
                                                          speaking, when it can
                                                          be had at one’s
                                                          command; and such a
                                                          thing has no defects.
                                                          Consequently, the
                                                          Philosopher says that
                                                          knowledge had about
                                                          God “is not a human
                                                          possession” but
                                                          divine, because only
                                                          God knows Himself
                                                          perfectly, while man’s
                                                          knowledge of God is
                                                          necessarily defective.
                                                          Thus, life will be had
                                                          as a possession when
                                                          through life all the
                                                          defects opposed to
                                                          life are excluded.
                                                          Now, this is what the
                                                          life of glory does; it
                                                          excludes all death,
                                                          spiritual as well as
                                                          physical, so that
                                                          there remains not even
                                                          the possibility of
                                                          dying. The life of
                                                          grace does not do
                                                          this. Consequently,
                                                          the book of life does
                                                          not concern the life
                                                          of grace without
                                                          qualification, but
                                                          only the life of
                                                          glory.

                          Luc. X, 20, super illud: gaudete, quia nomina vestra
                          etc., dicit Glossa: si quis caelestia sive terrestria
                          opera gesserit, per haec quasi litteris annotatus apud
                          Dei memoriam aeternaliter est affixus. Sed sicut per
                          opera caelestia, quae sunt opera iustitiae, aliquis
                          ordinatur ad vitam; ita per opera terrestria, quae
                          sunt opera peccati, aliquis ordinatur ad mortem. Ergo
                          sicut in Deo est conscriptio ordinata ad vitam, ita
                          est ibi conscriptio ordinata ad mortem; ergo sicut in
                          Deo dicitur liber vitae, ita debet ibi dici liber
                          mortis.

                          1. In its comment on Luke (10:20), “Rejoice in this,
                          that your names are written...,” the Gloss reads: “By
                          means of his heavenly or earthly deeds, a person is,
                          as it were, engraved on God’s memory forever.”’ Now,
                          just as a person is ordained to life through heavenly
                          deeds, that is, through works of justice, so is he
                          also ordained to death through earthly deeds, that is,
                          through works of sin. Hence, as there is in God an
                          enrollment of those ordained to life, so is there also
                          in Him an enrollment of those ordained to death.
                          Consequently, just as there is said to be a book of
                          life in God, so should there also be said to be in Him
                          a book of death.

                              praemia, ita etiam poenas et supplicia. Ergo et

                              2. The book of life is said to be in God only
                              inasmuch as He has a list of those for whom He has
                              prepared an eternal reward—a list resembling that
                              which a ruler on earth has, containing the names
                              of those whom he has decided to honor. But a ruler
                              on earth has a list of punishments and tortures as
                              well as a list of honors and rewards. Therefore,
                              God also has a book of death.

                                  also know His reprobation by which He prepares
                                  others for death. Now, the knowledge which God
                                  has of His predestination is called the book
                                  of life, as mentioned earlier. Therefore, His
                                  knowledge of reprobation should be called the
                                  book of death.

                                          Secundum Dionysium in libro de divinis

                                          According to Dionysius, “We should not
                                          venture to say anything about God
                                          unless we can support what we are
                                          saying from Scripture.” Now, we do not
                                          find anything in Scripture that refers
                                          to a book of death as it refers to the
                                          book of life. Therefore, we should not
                                          affirm the existence of a book of
                                          death.

                                                      Now, there are two kinds

                                                      namely, knowledge of
                                                      simple understanding and
                                                      knowledge of approval. His
                                                      knowledge of simple
                                                      understanding concerns all
                                                      things, both the good and
                                                      the evil; but His
                                                      knowledge of approval
                                                      concerns only the good.
                                                      Hence, the good are known
                                                      to God in a more special
                                                      way than the others; and
                                                      for this reason they are
                                                      said to be written in a
                                                      book, while the evil are
                                                      not. Consequently, a book
                                                      of death is not spoken of
                                                      as the book of life is.
