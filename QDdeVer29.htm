              1. By created grace a man is said to be an adopted son of God. But
              according to the saints’ Christ was not an adopted son. He
              therefore did not have created grace.

              2. Where there is a union of one thing with another through its
              essence, there is no need of union through a likeness. Thus for
              knowledge there is required a union of the knower with the thing
              known; and yet when things are in the soul through their essence,
              in order to be known they do not need to be in the soul through a
              likeness. But God is really united to the soul of Christ by His
              essence in the unity of the person. There is consequently no need
              of His being united to it through grace, that is, through a
              likeness.

              Praeterea, ad ea quae possumus per nostra naturalia, non indigemus
              gratia. Sed Christus poterat pervenire ad gloriam per id quod erat
              sibi naturale: est enim filius naturalis; et si filius, et haeres.
              Cum ergo gratia infundatur mentibus ad consequendam gloriam,
              videtur quod Christus gratia creata non indiguerit.

              3. We do not need grace for actions which we can perform by our
              natural powers. But Christ was able to attain glory by His natural
              powers; for He is the natural Son, and if the Son, then the heir
              also. Now since grace is imparted to minds for the purpose of
              attaining glory, it therefore seems that Christ had no need of
              created grace.

              Praeterea, subiectum potest sine accidente intelligi. Sed gratia,
              si fuit in Christo, accidens fuit. Potest ergo Christus intelligi
              sine gratia. Sic ergo intellecto, aut ei debetur vita aeterna, aut
              non. Si sic, ergo frustra addetur ei gratia: si autem non, cum
              filiis adoptivis vita aeterna debeatur ex hoc quod sunt filii,
              videtur quod filiatio adoptionis praeponderet filiationi naturali;

              4. A subject can be understood without an accident. But if grace
              was in Christ, it was an accident. Christ can therefore be
              understood without grace; and when He is so understood, either
              eternal life is due Him or not. If it is, then grace will be added
              to no purpose. If not, since eternal life is due to adopted sons
              because they are sons, it seems that adoptive sonship is worth
              more than natural sonship. But that is untenable.

              goodness.

              seems that He did not need grace.

              7. The union of the divinity to Christ is either sufficient for
              Him or not. If it is not, the union in question will be imperfect;

              the same thing with a less noble kind of knowledge, as through a
              probable medium. But Christ was good with the noblest goodness,
              which is uncreated goodness. He therefore did not need to be good
              by a less noble sort of goodness, namely, created goodness.

              9. An instrument does not need a habit for its operation,
              especially if the agent whose instrument it is has perfect power.
              But the humanity of Christ is a kind of “instrument of the
              divinity” which is united to it, as Damascene says. Since the
              divine power is most perfect, it seems that the humanity of Christ
              did not need grace.

              of all goodness because the Word, the treasure-house of all
              goodness, was united to it. It was therefore not necessary for the
              goodness of grace to be added to it.

              grace; and so created grace would be useless in it.

              Praeterea, duplex est imago Dei in nobis, ut habetur ex Glossa,

              tui, domine: una creationis, quae consistit in mente secundum unam
              essentiam et tres potentias: alia recreationis, quae attenditur
              secundum lumen gratiae. Aut ergo imago gratiae est Deo similior
              quam imago mentis Christi, aut non. Si est Deo similior: ergo

              12. The image of God in us is twofold, as is gathered from the
              Gloss in its comment upon the words of the Psalm (4:7): “The light
              of your countenance, O Lord, is signed upon us.” One is that of
              creation, which consists in the mind considered as one essence
              with three powers. The other is that of re-creation, viewed from
              the standpoint of the light of grace. Now either the image of
              grace is more like God than the image of Christ’s mind, or not. If
              it is more like God, then grace is a nobler creature than Christ’s
              soul. If it is not more like God, then by its means the mind of
              Christ would not come any closer to conformity with God—which is
              the purpose for which grace is infused into the mind. Grace would
              therefore be held to be in the soul of Christ in vain.

              13. If effects are incompatible, they will have incompatible
              causes. just as the unifying and the breaking up of a field of
              vision, for instance, are mutually incompatible, so also are white
              and black. But natural sonship, whose principle is eternal birth,
              is incompatible with adoptive sonship, whose principle is the
              infusion of grace. The infused grace is also incompatible with
              eternal birth; and since eternal birth applies to Christ, it
              therefore seems that He did not have infused grace.

              1. It is written in John (1: 14): “We saw... [Him] full of grace
              and truth.” But in Christ there was created knowledge, to which
              truth refers. Then there was also created grace.

              It is necessary to hold that there was created grace in Christ.
              The reason for this necessity can be gathered from the two
              different kinds of union with God which a soul can have: one
              consequent upon existence within a single person, which belongs
              uniquely to the soul of Christ; and another consequent upon an
              operation, which
              <i>is</i>
              common to all who know and love God.

              Prima quidem coniunctio sine secunda ad beatitudinem non sufficit:
              quia nec ipse Deus beatus esset, si se non cognosceret et amaret:
              non enim in seipso delectaretur, quod ad beatitudinem requiritur.
              Ad hoc ergo quod anima Christi sit beata, praeter unionem ipsius
              ad verbum in persona, requiritur unio per operationem; ut scilicet
              videat Deum per essentiam, et videndo fruatur. Hoc autem excedit
              naturalem potentiam cuiuslibet creaturae, soli autem Deo secundum
              naturam suam conveniens est. Oportet igitur supra naturam animae

            <td>
              The first kind of union is not sufficient for beatitude without
              the second, because not even God Himself would be blessed if He
              did not know and love Himself; for He would not take pleasure in
              Himself, as is required for beatitude. For the soul of Christ to
              be blessed, then, it requires besides its personal union with the
              Word also a union through its operation, that it may see God by
              His essence and, seeing Him, rejoice. Now this surpasses the
              natural ability of any creature and is proper to God alone
              according to His own nature. Something must therefore be added to
              the nature of Christ’s soul by which it is ordained to the
              beatitude in question. We call this grace. It is therefore
              necessary to hold that there was created grace in Christ’s soul.

              This shows the inanity of a certain opinion which affirmed that

              was united immediately to the Word and from this union grace
              flowed into the lower powers. For if it refers to personal union,
              then not only the higher part of Christ’s soul but the whole soul
              is united to the Word. But if it refers to union by operation,
              then habitual grace is required for this kind of union, as has
              been said.

              1. Attributes of such a kind as to belong to a person by reason of
              personality itself cannot be predicated of Christ if they are
              incompatible with the properties of an eternal person, which is
              the only kind of person in Him. An example would be the name
              <i>creature.</i>
              But things which belong to a person only by reason of his nature
              or a part of his nature can be predicated of Christ, even though
              they imply some incompatibility with an eternal person. This is
              because of the duality of natures. Examples would be to suffer, to
              die, and the like. Now sonship refers primarily to the person,
              whereas grace refers to the person only by reason of the mind,
              which is a part of the nature. Thus adoptive sonship by no means
              applies to Christ, though having grace does.

              1. Before we can understand an accident inhering in a substance,
              we must understand the substance in the existence of a supposit.
              But by the union of the human nature with the Word the human
              nature is established in the existence of a supposit. Since grace
              is an accident, it seems that the union of the human nature with
              the Word must be understood before grace. Thus grace is not
              required for the union.

              3 The soul is infused into the body in order that in it the soul
              may be perfected with knowledge and virtues, as the Master makes
              clear. But Christ’s soul is united to the Word before it is to the
              body; otherwise it would follow that a supposit was assumed, for
              from the union of the soul with the body a supposit is
              constituted. The union of Christ’s soul with the Word must
              therefore be understood before we understand grace in it. Thus
              grace does not dispose for the union in question.

              6. As Augustine says, in miraculous occurrences “the whole reason
              for the miracle is the power of the miracle-worker.” But the union
              of human nature to the divine is a miraculous occurrence above all
              others. It is therefore not necessary to posit a disposition on
              the part of the miracle, but the power of the miracle-worker
              suffices. Thus no intervening grace is required.

              Man, then, by grace. But this belongs to Him through the union.
              Therefore grace is required for the union.

              Respondeo. Dicendum, quod habitualem gratiam ad unionem praedictam
              requiri, potest intelligi dupliciter. Uno modo per modum principii
              causantis. Et sic ponere unionem in Christo esse factam per
              gratiam, sonat haeresim Nestorii, qui ponebat non aliter
              humanitatem esse in Christo verbo unitam nisi secundum perfectam
              similitudinem gratiae. Alio modo per modum dispositionis. Et hoc
              potest esse dupliciter: vel secundum modum dispositionis
              necessitatis, vel congruitatis. Necessitatis quidem, sicut calor
              est dispositio ad formam ignis, vel raritas: quia materia non
              potest esse propria materia ignis, nisi intelligatur cum calore et
              raritate. Congruitatis vero, sicut pulchritudo est quaedam
              dispositio ad matrimonium.

            <td>
              The proposition that habitual grace is required for the union in
              question can be understood in two ways: (1) It is required as a
              principle causing the union. To hold that the union in Christ is
              brought about by grace in this sense smacks of the heresy of
              Nestorius, who held that the humanity is united to the Word in
              Christ in no other way than on the basis of a perfect likeness in
              grace. (2) It is required as a disposition. This in turn can be of
              two kinds: either necessary or suitable—necessary, as heat or
              rarity is a disposition necessary for the form of fire, because
              matter cannot be the proper matter for fire unless it is taken
              together with heat and rarity; or suitable, as beauty is a
              disposition suitable for marriage.

              Dicunt ergo quidam, quod gratia habitualis est dispositio per
              modus necessitatis, quasi faciens humanam naturam esse
              assumptibilem. Sed istud non videtur. Nam gratia magis est finis
              assumptionis quam dispositio ad assumptionem. Dicit enim
              Damascenus, quod Christus ad hoc assumpsit humanam naturam, ut eam
              curaret, quae quidem curatio est per gratiam; unde gratia
              habitualis in Christo magis intelligitur ut effectus unionis quam
              ut praeparatio ad unionem. Et hoc significatur Ioan. I, 14:
              vidimus eum quasi unigenitum a patre, plenum gratiae et veritatis;
              quasi ex hoc ipso plenitudo gratiae Christo conveniat quod est

            <td>
              Some therefore say that habitual grace is a necessary disposition,
              as making human nature capable of being assumed. But that does not
              seem to be true. For grace is rather the end of that assumption
              than a disposition for it. Damascene says” that Christ assumed
              human nature in order to cure it. But that curing is accomplished
              through grace. Habitual grace in Christ is accordingly to be
              understood rather as an effect of the union than as a preparation
              for that union. This is indicated in the words of John (1: 14):
              “We saw him as it were the only begotten of the Father, full of
              grace and truth,” as if the fullness of grace belongs to Him by
              the very fact that He is the Only-begotten of the Father through
              the union.

              Et sic habitualis gratia non intelligitur dispositio ad unionem

              Thus habitual grace is not to be understood as a disposition for
              the union except as suitable. In this sense habitual grace can be
              called the grace of union, though more fittingly and more in
              conformity with the meaning of the saints”
              <i>the grace of union</i>
              is understood as the very existence in the person of the Word,
              which is conferred upon the human nature without any previous
              merits; but for this, habitual grace is not required as it is for
              the fruition, which consists in an operation; for a habit is not a
              principle of being but of operating.

              3. The answer was given that the grace of Christ is said to be
              finite, not because God could not give greater grace, but because
              the soul of Christ was not able to receive greater, for its entire
              capacity was filled with grace.—On the contrary, according to
              Augustine “the good of a creature consists in measure, species,
              and order; and where these three characteristics are great the
              good is great, and where they are small the good is small.
              Consequently, as a creature grows in goodness, the measure grows,
              and as a result the amount of its capacity is increased; for a
              thing’s measure depends upon its capacity, as Augustine says. Thus
              the more his grace is increased, the more the capacity in the soul
              of Christ is increased.

              fieri nisi per meritum infinitum, quod non potest esse hominis
              puri. Ex quo patet quod meritum hominis Christi fuit infinitum.
              Sed causa meriti est gratia. Ergo gratia Christi est infinita,
              quia a causa finita non potest egredi effectus infinitus.
            </td>

              4. Anselm proves that God had to be incarnated because atonement
              for human nature could not be made except through infinite merit,
              which could not be that of a mere man. From this it is evident
              that the merit of Christ as man was infinite. But the cause of
              merit is grace. The grace of Christ was therefore infinite,
              because an infinite effect cannot proceed from a finite cause.

              5. The charity of a wayfarer can increase to infinity, because
              however much a man advances in this life, he can always advance
              still further. Now if the grace of Christ were finite, the grace
              of some other man could increase to such an extent that it would
              be greater than Christ’s, and so that man would be better than
              Christ. But that is inadmissible.

              introduced in order to distinguish between Christ and John [the
              Baptist] and all the saints, as the Gloss points out. In that
              interpretation Christ does not differ in this respect from
              creatures; for the Holy Spirit, who is the third person of the
              Trinity, both is infinite in Himself and dwells in each one of the

            <td>
              For this reason another interpretation is set down in the Gloss:
              the words in question refer to eternal generation, in which the
              Father gave the Son an infinite nature, so that by “spirit” is
              understood the spiritual divine nature. The Gloss accordingly
              says: “That there should be a Son just as great as the Father, the
              Father begot a Son equal to Himself.” But this meaning does not
              agree with the words that follow; for the passage continues (John
              3: 3 5): “The Father loves the Son,” so that it is to be
              understood as if the love of the Father for the Son is the reason
              for the giving that is spoken of. Nor can it be said that love is
              the reason for the eternal generation, since personal love is
              rather from the generation. Essential love, of course, pertains to
              the will; but we do not grant that the Father begot the Son by
              will.

            <td>
              Still another interpretation is accordingly given in the Gloss:
              the statement refers to the union of the Word with the human
              nature. For the very Word of God, which is the divine wisdom, is
              communicated to each creature in some definite measure inasmuch as
              God has spread indications of His wisdom through all His works,
              according to the words of Sirach (1: 10): “And he poured her
              (wisdom) out upon all his works, and upon all flesh, according to
              his gift: and has given her to them that love him.” But the Word
              Itself is united to the human nature in Christ fully, without
              measure, so that by “the spirit” which is not given “by measure”
              is understood the Word of God. Hence the Gloss explains: “As the
              Father begot the Word full and perfect, so It is united to human
              nature full and perfect.” But this interpretation also does not
              agree in all respects with the following words. For the gift of
              which the words under discussion speak was made to the Son, as is
              shown in the words which are added (John 3:3 5): “The Father loves
              the Son: and has given all things into his hand.” Now by the union
              nothing has been given to the Son, but it has been given to a man
              to be the Son.

              To get a clear understanding of this matter we should bear in mind
              that
              <i>finite</i>
              and
              <i>infinite</i>
              are taken with reference to quantity, as the Philosopher makes
              clear. Now there are two kinds of quantity: dimensive, which is
              referred to extension; and virtual, which is referred to
              intensity; for the excellence (<i>virtus</i>) of a thing is its
              perfection, as the Philosopher teaches: “Anything is perfect when
              it attains its proper excellence”; and the virtual quantity of
              each form is considered according to the degree of its perfection.
              Both kinds of quantity are differentiated into many species. Under
              dimensive quantity are included length, width, and depth, and
              potentially number. Virtual quantity is distinguished into as many
              classes as there are natures and forms, whose degree of perfection
              constitutes all the measure of quantity that they have.

              Now it sometimes happens that what is finite as regards one sort
              of quantity is infinite as regards another. This is easily seen if
              we take dimensive quantity in both cases, for we can conceive a
              surface which is finite in width but infinite in length. It is
              also clear if we take one dimensive quantity and another virtual;
              for if we conceive an infinite white body, its whiteness will not
              on this account be infinite in intensity, but only (indirectly) in
              extension; for something whiter might be found. The same is no
              less evident if both quantities are virtual; for in one and the
              same subject different virtual quantities can be taken into
              consideration on the basis of different formalities of the
              attributes predicated of this subject. Thus if a thing is called a
              being, virtual quantity is considered in it with regard to the
              perfection of existing; and if it is called sentient, this
              quantity is considered with regard to the perfection of sensing;
              and so on.

              Quantum igitur ad rationem essendi, infinitum esse non potest nisi
              illud in quo omnis essendi perfectio includitur, quae in diversis
              infinitis modis variari potest. Et hoc modo solus Deus infinitus
              est secundum essentiam; quia eius essentia non limitatur ad
              aliquam determinatam perfectionem, sed in se includit omnem modum
              perfectionis, ad quem ratio entitatis se extendere potest, et ideo

              creaturae competere potest: nam cuiuslibet creaturae esse est
              limitatum ad perfectionem propriae speciei. Si ergo intelligatur
              aliqua anima sensibilis quae habeat in se quidquid potest
              concurrere ad perfectionem sentiendi qualitercumque, illa quidem
              anima erit finita secundum essentiam, quia esse suum est limitatum
              ad aliquam perfectionem essendi, scilicet sensibilem, quam excedit
              perfectio intelligibilis; esset tamen infinita secundum rationem
              sensibilitatis, quia eius sensibilitas ad nullum determinatum
              modum essendi limitaretur.

              With regard to the formality of existing, then, only that can be
              infinite which includes all the perfection of existing—a
              perfection which is capable of being diversified in an infinite
              number of different modes. In this respect only God is infinite
              essentially, because His act of existing is not limited to any
              determined perfection but embraces every mode of perfection to
              which the formality of being can extend. For this reason He is
              essentially infinite. This kind of infinity cannot apply to any
              creature, for the act of existing of every creature is limited to
              the perfection of its own species. If, then, we conceive of a
              sentient soul which has in it whatever can contribute in the
              perfection of sensing in any way whatsoever, that soul will be
              finite essentially, because its act of being is limited to a
              particular perfection of existing, namely, sentience, which is
              surpassed by another perfection, intelligence. Yet it would be
              infinite as regards the formality of sentience, because its
              sentience would not be limited to any definite mode of sensing.

              grace can be considered to be of any one of an infinite number of
              modes, no one of them was wanting to Christ, but He had grace in
              all the fullness and perfection to which the formality of this
              species, grace, can extend.

              This interpretation [of the words quoted at the beginning of this

              spirit to men by measure, to the Son not by measure; but just as
              He begot His Son wholly from Himself, so to His incarnate Son He
              gave His spirit wholly, not in part, not by any subdivision, but
              universally and generally.” Augustine also says that Christ is the
              head, in which all the senses are located; but in the saints, to
              whom the spirit is given by measure, there is only, as it were,
              the sense of touch.

              3. The capacity of a creature is predicated on the potency of
              reception which it has. Now the potency of a creature to receive
              is of two kinds. One is natural; and this can be entirely
              fulfilled, because it extends only to natural perfections. The
              other is obediential potency, inasmuch as it can receive something
              from God; and such a capacity cannot be filled, because whatever
              God does with a creature, it still remains in potency to receive
              from God. Now a measure which increases when goodness increases is
              determined by the amount of perfection received rather than by
              that of the capacity to receive.

              of Christ was not infinite in the intensity of the act, for He
              loved and knew finitely. But it had a certain infinity from the

              to any finite degree however great, is true if the same sort of
              quantity is referred to in both of the finite factors (for
              example, if we compare a line to a line or whiteness to
              whiteness), but not if different sorts of quantity are referred
              to. This is evident in dimensive quantity; for no matter how much

              1. It is characteristic of the head to have an influence upon the
              members. But Christ in His human nature does not have an influence
              upon men, that is, not a spiritual influence, because such an
              influence relates especially to the soul. For, as is brought out
              in the comment in the Gloss on John 5:2, taken from Augustine,
              souls are vitalized by the Word of God; bodies, by the Word made
              flesh. Therefore Christ in His human nature is not the head of the
              Church.

              3. The Church would have existed even if man had not sinned, but
              the Word of God would not have assumed human nature, as is said in
              a comment in the Gloss upon the words of the first Epistle to
              Timothy (1: 15): “Christ Jesus came into the world to save
              sinners.” But the Church cannot be without a head. Christ is
              therefore not the head of the Church in His human nature.

              4. It was said that, had man not sinned, Christ would have been
              the head of the Church inasmuch as He is the Word of God, whereas
              after that sin He is the head inasmuch as He is the Word made
              flesh.—On the contrary, for the full reparation of mankind it is
              required that man should not be indebted for his salvation to
              anyone to whom he was not previously indebted. For this reason, as
              Anselm says, reparation could not be made by an angel. But if
              Christ had been the head of the Church before only as the Word,
              man would not have been indebted to any creature for his
              salvation, whereas after his sin he is indebted to Christ in His
              human nature if Christ is the head in this nature. It would
              therefore seem that full reparation of mankind has not been
              effected. But that is inadmissible.

              The head is found to stand in a twofold relationship of
              distinction and conformity to the other members. There is
              distinction in three respects: (1) in point of dignity, because
              the head fully possesses all the senses, but the other members do
              not; (2) in point of government, because the head governs and
              regulates all the other members in their acts by means of both the
              external and the internal senses, which have their seat in the
              head; (3) in point of causality, for the head causes sensation and
              motion in all the members, and hence physicians say that the
              nerves Aid everything pertaining to the apprehensive and motive
              powers of animals originate in the head. The conformity of the
              head to the members is also found to be threefold: (1) in nature,
              for the head and the rest of the members are parts of one nature;
              (2) in order, for there is a union of order between the head and
              the members inasmuch as the members are of service to each other,
              as is pointed out in the first Epistle to the Corinthians(12:25);
              (3) in continuity, for the head is continuous with the other
              members in a physical body. In accordance with these points of
              conformity and distinction the term
              <i>head</i>

              There are some things among which there is conformity in nature.
              To one of these the term head is attributed only by reason of its
              eminence or dignity. Thus the lion is said to be the head of the
              animal kingdom, or a certain city is called the head of the realm
              because of its dignity. Isaiah (7:8), for instance, says: “The
              head of Syria is Damascus.” Certain other things have mutual
              conformity in a union of order, being ordained to one end. Among
              these the term
              <i>head</i>
              is attributed by reason of government, which is concerned with the
              relation to an end. Thus princes are called the heads of the
              people. For example, it is written in Amos (6:1): “You great men,
              heads of the people...” But where there is continuity, head is
              predicated by reason of influence, as a spring is called the head
              of a river.

              In these three different ways Christ in His human nature is called
              the head of the Church. He is of specifically the same nature as
              other men; and so the name head belongs to Him by reason of His
              dignity, on the grounds that grace is found more abundantly in
              Him. In the Church we also find a unity of order, since the
              members of the Church are of service to each other and are
              ordained to God; and in this respect Christ is called the head of
              the Church as its ruler. We also find in the Church a certain
              continuity by reason of the Holy Spirit, who, being one and
              numerically the same, fills and unites the whole Church. Christ in
              His human nature is accordingly called the head by reason of His
              influence.

              In causing spiritual sensation and motion a thing can be
              understood to be operative in two ways: (1) As a principal agent.
              In this way it belongs to God alone to pour grace into the members
              of the Church. (2) Instrumentally. In this way the humanity of
              Christ also is the cause of that in-pouring. For as Damascene
              says, just as iron burns because of the fire joined to it, the
              actions of Christ’s humanity were salutary” because of the
              divinity united to it, of which the humanity was like an
              instrument. This seems to be enough for the notion of a head. For
              even the head of a physical body does not exercise its influence
              upon the members except by reason of its latent power.

              sacraments by Himself, for the whole efficacy of the sacraments
              was in Him as its origin; but the other ministers of the Church
              cannot do so. Hence they cannot be called the head unless perhaps

              since the sin He must be the head of the Church in His human

              suited to the invisible government of the Word. For this reason
              medicine had to be applied to the wound through Christ’s humanity,

              Epistle to the Colossians (1:16) to be the head of all
              principalities and powers. Yet Christ’s humanity is related
              differently to angels than to men in two respects: (1) as to His
              conformity in nature, being in the same species as men but not as
              the angels; (2) as to the end of the Incarnation, which was
              carried out principally for the sake of man’s liberation from sin;
              and so Christ’s humanity is ordained to the influence which He
              exercises upon men as the end intended, whereas His influence upon

              9. Christ as man is the mediator between God and men, as is said
              in the first Epistle to Timothy (2:5). Now God is said to justify
              us in two ways: principally by His own action inasmuch as He is
              the efficient cause of our salvation, and also by our operation
              inasmuch as He is the end known and loved by us. In the same way,
              then, Christ as man is said to justify us in two ways: (1) By His
              own action, inasmuch as He merited and atoned for us. In this
              respect He could not be called the head of the Church before the
              Incarnation. (2) By our operation in His regard, in the sense that
              we are said to be justified by faith in Him. In this respect He
              could be the head of the Church in His humanity even before the
              Incarnation. In both ways, moreover, He is the head of the Church
              in His divinity, both before and after the Incarnation.

              2. Christ is the head of the Church in so far as He works for our

              conferred salvation upon us inasmuch as the humanity was in a way
              “the instrument of the divinity.” Now since an instrument does not
              require any habit but moves only when moved by the principal
              agent, it seems that Christ did not require habitual grace in
              order to be the head.

              3. The action of one man can contribute to the salvation of
              another in two ways: (1) Inasmuch as he acts as an individual
              person. Then grace is required in order that his action may be
              meritorious for himself or for another. (2) As a person
              representing the community. This applies to the ministers of the
              Church, who work for the salvation of others by administering the
              sacraments and pouring forth prayers to God in the name of the
              Church. No grace is needed for this but only a power or state, for
              such actions are performed not only by good but also by wicked
              men. Now Christ as head of the Church is considered as a person
              representing the community, and all the ministers of the Church
              are His vicars. He therefore had no need of habitual grace in
              order to be the head.

              the infinity of His merit from habitual grace, which was finite.

              praehabent lumen, puritatem et perfectionem. Sed Christus in
              quantum est caput Ecclesiae, purgat, illuminat et perficit. Ergo
              oportet, ad hoc quod sit caput, quod in eo sit gratiae plenitudo,
              per quam sit purus, lucidus et perfectus.

              3. Dionysius says that those who have the office of enlightening,
              perfecting, and cleansing others first have light, cleanness, and
              perfection themselves. But as head of the Church Christ cleanses,
              enlightens, and perfects. In order to be the head, therefore, He
              must have the fullness of grace, by which He is pure, full of
              light, and perfect.

              As Damascene says, the humanity of Christ in some sense “was the
              instrument of the divinity”; and for this reason His actions could
              be salutary for us. Inasmuch as it was the instrument of the
              divinity, then, it had to have a special connection with the
              divinity.

              with the divinity more closely than the others and in a more

              As a result there was a fitness in this humanity not only to have

              shining bodies transmit the light of the sun to others. And
              because in some sense Christ communicates the effects of grace to
              all rational creatures, this is why He is in some sense the source
              of all grace in His humanity, just as God is the source of all
              being. Then, as all the perfection of being is united in God, in
              Christ the fullness of all grace and virtue is found, and because
              of it He not only is capable of the work of grace Himself but can
              bring others to grace. For this reason He has the headship.

              grace of headship as the means by which grace is communicated to

              recompense. But the glory of the body comes from the glory of the
              soul by a certain natural sequence, as is seen from Augustine.

              possession of the divinity, it seems that He could not merit the

              and so the same thing cannot be the reward and the principle of
              meriting. But the charity which was found in Christ was a part of
              His reward, because it belonged to the perfection of His
              beatitude, since by its means He had enjoyment. It could therefore

              Christ merited before His passion when He was both a wayfarer and
              a possessor. This is shown as follows. There are two requisites
              for merit: the state of one who merits and the ability to merit.
              For the state of one who merits, the lack of that which is said to
              be merited is required, though some say that a person can merit
              what he already has. Thus they say of the angels that they merited
              their blessedness, which they received simultaneously with grace,
              by the subsequent actions performed with regard to us.

              Sed hoc non videtur esse verum, propter duo. Primo, quia
              contrariatur probationi Augustini, per quam contra Pelagianos
              probat, gratiam sub merito cadere non posse, quia ante gratiam
              nulla sunt merita nisi mala; cum ante gratiam homo sit impius, et
              meritis impii non gratia, sed poena debetur. Non ergo posset dici,
              quod gratiam quis meretur per opera quae quis post acceptam
              gratiam facit. Secundo, quia est contra rationem meriti. Nam
              meritum est causa praemii, non quidem per modum finalis causae:
              sic enim magis praemium est causa meriti; sed magis secundum
              reductionem ad causam efficientem: in quantum meritum facit dignum
              praemio, et per hoc ad praemium disponit. Id autem quod est causa
              per modum efficientis, nullo modo potest esse posterius tempore eo
              cuius est causa: unde non potest esse quod aliquis mereatur quod
              iam habet. Quod autem in humanis aliquis pro accepto beneficio
              domino suo servit, magis habet rationem gratiarum actionis quam
              meriti.
            </td>
            <td>
              But this does not seem to be true for two reasons: (1) Because it
              is contrary to Augustine’s argument, by which he proves against
              the Pelagians that grace cannot fall under merit because before
              grace there are no deserts except evil, since before receiving
              grace man is a sinner and not grace but punishment is what sinners
              deserve. For if the opinion in question is admitted] it could be
              said that one merits grace by the deeds which he does after
              receiving grace. (2) Because it is against the nature of merit;
              for merit is the cause of reward, not as a final cause (for in
              this sense the reward is rather the cause of the merit), but
              rather by reduction to efficient causality, inasmuch as merit
              makes a man worthy of a reward and in this way disposes him for
              it. Now anything that is a cause in the line of efficiency can by
              no means be posterior in time to that of which it is the cause. It
              is impossible, then, for a person to merit what he already has. If
              in human affairs someone serves his master in return for a favor
              received, this is more of the nature of thanksgiving than of
              merit.

              The ability to merit is required both on the part of nature and on
              that of grace. It is required on the part of nature because no one
              can merit by his own act unless he has dominion over his act. If
              he has that dominion he can, as it were, give his act as a price
              for the reward. Now a man has dominion over his own acts through
              the power of free choice. The natural ability of free choice is
              therefore required for meriting. On the part of grace it is
              required because the reward of blessedness exceeds the
              capabilities of human nature, and so man is not able to merit it
              by his unaided natural powers. Grace by which he is enabled to
              merit is accordingly required.

              this lack He was a wayfarer. There was in Him, moreover, the

              of grace because of the fullness of grace. He was therefore able

              others suitableness for the winning of glory. He could therefore
              merit condignly for others, just as He could exercise influence

              in value to the good of the whole nature. But the action of
              Christ, being that of God and man, had a dignity that made it

              and so one man cannot be praised for the act of another. But it
              gets its meritoriousness from its relation to the end, for which a
              person can be made suited by the influence of Christ. Christ could
              therefore merit for us.

              5. just as it belongs to a wayfarer to merit, so no one can merit
              except for a wayfarer, because the one for whom anyone merits must
              be lacking in some point that falls within the scope of merit. Now
              angels are not wayfarers with reference to the essential reward,
              and so Christ did not merit for them in this respect. But they are
              in some sense wayfarers with reference to the accidental reward in
              so far as they minister to us. In this respect, then, Christ’s
              merit is of value to them as well. It is accordingly said in the

              patriarchs, who, though having grace, were unable because of the
              debt of the nature to arrive at glory. The merit and satisfaction
              of Christ was accordingly needed to remove that debt. Furthermore,
              personal grace was never given to anyone after the sin of the
              first man except through faith, either explicit or implicit, in
              the Mediator.

              not act without the habit. If, then, Christ’s soul in its own
              nature could not have the use of free choice at the first instant
              of its creation, it seems that grace did not confer upon it the
              ability to merit at its first instant.

              6. An instant has the same relation to time as a point to a line.
              But according to the Philosopher, when a being in motion makes use
              of one point as two, that is, as the beginning of one line and the
              end of another, there necessarily intervenes a period of repose,
              as is shown in a reciprocating motion. Now, since the instant it
              which Christ’s soul was created is taken as the end of creation
              and as the beginning of the motion of free choice, and so we use
              one instant as two, it therefore seems that time intervenes. Thus
              Christ’s soul did not merit at the first instant of its creation.

              could not have had through grace an act which is within its
              competence by nature, namely, to choose.

              being, the one, and the good; for being results from the first
              act, one from the second, and good from the third. A thing is
              accordingly a being before it is oriented to an end. Now Christ’s
              soul was oriented to its end by a meritorious act. It is therefore
              not possible for it to have merited at the first instant of its

              in the instant in which someone sins mortally, he cannot merit
              because he does not have grace. Again it could be because of the
              lack of a natural capability, as a child at the first instant at
              which it is conceived cannot merit because it does not have the
              use of free choice.

              full of grace, and also the capability of nature, having the full
              use of free choice; otherwise He could not have been a possessor.

              Similarly no such impossibility came from the meritorious act
              either. That a given act could not be performed at a given instant
              could come about in two ways: (1) Because that act involves
              successiveness and so cannot be completed in an instant. Thus
              local motion cannot take place in an instant. (2) Because the act
              presupposes certain conditions that cannot precede a definite
              instant. Thus, if a fire has been kindled out of its proper place,
              it is impossible for that fire to be in its proper place at the
              first instant at which it comes into existence, because motion is
              a prerequisite, and that motion cannot be before the first instant
              of its existence.

              Now in neither of these two ways was Christ prevented from
              meriting at His first instant. Not in the first, because the
              motion of free choice upon which merit depends is not successive
              but simple and instantaneous. Not in the second, because nothing
              is prerequisite for the motion of the will except the act of the
              apprehensive power; and that motion is at the same instant as the
              act of the will, because the apprehended good moves the will; for
              the mover moves and the being in motion is moved at the same time
              and with the same motion. In Christ, moreover, the apprehension of
              the good does not need any previous inquiry in order to reach a
              certain judgment about the good, because Christ immediately had a
              true judgment about everything with certitude.

              1. The term deliberation can imply either of two meanings. The
              first is the perception by reason in a certain judgment of the
              matter about which the deliberation is being carried on. From this
              point of view it can take place in an instant in one devoid of any
              perplexity about what is to be done. In this sense deliberation
              found place in Christ. The term can also mean an inquiry or
              investigation. Then it implies a discourse and cannot take place
              in an instant. Christ needed no such deliberation, because He was
              not in doubt about what was to be done.

              creation, unless prevented, be attracted to good, but not to evil;
              for it is attracted to evil only through an error which occurs in

              the end of the first. Illumination and vision, for example,

              actually begins, because in this case repose intervenes, and
              consequently a time. In specifically different motions, however,
              it is possible for the end of one movement and the beginning of
              another to coincide, because between them no continuity or order
              is needed since both can exist together. For instance, while a
              thing is being moved it can at the same time be whitened, and at
              the instant at which it begins to become white the local motion
              ends. Between the parts of the same motion, however, there
              sometimes is an order, with the result that the two parts cannot
              exist together. In that case the end of one part does not coincide
              with the be inning of the other part if both are taken as actual.
              It is evident, then, that the use of one instant as two does not
