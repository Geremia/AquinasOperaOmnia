                  1 Jesus however proceeded to the Mount of Olives, 2 and early
                  in the morning he came again to the temple. All the people
                  came to him, and sitting down, he taught them. 3 Then the
                  scribes and Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery
                  and placed her in their midst. 4 They said to him, "Master,
                  this woman has just now been caught in adultery. 5 In the Law,
                  Moses commanded us to stone such a woman. But what do you
                  say?" 6 (They said this to test him so that they could accuse
                  him.) But Jesus bending down wrote on the ground with his
                  finger. 7 As they persisted in the question, he stood up and
                  said to them: "Whoever among you is without sin, let him be
                  the first to cast a stone at her." 8 And again bending down,
                  he wrote on the ground. 9 On hearing this, one after the other
                  departed, beginning with the oldest, and there remained only
                  Jesus and the woman standing there in the center. 10 Rising
                  up, Jesus asked the woman: "Woman, where are those who accuse
                  you? Has no one condemned you?" 11 To which she replied, "No
                  one, Lord." Then Jesus said: "Nor will I condemn you. Go and
                  do not sin again."

                    1118 After having treated of the origin of the doctrine of
                    Christ, the Evangelist here considers its power. Now the
                    doctrine of Christ has the power both to enlighten and to
                    give life, because his words are spirit and life. So first,
                    he treats of the power of Christ's doctrine to enlighten;
                    secondly, of its power to give life (10:1). He shows the
                    power of Christ's doctrine to enlighten, first by words; and
                    secondly, by a miracle (9:1). As to the first, he does two
                    things: first, he presents the teaching of Christ; secondly,
                    he shows the power of his teaching (8:12).

                        There are two things that pertain to the office of a
                        teacher: to instruct the devout or sincere, and to repel
                        opponents. So first, Christ instructs those who are
                        sincere; and secondly, he repels his opponents (v 3).
                        The Evangelist does three things with respect to the
                        first: first, he mentions the place where this teaching
                        takes place; secondly, he mentions those who listened to
                        it; and thirdly, the teacher. This teaching took place
                        in the temple; so he first mentions that Jesus left the
                        temple, and then that he returned.

                            Jerusalem on the festival days, to preach in the
                            temple and to work miracles and signs during the
                            day, and when evening came, he would return to
                            Bethany (which was on the Mount of Olives) as the
                            guest of Lazarus' sisters, Martha and Mary. With
                            this in mind, the Evangelist says that since Jesus
                            had remained in the temple and preached on the last
                            day of the great feast, in the evening, Jesus
                            proceeded to the Mount of Olives, where Bethany was
                            located.

                                Et hoc convenit mysterio: nam, ut dicit
                                Augustinus, ubi decebat Christum docere et suam
                                misericordiam manifestare nisi in monte oliveti,
                                in monte unctionis et chrismatis? Oliva autem
                                misericordiam signat: unde et in Graeco oleos
                                idem est quod misericordia. Lc. X, 34, dicitur
                                de Samaritano, quod infudit oleum et vinum,
                                secundum misericordiam et severitatem iudicii.
                                Item oleum sanativum est; Is. I, 6:
                                <i
                                  >vulnus et livor et plaga tumens non est

                                quae ad nos derivata est. Ps. XLIV, 8:
                                <i
                                  >unxit te Deus, Deus tuus, oleo laetitiae prae

                                And this is appropriate to a mystery: for as
                                Augustine says, where was it appropriate for
                                Christ to teach and show his mercy, if not on
                                the Mount of Olives, the mount of anointing and
                                of grace. The olive (<i>oliva</i>) signifies
                                mercy; so also in Greek, <i>oleos</i> is the
                                same as mercy. And Luke (10:24) tells us that
                                the Samaritan applied oil and wine, which
                                correspond to mercy and the stringency of
                                judgment. Again, oil is healing: "Wounds and
                                bruises and swelling sores are not bandaged or
                                dressed, or soothed with oil" (Is 1:6). It also
                                signifies the medicine of spiritual grace which
                                has been transmitted to us by Christ: "God, your
                                God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness
                                above your fellows" (Ps 44:8); and again, "like
                                the precious ointment on the head which ran down
                                upon the beard (Ps 132:2); and in Job we read
                                that "The rock poured out rivers of oil" (Jb
                                29:6).

                                            down, and when I rose" (Ps 138:1).
                                            Because it was through the human
                                            nature that our Lord assumed that he
                                            became visible, we began to be

                                            down, he taught them, that is, the
                                            simple, and those who respected his
                                            teaching: "He will teach his ways to
                                            the gentle, and will guide the mild
                                            in judgment" (Ps 24:9); "He will
                                            teach us his ways (Is 2:3).

                                                    test is a woman's adultery.
                                                    And so first, her accusers
                                                    detail the crime; and also

                                                    the first, the Evangelist
                                                    says,
                                                    <b

                                                    As Augustine says, three
                                                    things were noteworthy about
                                                    Christ: his truth, his
                                                    gentleness, and his justice.
                                                    Indeed, it was predicted
                                                    about him: "Go forth and
                                                    reign, because of truth,
                                                    gentleness, and justice" (Ps
                                                    44:5). For he set forth the
                                                    truth as a teacher; and the
                                                    Pharisees and scribes
                                                    noticed this while he was
                                                    teaching: "If I speak the
                                                    truth, why do you not
                                                    believe me?" (8:46). Since
                                                    they could find nothing
                                                    false in his words or his
                                                    teachings, they had ceased
                                                    their accusations on that
                                                    score. He showed his
                                                    gentleness as a liberator or
                                                    savior; and they saw this
                                                    when he could not be
                                                    provoked against his enemies
                                                    and persecutors: "When he
                                                    was reviled, he did not
                                                    revile" (1 Pet 2:23). Thus
                                                    Matthew has: "Learn from me,
                                                    for I am gentle and humble
                                                    of heart" (11:29). Thus they
                                                    did not accuse him on this
                                                    point. And he exercised
                                                    justice as its advocate; he
                                                    did this because it was not
                                                    yet known among the Jews,
                                                    especially in legal
                                                    proceedings. It was on this
                                                    point that they wanted to
                                                    test him, to see if he would
                                                    abandon justice for the sake
                                                    of mercy. So they present
                                                    him with a known crime,
                                                    deserving denunciation,
                                                    adultery: "Every woman who
                                                    is a harlot will be walked
                                                    on like dung on the road"
                                                    (Sir 9:10). Then they
                                                    present the sinner in person
                                                    to further influence him:
                                                    and placed her in their
                                                    midst. "This woman will be
                                                    brought into the assembly,
                                                    and among the sons of God"
                                                    (Sir 23:24).

                  12 Again Jesus spoke to them saying: "I am the light of the
                  world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but he
                  will have the light of life." 13 The Pharisees then said to
                  him, "You are bearing witness to yourself; your testimony is
                  not true. 14 Jesus replied: "Even though I bear witness
                  concerning myself, my testimony is true, because I know where
                  I come from and where I am going. But you do not know where I
                  come from, or where I am going. 15 You judge according to the
                  flesh. I do not judge anyone. 16 And if I do judge, my
                  judgment is true because I am not alone; but there is me and
                  the Father who sent me. 17 And it is written in your Law that
                  the testimony of two men is true. 18 It is I who bear witness
                  to myself, and the Father who sent me who bears witness
                  concerning me." 19 They therefore said to him, "Where is your
                  Father?" Jesus replied, "You know neither me nor my Father. If
                  you did know me, you might also know my Father." 20 Jesus
                  spoke these words in the treasury where he was teaching in the
                  temple; and no one arrested him because his hour had not yet
                  come.

                    1140 The Evangelist has presented Christ as teaching; now he
                    shows, first, the power which this teaching has to give
                    light, and secondly, what Christ himself said about it (v
                    13). With respect to the first he does three things: first,
                    he states Christ's prerogative concerning spiritual light;
                    secondly, the effect of this prerogative, Whoever follows me
                    will not walk in darkness; and thirdly, its fruit, but he
                    will have the light of life.

                        Quia enim dixit: <i>nec ego condemnabo te</i> etc.,
                        absolvens eam a crimine, ideo ne aliqui dubitarent utrum
                        ipse absolvere posset, et peccata dimittere, dignatur
                        apertius divinitatis suae potentiam demonstrare, dicens
                        se esse lucem, qui peccati tenebras pellit. Alio modo
                        potest continuari ad illud quod supra VII, 52 dixit:
                        <i
                          >scrutare Scripturas, et vide quia propheta a Galilaea
                          non surgit</i
                        >. Quia enim eum aestimabant Galilaeum, et quasi ex loco
                        determinato dependentem, doctrinam eius repudiabant;
                        ideo dominus ostendit se totius mundi esse lucem
                        universalem, dicens <i>ego sum lux mundi</i>, non
                        Galilaeae, neque Palaestinae, neque Iudaeae.

                        1141 He says, concerning the prerogative of Christ, who
                        is the light, to the spiritual light,
                        <b

                        We can relate this statement with what went before in
                        this way. Christ had said, when forgiving the woman's
                        sin, "Nor will I condemn you." And so they would have no
                        doubt that he could forgive and pardon sins, he saw fit
                        to show the power of his divinity more openly by saying
                        that he is the light which drives away the darkness of
                        sin. Or, we could connect this statement with what the
                        Pharisees said before (7:52): "Look at the Scriptures
                        and see that the Prophet will not come from Galilee."
                        For they thought of him as a Galilean and linked to a
                        definite place, and so they rejected his teaching. So
                        our Lord shows them that he is in the universal light of
                        the entire world, saying, I am the light of the world,
                        not just of Galilee, or of Palestine, or of Judea.

                            Manichaei autem, ut Augustinus dicit, hoc falso
                            intelligebant. Quia enim imaginatio eorum erat solum
                            de sensibilibus, ideo non valebant se ad
                            intellectualia et spiritualia extendere, credebant
                            enim supra corporalia nihil esse in rerum natura,
                            unde dicebant Deum esse corpus et lucem quamdam
                            infinitam, et solem istum oculis carnis visibilem,
                            Christum dominum esse putaverunt: et propter hoc
                            ipsum dixisse <i>ego sum lux mundi</i>. Sed hoc
                            stare non potest et Ecclesia Catholica improbat tale
                            figmentum. Sol enim iste corporalis est lux quam
                            sensus attingere potest: et ideo non est suprema
                            lux, quam intellectus solus attingit, quae est lux
                            intelligibilis propria rationalis creaturae. Hic de
                            ea dicit Christus <i>ego sum lux mundi</i>. De ista
                            dicitur supra I, 9:
                            <i
                              >erat lux vera quae illuminat omnem hominem
                              venientem in hunc mundum</i
                            >. Lux autem ista sensibilis, imago quaedam est
                            illius lucis intelligibilis: nam omne sensibile est
                            quasi quoddam particulare, intellectualia autem sunt
                            quasi totalia quaedam. Sicut autem lux ista
                            particularis habet effectum in re visa, inquantum
                            colores facit actu visibiles, et etiam in vidente,
                            quia per eam oculus confortatur ad videndum, sic lux
                            illa intelligibilis intellectum facit cognoscentem.
                            Quia quidquid luminis est in rationali creatura,
                            totum derivatur ab ipsa suprema luce; supra I, 9:
                            <i
                              >illuminat omnem hominem venientem in hunc
                              mundum</i
                            >. Item facit res omnes actu intelligibiles,

                            1142 The Manicheans, as Augustine relates,
                            misunderstood this: for since they judged by their
                            imagination, which does not rise to intellectual and
                            spiritual realities, they believed that nothing but
                            bodies existed. Thus they said that God was a body;
                            and a certain infinite light. Further, they thought
                            that the sun that we see with our physical eyes was
                            Christ the Lord. And that is why, according to them,
                            Christ said, I am the light of the world. But this
                            cannot hold up, and the Catholic Church rejects such
                            a fiction. For this physical sun is a light which
                            can be perceived by sense. Consequently, it is not
                            the highest light, which intellect alone grasps, and
                            which is the intelligible light characteristic of
                            the rational creature. Christ says about this light
                            here: I am the light of the world. And above we
                            read: "He was the true light, which enlightens every
                            man coming into this world" (1:9). Sense perceptible
                            light, however, is a certain image of spiritual
                            light, for every sensible thing is something
                            particular, whereas intellectual things are a kind
                            of whole. Just as particular light has an effect on
                            the thing seen, inasmuch as it makes colors actually
                            visible, as well as on the one seeing, because
                            through it the eye is conditioned for seeing, so
                            intellectual light makes the intellect to know
                            because whatever light is in the rational creature
                            is all derived from that supreme light "which
                            enlightens every man coming into the world."
                            Furthermore, it makes all things to be actually
                            intelligible inasmuch as all forms are derived from
                            it, forms which give things the capability of being
                            known, just as all the forms of artifacts are
                            derived from the art and reason on the artisan: "How
                            magnificent are your works, O Lord! You have made
                            all things in wisdom" (Ps 103:24). Thus Christ truly
                            says here: I am the light of the world; not the sun
                            which was made, but the one who made the sun. Yet as
                            Augustine says, the Light which made the sun was
                            himself made under the sun and covered with a cloud
                            of flesh, not in order to hide but to be moderated
                            [to our weakness].

                                Nestorius, who said that the Son of God was
                                united to human nature by a mere indwelling. For
                                it is obvious that the one who said, I am the
                                light of the world, was a human being.
                                Therefore, unless the one who spoke and appeared
                                as a human being was also the person of the Son
                                of God, he could not have said, I am the light
                                of the world, but "The light of the world dwells
                                in me."

                                    Because this light is universal, it
                                    universally expels all darkness. Now there
                                    are three kinds of darkness. There is the
                                    darkness of ignorance: "The have neither
                                    known nor understood; they walk in darkness"
                                    (Ps 81:5); and this is the darkness reason
                                    has of itself, insofar as it is darkened of
                                    itself. There is the darkness of sin: "You
                                    were at one time darkness, but now you are
                                    light in the Lord" (Eph 5:8). This darkness
                                    belongs to human reason not of itself, but
                                    from the affections which, by being badly
                                    disposed by passion or habit, seek something
                                    as good that is not really good. Further,
                                    there is the darkness of eternal damnation:
                                    "Cast the unprofitable servant into the
                                    exterior darkness" (Mt 25:30). The first two
                                    kinds of darkness are found in this life;
                                    but the third is at the end of life. Thus,
                                    Whoever follows me will not walk in
                                    darkness: the darkness of ignorance, because
                                    I am the truth; nor the darkness of sin,
                                    because I am the way; nor the darkness of
                                    eternal damnation, because I am the life.

                                        <i>sed habebit lumen vitae</i>: nam qui

                                        damnationis. Dicit autem
                                        <i>qui sequitur</i>, quia sicut
                                        quicumque non vult errare in tenebris,
                                        oportet ut sequatur eum qui lumen
                                        portat; ita quicumque vult salvari,
                                        oportet quod sequatur Christum, qui est
                                        lux, credendo et amando; et sic apostoli
                                        secuti sunt eum, Matth. IV, 20. Quia
                                        vero lux corporalis deficere potest per
                                        occasum, contingit quia qui sequitur
                                        eam, tenebras incurrit. Lux vero ista,
                                        quae nescit occasum, numquam deficit: et
                                        ideo qui sequitur eam, habet lumen
                                        indeficiens, scilicet vitae. Lumen enim
                                        visibile non dat vitam, sed coadiuvat
                                        exterius operationes vitae corporalis;
                                        lumen vero istud vitam dat, quia vivimus
                                        inquantum intellectum habemus, qui est
                                        quaedam participatio illius lucis.

                                        perfectam; Ps. XXXV, 10:

                                        >, for one who has the light is outside
                                        the darkness of damnation. He says,
                                        Whoever follows me, because just as one
                                        who does not want to stumble in the dark
                                        has to follow the one who is carrying
                                        the light, so one who wants to be saved
                                        must, by believing and loving, follow
                                        Christ, who is the light. This is the
                                        way the apostles followed him (Mt 4).
                                        Because physical light can fail because
                                        it sets, it happens that one who follows
                                        it meets with darkness. But the light we
                                        are talking about here does not set and
                                        never fails; consequently, one who
                                        follows it has an unfailing light, that
                                        is, an unfailing light of life. For the
                                        light that is visible does not give
                                        life, but gives us an external aid
                                        because we live insofar as we have
                                        understanding, and this is a certain
                                        participation in this light. And when
                                        this light completely shines upon us we
                                        will then have perfect life: "With you
                                        is the fountain of life, and in your
                                        light we will see the light" (Ps 35:10).
                                        This is the same as saying: We will have
                                        perfectly or completely when we see this
                                        light as it is. Thus we read further on:
                                        "This is eternal life: that they know
                                        you, the only true God and Jesus Christ,
                                        whom you have sent" (17:3).

                  αὐτοῖς ἔλεγεν. 28 εἶπεν οὖν [αὐτοῖς] ὁ Ἰησοῦς, ὅταν ὑψώσητε

                  21 Again he said to them: "I am going away; and you will seek
                  me, and you will die in your sin. Where I am going, you cannot
                  come." 22 (So the Jews wondered, "Will he kill himself, since
                  he says, 'Where I am going, you cannot come'?" 23 To them he
                  said: "You are from below; I am from above. You are of this
                  world; I am not of this world. 24 Therefore I said to you that
                  you will die in your sins. For if you do not believe that I
                  AM, you will die in your sin." 25 Then they ask him, "Who are
                  you?" Jesus replied: "The source (beginning) who is also
                  speaking to you. 26 I have much to say about you and much to
                  judge. But the one who sent me is truthful. Whatever I have
                  heard from him, this I declare to the world." 27 (And they did
                  not realize that he was calling God his Father.) 28 So Jesus
                  said to them: "When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then
                  you will understand that I AM, and that I do nothing of
                  myself; but as the Father taught me, so I speak. 29 He who
                  sent me is with me; he has not deserted me, because I always
                  do what is pleasing to him." 30 Because he spoke in this way,
                  many came to believe in him.

                    1165 After our Lord showed his special position with respect
                    to light, he here reveals the effect of this light, that is,
                    that it frees us from darkness. First, he shows that the
                    Jews are imprisoned in darkness; secondly he teaches the
                    remedy which can free them (v 22). He does three things
                    concerning the first: first, our Lord tells them he is going
                    to leave; secondly, he reveals the perverse plans of the
                    Jews, and thirdly, he mentions what they will be deprived
                    of.

                        ab alio ductus. Infra XVI, 5:
                        <i>vado ad eum qui me misit</i>; infra X, 18:

                        1166 Our Lord says that he is going to leave them by his
                        death, <b>I am going away.</b> We can see two things
                        from this. First, that he is going to die voluntarily,
                        that is, as going, and not as one led by someone else:
                        "I am going to him who sent me" (16:5); "No one takes my
                        life from me, but I lay it down of myself" (10:18). And
                        so this appropriately follows what went before: for he
                        had said, "and no one arrested him" (8:20). Why? Because
                        he is going willingly, on his own.

                            Secundo ostendit quod mors Christi erat quaedam
                            profectio illuc unde venerat et unde non
                            discesserat: sicut enim qui vadit in anteriora

                            journey to that place from which he had come, and
                            which he had not left, for just as one who walks
                            heads toward what is ahead, so Christ, by his death,
                            reached the glory of exaltation: "He became obedient
                            unto death, even the death of the cross. Because of
                            this God exalted him" (Phil 2:8); "Jesusknowing that
                            he came from God, and is going to God" (13:3).

                                results in life: "Seek the Lord, and your soul
                                will live" (Ps 68:7). But they wickedly searched
                                for him out of hatred, to persecute him: "The
                                who sought my soul used violence" (Ps 37:13). He
                                says, you will seek me, by attacking me after my
                                death with your accusations: "We remembered that
                                while still living the seducer said: 'After
                                three days I will rise'" (Mt. 27:63). And they

                                        1169 He is saying: Because you will
                                        wickedly search for me, you will die
                                        while continuing in your sin. We can
                                        understand this in one way as applying
                                        to physical death: and then one dies in
                                        his sins who keeps on sinning up to the
                                        time of his death. And so in saying, you
                                        will die in your sin, he emphasizes
                                        their obstinacy: "There is no one who
                                        does penance for his sin, saying: 'What
                                        have I done?'" (Jer 8:6); "They went
                                        down to the lower regions with their
                                        weapons" as we read in Ezekiel (32:2).

                                            est, tunc est quasi quaedam
                                            infirmitas quae praecedit Ps. VI, 3:

                                            In another way, we can understand
                                            this as applying to the death of
                                            sin, about which the Psalm says,
                                            "The death of sinners is the worst"
                                            (Ps 33:22). And just as a physical
                                            weakness precedes physical death, so
                                            a certain weakness precedes this
                                            kind of death. For as long as sin
                                            can be remedied, it is a kind of
                                            weakness which precedes death: "Have
                                            mercy on me, O Lord, for I am weak"
                                            (Ps 6:3). But when sin can no longer
                                            be remedied, either absolutely, as
                                            after this life, or because of the
                                            very nature of the sin, as a sin
                                            against the Holy Spirit, it then
                                            causes death: "There is a sin that
                                            leads to death; I do not say that
                                            one should pray for that" (1 Jn
                                            5:16). And according to this, our
                                            Lord is foretelling them that the
                                            weakness of their sins results in
                                            death.

                  everyone who commits sin is a slave to sin. 35 A slave does
                  not remain in the household forever; but the Son remains
                  forever. 36 If therefore the Son frees you, you will be truly
                  free. 37 I know that you are sons of Abraham. Yet you want to
                  kill me, because my message is not grasped by you. 38 I speak
                  of what I have seen with my Father. And what you have seen
                  with your father, that you do."

                            We need three things with respect to the word of
                            God. A concern to hear it: "Let every man be quick
                            to hear" (Jas 1:19). Then we need faith to believe
                            it: "Faith comes by hearing" (Rom 10:17). And also
                            perseverance in continuing with it: "How exceedingly
                            bitter is wisdom to the unlearned. The foolish will
                            not continue with her" (Sir 6:21). And so he says,
                            If you remain, that is, by a firm faith, through
                            continual meditation: "He will meditate on his law
                            day and night" (Ps 1:2); and by your ardent love:
                            "His will is the law of the Lord" (Ps 1:2). Thus
                            Augustine says that those who remain in the word of
                            our Lord are those who do not give in to
                            temptations.

                                        grasp the words of the teacher: "Are you
                                        also still without understanding?" (Mt
                                        15:16). But it is only Christ who can
                                        open the ears of the understanding: Then
                                        he opened their minds so that they could
                                        understand the Scriptures" (Lk 24:45);
                                        "The Lord opened my ears" (Is 50:5).

                                            Secondly, a disciple needs to

                                            (Lk 6:40), and thus he should not
                                            contradict him: "Do not speak
                                            against the truth in any way" (Sir

                                            same verse, "I do not resist."

                                                As we read above: "From this
                                                time on, many of his disciples
                                                turned back, and no longer
                                                walked with him" (6:67); and
                                                Isaiah adds: "I did not turn
                                                back" (Is 50:5).

                  did], 40 but now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you
                  the truth which I heard from God; this is not what Abraham
                  did. 41 You do what your father did. "They said to him, "We
                  were not born of fornication, we have one Father, even God."
                  42 Jesus said to them, "If God were your Father, you would

                  of my own accord, but he sent me. 43 Why do you not understand

                    1218 After showing that the Jews had a certain spiritual
                    origin, our Lord here rejects certain origins which they had
                    presumptuously attributed to themselves. First, he rejects
                    the origin they claimed to have from Abraham; secondly, the
                    origin they thought they had from God (v 41). As to the
                    first he does two things: first, he gives the opinion of the
                    Jews about their origin; secondly, he rejects it (v 39b).

                        our Lord had said to them, what you have seen with your
                        father, that you do, and so, glorying in their carnal
                        descent, they aligned themselves with Abraham. Thus they
                        said, <b>Abraham is our father.</b> This is like saying:
                        If we have a spiritual origin we are good, because our
                        father Abraham is good: "O offspring of Abraham his
                        servant" (Ps 105:6). And as Augustine says, they tried
                        to provoke him to say something against Abraham and so
                        give them an excuse for doing what they had planned,
                        namely, to kill Christ.

                                is like the one whose child he is; for just as
                                children according to the flesh resemble their

                                imitate their spiritual parents: "Be imitators
                                of God, as beloved children" (Eph 5:1). And as
                                to this he says,

                                    1222 Here a question arises, for when he
                                    says, if you are Abraham's children, he
                                    seems to be denying that they are the
                                    children of Abraham, whereas just previously
                                    he had said, "I know that you are children
                                    of Abraham" (v 37). There are two ways of
                                    answering this. The first, according to
                                    Augustine, is that before he said that they
                                    were children of Abraham according to the
                                    flesh, but here he is denying that they are
                                    children in the sense of imitating his
                                    works, especially his faith. Therefore, they
                                    took their flesh from him, but not their
                                    life: "It is men of faith who are the sons
                                    of Abraham" (Gal 3:7).

                                        eius filii. Differentia est inter semen
                                        et filium: nam semen est quid informe,

                                        For Origin, who has another explanation,
                                        both statements refer to their spiritual
                                        origin. Where our text reads, "I know
                                        that you are children of Abraham," the
                                        Greek has, "I know that you are the seed
                                        of Abraham." But Christ says here, if
                                        you are Abraham's children, do what
                                        Abraham did, because the Jews,
                                        spiritually speaking, were the seed of
                                        Abraham, but were not his children.
                                        There is a difference between a seed and
                                        a child: for a seed is unformed,
                                        although it has in it the
                                        characteristics of that of which it is a
                                        seed. A child, however, has a likeness
                                        to the parent after the seen has been
                                        modified by the informing power infused
                                        by the agent acting upon the matter
                                        which has been furnished by the female.
                                        In the same way, the Jews were indeed
                                        the seed of Abraham, insofar as they had
                                        some of the characteristics which God
                                        had infused into Abraham; but because
                                        they had not reached the perfection of
                                        Abraham, they were not his children.
                                        This is why he said to them, if you are
                                        Abraham's children, do what Abraham did,
                                        i.e., strive for a perfect imitation of
                                        his works.

                                            Respondeo. Dicendum quod praecipuum
                                            opus Abrahae est fides, per quam
                                            iustificatus est apud Deum; Gen. XV,
                                            6:

                                            <b>do what Abraham did</b>, it would
                                            seem that whatever he did, we should
                                            do. Consequently, we should have a
                                            number of wives and approach a
                                            maidservant, as Abraham did. I
                                            answer that the chief work of
                                            Abraham was faith, by which he was
                                            justified before God: "He believed
                                            the Lord; and he reckoned it to him
                                            as righteousness" (Gen 15:6). Thus,
                                            the meaning is, do what Abraham did,
                                            i.e., believe according to the
                                            example of Abraham.

                                                interpretation that faith should
                                                not be called a work, since it
                                                is distinguished from works:
                                                "Faith apart from works is dead"
                                                (Jas 2:26) ["Do what Abraham
                                                did" if translated literally
                                                gives "Do the works of
                                                Abraham."] I answer that faith
                                                can be called a work according
                                                to what was said above: "This is
                                                the work of God, that you
                                                believe in him whom he has sent"
                                                (6:29). An interior work is not
                                                obvious to man, but only to God,
                                                according to, "The Lord sees not
                                                as man sees; man looks on the
                                                outward appearance, but the Lord
                                                looks on the heart" (1 Sam
                                                16:7). This is the reason we are
                                                more accustomed to call exterior
                                                action works. Thus, faith is not
                                                distinguished from all works,
                                                but only from external works.

                    origin, and after rejecting the origin they presumed they
                    had, our Lord here gives their true origin, ascribing their

                    secondly, he gives its reason; and thirdly, he explains this
                    reason.

                            Cavenda est hic haeresis Manichaeorum, qui dicunt
                            esse quamdam naturam mali, et gentem quamdam
                            tenebrarum cum principibus suis, a qua corruptibilia
                            omnia originem trahunt; et secundum hoc omnes
                            homines secundum carnem ex Diabolo processisse.
                            Ponebant autem quasdam animas ad bonam creationem
                            pertinere, et quasdam ad malam; unde dicebant hoc
                            dictum a domino <i>vos ex patre Diabolo estis</i>,
                            quia ab eo secundum carnem processistis, et animae
                            vestrae sunt de mala creatione. Sed, ut Origenes
                            dicit, introducere duas naturas propter differentiam
                            boni et mali, simile videtur ei qui diceret alteram
                            esse oculi videntis substantiam, alteram caligantis
                            vel se avertentis. Quemadmodum enim oculi sani et
                            lippi non differunt substantia, sed quaedam
                            contingit causa deficiens, scilicet quae facit eum
                            caligare; ita eadem est substantia et natura rei,
                            sive sit bona, seu habeat in se defectum, quod est
                            peccatum voluntatis. Non ergo Iudaei ut mali,
                            dicuntur filii Diaboli natura, sed imitatione.

                            Here one must guard against the heresy of the
                            Manicheans who claim that there is a definite nature
                            called "evil," and a certain race of darkness with
                            its own princes, from which all corruptible things
                            derive their origin. According to this opinion, all
                            men, as to their flesh, have come from the devil.
                            Further, they say that certain souls belong to that
                            creation which is good, and others to that which is
                            evil. Thus they said that our Lord said, you are of
                            your father, the devil, because they came from the
                            devil according to the flesh, and their souls were
                            part of that creation which was evil. But as Origen
                            says, to suppose that there are two natures because
                            of the difference between good and evil seems to be
                            like saying that the substance of an eye which sees
                            is different from that of an eye that is clouded or
                            crossed. For just as a healthy and bleary eye do not
                            differ in substance, but the bleariness is from some
                            deficient cause, so the substance and nature of a
                            thing is the same whether it is good or has a defect
                            in itself, which is a sin of the will. And so the
                            Jews, as evil, are not called the children of the
                            devil by nature, but by reason of their imitating
                            him.

                                        of envy towards man, whom he destroys.
                                        And from the sin of envy towards man,
                                        because of which he injures him, we can

                                        secondly, his sin against God, he did
                                        not stand in the truth.

                                            lies in the fact that he kills him.
                                            So he says, <b>he</b>, that is, the

                                            Here it should be noted that the
                                            devil kills man not with the sword,
                                            but by persuading him to do evil.
                                            "Through the devil's envy death
                                            entered the world" (Wis 2:24).
                                            First, the death of sin entered:
                                            "The death of the wicked is very
                                            evil" [Ps 33:22]; then came bodily
                                            death: "Sin came into the world
                                            through one man and death through
                                            sin" (Rom 5:12). As Augustine says:
                                            "Do not think that you are not a
                                            murderer when you lead your brother
                                            into evil." However, it should be
                                            noted with Origen, that the devil is
                                            not called a murderer with respect
                                            to only some particular person, but
                                            with respect to the whole race,
                                            which he destroyed in Adam, in whom
                                            all die, as we read in 1 Corinthians
                                            (c 15). Thus he is called a murderer
                                            because that is a chief
                                            characteristic, and he is so indeed
                                            from the beginning, that is, from
                                            the time that a man existed who
                                            could be killed, who could be
                                            murdered; for one cannot be murdered
                                            unless he first exists.

                                                against God, which consists in
                                                the fact that he turned away
                                                from the truth, which is God.
                                                First, he shows that he is
                                                turned from the truth; secondly,
                                                he shows that he is contrary to
                                                the truth: when he lies, he
                                                speaks according to his own
                                                nature. As to the first he does
                                                two things: first, he shows that
                                                the devil is turned from the
                                                truth; secondly, he explains
                                                what he has said, because there
                                                is no truth in him.

                                                    and the truth of deed. The
                                                    truth of word consists in a
                                                    person saying what he feels
                                                    in his heart and what is in
                                                    reality: "Therefore, putting
                                                    away falsehood, let every
                                                    one speak the truth with his
                                                    neighbor" (Eph 4:25); "He
                                                    who speaks truth from his
                                                    heart, who does not slander
                                                    with his tongue" (Ps 15:3).
                                                    The truth of deed, on the
                                                    other hand, is the truth of
                                                    righteousness, i.e., when a
                                                    person does what befits him
                                                    according to the order of
                                                    his nature. Concerning this
                                                    it says above: "He who does
                                                    what is true comes to the
                                                    light, that it may be
                                                    clearly seen that his deeds
                                                    have been wrought in God"
                                                    (3:21). Speaking of this
                                                    truth our Lord says, in the
                                                    truth, namely, the truth of
                                                    righteousness, he did not
                                                    stand, because he abandoned
                                                    the order of his nature,
                                                    which was that he be subject
                                                    to God, and through him
                                                    acquire his happiness and
                                                    the fulfillment of his
                                                    natural desire. And so,
                                                    because he wanted to obtain
                                                    this through himself, he
                                                    fell from the truth.

                                                        meanings. One is
                                                        according to the
                                                        Manicheans, who say that
                                                        the devil is evil by
                                                        nature. From this it
                                                        follows that he was
                                                        always evil, because
                                                        whatever is present by
                                                        nature is always
                                                        present. But this is
                                                        heretical, for we read:
                                                        "God made heaven and
                                                        earth, the sea, and all
                                                        that is in them" (Ps
                                                        146:6). Therefore, every
                                                        being is from God; but
                                                        everything which is from
                                                        God, insofar as it is,
                                                        is good.

                    then shows that the Jews are imitating these. Our Lord
                    ascribed two kinds of evil to the devil, murder and lying.
                    He reproved them before for their imitation of one of these,
                    namely, murder: "Now you seek to kill me, a man who has told
                    you the truth" (8:40). Then passing from this, he reproves
                    them for turning away from the truth: first, he shows that
                    they are turned away from the truth; secondly, he rejects a
                    certain reason they might give for this (v 46); thirdly, he
                    concludes to the true reason for their being turned away
                    from the truth (v 46b).

                        "If I tell you, you will not believe" (Lk 22:67); "If I

                        etc." (3:12). And Isaiah complains: "Who has believed
                        what we have heard?" (Is 53:1).

                            1255 The reason which the Jews might allege for
                            their unbelief is that Christ is a sinner, for it is
                            not easy to believe a sinner even when he is telling
                            the truth. Thus we read: "But to the wicked God
                            says: 'What right have you to recite my statutes?'"
                            (Ps 50:16). So they might have said: We do not
                            believe you since you are a sinner.

                                    According to Gregory, we are invited to
                                    consider the mildness of God, who did not
                                    consider it beneath himself to show by
                                    rational grounds that he who can justify
                                    sinners by the power of his divinity is not
                                    a sinner: "If I have rejected the cause of
                                    my manservant or my maidservant, when they
                                    brought a complaint against me; what then
                                    shall I do when God rises up?" (Jb 31:13).
                                    We should also honor the unique greatness of
                                    Christ's purity, for as Chrysostom says, no
                                    mere man could have confidently said, Which
                                    of you convicts me of sin? Only God, who had
                                    no sin, could say this: "Who can say, 'I
                                    have made my heart clean; I am pure from my
                                    sin?'" (Prv 20:9) - this is like saying: No
                                    one but God alone. "They have all gone
                                    astray, they are all alike corrupt; there is
                                    none that does good, no, not one," except
                                    Christ (Ps 14:3).

                                                point, saying,

                                                >. For we read in Sirach
                                                (13:15): "Every creature loves
                                                its like." Therefore, whoever is
                                                of God, to that extent possesses
                                                a likeness to the things of God
                                                and clings to them. Thus, he who
                                                is of God gladly hears the words
                                                of God: "Every one who is of the
                                                truth hears my voice" (18:37).
                                                The word of God ought to be
                                                heard gladly by those, above
                                                all, who are of God, since it is
                                                the seed by which we are made
                                                the children of God: "He called
                                                them gods to whom the word of
                                                God came" (10:35).

                  51 "Truly, truly, I say to you, if any one keeps my word, he
                  will never see death." 52 The Jews said to him, "Now we know
                  that you have a demon. Abraham died, as did the prophets; and
                  you say, 'If any one keeps my word, he will never taste
                  death.' 53 Are you greater than our father Abraham, who died?
                  And the prophets died! Who do you claim to be?" 54 Jesus
                  answered, "If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing; it is my
                  Father who glorifies me, of whom you say that he is your God.
                  55 But you have not known him; I know him. If I said, I do not
                  know him, I should be a liar like you; but I do know him and I
                  keep his word. 56 Your father Abraham rejoiced that he was to
                  see my day; he saw it and was glad." 57 The Jews then said to
                  him, "You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen
                  Abraham?" 58 Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you,
                  before Abraham was [came to be], I am." 59 So they took up
                  stones to throw at him; but Jesus hid himself, and went out of
                  the temple.

                    1270 Above, our Lord had promised two things to his
                    followers: liberation from darkness and the attainment of
                    life, saying, "He who follows me does not walk in darkness,
                    but will have the light of life" (8:12). The first of these
                    has been treated above; so we are now concerned with the
                    second, the obtaining of life through Christ. First, he
                    states the truth; secondly he counters its denial by the
                    Jews (v 52).

                        1271 It should be noted that although Christ had been
                        loaded down with insults and criticisms, he did not stop
                        his teaching; indeed, after being accused of having a
                        demon, he offers the benefits of his teachings more
                        generously, saying:

                        wicked men increases, and those that are converted are
                        abused with insults, preaching, so far from being
                        curtailed, should be increased: "And you, son of man, be
                        not afraid of them, nor be afraid of their words" (Ez
                        2:6); "the gospel for which I am suffering and wearing
                        fetters like a criminal. But the word of God is not
                        fettered" (2 Tim 2:9).

                            requires something, and he promises something. What
                            he requires is that his words be kept, if any one
                            keeps my word - for the word of Christ is the truth.
                            Therefore, we should keep it, first of all, by faith
                            and continual meditation: "Do not forsake her, and
                            she will keep you" (Prv 4:6); secondly, by
                            fulfilling it in action: "He who has my commandments
                            and keeps them, he it is who loves me" (14:21).

                                <i>quae fecerit homo, vivet in eis</i>.

                                What he promises is freedom from death; thus he
                                says, <b>he will never see death</b>, that is,
                                experience it: "They who act by me (i.e., by
                                divine wisdom) shall not sin; they who explain
                                me shall have life everlasting" [Sir 24:30].
                                Such a reward suits such merit, for life
                                everlasting consists especially in the divine
                                vision: "This is eternal life, that they know
                                thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom
                                thou has sent" (17:3). Now the seedbed and
                                source of this vision comes into us by the word
                                of Christ; "The seed is the word of God" (Lk
                                8:11). Therefore, just as a person who keeps the
                                seed of some plant or tree from being destroyed
                                succeeds in obtaining its fruit, so the person
                                who keeps the word of God attains to life
                                everlasting: "Keep my statutes and my ordinances
                                by doing which a man shall live" (Lev 18:5).

                                    presumption; secondly, Christ answers some
                                    of their retorts (v 54). As to the first
                                    they do three things: first, they insult
                                    Christ; secondly, they state a certain fact
                                    (v 52); and thirdly, they ask a question (v
                                    53).

                                        1273 They reproached him for lying when
                                        they said,
                                        <b
                                          >now we know that you have a demon.</b

                                        They said this because the Jews knew
                                        that the inventor of sin, and especially
                                        of lying, was the devil: "I will go
                                        forth and will be a lying spirit in the
                                        mouth of his prophets" (1 Kg 22:22). It
                                        seemed to them that our Lord's
                                        statement, "If any one keeps my word, he
                                        will never see death," was an obvious
                                        lie - for since they were carnal minded,
                                        they understood of physical death what
                                        he said about spiritual and eternal
                                        death; and especially also because it
                                        was contrary to the authority of Sacred
                                        Scripture, which says, "What man can
                                        live and never see death? Who can
                                        deliver his soul from the power of
                                        Sheol?" (Ps 89:48). For these reasons
                                        they said to him: you have a demon. It
                                        was like saying: You are lying because
                                        prompted by the devil.

                                            verba. Nam dominus dixit

                                            intelligunt, quod mortem, scilicet
                                            corporalem, non experietur in
                                            aeternum. Sed quantum ad verum
                                            intellectum differt, ut Origenes

                                            videre: nam videre mortem est eam
                                            perfecte experiri; gustare autem est

                                            convict him of lying: first, they
                                            mention the death of the ancients;
                                            secondly, they quote Christ's own
                                            words (v 52b). So they say: What you
                                            say, if any one keeps my word, he
                                            will never see death, is obviously
                                            false, for Abraham died, as is clear
                                            from Genesis (c 25); and the
                                            prophets died: "We must all die, we
                                            are like water split on the ground,
                                            which cannot be gathered up again"
                                            (2 Sam 14:14). But although they are
                                            dead in the bodily sense, they are
                                            not dead spiritually, for in Matthew
                                            (22:32) our Lord says: "I am the God
                                            of Abraham and the God of Isaac and
                                            the God of Jacob," and then he adds,
                                            "He is not God of the dead, but of
                                            the living." Thus, they were dead as
                                            to the body, but they were living in
                                            the spirit, because the Lord was
                                            speaking of, and not bodily death.
                                            Then, when they continue they wrote
                                            Christ's own words: And you say, If
                                            any one keeps my word, he will never
                                            taste death. But they were careless
                                            and evil listeners and so garbled
                                            our Lord's words and did not repeat
                                            them exactly. For our Lord had said,
                                            "he will never see death," but they
                                            quote it as "he will never taste
                                            death." However, as far as their
                                            understanding was concerned, it was
                                            all the same, because in both cases
                                            they understood that they would
                                            never experience a bodily death. But
                                            as Origen tells us, there is a real
                                            difference between seeing death and
                                            tasting death: for to see death is
                                            to experience it completely; while
                                            to taste it is to have some taste or
                                            share in death.

                                                before they see the Son of man
                                                coming in his kingdom" (Mt
                                                16:28). And there are others
                                                who, if they do not see death by

                                                taste it, because they have a

                                                and as Origen explains it, said,
                                                he will never see death, because
