                  1 After this Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples by
                  the Sea of Tiberias; and he revealed himself in this way. 2
                  Simon Peter, Thomas called the Twin [Didymus], Nathanael of
                  Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his
                  disciples were together. 3 Simon Peter said to them, "I am
                  going fishing." They said to him, "We will go with you." They
                  went out and got into the boat; but that night they caught
                  nothing. 4 Just as day was breaking, Jesus stood on the beach;
                  yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus. 5 Jesus said
                  to them, "Children, have you any fish?" They answered him,
                  "No." 6 He said to them, "Cast the net on the right side of
                  the boat, and you will find some." So they cast it, and now
                  they were not able to haul it in, for the quantity of fish.

                    2569 The Evangelist has just told of two appearances of
                    Christ to his disciples. Now he mentions a third appearance.
                    If we consider the order and purpose of these appearances,
                    it is evident that the first showed Christ's divine
                    authority by his breathing the Holy Spirit upon them; the
                    second showed that he was the same person as before, since
                    he let them view his wounds; and the third showed the
                    reality of his risen human nature, for he ate with them.

                        There are two parts in this. The Evangelist first
                        mentions Christ's dealing with a group of the disciples;
                        secondly, with two of them he especially loved (v 15).
                        As to the first, the Evangelist mentions the time and
                        circumstance of his appearance, and then adds a short
                        epilogue, <b>This was now the third time....</b>

                            et erunt beati. Dan. II, 11: <i>exceptis diis</i>,

                            Evangelist just narrated. It is significant that he
                            says this for it shows that Christ was not with them
                            continuously, but appeared to them at intervals. The
                            reason for this was that he had not risen with the
                            same life as before, but with a glorious life, as
                            the angels have and the blessed will have: "Except
                            the gods," that is, the angels, "whose dwelling is
                            not with flesh" (Dan 2:11).

                                addit hic hanc narrationem? Ad haec Augustinus
                                assignat rationem mysticam. Per hanc enim
                                apparitionem significatur gloria futurae vitae,
                                quando nobis apparebit <i>sicuti est</i>. Et
                                ideo post finem hanc posuit, ut faceret
                                evidentiorem locum quo illam daret intelligi.

                                2571 The Evangelist seemed to be ending his
                                gospel before, when he wrote,
                                <b
                                  >these are written that you may believe....</b

                                Why, then, does he add on this appearance?
                                Augustine gives a mystical reason for this,
                                which is that this appearance signifies the
                                glory of the future life, when Christ will
                                appear to us as he is.

                                And so the Evangelist put this appearance after
                                what seemed to be the end of his gospel so that
                                this could be better understood.

                                    person wishes, by non‑glorified bodies. That
                                    is why he says, <b>revealed</b>, i.e.,
                                    Christ made himself visible. In the same way
                                    he is said to appear, which means the same
                                    thing as to reveal, "appearing to them
                                    during forty days" (Acts 1:3). As Ambrose
                                    says, that appears in whose power it is to
                                    be seen or not seen.

                                        is going before you to Galilee" (Mt
                                        28:7). Secondly, he wanted to show that
                                        our Lord had banished the very great
                                        fear from the hearts of his disciples,
                                        so that they no longer remained shut up
                                        in their house, but even traveled as far
                                        as Galilee.

                  7 That disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, "It is the
                  Lord!" When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on
                  his clothes, for he was stripped for work, and sprang into the
                  sea. 8 But the other disciples came in the boat, dragging the
                  net full of fish, for they were not far from the land, but
                  about a hundred yards [two hundred cubits] off. 9 When they
                  got out on land, they saw [hot coals] a charcoal fire there,
                  with fish lying on it, and bread. 10 Jesus said to them,
                  "Bring some of the fish that you have just caught." 11 So
                  Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net ashore, full of
                  large fish, a hundred and fifty‑three of them; and although
                  there were so many, the net was not torn. 12 Jesus said to
                  them. "Come and [dine] have breakfast." Now none of the
                  disciples dared ask him, "Who are you?" They knew it was the
                  Lord. 13 Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them,
                  and so with the fish. 14 This was now the third time that
                  Jesus was revealed to the disciples after he was raised from
                  the dead.

                    2591 The Evangelist, having shown how the taking of the
                    great number of fish lead the disciples to recognize Christ,
                    now mentions the order in those recognizing him. First, he
                    mentions John; then Peter; and then actions of the other
                    disciples.

                        2592 John, being quick in understanding, recognized
                        Christ at once. So he said to Peter, whom he loved more
                        than the others, and also because Peter was above the
                        others in rank, <b>It is the Lord!</b> John was
                        convinced of this by the catch of the fish: "Thou dost
                        rule the raging of the sea" (Ps 88:8); "Whatever the
                        Lord pleases he does, in heaven and on earth in the seas
                        and all deeps" (Ps 134:6). He said,
                        <b>It is the Lord!</b> because they usually called him
                        this: "You call me teacher and Lord" (13:13).

                            2593 Peter is seen as passionately devoted to
                            Christ. His devotion is clear, first of all, by his
                            quickness to act:
                            <b

                                Secundo quantum ad reverentiam eius ad Christum:
                                quia noluit nudus prae pudore accedere,
                                <i>sed tunica succinxit se, erat enim nudus</i>,
                                et propter caliditatem terrae, et propter
                                expeditionem operis. Et per hoc datur intelligi
                                quod venientes ad Christum debent exuere veterem
                                hominem, et induere novum qui secundum Deum
                                creatus est in fide. Apoc. c. III, 5:
                                <i

                                Secondly, we see his devotion for Christ, for
                                out of modesty he did not want to appear naked,
                                but put on his clothes, for he was stripped for
                                work, because it was hot and it made working
                                easier. We can learn from this that those coming
                                to Christ ought to put off the old man and put
                                on the new, which has been created for God in
                                faith: "He who conquers shall be clad thus in
                                white garments, and I will not blot his name out
                                of the book of life" (Rev 3:5).

                                    Thirdly, his devotion is shown by his lack
                                    of fear: for because of his great love he
                                    was unwilling to stay in the boat, which was
                                    moving too slowly, and so he
                                    <b>sprang into the sea</b>, to reach Christ
                                    more quickly.

                                        2594 In the mystical interpretation, the
                                        sea signifies the troubles of this
                                        present world. Those who desire to come
                                        to Christ cast themselves into the sea,
                                        and do not refuse the tribulations of
                                        this world: "Through many tribulations
                                        we must enter the kingdom of God" (Acts
                                        14:22); "My son, if you come forward to
                                        serve the Lord, prepare yourself for
                                        trials" (Sir 2:1). Now Peter did cast
                                        himself into the sea and he reached
                                        Christ unharmed because the servant of
                                        Christ is kept safe and unharmed in the
                                        midst of tribulations: "You have given a
                                        path in the sea, and a safe way through
                                        the waves" [Wis 14:3]. As Chrysostom
                                        says, this incident very well brings out
                                        the difference between John and Peter:
                                        for John is seen to be greater in
                                        understanding, while Peter is more
                                        ardent in his affections.

                                                        are taken is the
                                                        teaching of the faith,
                                                        by which God draws us by
                                                        inspiring us from
                                                        within: "No one can come
                                                        to me unless the Father
                                                        who sent me draws him"
                                                        (6:44). The apostles

                  15 When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon

                  He said to him, "Yes, Lord; you know that I love you." He said

                  Lord; you know that I love you." He said to him, "Tend my

                  because he said to him the third time, "Do you love me?" And

                    2614 The Evangelist just showed what the Lord did for the
                    disciples in general; here he shows him dealing with his two
                    especially loved disciples: first, what he did for Peter;
                    and how he dealt with John (v 20). He does two things with
                    the first: first, he lays on Peter the pastoral office;
                    secondly, he predicts that he will be martyred (v18).

                        He imposes the pastoral office on Peter only after an
                        examination. Thus, those who are to be raised to this
                        office are first examined, "Do not be hasty in the
                        laying on of hands" (1 Tim 5:22). Christ examined him
                        three times, and so this part is divided into three
                        parts. In the first part we see our Lord's question (v
                        15); Peter's answer; and the imposition of the office (v
                        15). Looking at the first, we can consider three things:
                        the time of the examination; the tenor of the
                        conversation; and on what Peter was examined.

                            <b>When they had finished</b> the meal. This
                            signifies the spiritual meal by which the soul is
                            refreshed with spiritual gifts, even when it is
                            united to the body: "I will come in to him and eat
                            with him" (Rev 3:20). Therefore it is appropriate
                            that one who is raised to this office be already
                            refreshed with this joyous meal. Otherwise, how
                            could he refresh the hungry ones that come to him:
                            "I will feast the soul of the priests with
                            abundance" (Jer 31:14), with that abundance
                            mentioned in Psalm 63 (v 5): "My soul is feasted as
                            with marrow and fat."

                                2616 The tenor of the conversation is seen when
                                he says, <b>Jesus said to Simon Peter.</b> Three
                                things are given here which are necessary for a
                                prelate. First, obedience, when he says,
                                <b>Simon,</b> which means obedient. A prelate
                                needs to be obedient because one who does not
                                know how to obey superiors does not know how to
                                govern inferiors: "An obedient man will speak of
                                victory" [Prv 21:28]. Secondly, a prelate needs
                                knowledge, indicated by <b>Peter</b>, which
                                means understanding. A prelate needs
                                understanding for he is the appointed watchman,
                                and one who is blind is a poor watchman: "His
                                watchmen are blind" (Is 56:10); "Because you
                                have rejected knowledge, I reject you from being
                                a priest to me" (Hos 4:6). Thirdly, a prelate
                                needs grace, for he says
                                <b>son of John.</b> Prelates need grace because
                                if they do not have grace they do not have
                                anything: "By the grace of God I am what I am"
                                (1 Cor 15:10); "And when they perceived the
                                grace that was given to me, James and Cephas and
                                John, who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me
                                and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship" (Gal
                                2:9).

                                    convenienter. Petrus prius in peccatum
                                    ceciderat, ut patet supra, nec idoneus erat

                                    aboleretur: quod non fit nisi per caritatem.
                                    I Petr. IV, 8:
                                    <i>caritas operit multitudinem peccatorum</i

                                    scrutatur renes et corda, sed aliis: et ideo
                                    non quasi ignorans dicit
                                    <i>diligis me plus his?</i> Sed quia, ut
                                    dicitur I Io. IV, 18,
                                    <i>perfecta caritas foras mittit timorem</i
                                    >. Inde est quod Petro, qui cum dominus
                                    moreretur, timuit et negavit, resurgens
                                    dominus amorem inseruit, et fugavit timorem.
                                    Ideo qui tunc negavit timens mori,
                                    resurgente domino nil timuit. Quid enim
                                    timeret, cum iam mortem mortuam reperiret?

                                    2617 The questions are about love; and Jesus
                                    asks,
                                    <b>Do you love me more than these?</b> This
                                    was a suitable question, for Peter had
                                    previously fallen, as we saw before, and it
                                    was not appropriate that he be preferred to
                                    the others until his sin was forgiven ‑
                                    which is only brought about by charity:
                                    "Love covers a multitude of sins" (1 Pet
                                    4:8); "Love covers all offenses" (Prv
                                    10:12). So it was fitting that his charity
                                    be made known by this questioning, not
                                    indeed to him who looks into the depths of
                                    our hearts, but to others. So Christ said,
                                    but not as one who did not already know,
                                    <b>Do you love me more than these?</b> Now
                                    we read that "perfect love casts out fear"
                                    (1 Jn 4:18). Thus it was that when our Lord
                                    was about to die, Peter was afraid and
                                    denied him; but the risen Lord restored love
                                    and banished his fear. So Peter, who before
                                    had denied Christ because he was afraid to
                                    die, now, after our Lord has arisen, feared
                                    nothing. Why should he be afraid, since he
                                    now realized that death had died?

                                        2618 This questioning was also
                                        appropriate for the office, since many
                                        who assume a pastoral office use it as
                                        self‑lovers: "In the last days there
                                        will come times of stress. For men will
                                        be lovers of self" (1 Tim 3:1). One who
                                        does not love the Lord is not a fit
                                        prelate. A fit prelate is one who does
                                        not seek his own advantage, but that of
                                        Christ's; and he does this through love:
                                        "The love of Christ controls us" (2 Cor
                                        5:14). Love also becomes this office
                                        because it benefits others: for it is
                                        due to the abundance of love that those
                                        who love Jesus will at times give up the
                                        quiet of their own contemplation to help
                                        their neighbor. Although the: Apostle
                                        said, "I am sure that neither death nor
                                        life... will be able to separate us from
                                        the love of God" (Rom 8:39), he added,
                                        "For I could wish that I myself were
                                        accursed and cut off from Christ for the
                                        sake of my brethren" (Rom 9:3). Thus a
                                        prelate should be questioned about his
                                        love.

                                            the Philosopher says in his

                                            Thus he says that just as the soul
                                            is to the body that it rules, and
                                            reason is to our lower powers, so
                                            man is related to the irrational
                                            animals. And there ought to be a
                                            similar relation between prelates
                                            and their subjects. Thus, according
                                            to Gregory, the life of a pastor
                                            should be such that he is related to
                                            his subjects as a shepherd to his
                                            sheep.

                                                distinctions must be made. Some
                                                things are sufficient according
                                                to human judgment which are

                                                to the divine judgment.
                                                According to human judgment, if
                                                a person cannot be reproached
                                                for something, this is
                                                sufficient for his election to
                                                stand. For it is obvious that it
                                                would be difficult to have
                                                elections if they could be
                                                nullified because someone was
                                                found who was better than the

                                                it is sufficient if an election
                                                is honest and a suitable person

                                                    But, so far as concerns the
                                                    divine judgment, and our own
                                                    conscience, it is necessary
                                                    to choose that person who is
                                                    better. Now a person can be
                                                    unconditionally better; and
                                                    this is the way a holier
                                                    person is said to be better,
                                                    for holiness makes one good.
                                                    Yet such a person might not
                                                    be better for the Church.
                                                    For this purpose, that
                                                    person would be better who
                                                    is better educated, more
                                                    competent, more discerning,
                                                    and chosen more unanimously.
                                                    But if other things are
                                                    equal, such as the benefit
                                                    and welfare of the Church,
                                                    one would sin if he were to
                                                    choose a person who was less
                                                    unconditionally good than
                                                    another. There has to be a
                                                    reason for such a choice.
                                                    This is either the honor of
                                                    God and the benefit of the
                                                    Church, or some private
                                                    motive. If the motive is the
                                                    honor of God and the benefit
                                                    to the Church, these goods
                                                    will be regarded as linked
                                                    to the one chosen, and will
                                                    make him the better person,
                                                    in these respects. If there
                                                    is some private motive for
                                                    the choice, such as some
                                                    carnal love, the expectation

                                                        This is a clear sign
                                                        that he had retracted
                                                        his previous denial. And
                                                        it shows that if the
                                                        predestined fall, they

                                                        they are corrected.
                                                        Before his denial, Peter
                                                        thought that he was
                                                        better than the other
                                                        apostles, saying,
                                                        "Though they all fall
                                                        away because of you, I
                                                        will never fall away"
                                                        (Mt 26:33). And when
                                                        Jesus said to him, "You
                                                        will deny me three
                                                        times," Peter went
                                                        against this and even
                                                        boasted that "Even if I
                                                        must die with you, I
                                                        will not deny you" (Mt
                                                        26:35). But now, Peter,
                                                        having been conquered by
                                                        his own weakness, does
                                                        not presume to state his
                                                        love unless it is
                                                        attested to and
                                                        confirmed by the Lord.
                                                        He humbles himself
                                                        before Christ, saying,
                                                        <b

                                                        for he does not say that

                    2628 Above, our Lord entrusted the office of shepherd to
                    Peter. Now he foretells his martyrdom. This was pertinent
                    because a good shepherd should lay down his life for his
                    sheep (10:11). It was not granted to the young Peter to lay
                    down his life for Christ; but rather to the old Peter to lay
                    down his life for his sheep. This is what Christ foretold to
                    him. Christ first tells of Peter's past life; then he
                    predicts the end of his future life (v 18). Thirdly, the
                    Evangelist explains our Lord's words (v 19).

                        Conditio autem Petri praeterita fuit cum defectu, quia
                        in sua iuventute nimis praesumptuosus fuit, et propriae
                        voluntatis: est hoc enim proprium iuvenum, ut dicit
                        philosophus in sua rhetorica. Unde Eccle. XI, 9, quasi
                        obiurgando dicitur:
                        <i
                          >laetare, iuvenis, in adolescentia tua, et in bono sit

                          >cum esses iunior, cingebas te, et ambulabas ubi
                          volebas</i
                        >. Et dicit <i>cingebas te</i>, idest ab aliquibus
                        illicitis et superfluis cohibebas te, quasi tuo arbitrio
                        non passus quod ab aliquo cohibereris; et etiam inde est
                        quod in processu bonorum operum semper vis esse pro me
                        in periculis. Non tamen datum est tibi quod iuvenis pro
                        me patiaris, sed <i>cum senueris</i>, implebo tuum
                        desiderium, ut quae non es passus iuvenis, patiaris
                        senex: quia
                        <i>extendes manus tuas, et alius te cinget</i>.

                        tempus mortis Petri fluxerunt fere triginta septem anni:

                        2629 Peter's past life showed certain shortcomings, for
                        as a young man he was too presumptuous and self‑willed.
                        But this is characteristic of the young, as the
                        Philosopher says in his <i>Rhetoric.</i>
                        <a
                          href="John21.htm#_ftn22"

                        >
                        Thus we read in Ecclesiastes (11:9) a kind of reproach:
                        "Rejoice, O young man, in your youth, and let your heart
                        cheer you in the days of your youth; walk in the ways of
                        your heart and the sight of your eyes." Our Lord refers
                        to this trait of Peter and says,
                        <b
                          >When you were young, you girded yourself and walked
                          where you would.</b
                        >
                        He says, <b>you girded yourself</b>, that is, you
                        restrained yourself from certain unlawful and
                        superfluous things,
                        <b>but walked where you would,</b> not allowing yourself
                        to be kept in check by anyone. That is why you always
                        wanted to be in danger for my sake. But it was not
                        granted to you that you suffer for me when young,
                        <b>but when you are old</b> I will fulfill your desire
                        because
                        <b
                          >you will stretch out your hands, and another will
                          gird you.</b
                        >
                        What a wondrous prediction! It gives both the time and
                        the suffering. From the time these words were spoken
                        until Peter's death, about thirty‑seven years went by.
                        We can see from this that Peter was quite old.

                            Dicit autem, secundum Chrysostomum
                            <i>cum autem senueris</i>, quia aliter in humanis,
                            aliter in divinis: in humanis enim negotiis iuvenes
                            sunt utiles, senes vero inutiles; sed in divinis
                            virtus non tollitur propter senectutem, immo
                            aliquando magis roboratur. Ps. XCI, 11:
                            <i>senectus mea in misericordia uberi</i>; Deut.
                            XXXIII, 25:
                            <i
                              >sicut dies iuventutis tuae, ita et senectus
                              tua</i
                            >. Sed hoc intelligendum est in his qui in iuventute
                            sua in bono exercitantur, ut Tullius dicit. Sed qui
                            in iuventute sua dant se inertiae, non multum vel
                            nihil valent senes. Intelligitur etiam per hoc, ut
                            dicit Origenes super illud Matth. XXV, 19:
                            <i>post multum vero temporis reversus</i>, quod raro
                            inveniuntur utiles rectores et doctores Ecclesiae
                            parvo tempore vivere, et inducit exemplum de Paulo,
                            qui ut legitur Act. VII, 9, erat adolescens, et
                            postea scribit ad Philemonem v. 9,
                            <i>cum sis talis ut Paulus senex</i>. Et huiusmodi
                            ratio est, quia cum pauci inveniantur ad hoc idonei,
                            quando aliqui inveniuntur tales, conservantur a
                            domino ut diutius vivant.

                            <b>when you are old</b>, because human affairs are
                            different than divine affairs: in human affairs the

                            old age, rather it sometimes becomes even stronger:

                            92:10]; "As the days of your youth, so shall your
                            old age be" [Deut 33:25].

                            practiced virtue in their youth, as Cicero says.

                            For those who have passed their youth in idleness
                            will become of little or no value when old. This
                            also teaches us that we rarely find rulers and
                            teachers who are useful to the Church dying young,
                            as Origen remarks in his explanation of Matthew
                            (25:19): "Now after a long time the master of those
                            servants came."

                            He gives Paul as an example. In Acts (7:58) Paul is
                            seen as "a young man," but in Philemon (1:9) he is
                            "an old man." The reason for this is that people of
                            this caliber are so rare, that when they are found,
                            the Lord preserves them to a ripe old age.

                                Peter was crucified. Yet he was crucified using
                                ropes, not nails, so he would not die so
                                quickly. This is the girding spoken of by

                                    affectionis: nam inter animam et corpus est
                                    adeo naturalis amor quod numquam vellet
                                    anima a corpore separari, nec e converso. II
                                    Cor. V, v. 4:
                                    <i>nolumus expoliari, sed supervestiri</i>;
                                    Matth. XXVI, 38:

                                    scilicet naturae instinctu, qui sic est
                                    naturalis ut nec ipsa senectus potuerit eum

                                    minuit: unde ad Phil. I, 23:
                                    <i>cupio dissolvi, et esse cum Christo</i>;

                                    ipse repressit. I Petr. II, 21:

                                    Three things can be considered in the
                                    sufferings of the saints. First, there is a
                                    natural affection: there is such a natural
                                    love between the soul and the body that the
                                    soul never desires to be separated from the
                                    body, nor the body from the soul: "For while
                                    we are still in this tent, we sigh with
                                    anxiety; not that we would be unclothed, but
                                    that we would be further clothed" (2 Cor
                                    5:4); "My soul is very sorrowful, even to
                                    death" (Mt 26:38). This is why Christ says,
                                    <b>where you do not wish to go,</b> that is,
                                    by the impulse of nature, which is so rooted
                                    in nature that even old age could not
                                    destroy it in Peter. Yet, the desire due to
                                    grace weakens this: "My desire is to depart
                                    and be with Christ" (Phil 1:23); "We are of
                                    good courage, and we would rather be away
                                    from the body and at home with the Lord" (2
                                    Cor 5:8). Secondly, the intentions of the
                                    persecutors and the saints are different,
                                    <b
                                      >and carry you where you do not wish to
                                      go.</b
                                    >
                                    Thirdly, we see that we should be prepared
                                    to suffer, but not to kill ourselves. Thus
                                    Christ says,
                                    <b>you will stretch out your hands.</b> This
                                    clearly was the case with Peter: for when
                                    the people wanted to rebel against Nero and
                                    deliver Peter, he forbade it: "Christ also
                                    suffered for you, leaving you an example" (1
                                    Pet 2:21).

                                            or by death" (Phil 1:20); "But let
                                            none of you suffer as a murderer, or

                            be killed: "He killed James the brother of John with

                            according to Augustine, was that Peter not only
                            suffered death for Christ, but also followed Christ
                            even in the kind of death, that is, death by the
                            cross: "If any man would come after me, let him deny
                            himself and take up his cross and follow me" (Mt
                            16:24).

                            <b>Follow me,</b> Christ means in your office as
                            prelate, leader.

                            will make the nations your heritage" (Ps 2:8) ‑ so
                            will you be, in my place, over the whole Church.

                                        2639 First, John had the privilege of
                                        having Christ's special love. The
                                        Evangelist says,
                                        <b>Peter turned,</b> for he had begun to
                                        follow Jesus even bodily,
                                        <b
                                          >and saw following them the disciple
                                          whom Jesus loved.</b
                                        >
                                        Here we see that Peter, already made a
                                        shepherd, was intent on the care of
                                        others: "And when you have turned again,
                                        strengthen your brethren" (Lk 22:32).
                                        Now Jesus loved John without excluding
                                        the others, for above he said, "As the
                                        Father has loved me, so have I loved
                                        you" (15:9). But he loved John above the
                                        others with a special love. There were
                                        three reasons for this. First, because
                                        of his penetrating understanding: for
                                        teachers especially love their
                                        intelligent students: "A servant who
                                        deals wisely has the king's favor" (Prv
                                        14:35). Secondly, because of his purity,
                                        for he was a virgin: "He who loves
                                        purity of heart, and whose speech is
                                        gracious, will have the king as his
                                        friend" (Prv 22:11). Thirdly, because of
                                        his youth, for we have tender feelings
                                        for the young and the weak, and act with
                                        friendship towards them. And this is the
                                        way Christ acted with the youthful John:
                                        "When Israel was a child, I loved him"
                                        (Hos 11:1). We can see from this that
                                        God especially loves those who serve him
                                        from their youth: "My soul desires the
                                        first ripe figs" [Mic 7:1].

                                            <i>ego diligentes me diligo</i>. Sed
                                            Petrus diligebat plus Christum;
                                            supra:
                                            <i>diligis me plus his?</i> Ergo
                                            Christus plus debuit Petrum diligere
                                            quam Ioannem. Responsio. Posset
                                            dici, quod Ioannes quia plus
                                            dilectus, fuit felicior, sed Petrus
                                            quia plus diligens, fuit melior. Sed
                                            hoc esset contra iustitiam. Et ideo
                                            hoc refertur ad mysterium: nam per
                                            hos duos duplex vita significatur,
                                            scilicet activa et contemplativa, et
                                            utriusque finis et obiectum est
                                            Christus. Sed vita activa, quae
                                            signatur per Petrum, plus diligit
                                            Deum quam vita contemplativa, quae
                                            significatur per Ioannem: quia magis
                                            sentit praesentis vitae angustias,
                                            et aestuantius ab eis liberari
                                            desiderat et ad Deum ire.
                                            Contemplativam vero vitam Deus plus
                                            diligit, quia eam magis conservat;
                                            non enim simul finitur cum vita
                                            corporis, sicut vita activa. Ps.

                                            2640 But this seems to go against
                                            Proverbs (8:17): "I love those who
                                            love me." Peter loved Christ more
                                            than the others: "Do you love me
                                            more than these?" (21:15).
                                            Therefore, Christ should have loved
                                            Peter more than John. I answer: it
                                            could be said that John, because he
                                            was more loved, was happier; while
                                            Peter, because he loved more, was
                                            better. But this would be a
                                            violation of justice. Consequently,
                                            this refers to a mystery: that is,
                                            Peter and John stand for two kinds
                                            of life, the active and the
                                            contemplative, and the end and
                                            object of each is Christ. The active
                                            life, which Peter signifies, loves
                                            God more than the contemplative life
                                            (which is signified by John) because
                                            it feels more keenly the
                                            difficulties of this present life,
                                            and more intensely desires to be
                                            freed from them and to go to God.
                                            But God loves the contemplative life
                                            more, because he preserves it
                                            longer: it does not come to an end
                                            with death, as does the active life:
                                            "The Lord loves the gates of Zion
                                            more than all the dwelling places of
                                            Jacob" (Ps 87:2).

                                                problem using the literal sense.
                                                They distinguish two kinds of
                                                love in Christ, according to his
                                                two wills, his human and divine
                                                will. They say that Christ loved
                                                Peter more with his divine love,
                                                but he loved John more with his
                                                human love. The objection to
                                                this is that Christ's human will
                                                was entirely conformed to his
                                                divine will; and so the more he
                                                loved one with his divine will,
                                                so also he loved that one more
                                                with his human will. Therefore,
                                                we should say that he loves that
                                                one the more to whom he wills
                                                more good. He loved Peter more
                                                in the sense that he made Peter
                                                love him [Christ] more; Christ
                                                loved John more in another
                                                sense, that is, by giving him a
                                                keener understanding. "The Lord
                                                will fill him with the spirit of
                                                wisdom and understanding" [Sir
                                                15:3]. Accordingly, Peter is
                                                better because charity is better
                                                than knowledge (cf. 1 Cor 13:8);
                                                but John is better in keenness
                                                of understanding. However, only
                                                God can weigh their merits: "The
                                                Lord weighs the spirit" (Prv
                                                16:2).

                                                    And so others say, and this
                                                    is better, that Peter loved
                                                    Christ more in his members;
                                                    and in this way he was also
                                                    more loved by Christ. For
                                                    this reason the Church was
                                                    entrusted to him. But John
                                                    loved Christ more in
                                                    Himself, and in this way was
                                                    more loved by Christ, who
                                                    entrusted his mother to
                                                    John's care. Or, one could
                                                    say that Peter loved Christ
                                                    more readily and fervently.
                                                    While John was more loved by
                                                    being given tokens of
                                                    intimate friendship, which
                                                    Christ gave him on account
                                                    of his youth and purity.

                    2652 Now we have the last part of this Gospel, which is a
                    kind of epilogue. First, the Gospel is commended; and then
                    the vastness of the subject treated (v 25). The Gospel is
                    commended because of two things: its author, and its truth.
                    Three things are mentioned about the author.

                            John is said to have been loved more than the others
                            because of his unique charity: "By this all men will
                            know that you are my disciples, if you have love for
                            one another" (13:35). None of the other apostles
                            speak so much of love for others as does John in his
                            letters. We also read that as an old man he was
                            carried to the church by his followers to teach the
                            faithful. He taught only one thing: "Little
                            children, love one another." This is the perfection
                            of the Christian life.

                                    8:1); "The wisdom of the scribe depends on
                                    the opportunity of leisure; and he who has
                                    little business may become wise" (Sir
                                    38:24). For it was granted to John to live
                                    until the time when the Church was at peace;
                                    and this is the time when he wrote all these
                                    things. John mentions such things so that we
                                    will not think that his gospel has less
                                    authority than the other three, seeing that
                                    he wrote after the death of all the other
                                    apostles, and the other gospels, especially
                                    that of Matthew, had been approved by them.

                                        2656 Now John states that his Gospel is
                                        true, and he speaks in the person of the
                                        entire Church which received it: "My
                                        mouth will utter truth" (Prv 8:7). We
                                        should note that although many have
                                        written about Catholic truth, there is a
                                        difference among them: those who wrote
                                        the canonical scriptures, such as the
                                        evangelists and apostles and the like,
                                        so constantly and firmly affirm this
                                        truth that it cannot be doubted. Thus
                                        John says,
                                        <b>we know that his testimony is true</b
                                        >: "If any one is preaching to you a
                                        gospel contrary to that which you
                                        received, let him be accursed" (Gal
                                        1:9). The reason for this is that only
                                        the canonical scriptures are the
                                        standard of faith. The others have set
                                        forth this truth but in such a way that
                                        they do not want to be believed except
                                        in those things in which they say what
                                        is true.

                                                can be understood in two ways.
                                                First, the word
                                                <b>contain</b> can refer to the
                                                capacity of our minds to
                                                understand. So the meaning is:
                                                So much could be said about
                                                Christ that the world could not
                                                understand all that could be
                                                written: "I have yet many things
                                                to say to you, but you cannot
                                                bear them now," that is,
                                                understand them (16:12). We
                                                could also regard this statement
                                                as a deliberate exaggeration;
                                                and it then indicates the
                                                abundance of Christ's works.

                                                    quibusdam figuratis
                                                    locutionibus, sicut:
                                                    <i
                                                      >vidi dominum sedentem
                                                      super solium excelsum et
                                                      elevatum</i
                                                    >, et tamen non sunt falsae:
                                                    ita quando in sacra
                                                    Scriptura est aliqua locutio
                                                    hyperbolica. Non enim est
                                                    intentio dicentis ut
                                                    credatur quod dicit, sed
                                                    quod intendit significare,
                                                    scilicet excessum operum
                                                    Christi. Hoc tamen non fit
                                                    quando aliquid quod erat
                                                    obscurum vel dubium
                                                    exponitur, sed quando id
                                                    quod est apertum augetur vel
                                                    attenuatur; puta cum quis
                                                    volens copiam alicuius rei
                                                    commendare, dicit: hoc
                                                    sufficit centum personis vel
                                                    mille. Volens autem
                                                    vituperare dicit: hoc vix
                                                    sufficeret tribus. Nec tamen
                                                    falsum dicit: quia sic verba
                                                    rem quae indicatur excedunt,

                                                    intendit mentiri, sed
                                                    ostendere esse parum vel
                                                    multum.

                                                    resorts to hyperbole,
                                                    exceeding the truth.
                                                    According to Augustine,
                                                    Scripture does use figures
                                                    of speech, such as "I saw
                                                    the Lord seated on a high
                                                    and lofty throne" [Is 6:1],
                                                    and such statements are not
                                                    false.

                                                      name="_ftnref35"
                                                      id="_ftnref35"
                                                      >[35]</a

                                                    This is so when hyperbole is
                                                    used. The desire of the
                                                    speaker is not that we
                                                    accept the literal meaning
                                                    of the words, but what they
                                                    were intended to mean, that
                                                    is, the great number of
                                                    Christ's works. Hyperbole is
                                                    not used to explain what is
                                                    obscure or doubtful, but to
                                                    exaggerate or minimize what
                                                    is obvious. For example, to
                                                    emphasize how plentiful
                                                    something is, one can say
                                                    that there is enough for a
                                                    hundred or a thousand
                                                    people. And to minimize
                                                    something, one could say
                                                    that there is hardly enough
                                                    for three. This is not
                                                    speaking falsely, because it
                                                    is so obvious that the words
                                                    contort the reality that
                                                    they show that one does not
                                                    intend to lie, but to
                                                    indicate that something is
                                                    great or small.

                                                        For to write about each
                                                        and every word and deed
                                                        of Christ is to reveal
                                                        the power of every word
                                                        and deed. Now the words
                                                        and deeds of Christ are
                                                        also those of God. Thus,
                                                        if one tried to write
                                                        and tell of the nature
                                                        of every one, he could
                                                        not do so; indeed, the
                                                        entire world could not
                                                        do this. This is because
                                                        even an infinite number
                                                        of human words cannot
                                                        equal one word of God.
                                                        From the beginning of
                                                        the Church, Christ has
                                                        been written about; but
                                                        this is still not equal
                                                        to the subject. Indeed,
                                                        even if the world lasted
                                                        a hundred thousand
                                                        years, and books written
                                                        about Christ, his words
                                                        and deeds could not be
                                                        completely revealed: "Of
                                                        making many books there
                                                        is no end" (Eccl 12:12);
                                                        The works of God "are
