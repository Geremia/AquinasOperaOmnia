              In this text the life of the saints is described under three
              aspects: first, its narrowness, when it is called a
              <i>path:</i> “For the gate is narrow and the way is hard, that
              leads to life” (Mt. 7:14); “That path no bird of prey knows, and
              the falcon’s eye has not seen it” (Job 28:7); secondly, its
              splendor when he says, <i>the light of dawn:</i> “For once you
              were darkness, but now you are light in the Lord” (Eph. 5:8). For
              the just shine and, as a result, their life shines. Thirdly, its
              progress, because it is always growing: “Long for the pure
              spiritual milk, that by it you may grow up to salvation” (1 Pet.
              2:2); and this even until the full <i>day</i> of glory; “When the
              perfect comes, the imperfect will pass away” (1 Cor. 13:10).

              not know over what they stumble” (Prov. 4:19); “The gate is wide
              and the way is easy, that leads to destruction, and those who

              Ex his verbis trahi potest materia huius epistolae. Erant enim
              Philippenses in Christi recta semita, tribulationes multas pro
              Christo sustinentes. Item, illuminati per fidem, infra II, 15:
              <i>inter quos lucetis</i>, et cetera. Item, proficiebant, ut patet
              per totam epistolam. Item, convenienter post epistolam ad
              Ephesios, in qua fit instructio qualiter servanda sit
              ecclesiastica unitas, hi proponuntur in exemplum servandae
              ecclesiasticae unitatis, qui optime eam servaverunt.

              From these words we can gather the subject matter of this letter.
              For the Philippians were on Christ’s narrow way, enduring many
              tribulations for Christ. They were enlightened by faith: “Among
              whom you shine as lights in the world” (Phil. 2:15). Furthermore,
              they were making progress, as is clear from the entire letter.
              Therefore, after the letter to the Ephesians, in which an
              instruction was given on preserving Church unity, it was fitting
              that those who best preserved it should be held up as an example
              of preserving the unity of the Church.

                in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the bishops and
                deacons: 2 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the
                Lord Jesus Christ. 3 1 thank my God in all my remembrance of
                you, 4 always in every prayer of mine for you all making my
                prayer with joy, 5 thankful for your partnership in the gospel
                from the first day until now. 6 And I am sure that he who began
                a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of
                Jesus Christ. 7 It is right for me to feel thus about you all,
                because I hold you in my heart, for you are all partakers with
                me of grace, both in my imprisonment and in the defense and
                confirmation of the gospel.

              indicates his humility: “The least one shall become a clan, and
              the smallest one a mighty nation” (Is. 60:22). Secondly, the
              co-sender, when he says, <i>and Timothy,</i> because he was their
              preacher: “I have no one like him, who will be genuinely anxious
              for your welfare” (<i>infra</i> 2:20).

              servitutem, et de hac intelligitur dictum praemissum Io. XV, 6.

              Then when he says,
              <i>servants of Christ Jesus,</i> he states their condition: “For
              what we preach is not ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, with
              ourselves as your servants for Jesus’ sake” (2 Cor. 4:5). But this
              seems to conflict with John (15:15): “No longer do I call you
              servants, for the servant does not know what his master is doing.”
              I answer that there are two kinds of servitude, corresponding to
              the two kinds of fear. Fear of punishment causes evil servitude,
              and this is the kind meant in the above text from John. But chaste
              fear causes reverential servitude, which is the kind the Apostle
              has in mind.

              Personae salutatae sunt omnes de Ecclesia Philippensi. Et, primo,
              minores. Unde dicit
              <i>omnibus sanctis qui sunt Philippis</i>, quae est civitas quam
              Philippus condidit; et dicit <i>sanctis</i>, et hoc propter
              Baptismum. Rom. c. VI, 3:
              <i

                sumus</i

              Quaestio est quare minores praeponit maioribus? Quia prius est
              populus, quam praelatus. Ez. XXXIV, 2:
              <i>nonne greges pascuntur a pastoribus?</i>
              Greges enim pascendi sunt a pastoribus, non e converso. Item cur
              intermittit presbyteros? Respondeo. Dicendum est quod
              comprehenduntur cum episcopis, quia in una civitate non sunt
              plures episcopi. Unde dicens in plurali, dat intelligere etiam
              presbyteros. Et tamen est alius ordo, quia ex ipso Evangelio hoc
              legitur quod post designationem duodecim apostolorum (quorum
              personas gerunt episcopi), designavit septuaginta duos discipulos,
              quorum locum sacerdotes tenent. Dionysius etiam distinguit
              episcopos et sacerdotes. Sed in principio, licet ordines fuerint
              distincti, non tamen nomina ordinum; unde hic comprehendit
              presbyteros cum episcopis.

              which is a city founded by Philip. He calls them
              <i>saints</i> on account of their baptism: “Do you not know that
              all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized
              into his death?” (Rom. 6:3). He includes the greater ones when he
              says, <i>with the bishops and deacons.</i> But why does he mention
              the lesser ones before the greater? Because the people are prior
              to the prelate: “Should not shepherds feed the sheep?” (Ez. 34:2).
              For the flocks are to be fed by the shepherds, and not vice versa.
              But why does he not mention the priests? I answer that they are
              included with the bishops, because there are not a number of
              bishops in a city; hence when he puts it in the plural, he means
              to include priests. Yet it is a distinct order, because we read in
              the gospel that after appointing twelve apostles (whose persons
              the bishops manifest), He appointed seventy-two disciples, whose
              place the priests hold. Dionysius also distinguished bishops from
              priests. But in the beginning, although the orders were distinct,
              there were not distinct names for the orders; hence here he
              includes priests with bishops.

              <i>For you all:</i> “Your people shall all be righteous; they

              The reason for his joy is given when he says:
              <i>It is right for me to feel thus about you all,</i>

              As if to say: I have this knowledge of you that you are such;
              therefore, I rejoice so that you might rejoice in the things in
              which I rejoice, which
              <i>is in my imprisonment.</i>
              For he was imprisoned for Christ at that time and he rejoiced in
              it: “Count it all joy, my brethren, when you meet various trials,
              for you know that the testing of your faith produces
              steadfastness. And let steadfastness have its full effect” (Jas.
              1:2); “Then they left the presence of the council, rejoicing that
              they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the name” (Acts
              5:41).
              <i>And in the defense and confirmation of the gospel,</i>
              namely, in preaching boldly against tyrants and heretics, and
              confirming the gospel in the hearts of the faithful: “He departed
              and went from place to place through the region of Galatia and
              Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples” (Acts 18:23). Or another
              way according to a Gloss:
              <i>in my heart,</i>
              i.e., in my desire that you be partakers of eternal joy: “No one
              will take your joy from you” (Jn. 16:22). And this cannot be
              snatched from my heart, for even though I am imprisoned and intent
              on confirming and defending the gospel, my anxiety for you has not
              slipped from my heart.

                word of God without fear. 15 Some indeed preach Christ from envy
                and rivalry, but others from good will. 16 The latter do it out
                of love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the
                gospel; 17 the former proclaim Christ out of partisanship, not
                sincerely but thinking to afflict me in my imprisonment.

              Affectus enim interior perficitur per charitatem, et ideo non

              nobis operatur. II Cor. IX, 8:
              <i
                >potens est autem Deus omnem gratiam abundare facere in vobis,

              Matth. V, 20:
              <i
                >nisi abundaverit iustitia vestra plus quam Scribarum et

              Then when he says, <i>and it is my prayer,</i> he mentions his
              prayer. He asks three things: the first pertains to increasing
              charity within. For the interior affections are perfected by
              charity; therefore, if one lacks charity, he should desire to
              obtain it; if he has it, he should desire that it be made perfect.
              Hence he says,
              <i>that your love may abound more and more.</i>
              God is the one from whom an increase of charity should be sought,
              because God is the only one who works this in us: “God is able to
              provide you with every blessing in abundance, so that you may
              always have enough of everything and may provide in abundance for
              every good work” (2 Cor. 9:8). Hence it is necessary that we pray
              for it, because “unless your righteousness exceeds that of the
              scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven”
              (Mt. 5:20).

              Secundo quantum ad intellectum. Unde dicit
              <i>in omni scientia</i>. Sed numquid ex charitate provenit
              scientia? Sic, quia dicitur I Io. II, 27:
              <i
                >et vos unctionem quam accepistis ab eo, maneat in vobis, et non
                necesse habetis ut aliquis doceat vos, sed sicut unctio eius
                docet vos de omnibus</i
              >, et cetera. Item, charitas est spiritus, de quo dicitur Io. XVI,
              13: <i>cum venerit ille spiritus veritatis, docebit vos omnem</i>,
              et cetera. Cuius ratio est, quia qui habet habitum, si rectus est
              habitus, sequitur inde rectum iudicium de his quae pertinent ad
              illum habitum; si vero corruptus, falsum. Sicut circa venerea
              temperatus habet bonum iudicium, intemperatus non sed falsum.
              Omnia autem quae a nobis fiunt, sunt informanda charitate, et ideo
              habens charitatem, habet rectum iudicium, et quantum ad
              cognoscibilia. Et sic dicit <i>in omni scientia</i>, qua scilicet
              agnoscat veritatem et inhaereat circa ea quae sunt fidei. Haec est
              scientia sanctorum, de qua dicitur Sap. X, 10. Et quantum ad
              operabilia, et sic dicit <i>et in omni sensu</i>, qui est vis
              cognoscitiva circa exteriora obiecta. Et proprium eius est ut
              statim iudicet de proprio sensibili recte. Et ideo hoc nomen
              translatum est ad interius iudicium rationis; unde sensati
              dicuntur qui habent rectum iudicium circa agibilia. Sap. I, v. 1:
              <i>sentite de domino in bonitate</i>, et cetera. Sap. c. VI, 16:
              <i>cogitare ergo de illa, sensus est consummatus</i>, et cetera.
              Sed hic sensus debet esse non tantum considerativus sed etiam
              discretivus inter bonum et malum, et inter bonum et melius. Unde
              subdit <i>ut probetis</i>, et cetera. Nota quod charitas perficit
              sensum ut probet bona; sed perfecta charitas ut probet meliora. I
              Cor. XII, 31: <i>aemulamini meliora charismata</i>, etc. et infra
              cap. XIV: <i>sectamini charitatem</i>, et cetera. Et ideo dicit
              <i>potiora</i>. Tertio quantum ad effectum. Et primo ponit
              immunitatem a malo; secundo perfectionem in bono. Primum in hoc
              quod dicit <i>ut sitis sinceri</i>. Est enim duplex peccatum
              vitandum, scilicet interioris corruptionis, qua homo corrumpitur
              in se, et hoc excluditur per sinceritatem. I Cor. V, 8:
              <i>in azymis sinceritatis</i>, et cetera. Aliud est in proximum,
              scilicet offensa. Et ideo dicit <i>et sine offensa</i>. I Cor. IV,
              10:
              <i
                >sine offensione estote Iudaeis et gentilibus, et Ecclesiae Dei,
                sicut ego</i
              >, et cetera. Et II Cor. VI, 3:

              <i>In diem Christi Iesu</i>, id est usque in finem vitae. Matth.

              ad gratiam dicit <i>repleti fructu iustitiae</i>, ut opera
              iustitiae quaedam fructus sint. Rom. VI, 22:
              <i>habetis fructum vestrum in sanctificatione</i>, et cetera. Vel
              <i>fructu iustitiae</i>, id est praemio iustitiae, scilicet

              The second request regards understanding; hence he says,
              <i>with knowledge.</i> But does knowledge arise from charity? It
              seems so, because it is stated in 1 John (2:27): “But the
              anointing which you received from him abides in you, and you have
              no need that any one should teach you; as his anointing teaches
              you about everything, and is true, and is no lie.” Furthermore,
              charity is the Spirit, of whom it is said in John (16:13): “When
              the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth.”
              The reason for this is that when a person has a habit, if that
              habit is right, then right judgment of things pertaining to that
              habit follows from it; but if it is corrupted, then false judgment
              follows. Thus, the temperate person has good judgment in regard to
              sex, but an intemperate person does not, having a false judgment.
              Now all things that are done by us must be informed with charity.
              Therefore, a person with charity has a correct judgment both in
              regard to things knowable; hence be says,
              <i>with knowledge,</i> by which one recognizes the truth and
              adheres to the truths of faith; and this is the knowledge of holy
              things mentioned in Wisdom (10:10); and in regard to things to be
              done; hence he says, <i>and all discernment</i> (<i>sense</i>),
              which is the faculty that deals with external objects. Its
              function is to judge correctly and quickly about the proper object
              of sense. As a result, this name has been transferred to the
              internal judgment of reason; hence, those who possess correct
              judgment in regard to what they should do are called sensible:
              “Think,” i.e., sense, “of the Lord with uprightness” (Wis. 1: 1):
              “To fix one’s thought on,” i.e., to sense, “her is perfect
              understanding” (Wis. 6:15). But this discernment should be able
              not only to recognize, but also to distinguish between, good and
              evil, and between good and better; hence he says, so
              <i>that you may approve what is excellent:</i>
              “Earnestly desire the higher gifts” (1 Cor. 12:31) and in (15:1):
              “Make love your aim, and earnestly desire the spiritual gifts;”
              hence he says, <i>what is excellent.</i> The third request
              concerns behavior. First, he mentions immunity from evil, when he
              says that you may be <i>pure.</i> For there are two evils to be
              avoided: first, internal destruction, by which a man is destroyed
              in himself; and this is excluded by sincerity: “the unleavened
              bread of sincerity and truth” (1 Cor. 5:8). The other concerns our
              neighbor, namely, offenses; hence he says,
              <i>and blameless:</i> “Give no offense to Jews or to Greeks or to
              the church of God, just as I try to please all men in everything I
              do” (1 Cor. 10:32); “We put no obstacle in anyone’s way, so that
              no fault may be found with our ministry” (2 Cor. 6:3).
              <i>For the day of Christ,</i> i.e., to the end of our lives: “He
              who endures to the end will be saved” (Mt. 24:13). As to the
              effects of grace he says,
              <i>filled with the fruits of righteousness.</i>
              Good works are the fruit: “The return (fruit) you get is
              sanctification and its end, eternal life” (Rom. 6:22). Or,
              <i>the fruits of righteousness,</i> i.e., the reward of justice,
              namely, the crown: “Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown
              of righteousness” (2 Tim. 4:8); “For the fruit of good labors is
              renowned” (Wis. 3:15). This is obtained
              <i>through Jesus Christ,</i> because all that we do is good
              through Him. “Apart from me you can do nothing” (Jn. 15:5).
              Furthermore, these things must be done for this end,
              <i>to the glory and praise of God,</i> because God is glorified by
              the works of the saints, since they cause other people to break
              out in praise of God: “Praise God in his sanctuary (saints)” (Ps.
              156: 1); “And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and a
              glory before all the nations of the earth who shall hear of all
              the good that I do for them” (Jer. 33:9).

              manifestum fuerat quod talia pro Christo pateretur constanter, ita
              ut vincularetur, unde dicitur <i>ut vincula</i>, etc., quod est
              gloriosum pro Christo. I Petr. c. IV, 15:
              <i
                >nemo vestrum patiatur quasi homicida, aut fur, aut alienorum
                appetitor; si autem ut Christianus, non erubescat</i
              >, et cetera. <i>In omni praetorio</i>, sicut in curia Caesaris,
              et cetera. Ex parte vero aliorum fides crescebat in communi. Unde
              dicit <i>ut plures</i>, et cetera. I Mach. c. IV: de elephantibus.
              Eccli. X, 2: <i>secundum iudicem populi, sic et ministri eius</i>,
              et cetera. Prov. XVIII:
              <i>iustus quasi leo confidens absque terrore erit</i>, et cetera.
              Ex parte tamen aliorum est diversitas, quia quidam bene
              loquebantur, quidam male. Et qui bene, quidam ex generali
              charitate et quidam ex speciali amore ad apostolum. Et qui male,
              quidam ex generali malitia, quidam ex speciali odio ad apostolum.
              Sed ut mihi videtur, apostolus duplicem ostendit causam propter
              quam quidam praedicabant. Primo propter invidiam. Et ideo
              apostolus eorum pravam intentionem ostendit, dicens
              <i>quidam quidem propter invidiam</i>, et cetera. Iac. III, 16:
              <i
                >ubi zelus et contentio, ibi inconstantia, et omne opus
                pravum</i
              >. I Cor. c. III, 3:
              <i>cum sit inter vos zelus et contentio, nonne carnales estis?</i>
              Secundo propter amorem Christi, et Evangelii. Unde dicit
              <i>quidam propter bonam</i>, et cetera. Ps. CL, 20:
              <i>benigne fac in bona voluntate</i>, et cetera. Sed apostolus
              addit dicens <i>quidam vero ex charitate</i>, scilicet quae facit
              bonam voluntatem, etc., quia ut supplerent defectum mei docentis,
              praedicaverunt. Deinde apostolus exponit quod dixerat, dicens quod
              quidam non secundum sanam intentionem, sed ex contentione.
              Corrupta eorum intentio dupliciter patuit: uno modo ut publice
              praedicando, turbationem facerent in populo gentili contra
              apostolum, supra illam quam habuit. Alio modo quia credebant quod
              Paulus audiens eos usurpare officium sibi commissum, turbaretur et
              ex hoc adderetur afflictio afflicto.

              Then he shows his own progress; secondly, that of others (1:14).
              In regard to himself, of course, it was obvious that he suffered
              for Christ with constancy,
              <i
                >so that it has become known... that my imprisonment is for
                Christ.</i
              >
              This redounds to Christ’s glory: “But let none of you suffer as a
              murderer, or a thief, or a wrongdoer, or a mischief-maker; yet if
              one suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but under that
              name let him glorify God” (1 Pet. 4:15).
              <i>Throughout the whole praetorian guard,</i>
              and in Caesar’s court. As for the progress of others, their faith
              has grown apace:
              <i
                >most of the brethren have been made confident in the Lord
                because of my imprisonment, and are much more bold to speak the
                word of God without fear.</i
              >
              “Like the magistrate of the people, so are his officials” (Si.
              10:2); “The righteous are bold as a lion” (Prov. 28:1). Yet there
              is some diversity among these, because some spoke properly and
              some not. Of those who spoke properly, some did so out of general
              love, and others out of love for the Apostle; of those who spoke
              improperly, some acted out of general malice, and some out of
              personal hatred of the Apostle. Yet it seems to me that the
              Apostle is revealing the two reasons why some preached: first,
              because of envy; consequently, to show their evil intention the
              Apostle says,
              <i>from envy and rivalry:</i> “For where jealousy and selfish
              ambition exists, there will be disorder and every vile practice”
              (Jas. 3:16); “For while there is jealousy and strife among you,
              are you not of the flesh?” (1 Cor. 3:5); secondly, out of love for
              Christ and the gospel; hence he says,
              <i>but others from good will:</i>
              “Deal favorably, O Lord, in your good will with Sion” (Ps. 50:20).
              The Apostle continues,
              <i>the latter do it out of love,</i>
              which causes good will, because they preached to make up for my
              being prevented from teaching. Then the Apostle explains what he
              had said, saying that,
              <i>the former proclaim Christ out of partisanship</i>
              and not according to a right intention. For their depraved
              intention is clear in two ways: first, by preaching publicly they
              caused a disturbance among the Gentiles against the Apostle and
              thus added to the affliction he already had; secondly, because
              they believed that Paul would be disturbed, when he heard that
              they were usurping the task committed to him, thereby adding more
              affliction to one already afflicted.

              effectu, sed de causa non. Et sic de redemptione per Christum,
              licet fuerit ex scelere Iudae et Iudaeorum. Ita contigit in
              Ecclesia, ubi provenit utilitas quandoque per bonos praedicatores

              Sometimes it happens that joy arises from a good cause, and this
              directly and of itself; sometimes from an evil cause, and this
              indirectly and by accident. For when it springs from a good cause,
              one should rejoice both in the effect and in the cause, as in the
              case of giving an alms for the glory of God; but when it springs
              from an evil cause, one should rejoice in the effect but not in
              the cause, as in the redemption by Christ, since it came about
              from the crime committed by Judas and the Jews. The same thing
              happens in the Church when something beneficial results from good
              preachers with a good intention, and from evil preachers with an
              evil intention; nevertheless, one should rejoice in both cases, as
              has been said. He says, therefore:
              <i
                >what then? Only that in every way, whether in pretence or in
                truth, Christ is proclaimed; and in that I rejoice. Yes, and I
                shall rejoice.</i
              >
              One announces Christ <i>in pretense</i> when he does not chiefly
              aim at this but at something else, as profit or glory; “He who is
              estranged seeks pretexts” (Prov. 18:1); but <i>in truth,</i> when
              it is done with a right intention: “Remember now, 0 Lord, I
              beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in faithfulness and
              with a whole heart, and have done what is good in thy sight” (Is.
              38:3). But either way the results are good for the Church; hence
              he says,
              <i>Christ is proclaimed, and in that I rejoice,</i>
              because if something other than Christ were proclaimed, there
              would be reason for concern. This happens when false doctrine is
              taught; “The shepherd who teaches for the sake of the truth should
              be loved; the hireling who teaches for gain should be tolerated;
              but the one who teaches what is false must be expelled”
              (Augustine).

              he deserve who gains the salvation of many? Now help depends on
              three things: first, on prayer by others; hence he says,
              <i>through your prayers,</i> by which I hope to be helped by God:
              “Pray for one another that you may be healed. The prayer of a
              righteous man has great power in its effects” (Jas. 5:16).
              Secondly, on God, in whom we place our hope for salvation: [“In
              your presence we have conceived, and have been as it were in labor
              and have brought forth the spirit of salvation”] (Is. 12:18);
              hence he says,
              <i>and the help of the Spirit of Jews Christ:</i>
              “The Spirit helps us in our weakness” (Rom. 8:26).
              <i>This will turn out for my deliverance.</i>
              He speaks in a simile; for when a person is infirm, be needs to be
              delivered from his infirmity, if he is to be kept alive; and this
              is to help. But we are weak and infirm; therefore, we need the
              help of the Spirit: “He will teach you all things, and bring to
              your remembrance all that I have said to you” (Jn. 14:26), by
              helping us, as it were. Thirdly, help depends on our trust in God,
              because “he who trusts in his riches will fair (Prov. 11:28).
              Therefore, our hope must be in God: “Those who trust in the Lord
              are like Mount Zion, which cannot be moved, but abides forever”
              (Ps. 125:1); hence he says,
              <i>it is my eager expectation and hope.</i>

              But isn’t hope the expectation of future happiness? I answer that
              hope is a movement of the appetite toward an arduous good; and
              this can occur in two ways: sometimes a person hopes to obtain
              something by himself, and then there is hope without expectation;
              but sometimes he hopes to obtain something through someone else,
              and then there is hope with expectation. This is the way we
              expect, when we have the hope of obtaining something through
              someone else: [“With expectation I have waited for the Lord, and
              he was attentive to me”] (Ps. 40: 1); “For in this hope we were

              He shows that his intention is right because
              <i>Christ will be honored.</i>
              Since He is God, He cannot be honored (increased) or diminished in
              Himself, but in us, i.e., in our knowledge. For a person honors
              Christ when he increases his knowledge of Him: “Who can extol him
              as he is?” (Si. 43:31). And this in word and deed, when the
              greatness of His effects shows His greatness. Among these
              marvelous effects is justification. But as long as this lies
              hidden in a man’s heart, Christ is not honored by it, except in
              that heart, but not in regard to others, until it breaks out into
              external visible actions. Hence be says,
              <i>in my body.</i> Christ is honored in our body in two ways: in
              one way, inasmuch as we dedicate our body to his service by
              employing our bodies in his ministry: “Glorify God in your body”
              (1 Cor. 6:20); in another way by risking our body for Christ: “If
              I deliver my body to be burned” (1 Cor. 13:3). The first is
              accomplished by life, the second by death: hence he says,
              <i>whether by</i> life, because the body acts only when living, or
              by <i>death:</i> “If we live, we live to the Lord, and if we die,
              we die to the Lord” (Rom. 14:8). This can also refer to spiritual
              death: “Put to death therefore what is earthly in you” (Col. 3:5).

              Then he explains how He will be honored (?) by life and death,
              saying:
              <i>for to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</i>
              Now life produces activity, for that seems to be at the root of
              man’s life which is the principle of his activity. Hence some call
              that by which they are roused to activity, their life; as hunters
              call hunting their life, and friends their friend. So, Christ is
              our life, because the whole principle of our life and activity is
              Christ; hence the Apostle says,
              <i>for to me to live is Christ,</i>
              because Christ alone moved him,
              <i>and to die is gain.</i>
              Here the Apostle is speaking precisely. For a person regards it a
              gain when he can improve the imperfect life he has; thus a sick
              person regards a healthy life a gain. Our life is Christ: “Your
              life is hid with Christ in God” (Col. 3:3). But here it is
              imperfect: “While we are at home in the body we are away from the
              Lord” (2 Cor. 5:6). Therefore, when we die in the body, our life,
              namely, Christ, with whom we are then present, is perfected in us”
              [“He gives to his beloved in sleep”] (Ps. 126:2); “The time of my
              departure has come” (2 Tim. 4:6).

              But why do you hesitate? Because I
              <i>am hard pressed between the two.</i>
              First, he gives a reason for one side; secondly, for the other
              side. The first reason is that there are two impulses in man, the
              impulse of nature and that of grace: of nature, not to die: “Not
              that we would be unclothed, but that we would be further clothed”
              (2 Cor. 5:5); “And another will carry you where you do not wish to
              go” (Jn. 21:18); and the impulse of grace, which charity follows,
              is to love God and neighbor. This impulse to love God moves us to
              be with God; hence he says,
              <i>my desire is to depart,</i>
              not absolutely, but
              <i>to be with Christ:</i>
              “We are of good courage, and we would rather be away from the body
              and at home with the Lord” (2 Cor. 5:8). This shows the error in
              the opinion of the Greeks that the souls of the saints are not
              with Christ immediately after death. The reason why I desire this
              is that to
              <i>be with Christ is far better.</i>
              “Whom have I in heaven but thee? And there is nothing upon earth
              that I desire besides thee” (Ps. 73:25); “For a day in thy courts
              is better than a thousand elsewhere” (Ps. 84:10). But love of
              neighbor moves us to desire his betterment; hence he says,
              <i
                >but to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your
                account,</i
              >
              i.e., my life is necessary for your benefit: “For if we are beside
              ourselves, it is for God; if we are in our right mind, it is for
              you” (2 Cor. 5:13). Or another way, I
              <i>am hard pressed between the two,</i>
              i.e., on two sides: there arises a desire
              <i
                >to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better. But to
                remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account.</i
              >
              The sense is not changed.

              But this does not seem to be subject to doubt; indeed, the Apostle
              seems to be inclined to the worse side. For the love of God rouses
              the first desire in us, and the love of neighbor the second. But
              the first is a greater and better desire. Therefore [Paul has
              chosen the less perfect]. I answer that the love of God is
              twofold, namely, concupiscible love, by which a man wills to love
              God and find his delight in Him; and this is for the man’s good.
              The other is the love of friendship, by which a man prefers the
              honor of God, even over this delight with which he enjoys God; and
              this is perfect charity. Hence it is stated in Romans (8:38): “For
              I am sure that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor
              principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor
              powers, nor height, nor depth nor anything else in all creation,
              will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus
              our Lord.” And then he continues in (9:3): “For I could wish that
              I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my
              brethren.” He said this to show that be possessed a more perfect
              charity, as though for the love of God and neighbor he was
              prepared to lose the delight of seeing God. Therefore, he shows
              this as something more perfect.

              thing required of them is that they live worthy of the gospel of
              Christ, in a manner that conforms to that gospel: “We exhorted
              each one of you and encouraged you and charged you to lead a life
              worthy of God, who calls you into his own kingdom and glory” (1
              Thess. 2:12); “To lead a life worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing
              to him” (Col. 1: 10). And this is my joy: “No greater joy can I
              have than this, to hear that my children follow the truth” (3 Jn.
              4). Now he specifically desires from them unity and constancy.
              There are three kinds of unity required of the saints: first, the
              unity of love; hence he says,
              <i>that I may hear,</i> namely,
              <i>that you stand firm in one spirit,</i>
              through love: “Eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the
              bond of peace” (Eph. 4:3), and in 1 Corinthians (6:17) “He who is
              united to the Lord becomes one spirit with him.” Secondly, the
              unity of concord; hence he says,
              <i>with one mind,</i> i.e., have one will and one soul: “Now the
              company of those who believed were of one heart and soul” (Acts
              4:32); [“God makes men of one way to dwell in one house”] (Ps.
              67:7). Thirdly, the unity of cooperation; hence he says,
              <i>striving side by side for the faith of the gospel,</i>
              i.e., one helping the other. This is brought about by what is
              stated in 1 Kings (25: 1) “All Israel assembled and mourned for
              him,” namely, Samuel; “A brother helped is like a strong city”
              (Prov. 18:19).

              secundo ponit rationem. Dicit ergo <i>et in nullo</i>, etc.; quia
              nihil possunt, nisi quantum Deus permittit. Lc. XXI, v. 18:
              <i>capillus de capite vestro non peribit</i>. Ps. I, 3:
              <i>folium eius non defluet</i>, et cetera. Is. LI, v. 12:

                quasi foenum ita arescet?</i
              >
              Ratio autem est triplex. Prima sumitur a fructu tribulationis;
              secunda ex dono duplici Dei; tertia ab actore. Dicit ergo
              <i>non terreamini</i>, quia est vobis fructus, id est ipsa
              persecutio <i>quae</i> in illis, scilicet persequentibus,
              <i>est causa perditionis</i>, sed <i>vobis est causa salutis</i>.
              Matth. XVI, 25:
              <i>qui voluerit animam suam salvam facere, perdet eam</i>, et
              cetera. Io. XII, 25: <i>qui amat animam suam perdet eam</i>. Os.

              <i>donatum est vobis</i>, quod sustineatis tribulationes

              Secondly, he expects constancy:
              <i>and not frightened in anything by your opponents.</i>
              First, he urges them to be brave, because their opponents can do
              only as much as God allows: “But not a hair of your head will
              perish” (Lk. 21:18); “Its leaf does not wither” (Ps. 1: 3); “Who
              are you that you are afraid of man who dies, of the son of man who
              is made like grass?” (Is. 51:12). There are three reasons for
              this: the first is taken from the fruit of tribulation. He says,
              therefore:
              <i>not frightened,</i> because there is fruit for you in that
              persecution which <i>to them,</i> i.e., to the persecutors, is a
              <i>clear omen of their destruction;</i>
              but to you it is a cause
              <i>of salvation:</i> “Whoever would save his life will lose it,
              and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it” (Mt. 16:25);
              “He who loves his life loses it” (Jn. 12:25); “I will destroy you,
              O Israel; who can help you?” (Hos. 13:9). And this
              <i>from God,</i> from whom <i>it has been granted to you</i> to
              endure tribulation patiently.

              Secunda ratio,

              The second reason is that you
              <i>should believe in him:</i> “For by grace you have been saved
              through faith” (Eph. 2:8), which is the great and first gift;
              <i>but also suffer for his sake,</i>
              which is a greater gift, namely, that you should act for Christ as
              his athlete: “Then they left the presence of the council,
              rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the
              name” (Acts 5:41). This is useful and honorable; hence you should

              Then he indicates what he is urging them to do: first, in general,
              when he says,
              <i>complete my joy.</i> As if to say: I always rejoice in you on
              account of the good things I have seen and heard of you; but when
              these multiply, my joy will grow and finally become perfect.
              Therefore, complete it, by making progress in good. Secondly, in
              particular, when he urges them to mutual love, whose unity
              consists in two things: first, in the affections: “Let us not love
              in word or speech but in deed and in truth” (1 Jn. 3:18), bearing
              on the object of charity; hence he says,
              <i>being of the same mind.</i> For wisdom in the mind is knowledge
              of the loftiest causes, because it pertains to wisdom to judge,
              and no one can do this without knowing the highest cause.
              Consequently, wisdom is concerned with divine things. Therefore,
              <i>being of the same mind.</i> As if to say: Have the same mind in
              regard to the things of faith: “May the God of steadfastness and
              encouragement grant you to live in such harmony with one another,
              in accord with Christ Jesus, that together you may with one voice
              glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ” (Rom. 15:5).
              But this depends on having the same charity; hence he says,
              <i>having the same love:</i> “And above all these put *on love,
              which binds everything together in perfect harmony” (Col. 3:14).
              As for its effect, which consists in two persons consenting to the
              same thing, two things are required. As to the first he says,
              <i>being in full accord,</i> namely, in acting: [“God makes men of
              one way to dwell in one house” (Ps. 67:7)]; “That together you may
              with one voice glorify God” (Rom. 15:6). As to the second he says,
              <i>and of one mind.</i> This differs from the statement
              <i>being of the same mind,</i> as
              <i>being in full accord</i> differs from
              <i>having the same love.</i>

              Then he exhorts them to humility: first, he excludes whatever is
              contrary to humility; secondly, he exhorts them to it. The things
              contrary to humility are those which spring from pride: one is
              outward contention, because the humble yield to one another: “By
              insolence the heedless make strife” (Prov. 13:10); “For where
              jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there will be disorder and
              every vile practice” (Jas. 3:16). Therefore, he says,
              <i>do nothing from selfishness.</i> The other is vainglory, for a
              proud person desires his own excellence, even in the opinion of
              others: “Let us have no self-conceit, no provoking of one another,
              no envy of one another” (Gal. 5:26); I do not seek my own glory;
              there is One who seeks it and he will be the judge” (in. 8:50).
              Thus, he says here, <i>or conceit. This is</i> followed by the
              admonition,
              <i>but in humility count others better than yourselves.</i>
              For just as it pertains to pride that a man extol himself above
              himself, so to humility that he restrain himself according to his
              limitations.

              But how can a superior person do this? For he either does not know
              that he is superior and virtuous, and then he is not virtuous,
              because be is not prudent; or he does know, and then he cannot
              consider some as superior to himself. I answer that no one is so
              good that there is no defect in him, or so evil that he has no
              good. Therefore, he should not prefer another to himself
              absolutely, but because he can say in his mind: “Perhaps there is
              some defect in me that is not in this other person.” Augustine
              shows this in the book
              <i>On Virginity,</i> when he recommends that a virgin prefer a
              married woman to herself on the ground that she may be more
              fervent. But suppose that one person is good from every aspect,
              and another evil; nevertheless, you and he bear a double person,
              namely, yours and Christ’s. Therefore, if you cannot prefer him to
              yourself by reason of his person, you can do so by reason of the
              divine image: “Outdo one another in showing honor” (Rom. 12:10).

              these your servants, who continually stand before you and hear
              your wisdom” (1 Kgs. 10:8); “As soon as they heard of me they
              obeyed me” (Ps. 18:44). Thirdly, to smell the grace of His
              meekness, that we may run to Him: “Your anointing oils are
              fragrant... draw me after you” (Cant. 1:3); fourthly, to taste the
              sweetness of His mercy, that we may always be in God: “Taste and
              see that the Lord is good” (Ps. 34:9); fifthly, to touch His
              power, that we may be saved: “If I only touch his garment, I shall
              be made well” (Mt. 9:21).

              He mentions Christ’s majesty first, in order that His humility
              might be more easily recommended. In regard to His majesty he
              proposes two things, namely, the truth of His divine nature, and
              His equality. He says, therefore: <i>who,</i> namely, Christ,
              <i>though he was in the form of God.</i> For it is through its
              form that a thing is said to be in a specific or generic nature;
              hence the form is called the nature of a thing. Consequently, to
              be in the form of God is to be in the nature of God. By this is
              understood that He is true God: [“That we may be in his true Son,
              Jesus Christ” (1 Jn. 5:20) ]. However, it should not be supposed
              that the form of God is one thing and God himself another, because
              in simple and immaterial things, and especially in God, the form
              is the same as that whose form it is.

              But why does he say,
              <i>in the form,</i> rather than “in the nature”? Because this
              belongs to the proper names of the Son in three ways: for He is
              called the Son, the Word and the Image. Now the Son is the one
              begotten, and the end of begetting is the form. Therefore, to show
              the perfect Son of God he says, <i>in the form,</i> as though
              having the form of the Father perfectly. Similarly, a word is not
              perfect unless it leads to a knowledge of a thing’s nature; and so
              the Word of God is said to be in the form of God, because He has
              the entire nature of the Father. Finally, an image is not perfect,
              unless it has the form of that of which it is the image: “He
              reflects the glory of God and bears the very stamp of his nature”

              But does He have it perfectly? Yes, because He
              <i>did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped.</i>
              This can be taken two ways: in one way, of His humanity. But this
              is not the way Paul understood it, because it would be heretical;
              for it would be a grasping [robbery] if it referred to his
              humanity. Therefore, it must be explained in another way, namely,
              of His divinity, according to which equality with God is said of
              Christ. It is contrary to reason to say otherwise: because the
              nature of God cannot be received in matter; but the fact that
              someone existing in a certain nature participates in that nature
              to a greater or lesser degree is due to the matter; which is not
              the case here. Therefore, we must say that He
              <i>did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped,</i>
              because He is in the form of God and knows His own nature well.
              And because He knows this, it is stated in John (5:18): “He called
              God his Father, making himself equal with God.” But this is not a
              grasping, as it was when the devil and man wished to be equal to
              Him: “I will make myself like the Most High” (Is. 14:14); “You
              will be like God” (Gen. 3:5), for which Christ came to make
              satisfaction: “What I did not steal must I now restore?” (Ps.
              69:4). Then when he says,
              <i>but emptied himself,</i> he commends Christ’s humility: first,
              as to the mystery of the incarnation; secondly, as to the mystery
              of the passion (2:8). In regard to the first: first, he mentions
              His humility; secondly, its manner and form (2:7).

              began to exist in a new way on earth, so He also emptied Himself,

              First, he touches on the assumption of human nature when he says,
              <i>taking the form of a servant.</i>
              For by reason of his creation man is a servant, and human nature
              is the form of a servant: “Know that the Lord is God! It is he
              that made us, and we are his” (Ps. 100:3); “Behold my servant,
              whom I uphold” (Is. 42:1); “But thou, 0, Lord, art a shield about
              me” (Ps. 3:4). But why is it more fitting to say
              <i>the form of a servant,</i>
              rather than “Servant” Because servant is the name of a hypostasis,
              which was not assumed, but the nature was; for that which is
              assumed is distinct from the one assuming it. Therefore, the Son
              of God did not assume a man, because that would mean that he was
              other than the Son of God; nevertheless, the Son of God became
              man. Therefore, He took the nature to His own person, so that the
              Son of God and the Son of man would be the same in person.

              Thirdly, he mentions the conditions of His human nature when he
              says,
              <i>and being found in human form.</i>
              For He assumed all the defects and properties associated with the
              human species, except sin; therefore, he says,
              <i>and being found in human form,</i>
              namely, in His external life, because He became hungry as a man
              and tired and so on: “One who in every respect has been tempted as
              we are, yet without sinning” (Heb. 4:15); “Afterward [He] appeared
              upon earth and lived among men” (Bar. 3:37). Thus, we can refer
              <i>form</i> to outward activities. Or
              <i>in human form</i>
              [
              <i>in habit</i> ], because He put humanity on as a habit. For
              there are four kinds of habit [ <i>habitus</i> ] or ways in which
              something is “had”: one kind changes a person without itself being
              changed, as a fool by wisdom; another is changed and also changes
              the possessor, as food; a third neither changes the possessor nor
              is changed, as a ring worn on the finger; another is changed and
              does not change the possessor, as a dress. And by this likeness
              the human nature in Christ is called a habit or “something had”;
              because it comes to the divine person without changing it, but the
              nature itself was changed for the better, because it was filled
              with grace and truth: “We have beheld his glory, glory as of the
              only Son from the Father” (Jn. 1:14). He says, therefore,
              <i>being born in the likeness of men,</i>
              but in such a way that He is not changed, because in habit He was
              found as a man.

              Sed advertendum est quod ex hoc verbo
              <i>habitu</i>, etc., aliqui erraverunt. Unde tangitur triplex
              opinio VI distinct. III Sentent. Prima est quod humanitas Christi
              advenit ei accidentaliter, quod est falsum: quia suppositum
              divinae naturae factum est suppositum humanae naturae; et ideo
              accidentaliter non advenit ei, sed substantialiter, non quod
              divinitas naturaliter non advenit ei, sed substantialiter
              praedicetur de ipso. Et per hoc etiam excluditur error Photini,
              qui dixit quod Christus esset purus homo, non de virgine, quia
              dicitur <i>cum in forma Dei esset</i>. Ergo prius in forma Dei
              erat, quam acciperet formam servi, ex qua est minor patre, quia
              <i>non rapinam</i>, et cetera. Vincitur ergo quod per formam servi
              meruit. Item excluditur error Arrii, qui dixit quod esset minor
              patre, quia <i>non rapinam</i>, et cetera. Item Nestorii, qui
              dixit quod unio esset intelligenda secundum inhabitationem,
              inquantum scilicet Deus inhabitavit hominem, et quod alius est
              filius hominis et alius filius Dei. Sed Rabanus dicit quod
              apostolus incarnationem nominat exinanitionem. Constat autem quod
              pater inhabitat et spiritus sanctus: ergo et isti sunt exinaniti,
              quod est falsum. Item dicit: <i>semetipsum exinanivit</i>, ergo
              idem est qui exinanitus est, et exinaniens. Sed huiusmodi est
              filius Dei, quia ipse semetipsum exinanivit, ergo est unio in
              persona. Item Eutichetis, qui dixit quod ex duabus naturis
              resultat etiam una natura. Ergo non accepit formam servi, sed
              quamdam aliam, quod est contra hoc. Item Valentini, qui dixit quod
              attulit corpus de caelo. Item Apollinaris, qui dixit quod non
              habuit animam. Sic enim non esset in similitudinem hominum factus.

              It should be noted that some have fallen into error on account of
              this phrase,
              <i>being found in human form.</i>
              Hence he touches on several opinions: the first is that Christ’s
              humanity accrues to Him as an accident. This is false, because the
              person existing in the divine nature became a person existing in
              the human nature; therefore, it is present not as an accident, but
              substantially: not that the humanity is united to the Word in His
              nature, but in His person. By this is excluded the error of
              Photinus, who said that Christ was true man but not of the Virgin:
              however, Paul says,
              <i>he was in the form of God;</i>
              therefore, He was in the form of God before receiving the form of
              a servant, as a result of which He is less than the Father,
              because He
              <i>did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped.</i>
              Arius’ error is also excluded, for he said Christ was less than
              the Father; but Paul says, He
              <i>did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped.</i>
              And Nestorius’ error, who said that the union should be taken as
              an indwelling, so that God dwells in the Son of man as in a
              temple, and that the Son of man is a person distinct from the Son
              of God. And Rabanus says that the incarnation was an emptying. Now
              it is evident that the Father and the Holy Spirit are involved in
              every indwelling; therefore, they too are emptied. But this is
              false. Furthermore, Paul says,
              <i>He emptied himself;</i>
              therefore the person emptied and the one emptying are the same.
              But this is the Son, because He emptied Himself. Therefore, the
              union is in the person. Also the error of Eutyches, who said that
              one nature results from the two. Therefore, He did not receive the
              form of a servant, but a different one, which is contrary to what
              the Apostle says. Also the error of Valentinus, who said that He
              took His body from heaven; and the error of Appollinaris, who said
              that He had no soul. If this were so, He would not have been
              <i>born in the likeness of man.</i>

                iusti constituuntur multi</i

              magna et commendabilis sit haec obedientia, patet: quia tunc est
              obedientia magna, quando sequitur imperium alterius contra motum
              proprium; motus autem voluntatis humanae ad duo tendit: ad vitam
              et ad honorem; sed Christus non recusavit mortem. I Petr. III, 18:
              <i>Christus semel pro peccatis nostris mortuus est</i>, et cetera.
              Item non fugit ignominiam. Unde dicit <i>mortem autem crucis</i>,
              quae est ignominiosissima. Sap. II, 20:
              <i>morte turpissima condemnemus eum</i>. Sic ergo nec refugit
              mortem, nec genus ignominiosae mortis.

              Hence, in order to show the greatness of Christ’s humility and
              passion, he says that He
              <i>became obedient;</i>
              because if He had not suffered out of obedience, His passion would
              not be so commendable, for obedience gives merit to our
              sufferings. But how was He made obedient? Not by His divine will,
              because it is a rule; but by His human will, which is ruled in all
              things according to the Father’s will: “Nevertheless, not as I
              will but as thou wilt” (Mt. 26:39). And it is fitting that He
              bring obedience into His passion, because the first sin was
              accomplished by disobedience: “For as by one man’s disobedience
              many were made sinners, so by one man’s obedience many will be
              made righteous” (Rom. 5:19); [“The obedient man shall speak of
              victory” (Prov. 21:28) ]. That this obedience is great and
              commendable is evident from the fact that obedience is great when
              it follows the will of another against one’s own. Now the movement
              of the human will tends toward two things, namely, to life and to
              honor. But Christ did not refuse death: “Christ also died for sins
              once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous” (1 Pet. 3:18).
              Furthermore, He did not flee ignominy; hence he says,
              <i>even death on a cross,</i>
              which is the most shameful: “Let us condemn him to a shameful
              death” (Wis. 2:20). Thus, He neither refused death nor an
              ignominous form of death.

              He says,
              <i>therefore God has highly exalted him,</i> namely, that He
              should rise from the dead and pass from mortality to immortality:
              “Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; death no
              longer has dominion over him” (Rom. 6:9); “The right hand of the
              Lord does valiantly! I shall not die, but I shall live” (Ps.
              118:16). He also exalted Him by setting Him on His right hand: “He
              raised him from the dead and made him sit at his right hand in the
              heavenly places, far above all rule and authority and power and
              dominion, and above every name that is named, not only in this age
              but also in that which is to come” (Eph. 1:20,). But while it is
              true that others are raised to glory and immortality, He is more
              so, because God
              <i>bestowed on him the name which is above every name.</i>
              Now a name is imposed to signify some thing, and the loftier the
              thing signified by a name, the loftier is the name: hence the name
              of the divinity is highest: “O Lord, our Lord, how majestic is thy
              name in all the earth!” (Ps. 8:1). Therefore, this name, that He
              should be called and should be God, the Father gave Him, i.e., to
              Christ, as to the true God.

              adoptionis sed unionis, qua simul esset Deus et homo. Rom. I, 4:
              <i>praedestinatus est filius Dei in virtute</i>, ille scilicet qui
              factus est ei ex semine David secundum carnem. Et haec est

              But Photinus says that this is mentioned here as a reward for
              Christ’s humility and that it does not mean He is true God, but
              merely that He received a certain pre-eminence over the creature
              and a likeness of the godhead. This however, is not true, because
              it was stated that
              <i>he was in the form of God.</i> Therefore, one must answer that
              there are two natures and one hypostasis in Christ: for this
              person is God and man. Therefore, this can be explained in two
              ways: in one way, that the Father gave Him this name inasmuch as
              He is the Son of God; and this from all eternity by an eternal
              engendering, so that this giving is no more than His eternal
              generation: “For as the Father has life in himself, so he has
              granted the Son also to have life in himself” (Jn. 5:26). In
              another way it can refer to Christ as man; and then the Father
              gave that man the name of being God not by nature, because God’s
              nature is distinct from the nature of man, but to be God by the
              grace, not of adoption, but of union, by which He is at once God
              and man: “Designated Son of God in power,” He, namely, “who was
              descended from David according to the flesh” (Rom. 1:4). This
              second way is Augustine’s explanation in keeping with the
              Apostle’s intention. Similarly, it is stated in Acts (2:36) “Let
              all the house of Israel therefore know assuredly that God has made
              him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.” The
              first is Ambrose’s.

              But you might object to both explanations and ask why he says,
              <i>he humbled himself and became obedient unto death</i>
              and follows with,
              <i>therefore God has highly exalted him,</i>
              since the reward does not precede the merit. Therefore, neither
              the eternal engendering nor the incarnation is the reward of
              Christ’s passion, because they precede it. The answer is that in
              Sacred Scripture a thing is said to occur when it is known.
              Therefore,
              <i>God bestowed,</i> i.e., made manifest to the world, that He has
              this name. This was manifested in the resurrection, because prior
              to it the divinity of Christ was not that well known. This is
              supported by the text which follows: it implies that He did not
              give Him a name He did not already have, but that all should
              venerate it. And he mentions two types of veneration, namely,
              subjecting the body and confessing with the mouth:
              <i>and every tongue confess.</i> He says therefore: He has given
              Him a name which is above all names, even as man; hence he adds,
              <i>that at the name of Jesus,</i> which is the name of the man,
              <i>every knee should bow;</i> “To me every knee shall bow, every
              tongue shall swear’ (Is. 45:23).

              Likewise, holy and just and beatified men will be subject in this
              way: “All the nations thou has made shall come and bow down before
              thee, 0 Lord, and shall glorify thy name” (Ps. 86:9); but not the
              devils and the damned, for they will be subject involuntarily:
              “Even the demons believe—and shudder” (Jas. 2:19).

              <i>Every tongue,</i> namely,
              <i>in heaven and on earth and under the earth.</i>
              This does not refer to a confession of praise from those under the
              earth, but to a forced confession, which is made by recognizing
              God: “And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh
              shall see it together” (Is. 40:5); “Let them praise thy great and
              terrible name! holy is he!” (Ps. 99:3). And this confession will
              recognize
              <i>that Jesus Christ is Lord</i> [ <i>in</i> ]
              <i>the glory of God the Father.</i>
              He does not say in a similar glory, because it is the same glory:
              “That all may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father?” (in.
              5:23). It should be noted that earlier he had said that,
              <i>he was in the form of God,</i>
              but here he says
              <i>in the glory,</i> because it would come to pass that what He
              had from all eternity would be known by all: “Father, glorify thou
              me in thy own presence with the glory which I had with thee before
              the world was made” (Jn. 17:5).

              magnum, sed maius si de corpore, maximum autem si de anima et

              He says, therefore: Since Christ thus humbled Himself and was
              exalted for it, you ought to realize that if you are humbled, you
              shall also be exalted; and you should do this
              <i>as you have always obeyed.</i>
              He recalls their obedience to show its relevance to good works,
              because every virtue is included under obedience. For a man is
              just inasmuch as he keeps God’s commandments: “Do you not know
              that if you yield yourself to anyone as obedient slaves, you are
              slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to
              death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness?” (Rom.
              6:16). Furthermore, every good work, no matter how good it is of
              itself, is made better by obedience; [“The obedient man shall
              speak of victories” (Prov. 21:28)]. Finally, obedience is one of
              the greatest of the virtues: for to offer something from one’s
              external things is great; to offer something from the body is
              greater; but the greatest is to offer something from your soul and
              will: and this is done by obedience: “To obey is better than
              sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams” (1 Sam. 15:22). If
              you have acted thus, I urge you to continue doing the same.

              Then when he says,
              <i>not only as in my presence,</i>
              he shows what they should do. First, he urges them to act
              faithfully, because an unfaithful servant serves only when the
              master is looking, because he seeks only to please; but a faithful
              servant always works well. Hence he says,
              <i>not only as in my presence,</i>
              for then it would appear that you are not acting from the instinct
              of good will: “Not in the way of eye-service, as men-pleasers, but
              as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart” (Eph.
              6:6). Secondly, that they act humbly, when he says,
              <i>with fear and trembling,</i>
              for the proud man does not fear, but the humble does: “Let anyone
              who thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall” (1 Cor. 10:12);
              “Blessed is the man who fears the Lord always” (Prov. 28:14);
              “Serve the Lord with fear, with trembling kiss his feet” (Ps. 2:
              11). Thirdly, that they act with an eye toward salvation-
              <i>work out your own salvation:</i>
              “He who endures to the end will be saved” (Mt. 24:13).

              The second are those who deny free will altogether and say that

              this when he says,
              <i>in you,</i>
              because He moves the will from within to act well: “Thou has
              wrought for us all our works” (Is. 26:12). The third, like the
              first, is that of the Pelagians who say that choices are in us,
              but the performing of works in God, because willing comes from us,
              but accomplishing comes from God. He excludes this when he says,
              <i>both to will and to work:</i>
              “It depends not upon man’s will,” i.e., without God’s help, “or
              exertion, but upon God’s mercy” (Rom. 9:16). The fourth is the
              opinion that God accomplishes every good in us and does this
              through our merits. He excludes this when he says [
              <i>according to</i>
              ]
              <i>for his good pleasure,</i>
              and not our merits, because before we get God’s grace there is no
              good merit in us: “Do good to Zion in thy good pleasure” (Ps.
              51:18).

                run in vain or labor in vain. 17 Even if I am to be poured as a
                libation upon the sacrificial offering of your faith, I am glad
                and rejoice with you all. 18 Likewise you also should be glad
                and rejoice with me. 19 I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy
                to you soon, so that I may be cheered by news of you. 20 I have
                no one like him, who will be genuinely anxious for your welfare.
                21 They all look after their own interests, not those of Jesus
                Christ. 22 But Timothy’s worth you know, how as a son with a
                father he has served with me in the gospel. 23 I hope therefore
                to send him just as soon as I see how it will go with me; 24 and
                I trust in the Lord that shortly I myself shall come also. 25 1
                have thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus my brother
                and fellow worker and fellow soldier, and your messenger and
                minister to my need, 26 for he has been longing for you all, and
                has been distressed because you heard that he was ill. 27 Indeed
                he was ill, near to death. But God had mercy on him, and not
                only on him but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon
                sorrow. 28 I am the more eager to send him, therefore, that you
                may rejoice at seeing him again, and that I may be less anxious.
                29 So receive him in the Lord with all joy; and honor such men,
                30 for he nearly died for the work of Christ, risking his life
                to complete your service to me.

              First, he points out two ways to act, namely,
              <i>without grumbling or questioning.</i> For virtuous works are
              very difficult, and offer a fertile field for grumbling: “We must
              not grumble, as some of them did and were destroyed by the
              Destroyer” (1 Cor. 10: 10). Furthermore, they should not hesitate
              about doing them: “He who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is
              driven and tossed by the wind” (Jas. 1:6).

              He gives reasons for this: first, on their part, and then on the
              part of the Apostle. On their part he gives three reasons: first,
              in regard to the faithful when he says,
              <i>that you may be blameless:</i> “Walking in all the commandments
              and ordinances of the Lord blameless” (Lk. 1:6). For no one can
              exist without sin, but he can without grumbling; hence he urges
              them to do this. Secondly, in regard to God,
              <i>and innocent children of God.</i> For a son is like his Father.
              But God is innocent; hence we are innocent sons of God, when our
              intention is directed to one object: “A double-minded man is
              unstable in all his ways” (Jas. 1:8); “Be as wise as serpents and
              innocent as doves” (Mt. 10:16). Thirdly, in regard to unbelievers,
              <i>without blemish,</i> i.e., behave well toward unbelievers and
              give no offense <i>in the midst of a crooked,</i> as to evil
              works, <i>and perverse generation,</i> as to unbelief. And this is
              when they cannot be defamed by them: “Give the enemy no occasion
              to revile us” (1 Tim. 5:14). He gives the reason for this when be
              says,
              <i>among whom you shine as lights in the world,</i>
              because no matter how the world changes, the lights of the world
              remain bright: “You are the light of the world” (Mt. 5:14). They
              are luminous, not in essence, because God alone is light in this
              way: “The life was the light of man” (Jn. 1:4). The same is true
              of the saints: “He was not the light” (Jn. 1:8).

              Then he gives a reason on the part of the Apostle:
              <i>so that I may be proud;</i> secondly, he explains the reason,
              because subjects should act well so as to redound to the glory of
              their prelates. For it is their glory, when subjects are well
              behaved: “A wise son makes a glad father” (Prov. 10:1); “You are
              our glory and joy” (1 Thess. 2:20). And this,
              <i>in the day of Christ,</i> namely, when He will lead His
              faithful to Himself. This redounds to his glory for two reasons;
              because of the labor and suffering he endured in preaching.
              Therefore, he says,
              <i>that I did not run in vain or labor in vain.</i>
              He calls preaching a running because of his agility in traveling
              from Jerusalem to Spain. He says
              <i>labor,</i> because of the contradictions and punishments he
              suffered; and this not in vain, but in much fruit: “His grace
              toward me was not in vain” (1 Cor. 15: 10).

              your conversion, I <i>am glad</i> on my part: “Count it all joy,
              my brethren, when you meet various trials” (Jas. 1:2),
              <i>and rejoice with you all,</i> that you have the faith, even

              Sed numquid Lucas et Epaphroditus et alii, qui erant cum apostolo,
              quaerebant quae sua sunt? Respondeo. Dicendum est, quod in
              societate apostoli plures erant, qui hoc quaerebant, qui et
              deseruerunt eum. II Tim. IV, 10:

                >demas enim me dereliquit, diligens saeculum, et abiit
                Thessalonicam: Crescens in Galatiam: Titus in Dalmatiam: Lucas

              nonnullis, sicut de omnibus. Ier. c. VI, 13:
              <i
                >a minori quippe usque ad maiorem omnes avaritiae student, et a

              But did Luke and Epaphroditus and the others, who were with the
              Apostle seek the things that were their own? I answer that in the
              company of the Apostle were many who sought this and who deserted
              him: “For Demas, in love with this present world, has deserted me
              and gone to Thessalonica; Crescens has gone to Galatia, Titus to
              Dalmatia. Luke alone is with me” (2 Tim. 4:9). But it is a custom
              that sometimes the Scripture speaks of some as though of all:
              “From the least to the greatest of them, every one is greedy for
              unjust gains and from prophet to priest, every one deals falsely”
              (Jer. 6:13). Therefore it is a narrowed use of the word “all.”

              But why not at once? Because it is otherwise with Christ and with
              the other saints. In Christ was fulness of grace; hence He always
              had knowledge of all things; but not so the other saints. Hence
              the Apostle foresaw some things about himself and was ignorant of
              others. Thus, he received no revelation that he would be delivered
              from his imprisonment; hence he says,
              <i>just as soon as I see how it will go with me,</i>
              because if I were granted leave, I would come to you in person;
              consequently,
              <i>I trust in the Lord that shortly I myself shall come also.</i>
              But he was not freed from his prison: “Yea, thou dost light my
              lamp: the Lord my God lightens my darkness” (Ps. 18:28). For there
              is always some darkness in the saints.

              <i>and fellow worker,</i>
              i.e., in the work of preaching: “A brother helped is like a strong
              city” (Prov. 18:19);
              <i>and fellow soldier,</i>
              because we have suffered tribulation together: “Take your share of
              suffering as a good soldier of Christ Jesus” (2 Tim. 2:3); and
              <i>your messenger,</i>
              i.e., teacher. He was the bishop of the Philippians and sent by
              them to serve the Apostle; hence he says,
              <i>and minister to my need</i>: “I am filled, having received from
              Epaphroditus the things you sent, a fragrant offering, a
              sacrifice, acceptable and pleasing to God” (<i>infra</i>
              4:18). But why? To satisfy the desire with which
              <i>he has been longing for you all:</i>
              “For I long to see you” (Rom. 1:11), and also to relieve him of
              his sorrow, because he was sad at the sorrow you felt, when you
              heard that he was sick. He explains the reason, saying:
              <i>Indeed he was ill, near to death,</i>
              i.e., in the opinion of the physicians, though not according to
              God’s providence, but for the glory of God; “This illness is not
              unto death; it is for the glory of God” (Jn. 11:4). Thus he
              continues:
              <i>but God had mercy on him;</i>
              “Be gracious to me, 0 Lord, for I am languishing” (Ps. 6:2);
              <i>and not</i>
              only on
              <i>him but on me also,</i>
              because Paul had suffered the temporal and natural sadness of his
              affliction, as Christ is said to have suffered sometimes.

              “You received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus” (Gal. 4:14);
              “Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double
              honor, especially those who labor in preaching and teaching” (1
              Tim. 5:17). And this because
              <i>he nearly died for the work of Christ,</i>
              i.e., for God and the salvation of the faithful: “Greater love has
              no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends”
              (Jn. 15:13);
              <i>risking his life:</i>
              “The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep” (Jn. 10:11).
              And he did this,
              <i>to complete your service to me,</i>
              which you personally could not do.

              The aim of the admonition is to keep the Gentile believers from
              the ceremonies of the Law, to which certain persons were
              persuading them; hence he says
              <i>finally,</i> i.e., after my warnings,
              <i>my brethren,</i> namely, in the faith,
              <i>rejoice in the Lord</i> only, and not in the ceremonies of the
              Law: I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my
              salvation” (Hab. 3:18). And this because it
              <i>is not irksome to me to write</i> in my absence
              <i>the same things</i> I said when I was present. For words soon
              pass away, but writings endure: “The wisdom of the scribe depends
              on the opportunity of leisure; and he who has little business may
              become wise” (Si. 38:24); “Beloved, being very eager to write to
              you of our common salvation, I found it necessary to write” (Jude
              1:3); “But on some points I have written to you very boldly by way
              of reminder” (Rom. 15:15).

              The need for this admonition is that certain seducers are busy;
              therefore, he must be busier in writing to them; hence be says,
              <i>look out for the dogs, look out for the evil-workers.</i>
              He mentions three things about them: first, the unreasoning
              cruelty of their hearts; hence he says
              <i>dogs:</i> “It is the nature of a dog to bark from anger, not
              from reason but from habit” (Gloss). These people do the same:
              “The dogs have a mighty appetite; they never have enough. The
              shepherds also have no understanding; they have all turned to
              their own way” (Is. 56:11); “Outside are the dogs and sorcerers”
              (Rev. 22:15). Secondly, the perverse doctrine they sow:
              <i>evil-workers,</i> because they do not labor faithfully in the
              Lord’s vineyard or sow good seed in the soil: “An enemy has done
              this” (Mt. 13:28); “Do your best to present yourself to God as one
              approved, a workman who has no need to be ashamed, rightly
              handling the word of truth” (2 Tim. 2:15). Thirdly, he mentions
              their error: <i>those who mutilate the flesh</i> [
              <i>concession</i> ] <i>.</i> He uses this word to describe their
              mark, for they preach circumcision, which seeks to rival Christ’s
              grace: “If you receive circumcision, Christ will be of no
              advantage to you” (Gal. 5:2). Hence playing on the word, he says
              <i>concision,</i> as though they had not circumcision, but a cut.

              Christo, qui est veritas circumcisionis. Col. II, 11:

              <i>spiritus est qui vivificat, caro autem non prodest quicquam</i

              He says, therefore: I say that they are
              <i>those who mutilate the flesh,</i> but
              <i>we who worship God are the true circumcision.</i>
              For circumcision is of two kinds, namely, bodily and spiritual:
              “For he is not a real Jew who is one outwardly, nor is true
              circumcision something external and physical. He is a Jew who is
              one inwardly, and real circumcision is a matter of the heart,
              spiritual and not literal” (Rom. 2:28). For the circumcision of
              the flesh cuts off superfluous flesh; but the circumcision of the
              spirit is that by which the Holy Spirit cuts away superfluous
              internal concupiscences. Therefore, he says:
              <i>We are the true circumcision, who worship God in spirit,</i>
              i.e., who circumcises us inwardly to God. “For God is my witness,
              whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son” (Rom. 1:9);
              1 will sing with the spirit and I will sing with the mind also” (1
              Cor. 14:15). But circumcision is given as a sign of Abraham’s
              faith, to show that his faith, which believed in an offspring to
              come, was true: “The promises were made to Abraham and to his
              offspring” (Gal. 3:16). Therefore, circumcision is a sign of
              Abraham’s faith in Christ. Consequently, he is circumcised who by
              the Holy Spirit is renewed inwardly in Christ, who is the truth of
              the circumcision: “In him also you were circumcised with a
              circumcision made without hands” (Col. 2:11).
              <i>We put no confidence in the flesh,</i>
              i.e., in the circumcision of the flesh, because, as it is stated
              in John (6:63): “It is the spirit that gives life, the flesh is no
              avail.” The word “flesh” is sometimes taken for fleshly
              concupiscence, sometimes for the care of the flesh, and sometimes
              for observances of the flesh.

              In regard to the first he does two things: first, he shows the
              confidence he could have had in the things of the Law, saying: We
              must not put our confidence in the things of the Law,
              <i
                >though I myself have reason for confidence in the flesh
                also,</i
              >
              i.e., I could have, if I desired, because “Whatever anyone dares
              to boast of—I am speaking as a fool—I also dare to boast of that,”
              as he says in 2 Corinthians (11:21). And I can do this with more
              reason, because I have done more: “I am talking like a madman” (2
              Cor. 11:23). He mentions all these things in order more
              effectively to destroy the observances of the Law. For many scorn
              things they do not know or do not have; and this is not right, but
              only when a person has something and then scorns it and does not
              glory in it. Thus, if the Apostle had no prestige during the time
              of the Law, this could be cited as the reason why he went over to
              the gospel. Therefore, he shows the prestige he had under the Law:
              first, in general, and secondly, according to the life he led:
              <i>as to the Law a Pharisee.</i>
              As to the first, in three ways: first, in regard to the sacrament
              of his race, because he was
              <i>circumcised on the eighth day:</i>
              “It shall be a sign of the covenant between me and you’ (Gen.
              17:11). He says
              <i>on the eighth day</i> because this was the difference between
              proselytes and the descendants of Abraham: the former were not
              circumcised on the eighth day, but as adults, when they were
              converted; but the latter on the eighth day according to the Law:
              “He that is eight days old among you shall be circumcised” (Gen.
              17:12). Thus it was not as a proselyte but as a true Israelite
              that he was circumcised. Secondly, in regard to his race when he
              says, <i>of the people of Israel</i>. For two races descended from
              Abraham: one through Isaac, and the other through Ishmael. From
              Isaac also two races descended: one through Esau and one through
              Jacob. But the one from Esau and the one from Ishmael were not
              included in the inheritance, but only Jacob who is also called
              Israel; hence he says,
              <i>of the people of Israel:</i>
              “Are they Israelites? So am I” (2 Cor. 11:22).

              Then in regard to his tribe, because in the tribe of Israel some
              were descended from bondwomen, i.e., from Bala and Zelpha, and
              some from free women, namely, Lia and Rachel. Among these some
              persevered in the worship of God, namely, the tribes of Levi, Juda
              and Benjamin, but the others turned to idols during the time of
              Jeroboam. Therefore, the
              <i>tribe of Benjamin</i> was privileged, because it continued in
              the faith and worship of God, and the temple was built in it: “The
              beloved of the Lord, he dwells in safety by him; he encompasses
              him all the day long, and makes his dwelling between his
              shoulders” (Deut. 33:12); “Benjamin is a ravenous wolf, in the
              morning devouring the prey, and at evening dividing the spoil”
              (Gen. 49:27). He prefigured Paul who in his early days persecuted
              the Church. Thirdly, in regard to his name and tongue when he
              says, <i>a Hebrew.</i> Some say that the word “Hebrew” comes from
              Abraham, as Augustine did, but later retracted. But it is taken
              from Heber (Gen. 11:16). That it does not come from Abraham is
              evident, because Abraham himself is called a Hebrew: “Then one who
              had escaped came, and told Abram the Hebrew” (Gen. 14:13). A gloss
              on Genesis (11) says that in the time of Heber the languages of
              all nations were separated, but the primitive language remained in
              the family of Heber and in the worship of the one God and among
              all the Hebrews. He was also born of Hebrew parents; hence he
              says,
              <i>born of Hebrews.</i>

              Pharisaeus fuerit, dicitur Act. XXVI, 5:

              Then he shows the prestige he had in his manner of life: first of
              all, in regard to his sect when he says, as
              <i>to the law a Pharisee.</i>
              For there were three sects among the Jews, namely, the Pharisees,
              the Sadducees, and the Essenes. But the Pharisees were closer to
              the truth, because the Sadducees denied the resurrection and did
              not believe in angels or spirits, while the Pharisees believed
              both, as it is stated in Acts (23). For this reason the sect of
              the Pharisees was more commendable. That he was a Pharisee is
              stated in Acts (26:5): “According to the strictest party of our
              religion I have lived as a Pharisee.” Secondly, in regard to the
              zeal which the Jews had, although not according to knowledge, in
              persecuting Christians; hence he says,
              <i>a persecutor of the church.</i>
              “He who once persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once
              tried to destroy” (Gal. 1:23); “I myself was convinced that I
              ought to do many things in opposing the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
              And I did so in Jerusalem” (Acts 26:9); “I am unfit, to be called
              an Apostle because I persecuted the church of God” (1 Cor. 15:9).

              Tertio, quantum ad innocentiam conversationis. Ideo dicit
              <i>secundum iustitiam</i>, et cetera. Haec iustitia consistit in
              exterioribus, sed iustitia fidei est cordis. Act. XV, 9:
              <i>fide purificans corda eorum</i>. Nam, quantum ad iustitiam

              Thirdly, in regard to the innocence of his manner of life; hence
              he says,
              <i>as to righteousness under the Law blameless.</i>
              This justice consists in externals, but the justice of faith is of
              the heart: “God who knows the heart... cleanse their hearts by
              faith” (Acts 15:9). As to external justice the Apostle lived
              innocently; hence he says,
              <i>blameless.</i> He does not say “without sin,” because blame is
              concerned with a sin of scandal against one’s neighbor in matters
              that are external: “And they were both righteous before God,
              walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord
              blameless” (Lk. 1:6). Therefore, he does not contradict what he
              says in Ephesians (2:3). “Among these we all once lived,” because
              he did not then have the true justice of faith, which makes a man
              pure, but only the justice of the Law.

              <i>Whatever gain I had,</i>
              i.e., prestige, namely, to be a Pharisee and so on, I
              <i>counted as loss for the sake of Christ,</i>
              i.e., I came to regard them as hindrances. For the observances of
              the Law, which were effective during the time of the Law, became
              harmful after Christ; hence he says, loss. And the reason for
              abandoning them was Christ; hence he says,
              <i>for the sake of Christ.</i>
              He explains this: first, that he acted thus in order to know
              Christ, and secondly to obtain Him. In regard to the first he
              says,
              <i>Indeed I count everything as loss.</i>
              This is true, if he had continued to depend on them. What I did
              formerly, I now regard a loss on account of my desire for a
              correct understanding of Christ, my Lord: “For I decided to know
              nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified” (1 Cor.
              2:2).
              <i

                Lord,</i

              since this transcends all knowledge. For there is nothing better
              to be known than the Word of God m whom are hid all the treasures
              of wisdom and knowledge” (Col. 2:3).

              It should be noted that justice is taken sometimes as the special
              virtue through which a man fulfills what is right in matters
              pertaining to life in society, in the sense that it directs a
              person in this matter; for temperance deals with one’s own
              internal passions, but justice deals with another person. In
              another way justice is a general virtue, inasmuch as a man
              observes the law for the common good. This is the sense in which
              it is used in Scripture for the observance of the divine law: “I
              have done what is just and right” i.e., the law (Ps. 119:121),
              which he obeyed out of love, as though moved by his own
              initiative. In this way it is a virtue, but not if he is moved in
              some other way, such as by an external cause or for the sake of
              gain or because of punishments, where to obey might be personally
              displeasing. According to this there are two kinds of justice: one
              is moral justice; the other is legal justice, which makes one obey
              the law not from love but from fear. Therefore he says,
              <i>not having a righteousness of my own, based on law,</i>
              because as Augustine says: “The slight difference between the Law
              and the Gospel is fear and love”; “For you did not receive the
              spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received
              the spirit of sonship” (Rom. 8:15).

              Concerning this justice which he seeks, he states three things,
              namely, the method of acquiring it; its author; and its fruit. The
              method is that it is not obtained except by faith in Christ:
              “Since we are justified by faith, we have peace with God through
              our Lord, Jesus Christ” (Rom. 5:1); “The righteousness of God
              through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe” (Rom. 3:22).
              For the author is God and not man: “It is God who justifies” (Rom.
              8:33); “And to one who does not work but trusts him who justifies
              the ungodly, his faith is reckoned as righteousness” (Rom. 4:5).
              Therefore he says,
              <i>the righteousness from God that depends on faith:</i>
              “The Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey him” (Acts
              5:32). The fruit is knowledge of Him and the power of His
              resurrection and to be in the company of His saints.

              Et de huiusmodi, secundum duplicem cognitionem, potest dupliciter
              agi. Uno modo exponendo de cognitione viae, et sic oportet tria
              cognoscere de eo. Primo eius personam, scilicet quod est verus

              gloriosum. Ideo dicit <i>et virtutem resurrectionis eius</i>,
              scilicet ex qua resurgemus. I Cor. XV, 14:

              These things can be explained in two ways according to the two
              forms of knowledge: in one way, in terms of knowledge available in
              this life. In that case one must know three things about Him:
              first, His person, namely, that He is true God and true man; hence
              he says,
              <i>that I may know him:</i> “Have I been with you so long, and yet
              you do not know me, Philip? He who has seen me has seen the
              Father” (Jn. 14:9). Secondly, the glory of His resurrection; hence
              he says,
              <i>and the power of his resurrection,</i>
              i.e., the powerful resurrection performed by His own power.
              Thirdly, how to imitate Him, when he says,
              <i>and may share his sufferings,</i>
              namely, be associated with Him in His passion: “Christ also
              suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow
              in his steps” (1 Pet. 2:21). In the other way, by practical
              knowledge, which begins from what is later, which is the last
              thing accomplished but the first thing intended. The first thing
              intended is the knowledge of God through His essence, to which
              faith leads: “They shall all know me, from the least of them to
              the greatest” (Jer. 31:34); therefore, he says,
              <i>that I may know him.</i> Secondly that not only the soul will
              be glorified, but the body also; hence he says,
              <i>and the power of his resurrection,</i>
              namely, by which we shall rise: “If Christ has not been raised,
              then our preaching is in vain” (1 Cor. 15:14). Thirdly, the value
              of sharing His suffering, because we shall know how much it
              benefits us to be associated with His passion: “Cod is faithful,
              by whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus
              Christ our Lord” (1 Cor. 1:9).

              For one reaches glory by sufferings endured here: “For if we have
              been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be
              united with him in a resurrection like his” (Rom. 6:5); “If we

              “Fellow heirs of God with Christ, provided we suffer with him”
              (Rom. 8:17). He says,
              <i>if possible,</i> because of its difficulty, arduousness and
              labor: “For the gate is narrow and the way is hard, that leads to
              life, and those who find it are few” (Mt. 7:14); “Prepare to meet
              your God, O Israel!” (Amos 4:12). For Christ rose by His own
              power, but man not by his own power, but by the grace of God: “He
              who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will give life to your
              mortal bodies also through his Spirit which dwells in you” (Rom.

              But this attitude is contrary to the command to be perfect (Mt.
              5:48) and (Gen. 17:1). I answer that perfection is twofold,
              namely, of heaven and of earth. For man’s perfection consists in
              adhering to God through charity, because a thing is perfect to the
              degree it adheres to its perfection. But the soul can adhere to
              God in two ways: in one way, perfectly, so that a person actually
              refers his actions to God and knows Him as He can be known; and
              this is in heaven. But adherence in this life is of two kinds: one
              is necessary for salvation, and all are bound to it, namely, that
              a person in no case place his heart in anything against God, and
              that he habitually refer his whole life to Him. The Lord says of
              this way: “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart,
              and with all your soul, and with all your mind” (Matt. 22:37). The
              other is of supererogation, when a person adheres to God above the
              common way. This is done when he removes his heart from temporal
              things, the better to approach heaven, because the smaller
              covetousness becomes, the more charity grows. Therefore, what is
              said here refers to the perfection of heaven.

              Sed contra, quia Deus est incomprehensibilis, quia Ier. XXXI, 37
              dicitur:
              <i
                >si mensurari potuerint caeli desursum, et investigari
                fundamenta terrae deorsum</i
              >, et cetera. Respondeo. Dicendum est, quod comprehendere uno modo
              est includere, sicut domus comprehendit nos. Alio modo idem est
              quod attingere et tenere. Primo ergo modo est incomprehensibilis,
              quia non potest includi in intellectu creato, cum sit
              simplicissimus, quia non perfecte vides eum nec amas, sicut est
              visibilis et amabilis, sicut qui nescit demonstrationem, nescit
              demonstrative, sed opinative. Deus autem perfecte seipsum
              cognoscit ut cognoscibilis est. Cuius ratio est, quia res
              cognoscitur secundum modum sui esse et veritatis. Deus autem lux
              est et veritas infinita, sed nostrum lumen est finitum. Et ideo
              dicit <i>sequor si quo modo comprehendam</i>, hoc intelligendo
              secundo modo, scilicet attingendo. Cant. ult.:
              <i>tenui eum, nec dimittam</i>, et cetera.
              <i>In quo et comprehensus sum</i>. Quod tripliciter intelligitur.
              Nam tota gloria est in dicta Dei comprehensione, ut scilicet Deus
              sit praesens animae nostrae. Sed non omnes habent aequalem
              beatitudinem, quia quidam clarius vident, sicut etiam quidam
              ardentius amabunt et plus gaudebunt. Unde quilibet habebit certam
              mensuram, et hoc ex praedestinatione divina. Et ideo dicit
              <i>in quo et comprehensus sum</i>; quasi dicat: in tali mensura
              intendo comprehendere, secundum quod mihi dispositum est a
              Christo. Vel sequor ut comprehendam sicut comprehensus sum; quasi
              dicat: ut videam eum sicut ipse me videt. I Io. III, 2:
              <i>videbimus eum sicuti est</i>, id est non per similitudinem, sed
              per essentiam. Vel comprehendam videndo Christum gloriosum. In quo
              comprehensus sum, id est in illa gloria qua apparuit quando
              conversus sum.

            <td>
              But on the other hand God is incomprehensible, because it is said
              in Jeremiah (31:37): “If the heavens above can be measured, and
              the foundations of the earth below can be explored, then I will
              cast off all the descendants of Israel.” I answer that in one
              sense, to comprehend means to enclose, as a house comprehends us;
              in another sense, it means to attain and hold. In the first sense
              He is incomprehensible, because He cannot be enclosed in a created
              intellect, since He is most simple and because you do not know or
              love Him to the degree that He is knowable and loveable, as a
              person who does not know a truth by demonstration but by opinion
              does not know it as perfectly as it can be known. But God knows
              Himself, as far as He is knowable. The reason for this is that a
              thing is known according to the mode of its own being and truth.
              God, however, is infinite light and truth, whereas our light is
              finite. Hence he says,
              <i>but I press on to make it my own,</i>
              that is, to comprehend Him in the second way, i.e., by attaining:
              I held him, and would not let him go” (Cant. 3:4),
              <i>because Christ Jesus has made me his own.</i>
              This can be taken in three ways: for all glory depends on
              apprehending God, i.e., that God be present to our soul. But not
              all have equal happiness: because some see more clearly, just as
              some will love more ardently and will rejoice more. Hence each
              person will have a definite amount according to God’s
              predestination; therefore, he says,
              <i>because Christ Jesus has made me his own.</i>
              As if to say: I intend to comprehend in such an amount as has been
              decided by Christ. Or, I
              <i>press on to make it my own,</i>
              as I am owned (apprehended). As if to say: that I may see Him as
              He sees me: “We shall see him as he is” (Jn. 3:2), not through a
              likeness, but through His essence. Or,
              <i>to make it my own,</i>
              by seeing Christ in glory, in which I am apprehended, i.e., in
              that glory in which He appeared, when I was converted.

              Four renditions of this are found in a Gloss: the first two are
              more literal. One is this: I say that you should think as I do,
              namely, that you are imperfect; yet if you think otherwise, i.e.,
              better of yourselves than I do of myself, this very thing has been
              granted to you by divine revelation: and when something loftier is
              revealed to you than to me, I will not contradict but will yield
              to your revelation. Nevertheless, I do not want you to separate
              from the unity of the Church because of this revelation; but in
              unity, let us hold
              <i>true to what we have attained.</i> This unity consists in the
              unity of the truth of faith and the rectitude of good action; and
              both must be preserved: “Mend your ways, heed my appeal, agree
              with one another, live in peace” (2 Cor. 13:1-1). And the same
              holds for a good life and good actions: “Peace and mercy be upon
              all who walk by this rule, upon the Israel of God “Gal. 6:16). Or
              another way: I say that if on account of ignorance or weakness you
              think otherwise than the truth holds, let us admit it humbly and
              do not defend it stubbornly: “Thou hast hidden these things from
              the wise and understanding and revealed them to babes” (Mt.
              11:25). Or another way: I say that we should be of the same mind,
              namely, that we have not yet made it our own; but if in anything
              you are now otherwise minded than you will be in the future,
              because “now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face” (1
              Cor. 13:12), <i>God will reveal</i> it in the future: “The voice
              of the Lord shakes the wilderness,... and strips the forests bare;
              and in his temple all cry Glory!” (Ps. 29:9). Or another way:
              Whether you understand dimly here, or clearly in the future,
              <i>God will reveal that,</i> because faith is from God.
              <i>Only let us hold true to what we have attained.</i>

              Then he describes their intention: first, he reveals their
              intention; secondly, the result of that intention (3:19). He says:
              <i>their god is the belly. As</i>
              if to say: they spread this doctrine, namely, that the ceremonies
              of the Law must be observed, for their own gain and glory to
              satisfy their belly: “For such persons do not serve our Lord
              Christ, but their own belly, and by fair and flattering words they
              deceive the hearts of the simpleminded” (Rom.. 16:18); “All the
              toil of man is for his mouth, yet his appetite is not satisfied”
              (Eccl. 6:7). Hence he says
              <i>god,</i> because it is peculiar to God to be the first
              principle and the ultimate end; hence those who have something as
              an end have it as their God. Furthermore, they seek their own
              glory against what is stated in John (8:50): “Yet I do not seek my

              This coming involves three things: first, the general
              resurrection; hence he says,
              <i>who will change our lowly,</i>

              imperishable. It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory. It is
              sown in weakness, it is raised in power” (1 Cor. 15:42). This

              Spirit which dwells in you” (Rom. 8:11).

              Secondly, the imitation of the saints; hence he says,
              <i>to be like his glorious body.</i>
              The body of Christ, of course, is glorified by the glory of His
              divinity; and He merited this by His passion. Therefore, whoever
              shares in the power of the divinity by grace and imitates the
              passion of Christ shall be glorified: “He who conquers, I will
              grant him to sit with me on my throne, as I myself conquered and
              sat clown with my Father on his throne” (Rev. 3:21); “We shall be
              like him” (1 Jn. 3:2); “Then the righteous will shine like the sun
              in the kingdom of their Father” (Mt. 13:43). Thirdly, the power by
              which He does this:
              <i>by the power</i>
              of his Godhead, i.e., by the power in Him
              <i>which enables him even to subject all things to himself:</i>
              for all will be subject to Christ; some unto salvation, and some
              unto punishment. Toward the first He will exercise mercy, and
              toward the second justice: “Thou hast given dominion over the
              works of thy hands” (Ps. 8:6); “For God has put all things in
              subjection under his feet” (1 Cor. 15:27); “Whatever the Father
              does, that the Son does likewise” (Jn. 5:19).

              praedestinati eliguntur a Deo ad magnum, scilicet ad vitam
              aeternam. Et haec ordinatio est praedestinatio. Conscriptio huius
              ordinationis dicitur liber vitae: haec conscriptio est in memoria
              divina, quia inquantum ordinat, praedestinat. Inquantum vero

              According to a Gloss the book of life is the same as the
              predestination of the saints. They are the same reality but the
              ideas are different. It should be noted that in olden times it was
              a custom to write in a register the names of those appointed to
              some duty or dignity, as soldiers and senators, who were enrolled
              in the palace. Now all the predestined saints are chosen by God
              for something great, namely, eternal life; and this appointment is
              called predestination. The record of this appointment is called
              the book of life: and this record is in the divine memory, because
              inasmuch as He appoints, He predestines; inasmuch as He knows it
              unchangeably, it is called foreknowledge. Therefore, this
              foreknowledge about the predestined is called the book of life.

              enrolled absolutely, and others in a qualified sense. For some are
              absolutely predestined by God to obtain eternal life, and they are
              enrolled indelibly. Others are predestined to have eternal life
              not in itself, but in its cause, inasmuch as they are ordained to
              justice for the present; and such persons are said to be erased

              life.

              Necessarium est enim cuilibet volenti proficere, quod habeat
              spirituale gaudium. Prov. XVII, 22:
              <i>animus gaudens aetatem floridam facit</i>, et cetera.
              Conditiones autem quatuor veri gaudii tangit apostolus, et primo
              quod debet esse rectum, quod est quando est de proprio bono
              hominis, quod non est quid creatum, sed Deus, Ps. LXXII, 28:
              <i>mihi adhaerere Deo bonum est</i>, et cetera. Tunc autem rectum
              est quando in domino. Ideo dicit <i>in domino</i>. Neh. VIII, v.
              10: <i>gaudium domini est fortitudo vestra</i>. Item continuum;
              unde dicit <i>semper</i>. I Thess. ult.: <i>semper gaudete</i>.
              Quod fit quando non interrumpitur peccato: tunc enim est
              continuum. Aliquando vero interrumpitur per tristitiam temporalem,
              quod significat imperfectionem gaudii. Cum enim quis perfecte
              gaudet, non interrumpitur eius gaudium, quia parum curat de re
              parum durante. Et ideo dicit <i>semper</i>. Item multiplicatum
              debet esse; si enim gaudes de Deo, imminet tibi gaudere de eius
              incarnatione. Lc. II, 10:
              <i>evangelizo vobis gaudium magnum, quia natus est</i>, et cetera.
              Item ut gaudeas de actione. Prov. XXI, 15:
              <i>gaudium est iusto facere iudicium</i>, et cetera. Imminet etiam
              tibi gaudium de contemplatione. Sap. c. VIII, 16:
              <i>non habet amaritudinem conversatio illius</i>. Item si gaudes
              de bono proprio, imminet tibi gaudere similiter de bono aliorum.
              Item si de praesenti, imminet etiam de futuro; et ideo dicit
              <i>iterum</i>, et cetera. Item debet esse moderatum, ne scilicet
              effluat per voluptates, sicut facit gaudium mundi. Et ideo dicit
              <i>modestia vestra</i>, etc.; quasi dicat: ita sit moderatum
              gaudium vestrum, quod non vertatur in dissolutionem. Iudith ult.:
              <i>populus erat iucundus secundum faciem sanctorum</i>, et cetera.
              Prov. XII, v. 11: <i>qui suavis est, vivit in moderationibus</i>.
              Et dicit <i>nota sit omnibus hominibus</i>; quasi dicat: vita
              vestra sic moderata sit in exterioribus, ut nullius offendat
              aspectum: impediret enim conversationem vestram.
            </td>
            <td>
              Anyone who desires to make progress must have spiritual joy: “A
              cheerful heart is a good medicine” (Prov. 17:22). The Apostle
              touches on four characteristics of true joy; first, it must be
              right, this happens when it concerns the proper good of man, which
              is not something created, but God: “But for me it is good to be
              near God; I have made the Lord God my refuge” (Ps. 73:28).
              Therefore, it is right, when there is joy in the Lord; hence he
              says,
              <i>in the Lord:</i> “‘Me joy of the Lord is your strength” (Neh
              8:10). Secondly, it is continuous; hence he says,
              <i>always,</i> “Rejoice always” (1 Thess. 5:16). This happens when
              it is not interrupted by sin, for then it is continuous. But
              sometimes it is interrupted by temporal sadness, which signifies
              the imperfection of joy. For when a person rejoices perfectly, his
              joy is not interrupted, because he cares little about things that
              do not last; that is why he says <i>always.</i> Thirdly, it should
              be multiple, for if you rejoice in God, you will rejoice in His
              incarnation: I bring you good news of a great joy, which will come
              to all the people; for to you is born this day in the city of
              David a Savior” (Lk. 2: 10); and in your own activity: “When
              justice is done, it is a joy to the righteous” (Prov. 21:15); and
              in your contemplation: “Companionship with her has no bitterness”
              (Wis. 8:16). Again, if you rejoice in your good, you will be
              prepared to rejoice in the good of others; if you rejoice in the
              present, you are prepared to rejoice in the future; hence he says,
              <i>again I will say, rejoice.</i>
              Fourthly, it should be moderate and not flooded with pleasures, as
              happens in worldly joy; hence he says,
              <i>let all men know your forbearance. As</i>
              if to say: Your joy should be so moderated that it will not
              degenerate into dissoluteness: “The people continued feasting in
              Jerusalem before the sanctuary” (Judith 16:20). He says,
              <i>let all men know,</i>
              as if to say: Your life should be so moderate in externals, that
              it offends the gaze of no one; for that would hinder your manner
              of life.

              “He is not far from each one of us” (Acts 17:27); He is also near
              in His flesh: “But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off
              have been brought near in the blood of Christ” (Eph. 2:13). Again
              He is near through indwelling grace: “Draw near to God and he will
              draw near to you” (Jas. 4:8); and by His clemency in hearing: “The
              Lord is near to all who call upon him” (Ps. 145:18); and by His
              reward: “Its time is close at hand and its days will not be
              prolonged” (Is. 13:22).

              But this seems to be contrary to what is stated in Romans (12:8):
              “He that rules, [do so] with solicitude.” I answer that anxiety or
              solicitude sometimes suggests diligence in seeking what is
              lacking; and this is commendable and opposed to negligence.
              Sometimes it suggests anxiety of spirit with a lack of hope and
              with the fear of not obtaining that about which one is anxious.
              Such anxiety the Lord forbids in Matthew (6:25), because no one
              should despair, as though the Lord will not grant what is
              necessary. But in place of anxiety we should have recourse to God:
              “Cast all your anxieties on him, for he cares about you” (1 Pet.
              5:7). And this is done by praying; hence he says,

              It is fitting, after be says
              <i>the Lord is at hand,</i>
              to speak of petition, for it is customary to make petitions of a
              new lord on his arrival. He mentions four things required in every
              prayer. First, that prayer implies the ascent of the mind to God;
              therefore he says,
              <i>by prayer:</i>
              “The prayer of the humble pierces the clouds, and he will not be
              consoled until it reaches the Lord; he will not desist until the
              Most High visits him” (Si. 35:17). Secondly, it should be
              accompanied by confidence of obtaining, and this from God’s mercy:
              “We do not present our supplications before thee on the ground of
              our righteousness, but on the grounds of thy great mercy” (Dan.
              9:18); therefore, he says,
              <i>and supplication,</i>
              which is an appeal to God’s grace and holiness; hence it is the
              prayer of a person humbling himself: “The poor use entreaties”
              (Prov. 18:23). We do this when we say: “Through your passion and
              cross...” Thirdly, because a person who is ungrateful for past
              benefits does not deserve to receive new ones, he adds,
              <i>with thanksgiving:</i>
              “Give thanks in all circumstances” (1 Thess. 5:18). Fourthly,
              prayer is a petition; so he says,
              <i>let your requests be made known to God:</i>
              “Ask, and it will be given you” (Matt. 7:7). If we reflect, we
              will notice that all the prayers of the Church contain these four
              marks: first of all, God is invoked; secondly, the divine benefits
              are thankfully acknowledged; thirdly, a benefit is requested; and
              finally, the supplication is made: “Through our Lord....”

              But it should be noted that be says,
              <i>let your requests be made known to God.</i>
              Does not the Lord know them? This is explained in three ways in a
              Gloss: first,
              <i>let them be made known,</i>
              i.e., approved in God’s presence and counted worthy and holy: “Let
              my prayer be counted as incense before thee” (Ps. 141:2). Or
              <i>let them be made known</i>
              to ourselves, that is, let us recognize that they always reach
              God. As if to say: “But when you pray, go into your room and shut
              the door and pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father
              who sees in secret will reward you” (Matt. 6:6). Or,
              <i>let them be made known</i>
              to those who are with God, i.e., the angels, through whose
              ministry they are brought to God, not because He does not know
              them, but because they intercede for us: “The smoke of the incense
              rose with the prayers of the saints from the hand of the angel
              before God” (Rev. 8:4).

              supradicta dispositum. Et hanc per modum orantis optat. Pax,
              secundum Augustinum, est tranquillitas ordinis, perturbatio enim
              ordinis est destructio pacis. Haec ordinis tranquillitas
              tripliciter consideratur. Primo prout est in principio ordinis,
              scilicet in Deo. Rom. XIII, v. 2:
              <i>quae a Deo sunt, ordinata sunt</i>, et cetera. Ab isto
              profundo, in quo est pax, derivatur primo et perfectius in beatos,
              in quibus nulla est perturbatio, et nec culpae, nec poenae, et
              consequenter derivatur ad sanctos viros. Et quanto est magis
              sanctus, tanto minus patitur perturbationem mentis. Ps. CXVIII,
              165:
              <i
                >pax multa diligentibus legem tuam, et non est illis
                scandalum</i

              <i>ecce ego declinabo super eam quasi fluvium pacis</i>, et

              <i>ecce Deus magnus vincens scientiam nostram</i>, et cetera. Et
              secundum quod est in patria, superat omnem sensum Angelorum; sed
              secundum quod est in sanctis in via, exuperat omnem sensum humanum
              non habentium gratiam. Apoc. II, v. 17:
              <i>vincenti dabo manna absconditum, et dabo illi calculum</i>, et
              cetera.

              Then when he says,
              <i>and the peace of God... will keep your hearts,</i>
              he asks that peace descend on the soul now instructed by the
              things said above. He asks this as though he were entreating.
              Peace, according to Augustine, is the tranquility of order: for
              the disturbance of order is the destruction of peace. This
              tranquility of order is considered from three aspects: first,
              insofar as it exists in the principle of order, namely, in God:
              “For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist
              have been instituted by God. Therefore he who resists the
              authorities resists what God has appointed” (Rom. 13:1). From that
              profound source in which peace exists it flows first into the
              beatified, in whom there is no disturbance either of guilt or of
              punishment; then it flows into saintly men: the holier he is, the
              less his mind is disturbed: “Great peace have those who love thy
              law (Ps. 119:165). But it is more perfect in the beatified:
              “Behold, I will extend prosperity to her like a river, and the
              wealth of the nations like an overflowing stream” (Is. 66:12). Now
              because God alone can deliver the heart from all disturbance, it
              is necessary that it come from Him; hence he says,
              <i>of God:</i>
              and this, inasmuch as peace considered in that source
              <i>passes all</i>
              created
              <i>understanding,</i>
              as it is stated in I Timothy (6:16): “Who alone dwells in
              unapproachable light”; “Behold, God is great, and we know him not;
              the number of his years is unsearchable” (Job 36:26). As it exists
              in heaven, it surpasses all the knowledge of the angels; but as it
              exists in the saints on earth, it surpasses all the knowledge of
              those who lack grace: “To him who conquers I will give some of the
              hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone” (Rev. 2:17).

              These four things are mentioned here. For the object of a good act
              is either the object of the intellect or of the affections: the
              object of the intellect is the true; the object of the affections
              is the good. Hence he says,
              <i>finally brethren,</i>
              i.e., since you are so minded, think of
              <i>whatever is true</i>
              through faith: “Love truth and peace” (Zech. 8:19). In regard to
              an object of the affections, certain characteristics must be
              present of necessity in a good act, and others are over and above.
              Of necessity are three things: first, that it be good in itself;
              hence he says,
              <i>whatever is honorable [chaste]:</i>
              “But the wisdom from above is first pure” (Jas. 3:17); secondly,
              that it be directed to one’s neighbor; hence he says,
              <i>whatever is just:</i>
              “Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness
              [justice], for they shall be satisfied” (Matt. 5:6); thirdly,
              ordained to God; hence he says,
              <i>whatever is pure [holy]:</i>
              “That we might serve him without fear, in holiness and
              righteousness before him all the days of our life” (Lk. 1:74). The
              characteristics over and above what is necessary are twofold:
              first, that it lead to friendship; secondly, that it preserve
              one’s good reputation. As to the first he says,
              <i>whatever is lovely,</i>
              i.e., leading to mutual friendship: “Do not shrink from visiting a
              sick man, because for such deeds you will be loved” (Si. 7:35);
              “There is a friend who sticks closer than a brother” (Prov.
              18:24). As to the second he says,
              <i>whatever is gracious</i>
              [
              <i>of good fame</i>
              ]. For many things can be done with a good conscience, but must be
              omitted for the sake of one’s reputation: “Have regard for your
              name, since it will remain for you longer than a thousand great
              stores of gold” (Si. 41:12).

              judgment and knowledge” (Ps. 119:66). He explains what that
              knowledge is when he says,
              <i>think about these things,</i>
              namely,
              <i>what you have learned</i>
              from my teaching: “Learn from me; for I am gentle and lowly in
              heart” (Matt. 11:29); “Men you received the word of God which you
              heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men but as what

              first acquire it; hence he says,

                I have learned, in whatever state I am, to be content. 12 I know

                circumstances I have learned the secret of facing plenty and
                hunger, abundance and want. 13 I can do all things in him who

                the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church entered into
                partnership with me in giving and receiving except you only; 16
                for even in Thessalonica you sent me help once and again. 17 Not
                that I seek the gift; but I seek the fruit which increases to
                your credit. IS I have received full payment, and more; I am
                filled, having received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent, a
                fragrant offering, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God.

              Good works are acts of mercy and they are called flowers, because
              just as the fruit is produced after the flower, so from acts of
              mercy the fruit of eternal life is received: “My blossoms became
              glorious and abundant fruit” (Si. 24:17). Therefore, when a good
              work is interrupted and then resumed, it is said to flower again.
              But they once provided for the Apostle, and now they provided
              again; therefore he says,

              divitias et deprimuntur per paupertatem, ideo exaltationem vocat

              erigitur animus contra Deum, ex paupertate deiicitur. Et ideo
              dicitur Prov. XXX, 8:

              loquitur melius, quia virtute in utroque scit uti, et hoc

              He explains himself, saying: I
              <i>know how to be abased.</i>
              Now, abasement sometimes denotes a virtue: “He who humbles himself
              will be exalted” (Lk. 18:14); and sometimes a low condition: “His
              feet were hurt with fetters, his neck was put in a collar of iron”
              (Ps. 105:18). This is what he means when he says, I
              <i>know how to be abased,</i>
              i.e., how to endure a lowly condition with equanimity, as is
              becoming. And because men are exalted by riches and humbled by
              poverty, there is danger in each of these conditions: because
              abundance may raise the mind against God, and poverty withdraw it;
              hence it is stated in Proverbs (30:8): “Give me neither poverty
              nor riches.” But the Apostle knows how to employ virtue in both;
              therefore,
              <i>in any and all circumstances,</i>
              i.e., in all places, affairs, states and conditions I have learned
              the secret: “In all things let us conduct ourselves as God’s
              ministers” (2 Cor. 6:4).

              Secondly, he recalls a past favor;
              <i>and you Philippians yourselves know.</i>
              For he had received nothing from certain ones, such as the
              Corinthians and Thessalonians, because the Corinthians were
              covetous and became annoyed when they ministered to him; and
              because the Thessalonians were given to idleness, he labored,
              giving them an example of work. Yet the Philippians were good,
              whether he was present or absent; hence he says in 2 Corinthians
              (11: 8): “I robbed other churches by accepting support from them
              in order to serve you.”
              <i>No church entered into partnership with me in giving</i>

              reap your material benefits?” (1 Cor. 9:11).
              <i>For even in Thessalonica you sent me help once and again.</i>
              This is the reason why the Pope can take from one church to help
              another; but not without cause.

              <i>Not that I seek the gift.</i>
              Here it should be noted that when a person gives something to
              someone else, two things should be considered: the substance of
              the gift and the merit of the donor. One who takes joy in temporal
              things rejoices in the substance of the gift and looks only for
              donors; this is a hireling. But one who looks at the merit of the
              donor looks for the fruit of virtue and justice; such a one is a
              shepherd.
              <i>But I seek the fruit which increases to your credit.</i>
              He says,
              <i>increases,</i>
              because they gave more than they were required: for some gave
              while he was among them, but others even gave while he was in
              Rome. I

              “A pleasing odor to the Lord” (Lev. 4:31). For the devotion of the
              offerer is a sweet odor to God; and of all offerings an alms is
              very beneficial: “Do not neglect to do good and to share what you
              have, for such sacrifices are pleasing to God” (Heb. 13:16).

              have supplied mine. The Lord can do this because He abounds in
              riches: “The same Lord is Lord of all and bestows his riches upon
              all who call upon him” (Rom. 10: 12); hence he says,
