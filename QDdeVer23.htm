              Omni enim voluntatem habenti competit secundum electionem
              voluntatis agere. Sed Deus non agit secundum voluntatis
              electionem; ut enim dicit Dionysius, IV cap. de Divin. Nomin.:
              sicut noster visibilis sol non ratiocinans aut praeeligens, sed
              per ipsum esse illuminat omnia; ita et divina bonitas. Ergo Deo
              non competit voluntatem habere.

              1. It belongs to everyone who has a will to act according to the
              choice of his will. But God does not act according to the choice
              of His will; for, as Dionysius says, just as our visible sun
              enlightens all things, not by reasoning or choosing, but by its
              very being, so too does the divine goodness. It therefore does not
              belong to God to have a will.

              Praeterea, ex causa contingenti non possunt effectus necessarii
              provenire. Sed voluntas est causa contingens, cum se habeat ad
              utrumlibet. Ergo non potest esse causa necessariorum. Deus autem
              est causa omnium, tam necessariorum quam contingentium. Ergo non
              agit per voluntatem; et sic idem quod prius.
            </td>
            <td>
              2. Necessary effects cannot come from a contingent cause. But the
              will is a contingent cause, since it is open to alternatives. It
              cannot, then, be the cause of necessary things. But God is the
              cause of all things, necessary as well as contingent. He therefore
              does not act through a will, and so the conclusion is the same as
              before.

              Praeterea, ei quod non habet aliquam causam, non competit aliquid
              quod importet respectum ad causam. Sed Deus, cum sit prima causa
              omnium, non habet aliquam causam. Ergo, cum voluntas importet
              habitudinem in causam finalem, quia voluntas est finis, secundum
              philosophum in III Ethicorum, videtur quod voluntas Deo non
              competat.
            </td>
            <td>
              3. Nothing which implies a reference to a cause belongs to that
              which has no cause. But since God is the first cause of all
              things, He has no cause. Now a will implies a relationship to a
              final cause, because the will is referred to an end, as the
              Philosopher says. It therefore seems that will does not pertain to
              God.

              Praeterea, secundum philosophum, in III Ethic., voluntarium
              meretur laudem vel vituperium; involuntarium autem veniam et
              misericordiam. Ergo ei non competit ratio voluntarii cui non
              competit ratio laudabilis. Sed Deo non competit ratio laudabilis,
              quia laus, ut dicitur in I Ethic., non est optimorum, sed eorum
              quae ordinantur in optimum; honor autem est optimorum. Ergo Deo
              non competit habere voluntatem.
            </td>
            <td>
              4. According to the Philosopher, what is voluntary deserves praise
              or blame; what is involuntary deserves pardon and mercy.
              Voluntariness therefore does not belong to anything to which
              praiseworthiness does not belong. But praiseworthiness does not
              belong to God because, as is said in the
              <i>Ethics,</i> praise is not for the best, but for those things
              which are directed to the best. Honor is for the best. It
              therefore does not belong to God to have a will.

              Praeterea, opposita nata sunt fieri circa idem. Sed voluntario
              opponitur duplex involuntarium, ut dicitur in libro III Ethic.:
              scilicet involuntarium per ignorantiam, et per violentiam. Sed Deo
              non competit involuntarium per violentiam, quia coactio in Deum
              non cadit; nec involuntarium per ignorantiam, quia ipse omnia
              novit. Ergo nec voluntarium Deo competit.
            </td>
            <td>
              5. Opposites have reference to the same thing. But two species of
              the involuntary are opposed to the voluntary, as is said in the
              <i>Ethics:</i> the involuntary “from violence” and the involuntary
              “from ignorance.” Now nothing involuntary from violence is
              attributable to God because force cannot be applied to Him; nor is
              anything involuntary from ignorance, because He knows everything.
              Then neither is anything voluntary attributable to God.

              Praeterea, ut dicitur in Lib. de regulis fidei, est duplex

              effectionis respectu exteriorum. Voluntas autem affectionis, ut
              ibi dicitur, est faciens ad meritum; voluntas autem effectionis
              est perficiens meritum. Deo autem non competit mereri. Ergo nec
              voluntatem aliquo modo habere.

            <td>
              6. As is said in
              <i>The Rules of Faith,</i> there are two kinds of will:
              <i>affective,</i> regarding internal acts, and
              <i>effective,</i> regarding external acts. Affective will works
              for merit, as is said there; effective will achieves merit. But it
              does not belong to God to merit. Then neither does it belong to
              Him in any way to have a will.

              Praeterea, Deus movens est non motum: quia secundum Boetium,
              immobilis manens dat cuncta moveri. Sed voluntas est movens motum,
              ut dicitur in Lib. III de anima; unde et in II Metaphys., probat
              philosophus quod movet sicut desideratum et intellectum ex hoc
              quod est movens non motum. Ergo Deo non competit voluntatem
              habere.
            </td>
            <td>
              7. God is an unmoved mover because, in the words of Boethius,
              “while remaining immobile He communicates motion to all things.”
              But a will is a moved mover, as is said in <i>The Soul</i>. Hence
              the Philosopher likewise argues from the principle that God is an
              unmoved mover to show that He moves only by being desired and
              known. It therefore does not belong to God to have a will.

              8. Will is a sort of appetite, for it is included in the
              appetitive part of the soul. But appetite is an imperfection,
              since it is directed to what is not had, as Augustine points out.
              Since no imperfection is found in God, it therefore seems that it
              does not belong to Him to have a will.

            <td>
              9. Nothing that has reference to opposites seems to belong to God,
              since things having such reference are subject to generation and
              corruption. But God is far removed from these. Now the will has
              reference to opposites, since it is numbered among the rational
              powers, and these are open to opposite determinations according to
              the Philosopher.” Will is therefore not attributable to God.

              10. Augustine says that God is not disposed in one way to things
              when they are and in another when they are not. But when they are
              not, God does not want things to be; for, if He willed them to be,
              they would be. Therefore even when they are, God does not will
              them to be.

              3. Wherever more perfect conditions for willing are found, will
              exists in a more perfect way. But in God the conditions for
              willing are found most perfectly. In Him there is no separation of
              the will from its subject, because His essence is His will. There
              is no separation of the will from its act, because His action also
              is His essence. There is no separation of the will from the end,
              its object, because His will is His goodness. Therefore will is
              found most perfectly in God.

              Will is most properly found in God. In support of this it should
              be noted that knowledge and will in a spiritual substance are
              founded upon its different relations to things. There is one
              relation of a spiritual substance to things according as the
              things are in some sense within the spiritual substance itself,
              not indeed in their own existence, as the ancients held, saying
              that by earth we know earth and by water, water, etc., but in
              their distinctive intelligible design. “For a stone is not in the
              soul, but its species is” (that is, its intelligible design), as
              the Philosopher taught. Because the intelligible design of a being
              cannot be found by itself without a subject except in an
              immaterial substance, knowledge is not attributed to all things
              but only to immaterial beings. And the degree of knowledge
              parallels the degree of immateriality so that the things which are
              most immaterial are most capable of knowledge. Because their
              essence is immaterial, it serves them as a medium for knowing.
              Through His essence God knows Himself and all other things. Will,
              however, and any appetite is based upon the relation by which a
              spiritual substance is oriented to things as existing in
              themselves.

              principal object, the end. It should be noticed, however, that the

              Ad quartum dicendum, quod laus non debetur voluntati secundum
              quemlibet actum suum, si laus stricte accipitur, ut philosophus
              accipit; sed secundum quod voluntas comparatur ad ea quae sunt ad
              finem. Constat enim quod actus voluntatis invenitur non solum in
              operibus virtutis, quae sunt laudabilia, sed etiam in actu
              felicitatis, quae est honorabilium: constat enim quod felicitas
              delectationem habet. Et tamen etiam laus Deo attribuitur, cum ad
              laudandum Deum in multis locis Scripturae invitemur; sed laus
              communius accipitur quam philosophus accipiat. Vel potest dici,
              quod laus, etiam proprie accepta, Deo competit, in quantum sua
              voluntate ordinat creaturas in seipsum sicut in finem.

              4. If praise is taken strictly, as the Philosopher takes it, it is
              not due to the will in every one of its acts but only in that in
              which the will regards the means to an end. It is clear that an
              act of the will is found not only in virtuous deeds, which are
              praiseworthy, but also in the act of happiness, which is concerned
              with honorable things; for happiness obviously involves pleasure.
              And yet praise is attributed to God too, since we are invited in
              many places in Holy Scripture to praise God. But in this case
              praise is taken more broadly than the Philosopher takes it.—Or it
              can be said that praise, even in its proper sense, is attributable
              to God in so far as by His will He directs creatures to Himself as
              their end.

              be found, but only in an imperfect nature which is tending to

              7. When the object of the will is distinct from the will itself,
              the object really moves the will. But when it is identical with
              the will, then it moves it only in our way of speaking. And in
              regard to this way of speaking, in the opinion of the Commentator
              there is verified the saying of Plato that the first mover moves
              itself inasmuch as it understands and wills itself. Nor does it
              follow from the fact that God wills creatures to be that He is
              moved by creatures, because He does not will the creatures except
              by reason of His own goodness, as has been said.

              a term which it does not yet possess and reposes in a term which
              it has already come to possess. It is accordingly the function of
              one and the same power to tend to a good when it is not yet had,
              and to love it and take pleasure in it after it is had. Both
              belong to the appetitive power, though it gets its name rather
              from that act by which it tends to what it does not have. That is
              why

              The intelligible object is the perfection of the intellect just as
              the willed object is the perfection of the will. In God, however,

              2. The answer was given that, although there is no distinction in
              the divine will on the part of the one Willing, there is no the
              part of the things willed.—On the contrary, order can be held to
              be in the will on the part of the things willed in only two ways:
              either in regard to different things willed or in regard to one
              and the same thing willed. If this order is taken in regard to
              different things willed, it follows that the will will be said to
              be antecedent concerning the first creatures and consequent
              concerning those which follow. But this is false. If, however,
              this order is taken in regard to one and the same thing willed,
              this can only be according to different circumstances considered
              in that thing. But this cannot put any distinction or order in the
              will, since the will is referred to the thing as existing in its
              own nature whereas the thing in its own nature is enmeshed in all
              its conditions. In no sense, therefore, should antecedent and
              consequent be affirmed of the divine will.

              l. Damascene says that it should be noted that “God wills all to
              be saved by His antecedent will,” and not by His consequent will,
              as he adds just afterwards. The distinction of antecedent and
              consequent therefore applies to the divine will.

              The divine will is fittingly distinguished into antecedent and
              consequent. An understanding of this distinction is to be got from
              thee words of Damascene, who introduced it. He says: “Antecedent
              will is God’s acceptance of something on His own account,” whereas
              consequent will is a concession on our account.

              For the clarification of this point it should be noted that in any
              action there is something to be considered on the part of the
              agent and something on the part of the recipient. The agent is
              prior to the product and more important. Thus what pertains to the
              maker is naturally prior to what pertains to the thing made. It is
              evident in the operation of nature, for instance, that the
              production of a perfect animal depends upon the formative power,
              which is found in the semen; but it occasionally happens because
              of the matter receiving it, which is sometimes indisposed, that a
              perfect animal is not produced. This happens, for example, in the
              births of monsters. We accordingly say that it is by the primary
              intention of nature that a perfect animal is produced, but that
              the production of an imperfect animal is by the secondary
              intention of nature, which gives to the matter what it is capable
              of receiving, since it is unable because of the indisposition of
              the matter to give it the form of the perfect state.

              That to which God has destined the creature as far as He is
              concerned is said to be willed by Him in a primary intention or
              antecedent will. But when the creature is held back from this end
              because of its own failure, God nonetheless fulfills in it that
              amount of goodness of which it is capable. This pertains to His
              secondary intention and is called His consequent will. Because,
              then, God has made all men for happiness, He is said to will the
              salvation of all by His antecedent will. But because some work
              against their own salvation, and the order of His wisdom does not
              admit of their attaining salvation in view of their failure, He
              fulfills in them in another way the demands of His goodness,
              damning them out of justice. As a result, falling short of the
              first order of His will, they thus slip into the second. And
              although they do not do God’s will, His will is still fulfilled in
              them. But the failure constituting sin, by which a person is made
              deserving of punishment here and now or in the future, is not
              itself willed by God with either an antecedent or a consequent
              will; it is merely permitted by Him.

              2. The order of the divine will is not based upon the different
              objects of the will but upon the different factors found in one
              and the same object. For example, by His antecedent will God wants
              a certain man to be saved by reason of his human nature, which He
              made for salvation; but by His consequent will He wishes him to be
              damned because of the sins which are found in him. Now although
              the thing to which the act of the will is directed exists with all
              its conditions, it is not necessary that every one of those
              conditions which are found in the object should be the reason
              which moves the will. Wine, for instance, does not move the
              appetite of the drinker by reason of its power of inebriating but
              by reason of its sweetness, although both factors are found
              together in it.

              3. The divine will is the immediate principle of creatures,

              operation unless it is regulated by knowledge and determined by
              the will to do something. The order of things is accordingly
              referred to God’s will rather than to His power or knowledge.—Or
              the answer may be given that the essence of willing consists in a
              reference of the one willing to things themselves, as has been
              said. But things are said to be known or possible for a given
              agent in so far as they are within its knowledge or its power.
              Things do not have any order as they are in God but as they are in
              themselves. Thus the order of things is not attributed to His
              knowledge or to His power but only to His will.

              1. What is done in creatures is a sign or indication not only of
              the divine will but also of the divine knowledge and power. But
              knowledge and power are not distinguished into power and knowledge
              which are God’s essence and those which are indications of it.

              embracing will (<i>voluntas beneplaciti</i>), which is the divine

              2. By the fact that God wishes something by His embracing will it
              is shown that the act of the divine will is brought to bear upon
              it with the result that it is pleasing to God. Then that upon
              which His indicative will is brought to bear is either pleasing to
              God or not. If it is pleasing to God, then He wills it with His
              embracing will; and in that case His indicative will should not be
              distinguished from His embracing will. If, however, it is not
              something pleasing to God, it is nevertheless designated as
              pleasing to Him by His indicative will; and consequently the
              indication of the divine will is false. And so in the true
              doctrine such indications of the divine will should not be
              affirmed.

              sequence of dependence; for God does not do anything which He does
              not will with His embracing will, and He wills nothing in
              creatures with His embracing will which He does not do, according
              to the words of the Psalm (113: 3): “[The Lord] has done all
              things whatsoever he would.” God’s operation should therefore not
              be listed under His indicative will, which is opposed to His

              In matters dealing with God there are two different ways of
              speaking: (1) In proper language. This is found when we attribute
              to God what pertains to Him in His own nature, although it always
              pertains to Him in a way that goes beyond what we conceive in our
              minds or express in speech. For this reason none of our language
              about God can be proper in the full sense. (2) In figurative,
              transferred, or symbolic language. Because God, as He is in
              Himself, exceeds the grasp of our mind, we must speak of Him by
              means of the things that are found in our world. Thus we apply the
              names of sensible things to God, calling Him light or a lion or
              something of the sort. The truth of such expressions is founded on
              the fact that no creature “is deprived altogether of participation
              in good,” as Dionysius says. In every creature there are to be
              found certain properties representing the divine goodness in some
              respect. Thus the name is transferred to God inasmuch as the thing
              signified by the name is a sign of the divine goodness. Any sign,
              then, that is used instead of what is signified in speaking of God
              is a figurative expression.

              Uterque autem istorum modorum loquendi concurrit in voluntate

              consequentem distinguitur, ut dictum est, art. praeced. Quia vero

              Both of these two ways of speaking are used in regard to the
              divine will. There is found in God in a proper sense the formal
              character of will, as was said above; and so will is properly
              predicated of God. This is His
              <i>embracing will</i>
              (<i>voluntas beneplaciti</i>), which is distinguished into
              antecedent and consequent, as has been said. Because, however,
              will in us has some passion of the soul consequent upon it, the
              name of the will is predicated of God metaphorically like the
              names of the other passions. The name of anger is applied to God
              because there is found in Him an effect which is commonly that of
              an angry person among us, namely, punishment. As a consequence the
              punishment itself which God inflicts is called God’s anger. In
              like manner whatever is commonly a sign or indication of will
              among us is called the will of God. For this reason we speak of
              His
              <i>indicative will</i>
              (<i>voluntas signi</i>) because the sign itself which is usually
              the sign or indication of the will is called will.

              Now since the will can be considered both as prescribing a course
              of action and as setting the work in motion, in either sense
              certain signs are attributed to the will. From the viewpoint of
              its proposing a course of action regarding flight from evil, its
              sign is a
              <i>prohibition.</i>
              Regarding the pursuit of good there are two signs of the will. If
              the good is necessary and the will cannot attain its end without
              it, the sign of the will is a
              <i>command.</i>
              If the good is useful and by it the end can be acquired in an
              easier and more suitable fashion, the sign of the will is a
              <i>counsel.</i>
              From the viewpoint of setting the work in motion two signs are
              attributed to the will. One is express, and this is an
              <i>operation;</i>
              for the fact that a person does something indicates that he
              expressly wills it. The other is an interpretative sign,
              <i>permission;</i>
              for anyone, who does not forbid what he can prevent, when
              interpreted seems to consent to it. This is what the name
              permission implies.

              1. Although God is capable of doing all things and knows all
              things, yet He does not will all things. Consequently, besides the
              signs found in creatures, by which it is shown that He is knowing,
              powerful, and willing, certain signs are ascribed to His will to
              show what God wills and not only the fact that He is willing.—Or
              it may be said that knowledge and power are not accompanied by a
              passion, as the will is in our case. Thus the will comes closer to
              the things which are said metaphorically of God than do either
              power or knowledge. And so the signs of will we call will,
              metaphorically speaking, more than we call the signs of knowledge

              quod solet esse alicuius rei signum, sit falsum quando ei non
              respondet id quod solet significare, nisi tunc tantum quando ad
              significandum illud adhibetur. Quamvis ergo praecipere in nobis
              sit signum volendi illud, non tamen quandocumque praecipit aliquid
              vel Deus vel homo, oportet quod significet se velle illud esse.

              Or the answer can be given that His indicative will is not so
              called because it means that God wills the matter itself, but
              because what is ordinarily the indication of a will in our case is
              called will. It is not necessary that what is usually the sign of
              a certain thing be false when its usual term of reference does not
              correspond to it, but only when it is used in that signification.
              Although among us to command something is the sign of our willing
              it, yet is not necessary, whenever either God or man commands
              something, for him to signify that he wishes it to be. It
              consequently does not follow that it is a false sign.

              non subsit. Sed in verbo, si non subsit illud quod significat, de
              necessitate est falsitas, quia scilicet verba ad hoc sunt
              instituta ut sint signa; unde si non respondet eis signatum, est
              ibi falsitas. Actiones autem non sunt ad hoc institutae ut

              That is why there is not always a falsehood in our actions
              whenever an action which usually signifies something is performed
              and that signification is not there. But in our words, if what
              they signify does not underlie them, there is necessarily falsity,
              because words have been instituted for the very purpose of being
              signs. Hence, if what is signified does not correspond to them,
              there is falsity there. Actions, on the other hand, have not been
              instituted to serve as signs but to get something done. That they
              signify anything is quite accidental to them. There is
              consequently not always falsity in them if what is usually
              signified does not correspond. There can be falsity only when they
              are made use of by the agent in order to signify something.

              end which is the reason for willing, but all evils lack a relation
              to that end, all evils are on the same footing not only in regard
              to the end but also in regard to the divine will. But to goods,
              which are referred to the end, the will stands in different
              relations according to the different relation which they have to
              the end. For this reason there are different indications for the
              good and the better, but not for the bad and the worse.

              embracing will is always fulfilled, something which is fulfilled
              can also belong to His indicative will. Hence, even the matters
              which God commands or counsels He sometimes wills with an
              embracing will. But His indicative will is distinguished from His
              embracing will because the one is God Himself, the other is an
              effect of His, as has already been explained.

              which God permits evil to be done, since He never wills evil to be
              done; (2) there is another which always coincides, as an
              operation; (3) there is another which sometimes coincides,
              sometimes not, as a precept, a prohibition, or a counsel.

              2. The answer was given that God’s willing is necessary and
              eternal on the part of the One willing both from the viewpoint of
              the act of will, which is the divine essence, and from that of the
              reason for willing, which is the divine goodness; but not under
              the aspect of the relation of the will to the thing willed.—On the
              contrary, the very fact of God’s willing anything implies a
              relationship of the will to the thing willed. But the fact of
              God’s willing something is eternal. Then the relationship of the
              will to the thing willed is itself eternal and necessary.

              3. The answer was given that the relationship to the thing willed

              its exemplary idea, not inasmuch as it exists in itself or in its
              own nature.—On the contrary, a thing is willed by the fact of
              having the will of God referred to it. Consequently, if the will
              of God were not referred from all eternity to the thing willed as
              it exists in itself but merely as it exists in its exemplary idea,
              then a temporal fact, such as the salvation of Peter, would not be
              willed by God from all eternity as it exists in its own nature;
              but it would merely be the object of God’s will from all eternity
              as it exists in God’s eternal ideas. But this is obviously false.

              the act or of the reason for willing, not from that of its
              relationship to the thing willed.—On the contrary, to create is an
              act which always implies a relation to its effect, for it connotes
              a temporal effect. But the above reasoning would be verified
              concerning creation if it were supposed that God had always been
              creating, because what He has created He is unable not to have
              created. It therefore follows with necessity also from the

              It is consequently impossible for Him to will what He has not
              willed or not to will what He has willed. Hence whatever He wills
              He wills from necessity, and whatever He does not will He
              necessarily does not will.

              willed it, because what has been done is unable not to have been

              It should therefore be noted that the object of any will is

              secondary. The principal object is that to which the will is
              directed of its own nature, since the will is a nature and has a
              natural ordination to something. This is what the will naturally
              wills, as the human will naturally desires happiness. In regard to
              this object the will is under necessity, since it tends to it in
              the manner of a nature. A man, for instance, cannot will to be
              miserable or not to be happy. Secondary objects of the will are
              the things which are directed to this principal object as to an
              end. Now upon these two different sorts of objects the will has a

              own goodness, on account of which He wills whatever else He wills
              distinct from Himself. For He makes things on account of His own
              goodness, as Augustine says; that is to say, He does it in order
              that His goodness, which cannot be multiplied in its essence, may
              at least by a certain participation through likeness be poured out
              upon many recipients. Hence the things which He wills concerning
              creatures are, as it were, the secondary objects of His will. He
              wills them on account of His goodness. Thus the divine goodness

              It is not, however, under any necessity in regard to any other

              means stands to the will in the same relation as it stands to the
              end. Hence if the means is proportioned to the end so that it
              embraces the end perfectly and without it the end cannot be
              obtained, the means, like the end, is desired of necessity, and
              especially by a will which cannot depart from the rule of wisdom.

              But just as no effect of God is equal to the power of the cause,

              property of the uncreated Word. From this it comes about that, no
              matter how much more nobly any pure creature is related to God,
              being assimilated to Him in some way, it is still possible for
              some other creature to be related to God and to represent the
              divine goodness in a manner equally noble.

              It is accordingly clear that from the love which God has for His
              own goodness there is no necessity in the divine will for willing
              this or that concerning a creature. Nor is there any necessity in
              it as regards the whole of creation, since the divine goodness is
              perfect in itself, and would be so even though no creature
              existed, because God has no need of our goods, as is said in the
              Psalm (15:2). For the divine goodness is not an end of the kind
              which is produced by the means to the end, but rather one by which
              the things which are directed to it are produced and perfected.
              For this reason Avicenna says that only God’s action is purely
              liberal, because nothing accrues to Him from what He wills or does
              regarding any creature.

              1. Something is said to be necessary in two ways: (1) absolutely,
              and (2) conditionally. Something is said to be necessary
              absolutely because of a necessary relation which the terms used in
              a proposition have to each other; e.g., “Man is an animal” or
              “Every whole is greater than its part” and the like. But something
              is necessary conditionally which is not necessary of itself but
              only if something else is given; e.g., “Socrates has run.” In
              himself Socrates is no more disposed to this than to its opposite;
              but on the condition that he has run it is impossible for him not
              to have run.

              I say, therefore, that God’s willing something in creatures, as
              that Peter be saved, is not necessary absolutely, since the divine
              will does not have a necessary relation to this, as is evident
              from what has been said. But on the condition that God wills or
              has willed it, then it is impossible for Him not to have willed or
              not to will it, since His will is unchangeable. Among the
              theologians such necessity is accordingly called the necessity of
              unchangeability. Now the fact that God’s act of willing is not
              absolutely necessary comes from the thing willed, which falls
              short of a perfect proportion to the end, as has been said. In
              this respect the answer given above is verified. And eternity is

              15. The will has a twofold relation to its object: (1) inasmuch as
              the latter is the object, and (2) inasmuch as it is to be brought
              into act by the will. The second relation presupposes the first.
              We first understand that the will wills something. Then, from the
              fact that it wills it, we understand that it is bringing it forth
              into reality, if the will is efficacious. The first relation of
              the divine will to its object is not necessary in an absolute
              sense because of the lack of proportion of the object to the end,
              which is the reason for willing, as has been said. Hence it is not
              necessary absolutely that God will it. But the second relation is
              necessary because of the efficacy of the divine will; and for this
              reason it follows of necessity that if God wills anything with His
              embracing will, it comes about.

              Posita enim causa sufficienti, necesse est effectum poni; quod sic
              probat Avicenna in sua Metaph. Si enim posita causa, non
              necessario effectus ponitur, ergo adhuc post positionem causae,
              effectus se habet ad utrumque, scilicet ad esse et non esse. Sed
              quod est in potentia ad duo, non determinatur ad unum eorum, nisi
              sit aliquid determinans. Ergo post positionem causae, adhuc
              oportet ponere aliquid quod faciat effectum esse; et ita causa
              illa non erat sufficiens; et ita oportet quod, ea posita,
              necessarium sit effectum poni. Divina autem voluntas sufficiens
              causa est; et non est causa contingens, sed necessaria. Ergo et
              res volitae a Deo sunt necessariae.

            <td>
              1. When a sufficient cause is placed, it is necessary that the
              effect be placed. Avicenna proves this’ as follows. If, when the
              cause is placed, the effect is not necessarily placed, then even
              after the placing of the cause the effect remains open to the
              alternatives of either existence or non-existence. But whatever
              has the potentiality of alternatives is not determined to either
              one of them unless there is something to determine it.
              Consequently, after the placing of the cause it is still necessary
              to posit something which will make the effect exist. The cause was
              accordingly not sufficient. But if the cause is sufficient, when
              it is placed, the placing of the effect must be necessary. Now the
              divine will is a sufficient cause, and not a contingent but a
              necessary cause. The things willed by God are therefore necessary.

              media; quamvis motus solis, qui est causa prima, sit causa
              necessaria. Sed omnem defectum causae secundae potest divina
              voluntas removere, et omne impedimentum. Ergo contingentia causae
              secundae non impedit quin effectus sit necessarius propter
              necessitatem voluntatis divinae.

              2. The answer was given that from a necessary cause there
              sometimes follows a contingent effect because of the contingency
              of an intervening cause; e.g., from a major premise expressing
              what is necessary a contingent conclusion follows because of a
              subsumption expressing what is contingent.—On the contrary,
              whenever a contingent effect follows from a necessary cause
              because of the contingency of an intermediate cause, this comes
              from the deficiency of the second cause. The blossoming of a tree,
              for example, is contingent and not necessary because of the
              possible failure of the germinative power, which is the
              intermediate cause, although the motion of the sun, the first
              cause, is a necessary cause. But the divine will can remove all
              deficiency from the second cause, and likewise every hindrance.
              The contingency of a second cause, therefore, does not keep the
              effect from being necessary because of the necessity of the divine
              will.

              3. When the effect is contingent because of the contingency of the
              second cause, given a necessary first cause, the non-existence of
              the effect is compatible with the existence of the first cause.
              Thus the non-blossoming of a tree in spring is compatible with the
              motion of the sun. But the non-existence of what is willed by God
              is not compatible with the divine will. For these two things,
              God’s willing something to be and its not being, are
              irreconcilable. Consequently the contingency of second causes does
              not prevent the things willed by God from being necessary because
              of the necessity of the divine will.

              4. The answer was given that, although the non-existence of a
              divine effect is not compatible with the divine will, even so,
              because the second cause can fail, the effect itself is
              contingent.—On the contrary, the effect does not fail to occur
              except by the failure of the second cause. But it is impossible
              that the second cause should fail, given the divine will; for in
              that case there would simultaneously be verified the existence of
              the divine will and the non-existence of what is willed by God.
              But this is manifestly false. Hence the contingency of second
              causes does not prevent the effect of the divine will from being
              necessary.

              The divine will does not impose necessity upon all things. The
              reason for this is ascribed by some to the fact that, since this
              will is the first cause of all things, it produces certain effects
              through the mediation of secondary causes which are contingent and
              can fail. Thus the effect follows the, contingency of the
              proximate cause, not the necessity of the first cause. But this
              seems to be in agreement with those who held that all things
              proceed from God with natural necessity, just as they held that
              from the simple One there proceeds immediately a single being
              having some multiplicity, and through its mediation the whole
              multitude of things proceeds. In like fashion they say that from a
              single wholly immobile principle there proceeds something which is
              immobile in its substance but mobile and undetermined as to
              position, and through the mediation of this being generation and
              corruption occur in the things here below. In this line of
              argument it could not be held that multiplicity and corruptible
              and contingent things are caused immediately by God. But that
              position is contrary to the doctrine of the faith, which holds
              that a multitude even of corruptible things was immediately
              created by God; for example, the first individuals of trees and
              brute animals.

              It is accordingly necessary to assign a different principal reason
              for the contingency in things, to which the previously assigned
              cause will be subordinated. For the patient must be assimilated to
              the agent; and, if the agent is most powerful, the likeness of the
              effect to the agent cause will be perfect; but if the agent is
              weak, the likeness will be imperfect. Thus because of the strength
              of the formative power in the semen a son is made like his father
              not only in the nature of the species but also in many accidents.
              On the other hand, because of the weakness of the power mentioned
              the aforesaid assimilation is done away with, as is said in
              <i>Animals</i>. Now the divine will is a most powerful agent.
              Hence its effect must be made like it in all respects, so that
              there not only comes about what God wants to come about (a sort of
              likening in species), but it comes about in the manner in which
              God wants it to come about—necessarily or contingently, quickly or
              slowly (and this is a sort of likening in its accidents).

              The divine will determines this manner for things beforehand in
              the order of God’s wisdom. According as it arranges for certain
              things to come into being in this way or in that, it adapts their
              causes to the manner fixed upon. It could, however, introduce this
              manner into things even without the mediation of those causes. We
              accordingly say that some of the divine effects are contingent not
              merely because of the contingency of secondary causes but rather
              because of the appointment of the divine will, which saw to such
              an order for things.

              the necessity of nature and in regard to their immediate effects;
              but it is beside the point in the case of voluntary causes,
              because a thing follows from the will in the way in which the will
              disposes and not in the way in which the will has existence, as
              occurs among natural causes. In the latter we look to an
              assimilation as regards the condition of the cause and the thing
              caused, which is the same in both, whereas in voluntary causes we
              look to an assimilation as regards the fulfillment of the will of
              the agent in the effect, as has been said. And even in regard to
              natural causes the argument does not apply in the case of their

      Ad tertium dicendum, quod quamvis non esse effectus divinae voluntatis non
      possit simul stare cum divina voluntate, tamen potentia deficiendi
      effectum simul stat cum divina voluntate; non enim sunt ista

      sunt incompossibilia: Deus vult istum salvari, et iste damnatur. 3.
      Although the non-existence of an effect of the divine will is incompatible
      with the divine will, the possibility that the effect should be lacking is
      given simultaneously with the divine will. God’s willing someone to be
      saved and the possibility that that person be damned are not incompatible;
      but God’s willing him to be saved and his actually being damned are
      incompatible. Etiam similiter dicendum est ad quartum de effectu causae
      mediae. 4. The same is to be said about the deficiency of the intervening
      cause.

              3 Political justice, which is found in human affairs, has its
              model in natural justice, which consists in the fulfillment of its
              own nature by anything whatever. But each thing participates in
              the order of its nature because of the divine will; for Hilary
              says: “The will of God has conferred upon all creatures their
              essence.” All justice therefore depends merely upon the will of
              God.

              Since justice is a certain “correctness,” as Anselm says or
              “equation,” as the Philosopher teaches, the essential character of
              justice must depend first of all upon that in which there is first
              found the character of a rule according to which the equality and
              correctness of justice is established in things. Now the will does
              not have the character of the first rule; it is rather a rule
              which has a rule, for it is directed by reason and the intellect.
              This is true not only in us but also in God, although in us the
              will is really distinct from the intellect. For this reason the
              will and its correctness are not the same thing. In God, however,
              the will is really identical with the intellect, and for this
              reason the correctness of His will is really the same as His will
              itself. Consequently the first thing upon which the essential
              character of all justice depends is the wisdom of the divine
              intellect, which constitutes things in their due proportion both
              to one another and to their cause. In this proportion the
              essential character of created justice consists. But to say that
              justice depends simply upon the will is to say that the divine
              will does not proceed according to the order of wisdom, and that
              is blasphemous.

              operatione invenitur ratio debiti non ex parte agentis, cum Deus
              nulli sit debitor, sed ex parte recipientis: debitum enim est
              unicuique rei naturali ut habeat ea quae exigit sua natura, tam in
              essentialibus quam in accidentalibus. Hoc autem debitum ex divina
              sapientia dependet; in quantum scilicet res naturalis debet esse
              talis quod imitetur propriam ideam quae est in mente divina: et
              per hunc modum invenitur ipsa divina sapientia prima regula
              iustitiae naturalis. In omnibus autem divinis operationibus quibus
              Deus creaturae aliquid supra debitum naturae impendit, utpote in
              muneribus gratiarum, idem modus iustitiae invenitur qui in prima
              operatione est assignatus qua naturas instituit.

              3. God works in natural things in two ways: (1) by establishing
              the natures themselves, and (2) by providing each thing with
              whatever belongs to its nature. The essence of justice demands
              something due. Now, since it is no way due that creatures be
              brought into being, but purely voluntary, the first operation does
              not have the note of justice, but it depends simply upon the
              divine will. It might, however, conceivably be said to have the
              note of justice because of the ordination of the thing made to the
              will. For it is of obligation from the very fact that God wills it
              that everything which God wills be done. But in the fulfillment of
              this ordination it is wisdom which does the directing as the first
              rule. In the second sort of operation, however, there is found the
              character of something due, not on the part of the agent, since
              God is indebted to no one, but rather on the part of the
              recipient. It is due to every natural being that it have the
              things which its nature calls for both in essentials and in
              accidentals. But what is due depends upon the divine wisdom
              inasmuch as the natural being should be such as to imitate the
              idea of it which is in the divine mind. In this way the divine
              wisdom is found to be the first rule of justice. In all the divine
              operations, however, by which God bestows upon the creature
              anything beyond the debt of nature, as in the gifts of grace, the
              same sort of justice is found as is assigned in the first sort of
              operation, by which God establishes natures.

              For in God will, wisdom, and goodness are really identical. But on
              the part of the thing willed the divine will has a principle,
              which is that of the thing willed, not that of the One willing,
              according to which the thing willed is ordained to something else
              either by desert or by fitness. This ordination belongs to the
              divine wisdom. Hence this is the first root of justice.

              of our will to the divine, being affirmative, does not bind to
              constant compliance though it constantly binds. Thus it is not
              necessary that whenever conformity is lacking there is sin.—On the
              contrary, although a person not observing an affirmative
              commandment does not sin at every moment in which he is not
              observing it, yet he does sin whenever he acts contrary to it.
              Thus a person sins whenever he dishonors his parents, although he
              does not always sin when he is not actually honoring them. But he
              who sins mortally acts contrary to the conformity in question. It

              5. The answer was given that he is not obliged at that moment in
              which he is sinning venially, because affirmative commandments do
              not oblige us to comply always.—On the contrary, whoever does not
              comply with an affirmative commandment at the place and time at
              which it binds, is adjudged a transgressor. But it seems that no
              other time for conforming our will to the divine will can be
              determined upon than that at which the will passes into act.
              Hence, whenever the will passes into act, unless it is conformed
              to the divine will, there seems to be a sin; and so when a person
              sins venially, the sin seems to be mortal.

              cannot obtain it unless he carefully prepares himself for it. One

              not have charity he sins, since his not having it comes from a

              8. Since the form of an act consists especially in the manner of
              acting, if we are held to conformity with the divine will, we must
              will a thing in the same manner in which God wills it. Now a
              person can imitate the manner of the divine will after a fashion
              both by natural love and by gratuitous love. The conformity of
              which we speak, however, cannot be taken with reference to natural
              love, because even infidels and sinners conform their will to
              God’s in this manner as long as the natural love of good is alive
              within them. Similarly it cannot be taken with reference to
              gratuitous love, that is, charity. In that case we should be
              obliged to will from charity whatever we will. But this is
              contrary to the opinion of many, who say that the manner does not
              fall within the scope of the commandment. It therefore seems that

              Thus a friend is said to be a friend to his friend, and a brother,
              a brother to his brother. If, then, our will can conform to the

              Everyone is obliged to conform his will to God’s. The reason for
              this can be taken from the fact that in every genus there is some
              one thing which is primary and is the measure of all the other
              things which are in that genus, for in it the nature of the genus
              is most perfectly found. This is verified of the nature of color,
              for example, in whiteness, which is called the measure of all
              colors because the extent to which each color shares in the nature
              of the genus is known from its nearness to whiteness or its
              remoteness from it, as is said in the
              <i>Metaphysics</i>. In this way God Himself is the measure of all
              beings, as can be gathered from the words of the Commentator.

              But it should be noted that this conformity can be taken in many

              volitional act. Our conformity to God on the part of the will as a
              faculty is natural, belonging to the image. It accordingly does
              not fall under any commandment. But the act of the divine will has
              not only this characteristic, that it is an act of will, but at
              the same time this also, that it is the cause of all things that
              are acts. The act of our will can therefore conform to the divine
              will either as an effect to its cause or as a will to a will.

              Now the conformity of an effect to its cause is found in a
              different way among natural and among voluntary causes. In the
              case of natural causes the conformity is to be found according to
              a likeness in nature. For example, man begets a man, and fire
              begets fire. But in the case of voluntary causes the effect is
              said to conform to the cause by reason of the fact that the cause
              is fulfilled in the effect. Thus a product of art is likened to
              its cause, not because it is of the same nature as the art which
              is in the mind of the artist, but because the form of the art is
              fulfilled in the product. It is in this way that an effect of the
              will is conformed to the will when what the will disposes comes
              about. And so an act of our will conforms to the divine will by
              reason of the fact that we will what God wants us to will.

              One will is like another in species, I say, when the two have in
              common the same object; for from the object the act draws its
              species. But in the object of the will two aspects are to be taken
              into account: one which is, as it were, material—the thing willed;
              another which is, as it were, formal—the reason for willing, which
              is the end. It is like the case of the object of sight, in which
              color is in effect material, and light is formal, because by light
              the color is made actually visible. Thus on the part of the object
              two sorts of conformity can be found. One derives from the thing
              willed. A man, for instance, wills something that God wills. This
              conformity is, in a sense, based upon the material cause; for the
              object is, as it were, the matter of the act. It is accordingly
              the least among the types of conformity. The other sort of
              conformity derives from the reason for willing or the end. This is
              had when someone wills something for the same reason for which God
              wills it. Conformity of this kind is based upon the final cause.

              4. Although one who sins venially does not in this act conform his
              will to the divine, yet he does conform it habitually. Nor is he
              obliged always to go into act, but only according to the place and
              time. He is, however, obliged never to do anything contrary. But
              one who sins venially does not act contrary to the conformity in
              question but rather beyond its scope. Hence it does not follow
              that he sins mortally.

              6. A person is said to be obstinate in two senses: (1) This is
              said
              <i>absolutely,</i>
              when he has a will irreversibly adhering to evil. In this sense
              those who are in hell are obstinate, but not anyone in this life.
              Those who are in hell are still held to the conformity of which we
              are treating. Although they cannot attain it, nevertheless they
              were themselves the cause of their own impotence. They accordingly
              sin in not conforming their wills, although it happens that they
              do not incur demerit because they are not wayfarers. (2) A person
              is said to be obstinate
              <i>in a certain respect,</i>
              when, namely, he has a will adhering to evil which is not
              altogether irreversible but reversible only with great difficulty.
              It is in this sense that some are said to be obstinate in this
              life. These are able to conform their will to God’s. Hence in not
              conforming they not only sin but also incur demerit.

              8. We are said to be obliged to something in two ways: (1) We are
              obliged in such a way that, if we do not do it, we incur a
              penalty. And this is the proper sense of being obliged. According
              to the more common opinion we are not obliged in this way to do
              anything from charity; but we are so obliged to do something from
              natural love, and without at least this whatever is done is badly
              done. By natural love I mean not only that which is implanted in
              us by nature and is common to all, as all desire happiness, but
              also that to which a person can attain by natural principles. It
              is found in actions that are good by reason of their genus, and
              also in the political virtues. (z) We are said to be obliged to
              something because without it we are unable to attain our end,
              beatitude. In this way we are obliged to do something from
              charity, without which nothing that merits eternal life can be
              done. It is accordingly clear how the mode of charity in one way
              falls within the scope of commandment and in another does not.

              proper sense of proportion as found among quantities, consisting
              of a Certain measure of two quantities compared to each other.
              Nevertheless, in the sense in which the term proportion is
              transferred to signify any relationship of one thing to another
              (as we say that there is a likeness of proportions in this

              relationship to Him inasmuch as he is made by God and subject to
              Him.

              Or the answer could be given that, although there cannot be
              between the finite and the infinite a proportion properly so
              called, yet there can be a proportionality or the likeness of two
              proportions. We say that four is proportioned to two because it is
              the double; but we say that four is proportionable to six because
              four is to two as six is to three. In the same way, although the
              finite and the infinite cannot be proportioned, they can be
              proportionable, because the finite is equal to the finite just as
              the infinite is to the infinite. In this way there is a likeness
              of the creature to God, because the creature stands to the things
              which are its own as God does to those which belong to Him.

              alterius formam habere; quod significatur cum aliquid simile
              alteri dicitur. Sed quando forma est in uno principaliter, in
              altero vero quasi secundario, non recipitur similitudinis
              reciprocatio; sicut dicimus statuam Herculis similem Herculi, sed
              non e converso; non enim potest dici quod Hercules habeat formam
              statuae, sed solum quod statua habeat Herculis formam. Et per hunc
              modum creaturae dicuntur esse Deo similes et conformes, non tamen
              e contra. Sed conformatio, cum sit motus ad conformitatem, non
              importat aequiparantiae relationem, sed praesupponit aliquid ad
              cuius conformitatem alterum moveatur; unde posteriora prioribus

              11. Although likeness and conformity are reciprocal relations,
              these terms do not always designate indifferently the reference of
              either one of the related members to the other. It is only when
              the form on which the likeness or conformity is based is in each
              of the extremes in the same way, as whiteness is in two men. In
              that case either one can aptly be said to have the form of the
              other; and this is what is meant when something is said to be like
              another. But when the form is in one principally and in the other
              in a secondary way, reciprocity of the likeness is not had. Thus
              we say that the statue of Hercules is like Hercules, but not the
              other way about; for it cannot be said that Hercules has the form
              of the statue, but only that the statue has the form of Hercules.
              In this way creatures are said to be similar and conformed to God
              but not God to creatures. But since conformation is a motion
              toward conformity, it does not imply a reciprocal relation but
              presupposes one of the related members and denotes that something
              else is moving toward conformity with it. Succeeding things are
              conformed to preceding, but not conversely.

              2. What God knows can be revealed to someone else. Now God knows
              that a certain person is reprobated. He can therefore reveal to
              someone his reprobation. On the supposition that He reveals this
              to someone, it therefore follows that this person is bound to will
              his own damnation if we are bound to will what we know God wills.
              To will one’s own damnation, however, is contrary to charity, by
              which each one loves himself even to eternal life. A person would
              therefore be bound to will something against charity. But that is
              not befitting.

              He prayed shows: “My Father, if it be possible, let this chalice
              pass from me” (Matthew 26:39), even though God wished Him to

              5. According to Augustine’ sadness is had regarding the things
              which have happened to us against our will. But the Blessed Virgin
              felt sorrow at the death of her son, as is indicated in the words
              of Simeon: “Thy own soul a sword shall pierce” (Luke 2:35). The
              Blessed Virgin therefore did not wish Christ to suffer, but God
              wished it. Now if we are obliged to will what God wills, the
              Blessed Virgin sinned in this instance. But that cannot be
              granted. Thus it is seen that we are not obliged to conform our
              will to God’s as to the object.

              in regard to the object of our will we are in a sense obliged to
              conform our will to God’s and in a sense we are not. We are
              obliged to conform our will to God’s in this respect (as has been
              said), that the divine goodness is the rule and measure of every
              good will. But since good depends upon the end, a will is called
              good on the basis of its relation to the reason for willing, which
              is the end. The reference of the will to the object, however, does
              not in itself make the act of will good, since the object stands
              materially, as it were, to the reason for willing, which is an
              upright end. One and the same object can be desired either rightly
              or wrongly according as it is referred to different ends; and on
              the other hand different and even contrary objects can both be
              willed rightly by being referred to an upright end. Therefore,
              although the will of God cannot be anything but good, and whatever
              He wills He wills rightly, nevertheless the goodness in the very
              act of the divine will is viewed from the standpoint of the reason
              for willing, that is, the end to which God refers whatever He
              wills, His own goodness.

              Ad secundum dicendum, quod quamvis de potentia absoluta Deus
              possit revelare suam damnationem alicui, non tamen hoc potest
              fieri de potentia ordinaria, quia talis revelatio cogeret eum
              desperare. Et si alicui talis revelatio fieret, deberet intelligi
              non secundum modum prophetiae praedestinationis vel praescientiae,
              sed per modum prophetiae comminationis, quae intelligitur
              supposita conditione meritorum. Sed dato quod esset intelligenda
              secundum praescientiae prophetiam, adhuc non teneretur ille cui
              talis revelatio fieret, velle suam damnationem absolute, sed
              secundum ordinem iustitiae, quo Deus vult persistentes in peccato
              damnare. Non enim vult Deus ex parte sua aliquem damnare, sed
              secundum id quod ex nobis est, ut ex supradictis patet. Unde velle
              suam damnationem absolute, non esset conformare voluntatem suam
              divinae, sed voluntati peccati.

              2. Although in His absolute power God could reveal to someone his
              damnation, this can nevertheless not be done in His ordered power,
              because such a revelation would drive the man to despair. And if
              such a revelation were made to anyone, it would have to be
              understood, not as a prophecy of predestination or foreknowledge,
              but as one of warning, which is based upon the supposition that
              merits are taken into account. But granted that it were to be
              understood in the sense of a prophecy of foreknowledge, the one to
              whom such a revelation were made would still not be obliged to
              will his own damnation absolutely but only according to the order
              of justice, in which God wills to damn those who persist in sin.
              For God does not on His own part wish to damn anyone, but only in
              accordance with what depends upon us, as is clear from what has
              been said above. To will one’s own damnation absolutely, then,
              would not be to conform one’s will to God’s but to conform it to
              the will of sin.

              Ad quartum dicendum, quod passio Christi dupliciter considerari
              poterat: uno modo per se, in quantum scilicet erat quaedam
              afflictio innocentis; alio modo secundum ordinem ad fructum ad
              quem Deus eam ordinabat: et sic erat a Deo volita, non autem primo
              modo. Voluntas ergo Christi, quae poterat istum ordinem
              considerare, scilicet voluntas rationis, hanc passionem volebat,
              sicut et Deus; sed voluntas sensualitatis, cuius est non conferre,
              sed in aliquid absolute ferri, non volebat hanc passionem. Et in
              hoc divinae voluntati quodammodo in volito conformabatur, quando

              4. The passion of Christ could be considered in two ways: (1) in
              itself, inasmuch as it was an affliction of an innocent person,
              and (2) in its relation to the fruit to which God ordained it. In
              this latter sense it was willed by God, not in the former. The
              will of Christ which could consider that relation, namely, His
              rational will, therefore willed this passion as God did; but the
              will of sensuality, which is not capable of comparing but is
              brought to bear upon something absolutely, did not will this
              passion. In this respect also it was conformed to the divine will,
              in a sense, even as regards the object, because even God Himself
              did not will the passion of Christ taken in itself.

              5. The will of the Blessed Virgin was averse to the passion of
              Christ considered in itself; yet it willed the fruit of salvation
              which was coming from the passion of Christ. Thus it was conformed
              to the divine will both as regards what it was willing and as
              regards what it was not willing.

              whose craving for wine was denied by his physician because of
              their common desire for the patient’s health would find in that
              physician a truer friend than if the latter were willing to
              satisfy the patient’s desire for a drink of wine at the peril of
              his health.

              3. As was said above, the first object of God’s will and the
              measure and rule of all its other objects is the end which His
              will has, His own goodness. All other things He wills only for
              this end. Thus, as long as our will is conformed to the divine
              will in regard to the end, all the objects of our will are
              regulated by the first object of will.

              less good to what is more good, there will be perversity of
              choice, but not if he should prefer it in tending appetitively;
              for a man is not obliged always to carry out in his action what is
              better unless it is something that he is bound to by a
              commandment. Otherwise everyone would be obliged to follow the
              counsels of perfection, which clearly are better.
