            <i>Protegebat castra gladio suo</i>, et cetera. I Mach. c. III, 3.
            Haec verba congruunt materiae huius epistolae ad Colossenses, quia
            totus status huius vitae est in pugnatione militantium, quorum
            habitacula castra dicuntur. Iob VII, v. 1:
            <i>militia est vita hominis super terram</i>. Ideo habitacula
            fidelium nomine castrorum figurantur. Unde Ecclesia similitudinem
            habet castrorum. Gen. XXXII, 2: <i>castra Dei sunt haec</i>. Haec
            castra tripliciter impugnantur. A quibusdam quasi obsidentibus, qui
            manifeste se erigunt contra Ecclesiam. Apoc. XX, 8:
            <i
              >ascenderunt super latitudinem terrae, et circuierunt castra
              sanctorum et civitatem dilectam</i
            >. Ab aliis latenter decipitur, sicut ab haereticis. Rom.:
            <i>per dulces sermones et benedictiones seducunt corda hominum</i>,
            et cetera. II Tim. III, 13:
            <i
              >mali autem homines et seductores proficient in peius, errantes et
              in errorem mittentes</i
            >. A quibusdam, scilicet domesticis, per diversas corruptelas
            peccatorum quae sunt ex corruptione carnis. Gal. V, 17:
            <i
              >caro concupiscit adversus spiritum, et spiritus adversus
              carnem</i
            >. Eph. ult.:
            <i
              >non est nobis colluctatio adversus carnem et sanguinem, sed
              adversus principes</i
            >, et cetera. Praelati Ecclesiae sunt duces, Ps. LXVII, 28:
            <i>principes Iuda duces eorum</i>, ad quorum officium pertinet
            contra omnia praedicta castra Ecclesiae munire. Contra peccata
            quidem, per exhortationes. Is. LVIII, 1:
            <i
              >annuntia populo meo scelera eorum, et domui Iacob peccata
              eorum</i
            >. Contra haereticos, per sanam doctrinam. I Tim. I:
            <i>amplectentem eum, qui secundum doctrinam est, fidelem sermonem</i
            >, et cetera. Contra persecutores, exemplo, scilicet patienter
            tolerando. Sic Paulus protexit gladio spirituali, quia in suis
            epistolis corripiebat peccata, confutabat haereses, animabat ad
            patientiam. De primo, Eph. V, 3:
            <i
              >fornicatio autem et omnis immunditia aut avaritia nec nominetur
              in vobis</i
            >, et cetera. De secundo, Tit. III, 10:
            <i>haereticum hominem post primam et secundam correptionem devita</i
            >, et cetera. De tertio, II Cor. XI per totum patet quomodo animabat
            ad patientiam.

            1. – This passage is appropriate to the subject matter of this
            letter to the Colossians, because this present life is a battle
            waged by soldiers who live in a camp: “The life of man on earth is a
            war” (Job 7:1). And so the place where the faithful live is called a
            camp. And the Church is like a camp: “This is the camp of God” (Gen
            32:2). This camp is attacked in three ways. First, by those
            aggressors who openly rise against the Church: “They marched up over
            the broad earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the
            beloved city” (Rev. 20:9). Secondly, this camp is deceitfully
            undermined by heretics: “By fair and flattering words they deceive
            the hearts of the simple-minded” (Rom 16:18); “Evil men and
            imposters; will go from bad to worse, deceivers and deceived” (2 Tim
            3:13). Thirdly, it is attacked by some of its own members who have
            become depraved from sins that spring from the corruption of the
            flesh: “The desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the
            desires of the Spirit are against the flesh” as we read in Galatians
            (5:17); “For we are not contending against flesh and blood, but
            against the principalities, against the powers, against the world
            rulers of this present darkness” (Eph 6:12). In this war the
            prelates of the Church are our leaders: according to the Psalm “The
            princes of Judah are their leaders” (Ps 68:27). It is their duty to
            protect the camp of the Church against all these attacks. First,
            against sins, by encouraging the people: “Declare to my people their
            transgression, to the house of Jacob their sins” (Is 58:1).
            Secondly, against heretics, by their sound teaching: “He must hold
            firm to the sure word as taught, so that he may be able to give
            instruction in sound doctrine and also to confute those who
            contradict it” (Tit 1:9). Thirdly, they should protect the Church
            against those who persecute it by giving an example of patient
            suffering. This is the way Paul protected the Church with his
            spiritual sword, because in his letters he combated sin, refuted
            heresies, and encouraged patience. As to the first: “But immorality
            and all impurity or covetousness must not even be named among you,
            as is fitting among saints” (Eph 5:3). As to the second: “As for a
            man that is factious, after admonishing him once or twice, have
            nothing more to do with him” (Tit 3:10). As to the third, the entire
            eleventh chapter of his second letter to the Corinthians shows how
            he encouraged them to be patient.

            Et sic tanguntur duo in verbis propositis, scilicet Ecclesiae
            status, cum dicitur <i>castra</i>, et apostoli studium, ibi
            <i>protexit</i>. In castris autem debet esse sollicitudo ad mala
            vitanda. Deut. XXIII, 14:
            <i>ut sint castra tua sancta, et nihil in eis appareat foeditatis</i
            >. Item ordo ad ducem et ad se. Cant. c. VII, 1:
            <i>quid videbis in Sunamite, nisi choros castrorum?</i> Gen. XXXII,
            2: <i>castra Dei sunt haec</i>. Item terror ad hostes. Cant. VI, v.
            3: <i>terribilis ut castrorum acies ordinata</i>. Sed apostolus
            circa protectionem erat sollicitus tamquam pastor, cuius est
            dirigere oves diligenter ne errent. Io. X, 4: <i>ante eas vadit</i>,
            et cetera. Et sic apostolus faciebat. Phil. III:
            <i>imitatores mei estote, sicut et ego Christi</i>. Item pascere
            abundanter, ne deficiant. I Petr. V, 2:
            <i>pascite, qui in vobis est, domini gregem</i>, et cetera. Et sic
            apostolus faciebat. I Cor. I, 2:
            <i>tamquam parvulis lac dedi vobis</i>. Item defendere potenter, ne
            pereant. Eccli. c. VII, 6:
            <i
              >noli velle fieri iudex, nisi valeas virtute irrumpere
              iniquitates</i
            >. I Reg. XVII, 34:
            <i
              >pascebat servus tuus patris sui gregem, et veniebat leo, vel
              ursus</i
            >, et cetera. Et ideo dicit, quod apostolus protegebat castra, id
            est Ecclesiam Dei, gladio, quod est verbum Dei, ut dicitur Eph. VI:
            <i
              >vivus est enim sermo Dei et efficax et penetrabilior omni gladio
              ancipiti</i
            >, et cetera. Sic ergo materia huius epistolae est haec. Quia in
            epistola ad Ephesios ostendit modum ecclesiasticae unitatis; in
            epistola ad Philippenses ostendit eius profectum et conservationem;
            in hac autem agit de eius conservatione contra haereticos, qui
            depravaverant eos seducendo, et cetera.

            2. – The passage quoted at the beginning mentions two of these
            matters: the condition of the Church, when it says, camp, and the
            zeal of the Apostle, when it says, protected. Now a camp has to be
            alert in order to avoid evil: “Your camp must be holy” (Dt. 23:14);
            and it should have a good relationship with its leader and in
            itself: “This is the camp of God” (Gen. 32:21). It should also be a
            threat to the enemy: “Terrible as an army with banners” (Sg. 6:10).
            Now the Apostle was alert in protecting them, like a shepherd, whose
            duty is to carefully lead his sheep so they are not lost. “He goes
            before them, and the sheep follow him” (Jn. 10:4). The Apostle did
            act this way: “Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ” (1 Cor. 4:16).
            A shepherd should also feed his flock generously, so they do not
            become ill: “Tend the flock of God that is your charge” (1 Pet.
            5:2). And the Apostle did this also: “I fed you with milk” (1 Cor.
            3:2). A shepherd should also bravely defend his flock, so they will
            not be destroyed: “Do not seek to become a judge, lest you be unable
            to remove iniquity” (Sir. 7:6); “Your servant used to keep sheep for
            his father; and when there came a lion or a bear, and took a lamb
            from the flock, I went after him and delivered it out of his mouth”
            (1 Sam. 17:34). And so our beginning text says that the Apostle
            protected the camp, that is, God’s Church, with a sword, which is
            the word of God: “The word of God is living and active, sharper then
            any two-edged sword” (Heb. 4:12). Here, then, is the subject matter
            of this letter. In his letter to the Ephesians, the Apostle
            described the nature of the Church’s unity; and in the letter to the
            Philippians, he showed its growth and preservation. But in this
            letter he is dealing with its protection from those heretics who
            were corrupting and misleading the Colossians.

            Principalis primo tangitur ex nomine <i>Paulus</i>, id est humilis.
            Tales enim percipiunt sapientiam. Matth. XI, 25:

              parvulis</i

            id est missus, scilicet ad procurandum salutem fidelium. Act. XIII,
            2:
            <i>segregate mihi Saulum et Barnabam in opus ad quod assumpsi eos</i
            >. Io. XX, 21: <i>sicut misit me pater, et ego mitto vos</i>. Et
            <i>apostolus</i>, non cuiuslibet, sed <i>Iesu Christi</i>, cuius
            gloriam quaerit, non sui ipsius. II Cor. IV, 5:
            <i
              >non enim nosmetipsos praedicamus, sed Iesum Christum dominum
              nostrum, nos autem servos vestros per Iesum</i
            >. Sed quidam aliquando perveniunt ad officium ex ira Dei propter
            peccatum populi. Iob XXXIV, 30:
            <i>qui regnare facit hominem hypocritam propter peccata populi</i>.
            Os. XIII, v. 11: <i>dabo tibi regem in furore meo</i>. Et ideo dicit

          </td>

            4. – The principal sender of this letter is first identified by his
            name, Paul, that is, one who is humble, for it is such persons who
            receive wisdom: “Thou hast hidden these things from the wise and
            understanding and revealed them to babes” (Mt 11:25), and so Paul
            can teach this wisdom. Secondly, the sender is described by his
            office, namely, an apostle, that is, one who is sent, to bring
            salvation to the faithful: “Set apart for me Saul and Barnabas for
            the work to which I have called them” (Acts 13:2); “As the Father
            has sent me, even so I send you” (Jn 20:21). He is not the apostle
            of just anyone, but of Christ Jesus, whose glory he seeks, and not
            his own: “For what we preach is not ourselves, but Jesus Christ as
            Lord, with ourselves as your servants for Jesus’ sake” (2 Cor. 4:5).
            But at times some reach their office because God is angry because of
            a people’s sins: “Who makes a man who is a hypocrite to reign for

            after my own heart, who will feed you with knowledge and

            Bonum nostrum principaliter est in fide, spe et charitate: per fidem
            enim habemus notitiam Dei, per spem elevamur in ipsum, sed charitate
            unimur ei. I Cor. XIII, v. 13:
            <i>nunc autem manent fides, spes, charitas, tria haec</i>, et
            cetera. Et ideo de istis tribus gratias agit, primo quod fidem
            habent. Non enim ipse praedicaverat eis, sed quidam discipulus
            Epaphras nomine, et postea Archippus. Et ideo dicit
            <i>audientes fidem</i>, quae est principium spiritualis vitae. Hab.

            <i>accedentem ad Deum oportet credere</i>, et cetera. Sed haec fides
            sine dilectione operante est mortua, ut dicitur Iac. II, 17. Et ideo
            oportet, quod adsit dilectio operans. Gal. ult.:
            <i
              >in Christo Iesu neque circumcisio aliquid valet, neque
              praeputium, sed nova creatura</i
            >. Et ideo dixit <i>et dilectionem quam habetis</i>, et cetera. Est
            autem quaedam dilectio charitatis et quaedam mundana, sed mundana
            non se extendit ad omnes, quia dilectio talis ad illos est cum
            quibus est communio, quae est causa dilectionis, et haec causa in
            dilectione mundana non se habet ad omnes, sed tantum est cum
            consanguineis et mundanis, sed dilectio charitatis se extendit ad
            omnes. Et ideo dicit <i>in omnes</i>. Nam et si peccatores
            diligantur per charitatem, hoc est ut sint aliquando sancti. I Io.

              diligimus fratres</i
            >. Item dilectio mundi habet fructum in hoc mundo, sed charitas
            habet in vita aeterna. Et ideo tertio subdit de spe, dicens
            <i>propter spem quae reposita est</i>, id est propter gloriam
            aeternam, quae ideo dicitur spes, quia pro certo custoditur. Iob

            11. – Our blessings or goods consist especially in faith, hope, and
            the love of charity: for by faith we have a knowledge of God; by
            hope we are raised up to him; but by the love of charity we are
            united to him. As we read: “So faith, hope, love, abide, these
            three; but the greatest of these is love” (1 Cor. 13:13). So he
            gives thanks for these three. First, that they have the faith;
            although he was not the one who preached to them, but rather a
            disciple by the name of Epaphras, and later Archippus. Thus he says,
            we have heard of your faith, which is the beginning of the spiritual
            life: “The righteous shall live by his faith” (Hab 2:4); “For
            whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that
            he rewards those who seek him” (Heb 11:6). But this faith is dead
            without an active love, as James says (2:26), and so an active love
            must also be present: “For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision
            counts for anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation” (Gal
            6:15). And so he continues, and of the love which you have for all
            the saints. There is a love which springs from charity, and another
            which is worldly. This worldly love does not include everyone,
            because we love those with whom there is some communication or
            sharing, which is the cause of love; but in worldly love this cause
            is not present in everyone, but is only found in one’s relatives or
            other worldly people. But the love of charity does extend to
            everyone; and so he says, for all. For even though sinners are loved
            by the love of charity, it is in order that at some time they become
            holy: “We know that we have passed out of death into life, because
            we love the brethren” (1 Jn 3:14). Further, the fruit of worldly
            love is obtained in this world; but the fruit of the love of charity
            is in eternal life. This leads him to mention hope: because of the
            hope laid up for you in heaven, that is, because of your eternal
            glory, which is called hope because it is considered as certain:
            “This hope has been put in my heart,” as we read in Job (19:27)
            [Vulgate].

            universo mundo? Respondeo. Aliqui dicunt quod Evangelium Christi non
            est Evangelium regni. Sed hoc est falsum, quia dominus dicit hoc
            Evangelium regni. Sed dicendum est, secundum Chrysostomum, quod
            adhuc viventibus apostolis, Evangelium Christi est divulgatum per
            totum mundum, saltem quantum ad famam, quod est valde miraculosum,
            quod in quadraginta annis sic creverit doctrina Christi. Et sic
            dicit <i>in universo mundo</i>, quantum ad famam,
            <i>et tunc erit consummatio</i>, id est destructio Ierusalem.
            Secundum Augustinum autem hoc non est verum, quia adhuc tempore suo
            erant aliquae gentes, in quibus nondum erat Ecclesia. Et ideo ipse
            dicit hoc esse intelligendum quando praedicabitur, ita quod quando
            in omnibus gentibus Ecclesia erit fundata, licet aliqui sint
            credentes, aliqui non, tunc erit finis; et hoc non tempore apostoli,
            sed circa finem mundi: et sic quando hic dicitur
            <i>in universo mundo</i>, loquitur apostolus de futuro sicut de
            praesenti propter certitudinem eventus. Ps. XVIII, 4:
            <i>in omnem terram exivit sonus eorum</i>, et cetera. Potest tamen

            14. – Then when he says, which has come to you, Christ’s doctrine is
            commended for its growth, because it has come not only to you, but
            is indeed in the whole world: “Their voice goes out through all the
            earth, and their words to the end of the world” (Ps 19:4); “This
            Gospel of the kingdom will be preached throughout the whole world...
            and then the end will come” (Mt 24:14). But since the Gospel has
            been preached in the whole world, why has the end not come? I answer
            that some say that the Gospel of Christ is not the Gospel of the
            kingdom. But this is false, because our Lord calls it the Gospel of
            the kingdom. And so, according to Chrysostom, we should say that
            while the apostles were still alive, the Gospel of Christ was
            throughout the whole world, at least by some kind of report. And it
            is quite miraculous that Christ’s doctrine should have grown so much
            in forty years. And so the Apostle says, in the whole world, that
            is, by report; and “then the end will come,” that is, the
            destruction of Jerusalem. But Augustine does not agree with this
            interpretation, because even in his own time there were some
            countries in which there were yet no churches. So he says the time
            referred to is the time when the Gospel will be really preached.
            Thus the end will come after the Church has become established in
            all countries, even though some people are not believers. And this
            end is not at the time of the Apostle, but concerns the end of the
            world. And so when Paul says here, in the whole world, he is
            speaking of the future; but he is using the present tense because
            the outcome is so certain. Yet we can say that the Gospel is in the
            whole world by report, although it is not actually established in
            all places.

            says, from the day we heard of it we began to pray: “Since I spoke
            of him, I will still remember him” (Jer 31:20). Secondly, it is
            continuous: we have not ceased to pray for you: “Far be it from me
            that I should sin against the Lord by ceasing to pray for you” (1
            Sam 12:23); “Without ceasing I mention you always in my prayers”
            (Rom. 1:9). Thirdly, prayer has several elements and is complete: to
            pray for... asking. Praying is lifting our minds up to God; and
            asking is requesting things. Praying should come first, so that the
            one devoutly requesting is heard, just as those who are requesting
            something begin by trying to persuade their listener and bend him to
            their wishes. But we should begin with devotion and meditation on
            God and divine things, not in order to bend him, but to lift
            ourselves up to him.

            20. – He requests three kinds of knowledge for them. First, a
            knowledge of what they are to do; and so he says, that you may be
            filled with the knowledge of his will, that is, that you may fully
            know the will of God: “This is the will of God, your
            sanctification,” as we read in 1 Thessalonians (4:3). Thus, one who
            lives in a holy way knows God’s will; but one who sins does not know
            the will of God, because every sinner is ignorant: “That you may
            prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God” (Rom
            12:2). Secondly, he wants them to have a knowledge of divine things,
            in all wisdom, which consists in the knowledge of divine things, as
            Augustine says: “Think of the Lord with uprightness” (Wis 1:1).
            Thirdly, he wants them to have an understanding of spiritual things,
            i.e., not of these earthly material things: “Now we have received
            not the spirit of this world, but the Spirit which is from God,” as
            1 Corinthians (2:12) says. He appropriately associates wisdom and
            understanding, because wisdom is weak when there is no
            understanding, as Gregory says, and understanding is useless without
            wisdom: for wisdom judges and understanding apprehends, and one
            cannot apprehend without judging, and vice versa. The Gloss says
            that the first kind of knowledge is taken in general, the second
            pertains to the active life, and the third to the contemplative
            life.

            21. – Further, knowledge by itself is not enough, because “Whoever
            knows what is right to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin”
            (Jas. 4:17). And therefore, it is necessary to act according to
            virtue. He touches on this when he says, to lead a life worthy of
            the Lord, for one lives unworthily if he does not live as is fitting
            for a son of God to live: “As servants of God we commend ourselves
            in every way: through great endurance, in afflictions, hardships...”
            (2 Cor. 6:4); “As we solemnly forewarned you” (1 Th 4:6). Secondly,
            he touches on a correct intention: fully pleasing: “There was one
            who pleased God and was loved by him” (Wis 4:10). Thirdly, he brings
            in the desire to make progress: bearing fruit in every good work,
            for one should always try for a further good: “My blossoms became
            glorious and abundant fruit” (Sir 24:17); “The return you get is
            sanctification and its end eternal life” (Rom 6:22). And after one
            has borne fruit, an increase in knowledge follows, and increasing in
            the knowledge of God; for as a result of eagerly accomplishing the
            commands of God, a person is disposed for knowledge: “I understand
            more than the aged, because I keep your precepts” (Ps 119:100);
            “Wisdom will not dwell in a body enslaved to sin” (Wis 1:4). He
            says, increasing in the knowledge of God, and not of the world: “She
            gave him a knowledge of holy things” (Wis 10:10).

            virtuous life it is not enough just to know and to will; one must
            also act in spite of opposition: and this cannot be done without a
            patient endurance of evils. And so he says, may you be strengthened
            with all power: “Rich in power” (Sir 44:6). Such power, or virtue,
            comes from God; and so he says, according to his glorious might: “Be
            strong in the Lord” (Eph 6:10). He says, glorious might, that is,
            Christ’s, who is the glory of the Father, because to fall into sin
            is to fall into darkness: “She is a breath of the power of God, and
            a pure emanation of the glory of the Almighty” (Wis 7:25). Then when
            he says, for all patience and longsuffering, he prays that they may
            stand up under adversity. Some people fail because of the
            difficulties of their adversities; and they need patience: “By your
            patience you will gain your lives” (Lk 21:19). Other people fail
            because their reward is a long time coming; and so he says,
            longsuffering, which enables a person to wait for what was promised:
            “It it does not come soon, wait for it; because it will come and not
            delay” (Hab 2:3); “And thus, with his longsuffering, he obtained
            what was promised” (Heb 6:15). Yet, although some people do avoid
            these two vices, they do it with sadness; and since this should not
            be so he says, with joy: “Count it all joy, my brethren, when you
            meet various trials” (Jas. 1:2).

            grace to those who are unworthy. But this view is rejected by the
            Apostle, because whatever worth and grace we have was given to us by
            God, and so also were the effects of grace. And so Paul says, who

            of apportioning things: sometimes it is done by choosing, as when a
            person selects this portion, and another one that portion; and
            sometimes apportionment is by lot: “The lot puts and end to
            disputes” (Pr 18:18). The saints have their portion not because they
            chose it: “You did not choose me, but I chose you” (Jn 15:16), but
            because God chose them. (A lot consists in entrusting something to
            God’s judgment. And there are three types of lot: consultative,
            divining, and apportioning. The first is not evil when dealing in
            temporal matters; the second is useless and evil, and the third is
            sometimes allowed in cases of necessity.) The portion of the saints
            is the possession of the light: “He dwells in unapproachable light”
            (1 Tim 6.16); “In his hands he hides the light and commands it to
            come again” (Job 36:32), and from it there follows the effect of
            grace, i.e., our transference from darkness to light.

            which men are the slaves of sin before they receive grace. For since
            sin is a darkness, men [before receiving grace] are in the power of
            darkness, i.e., either of the evil spirits or of sins: “Against the
            world rulers of this present darkness” (Eph 6:12), “Even the

            might be the kingdom of God: “My kingdom is not of this world” (Jn
            18:36). This happens when we are freed from our sins: “You have made
            them a kingdom and priests to our God” (Rev 5:10). Or literally, we
            are transferred to this kingdom so that we may obtain eternal life:
            “The kingdom of heaven is at hand” (Mt 3:2). And this is what he

            Vel ad litteram, ut consequeremur vitam aeternam. Matth. III, 2:
            <i>appropinquabit regnum caelorum</i>. Et hoc est quod dicit
            <i>regnum filii dilectionis suae</i>. Dilectio, ut dicit Augustinus

            et filii. Sed si dilectio sic semper teneretur personaliter, tunc
            filius esset filius spiritus sancti; sed quandoque dicitur
            essentialiter, ut dicitur in Glossa. <i>Filii</i> ergo
            <i>dilectionis suae</i>
            dicitur, id est filii sui dilecti, vel filii essentiae suae. Sed
            numquid haec est vera: filius est filius essentiae patris? Dicendum
            est quod si genitivus designat habitudinem causae efficientis, est
            falsum, quia essentia non generat, nec generatur. Si autem designat
            formam, id est habens essentiam suam quasi materialiter, sicut
            dicitur aliquid egregiae formae, id est habens egregiam formam, sic
            est vera. Io. III, 35:

            27. – A more literal translation of this phrase would read: the
            kingdom of the Son of his love. As Augustine says in a Gloss, “love”
            is sometimes taken to mean the Holy Spirit, who is the love of the
            Father and the Son. But if “love” were always to mean this Person,
            then the Son would be the Son of the Holy Spirit. So at other times
            “love” is understood essentially, to indicate the divine essence.
            Thus the phrase, of the Son of his love, can be taken to mean either
            “of his beloved Son,” or it could mean, “of the Son of his [the
            Father’s] essence.” But is it true to say that the Son is the Son of
            the essence of the Father? I answer that if the possessive case, “of
            the essence” is taken to indicate the relationship of an efficient
            cause, it is false; because the essence [of the Father] does not
            generate nor is it generated. Sometimes the possessive case
            indicates the possession of a form, as when we say a thing is “of an
            excellent form,” that is, it has an excellent form. And if we
            understand “of the essence” in this way, then the statement is true,
            that is, the Son has the essence of the Father: “The Father loves
            the Son, and has given all things into his hand” (Jn 3:35).

            way we have been transferred. For humanity in sin was held down in
            two ways: first, as a slave: “Every one who commits sin is a slave
            to sin” (Jn. 8:34), and secondly, as deserving punishment and as
            turned away from God: “Your iniquities have made a separation
            between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you
            so that he does not hear” (Is 59:2). But these two things are taken
            away by Christ, because, as man, he became a sacrifice for us and
            redeemed us in his blood; and so Paul says, in whom we have
            redemption: “You were bought with a price” (1 Cor. 6:20); and from
            Christ, as God, we have the forgiveness of sins, because he took
            away our debt of punishment.

            30. – As to the first, we should note that God is said to be
            invisible because he exceeds the capacity of vision of any created
            intellect, so that no created intellect, by its natural knowledge,
            can attain His essence: “Behold, God is great, and we know him not”
            (Job 36:26); “He dwells in unapproachable light” (1 Tim. 6:16). And
            therefore, he is seen by the blessed by means of grace, and not by
            reason of their natural capacity. Dionysius gives the reason for
            this: all knowledge terminates at something which exists, that is,
            at some nature that participates in the act of existence [esse]; but
            God is the very act of existence [ipsum esse], not participating in
            the act of existence, but participated in; and thus he is not known.
            It is of this invisible God that the Son is the image.

            Sed videndum est quomodo dicatur imago Dei, et quare dicatur
            invisibilis. Et quidem de ratione imaginis sunt tria, scilicet quod
            sit ibi similitudo, quod deducta sit vel expressa ex eo cum quo est
            similitudo, et quod deducta sit in aliquo pertinente ad speciem vel
            signum speciei. Si enim sunt duo similia, quorum unum non derivetur
            ab alio, neutrum dicimus alterius imaginem, sicut ovum non dicitur
            imago ovi. Et ideo ab imitando dicitur imago. Item si sit simile,
            sed non quantum ad speciem, vel signum speciei, tunc nec imago
            dicitur: sicut in homine multa sunt accidentia, ut color, quantitas,
            et huiusmodi, et secundum nullum horum dicitur imago. Sed si figuram
            eius accipiat, sic potest esse imago, quia figura est signum
            speciei; filius autem est similis patri, et pater similis filio, sed
            filius habet hoc a patre, pater autem non a filio. Et ideo proprie
            loquendo dicimus filium imaginem patris, et non e converso, quia
            deducitur et derivatur haec similitudo a patre. Item haec similitudo
            est secundum speciem, quia filius in divinis repraesentatur aliquo
            modo, sed deficienter, per verbum mentis nostrae. Verbum autem
            mentis nostrae est, quando formamus actu formam rei cuius notitiam

            conceptum est quaedam rei similitudo quam in mente tenemus, et

            31. – Let us now see in what way the Son is called the image of God,
            and why he is said to be invisible. The notion of an image includes
            three things. First, an image must be a likeness; secondly, it must
            be derived or drawn from the thing of which it is a likeness; and
            thirdly, it must be derived with respect to something that pertains
            to the species or to a sign of the species. For if two things are
            alike, but neither is derived from the other, then neither one is
            the image of the other; thus one egg is not said to be the image of
            another. And so something is called an image because it imitates.
            Further, if there is a likeness between two things, but not
            according to species or a sign of the species, we do not speak of an
            image. Thus, a man has many accidents, such as color, size and so
            on; but they are not the reason for calling something an image of a
            man. But if something has the shape or figure of a man, then it can
            be called an image, because this shape is a sign of the species. Now
            the Son is like the Father, and the Father is like the Son. But
            because the Son has this likeness from the Father, and not the
            Father from the Son, we, properly speaking, say that the Son is the
            image of the Father, and not conversely: for this likeness is drawn
            and derived from the Father. Further, this likeness is according to
            species, because in divine matters the Son is somehow, although
            faintly, represented by our mental word. We have a mental word when
            we actually conceive the form of the thing of which we have
            knowledge; and then we signify this mental word by an external word.
            And this mental word we have conceived is a certain likeness, in our
            mind, of the thing, and it is like it in species. And so the Word of
            God is called the image of God.

            32. – As to our second question, we should note that the Arians
            misunderstood the text: for they thought about the image of God as
            they did of the images they made of their ancestors, so they could
            see in these images the loved ones no longer with them (just as we
            make images of the saints to see in these images those whom we
            cannot see in reality). And so they said that to be invisible was
            unique to the Father, and that the first visible reality was the
            Son, who manifested the goodness of the Father. They were saying
            that the Father was truly invisible, but the Son was visible, and
            thus their natures would be different. But the Apostle refutes this
            when he says: “He reflects the glory of God and bears the very stamp
            of his nature, upholding the universe by his word of power. When he
            had made purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the
            Majesty on high” (Heb 1:3). And thus the Son is not only the image
            of the invisible God, but he himself is invisible like the Father:
            He is the image of the invisible God.

            34. – We should note, about the first point, that the Arians
            understood this to mean that Christ is called the first-born because
            he is the first creature. But this is not the meaning, as will be
            clear. So we have to understand two things: how this image is
            generated, and in what way it is the first-born of creatures.. In
            regard to the first, we should note that things generate in various
            ways depending on their nature and manner of existence, for men
            generate in one way, and plants in another, and so on for other
            things. But the nature of God is his existence [ipsum esse] and his
            act of understanding [intelligere] and so it is necessary that his
            generating or intellectual conceiving is the generating or
            conceiving of his nature. (In us, however, our intellectual
            conceiving is not the conceiving of our nature, because our nature
            is not the same as our act of understanding). Therefore, since this
            image is a word and concept of an intellect, it is necessary to say
            that it is the offspring of the nature, so that the one receiving
            the nature from the other is generated by necessity.

            prima causa effectiva. Filius autem est conceptio intellectualis Dei

            35. – Secondly, we have to understand in what way the Son is called
            the first-born. God does not know himself and creatures through two
            different sources; he knows all things in his own essence, as in the
            first efficient cause. The Son, however, is the intellectual concept
            or representation of God insofar as he knows himself, and as a
            consequence, every creature. Therefore, inasmuch as the Son is
            begotten, he is seen as a word representing every creature, and he
            is the principle of every creature. For if he were not begotten in
            that way, the Word of the Father would be the first-born of the
            Father only, and not of creatures: “I came forth from the mouth of
            the Most High, the first-born before every creature” (Sir 24:5)

            respect to this, we should note that the Platonists affirmed the
            existence of Ideas, and said that each thing came to be by
            participating in an Idea, like the Idea of man, or an Idea of some
            other kind. Instead of all these we have one, that is, the Son, the
            Word of God. For an artisan makes an artifact by making it
            participate in the form he has conceived within himself, enveloping
            it, so to say, with external matter; for we say that the artisan
            makes a house through the form of the thing which he has conceived
            within himself. This is the way God is said to make all things in
            his wisdom, because the wisdom of God is related to his created
            works just as the art of the builder is to the house he has made.
            Now this form and wisdom is the Word; and thus in him all things
            were created, as in an exemplar: “He spoke and they were made” (Gen

            first principle. And they said there was an order of principles
            according to the orders of these perfections. Thus they affirmed a

            diversae sunt sententiae Gregorii et Dionysii. Dionysius enim
            ordinat eos secundum quod dicitur ad Ephesios, quia in secunda
            hierarchia ponit dominationes, virtutes, et potestates. Gregorius
            vero ordinat eos sicut hic habetur, quia in secunda hierarchia ponit
            dominationes, principatus et potestates, in tertia vero virtutes,
            Archangelos et Angelos. Sed sciendum est, quod, sicut Gregorius et
            Dionysius dicunt, haec dona spiritualia, ex quibus nominantur hi
            ordines, communia sunt omnibus, tamen quidam nominantur a quibusdam,
            quidam ab aliis, cuius ratio accipitur ex dictis Platonicorum, quia
            omne quod convenit alicui, convenit tripliciter, quia aut
            essentialiter, aut participative, aut causaliter. Essentialiter
            quidem quod convenit rei secundum proportionem suae naturae, sicut
            homini rationale. Participative autem quod excedit suam naturam, sed
            tamen aliquid de illo participat, sed imperfecte, sicut
            intellectuale homini, quod est supra rationale et est essentiale
            Angelorum et idem aliquid participat homo. Causaliter vero quod
            convenit rei supervenienter, sicut homini artificialia, quia in eo
            non sunt sicut in materia, sed per modum artis. Unumquodque autem
            denominatur solum ab eo quod convenit ei essentialiter. Unde homo
            non dicitur intellectualis nec artificialis, sed rationalis. De
            dictis autem donis in Angelis, ea quae conveniunt superioribus
            essentialiter, inferioribus conveniunt participative; quae vero
            inferioribus essentialiter conveniunt, superioribus causaliter
            conveniunt. Et ideo superiores denominantur a superioribus donis.
            Supremum autem in creatura spirituali est quod attingit Deum, et
            quodammodo participat eum. Et ideo denominantur superiores ex hoc,
            quod attingunt Deum. Seraphim, quasi ardentes Deo vel incendentes;
            Cherubim, quasi scientes Deum; throni, quasi habentes in seipsis
            sedentem Deum.

            41. – Why does Paul say in his letter to the Ephesians (1:22) “He
            has made him the head over all the Church”? For he does not seem to
            be saying the same thing there as here. I reply that here Paul is
            giving a descending list of such beings, because he is showing the
            procession of creatures from God; but in Ephesians he gives an
            ascending list, because he is showing that the Son of God, as man,
            is above all creatures. In Ephesians, the principalities are placed
            under the authorities (or powers), and the virtues are between the
            dominions and authorities; but here in our text, the principalities
            are placed above the authorities, and between the dominions and the
            authorities. This is the way the teaching of Gregory differs from
            that of Dionysius. For Dionysius arranges the spiritual beings as
            they are in Ephesians, because he puts the dominions, the virtues
            and authorities in the second hierarchy. But Gregory arranges them
            as Paul does here, because he puts the dominions, principalities and
            authorities in the second hierarchy; and the virtues, archangels and
            the angels in the third hierarchy. We should note, as Gregory and
            Dionysius say, that the spiritual gifts from which these different
            orders receive their names are common to all of them; yet some
            orders receive their name from certain of these gifts, and others
            receive their name from different gifts. The reason for this can be
            seen from the teachings of the Platonists: whatever belongs to
            something belongs to it in one of three ways: essentially, or by
            participation, or causally. A thing belongs essentially to another
            if it belongs to it according to a certain proportion to its nature;
            this is the way to be rational belongs to man. A thing belongs by
            participation to another if it surpasses the nature of the thing
            which has it, although the thing participates to a certain extent in
            it, although imperfectly; thus man is intellectual by participation,
            while to be intellectual, which is superior to being rational, is in
            the angels essentially. One thing belongs to another causally if it
            accrues to it, as artifacts belong to a person; for they do not
            exist in him as in matter, but exist in his artistic power. Now a
            thing is named only from what belongs to it essentially; thus we do
            not define man as an intellectual or artistic being, but as
            rational. In regard to the gifts present in the angels, those which
            belong to the higher angels essentially, belong to the lower ones by
            participation; and those which belong to the lower ones essentially,
            are present in the higher angels causally. Consequently, the higher
            angels receive their names from the higher gifts. But the highest
            thing in a spiritual creature is that it attain to God and somehow
            participate in him; and therefore the higher angels receive their
            name because they attain God: seraphim, as being fervent or on fire
            with God; the cherubim, as knowing God; and the thrones, as having
            God seated in them.

            42. – For one thing can participate in another in three ways: first,
            it can receive what is proper to the nature of what it is
            participating in; secondly, it can receive a thing insofar as it
            knows it; and thirdly, it can somehow serve the power of a thing.
            For example, a doctor participates in the art of medicine either
            because he possesses in himself the art of medicine, or because he
            has received a knowledge of the art, or because he serves or devotes
            himself to the medical art. The first way of participating is
            greater than the second, and the second way is greater than the
            third. In Sacred Scripture, what is divine is signified by fire:
            “The Lord your God is a devouring fire” (Deut 4:24). And so the
            highest order of angels is called the seraphim, as though on fire
            with God and having a divine property. The second order is the
            cherubim, who attain God by knowledge. And the third are the
            thrones, who serve or are devoted to his power. The other orders are
            not given their names because they attain God, but because of some
            activity of God. Some angels direct or command, and these are the
            dominions. Others accomplish and carry out [what is commanded], the
            principal angels who do this are the principalities: “Princes went
            before, joined with singers” (Ps 68:27). Among the others who carry
            out commands, some act over spiritual creatures, such as the
            authorities (powers), who restrain the evil spirits. If some act
            over natural things, they are called virtues, and these perform
            miracles. If they act over human beings, they are called archangels
            if they are concerned with great matters, and angels if concerned
            with lesser things. And so Paul concludes, all things were created
            through him [per ipsum], as by an efficient cause, and in him [in
            Thomas’ text], as in an exemplary cause: “All things were made
            through him, and without him was not anything made that was made”
            (Jn 1:3).

            is the one in whom we have our redemption. But because he has been
            made the head of the Church, two things have to be explained: first,
            in what way the Church is a body; and secondly, how Christ is its
            head. The Church is called a body because of its likeness to a
            single human being. This likeness is twofold: first, in that it has
            distinct members: “And his gifts were that some should be apostles,
            some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers” (Eph
            4:11); secondly, because the members of the Church serve each other
            in ways that are different: “The members may have the same care for
            one another” (1 Cor. 12:25); “Bear one another’s burdens, and so
            fulfill the law of Christ” (Gal 6:2). Again, just as a body is one
            because its soul is one, so the Church is one because the Spirit is
            one: “There is one body and one Spirit” (Eph 4:4); “Because there is
            one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the
            one bread” (1 Cor. 10:17). Next we have to consider the relationship
            of the members to the head of the Church, i.e., to Christ. For
            Christ is the head of the Church. “But you, O Lord, are the lifter
            of my head” (Ps 3:3).

            in dignity, because it is a source and a ruler. Secondly, it has the
            fulness of the senses, which are all in the head. Thirdly, it is the
            source of an inflow of sense and movement to the members of the
            body. So first, Paul shows how Christ is head because of his

            48. – The Church exists in two states: the state of grace in the
            present time, and the state of glory in the future. But it is the
            same Church, and Christ is its head in both states, because he is
            the first in grace and the first in glory. With respect to the first
            he says, he is the beginning, the first-born from the dead, because
            he is not only first in grace insofar as he is a man, but all men
            are justified by faith in Christ: “By one man’s obedience many will
            be made righteous” (Rom 5:19). So he says, he is the beginning
            [principium], that is, the beginning or source of justification and
            grace in the entire Church; because even in the Old Testament some
            were justified by faith in Christ: “I am the beginning who am
            speaking to you” (Jn 8:25); “With you is the beginning” (Ps 110:3)
            [Vulgate]. Christ is also the beginning of the state of glory; and
            so he says, the first-born from the dead. The reason for this is
            that the resurrection from the dead is a kind of second birth,
            because it restores us to eternal life: “In the rebirth, when the
            Son of Man sits on his glorious throne” (Mt 19:28); but Christ is
            the first of all; and thus he is the first-born from the dead, that
            is, the first-born of those who are born by the resurrection.

            mortal life; but “Christ, having risen from the dead, will never die
            again” (Rom 6:9); “Jesus Christ, the first-born of the dead, and the

            the fulness of all graces. For some saints had particular graces,
            but Christ had all graces; and so he says, that in him all the
            fulness was pleased to dwell [it seems that Thomas’ version lacked
            the words “of God”]. Each word has its own force. Pleased indicates
            that the gifts Christ had as man were not the result of fate or
            merits, as Photinus says, but were due to the good pleasure of the
            divine will taking this man into a unity of person: “This is my
            beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased” (Mt 3:17). He says, all,
            because some have one gift and others different ones; but [with
            Christ] “The Father had given all things into his hands” (Jn 13:3).
            He says, fulness, because one can have a gift without having the
            fulness of it or of its power, because perhaps one lacks something
            unwillingly. But John says that Christ was “full of grace and truth”
            (Jn 1:14), “My abode is in the fulness of the saints” (Sir 24:16).
            He says to dwell, because some received the use of a grace for only
            a time; thus the spirit of prophecy was not always possessed by the
            prophets, but it is continuously present in Christ, because he
            always has control over this fulness to use it as he wishes: “He on
            whom you see the Spirit descend and remain, this is he who baptizes
            with the Holy Spirit” as we read in John (1:33).

            Christus homo est; Dei, quia Deus est. Item discordia erat inter
            Iudaeos qui volebant legem, et gentiles qui non volebant legem; sed
            utrosque Christus concordat, quia ex Iudaeis est, et quia absolvit

            things are reconciled. Now there are two things to be considered in
            a reconciliation. First, the matters in which the reconciled persons
            agree. For people at odds have conflicting wills, but when they have
            been reconciled they agree in some things; and so wills that were
            before in conflict are made to harmonize in Christ. For example, the
            wills of men, of God and of the angels. The will of men, because
            Christ is a man; and the will of God, because Christ is God. There
            was also conflict between the Jews, who wanted the law, and the
            Gentiles, who did not want the law. But Christ created harmony
            between the two, because he was from the Jews, and he freed us from
            the legal observances. This harmony was accomplished by the blood of
            his cross. The cause of discord between God and men was sin; the
            discord between the Jews and the Gentiles was caused by the law. Now
            Christ destroyed sin by his cross and fulfilled the law; and thus he
            took away the causes of discord: “You have come to Mount Zion and to
            the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem” (Heb 12:22).
            Thus we are reconciled and all things are set at peace, whether on
            earth, that is, Jews and Gentiles, or in heaven, that is, the angels
            and God. And so when Christ was born the angels sang: “Glory to God
            in the highest, and on earth peace among men” (Lk 2:14). Again,
            Christ said at his resurrection: “Peace be with you” (Jn 20:19);
            “For he is our peace, who has made us both one” (Eph 2:14).

            flesh are not the same, but to show that Christ took a real body:
            “And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us” (Jn 1:14). A body of

            likeness of sinful flesh and of sin, has condemned sin in the flesh”

            And so Paul continues, provided that you continue in the faith,
            stable. For faith is a foundation; if it is firm the entire
            structure of the Church is firm. And steadfast in hope, not
            weakening themselves from within; not shifting by allowing others to
            shake that hope. This hope, I say, is the hope of the gospel, that
            is, the hope that the Gospel gives for the good things of the
            kingdom of heaven: “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand”
            (Mt 4:17). And there is no excuse, because the Gospel has been
            preached; and he uses the past tense here instead of the future
            tense because this future event is so certain. The Gospel has been
            preached, by the apostles that is, to every creature under heaven,
            that is, to every new creature, that is, to the faithful, for whom
            it had been prepared.

            mystica, cuius caput est Christus, corpus omnes iusti: quilibet
            autem iustus est quasi membrum huius capitis, I Cor. XII, 27:

            tam in capite quam in membris, sicut et praedestinavit numerum
            electorum. Et inter haec merita praecipue sunt passiones sanctorum.

            61. – And along with the above there is the fruit that in my flesh I
            complete what is lacking in Christ’s afflictions. At first glance
            these words can be misunderstood to mean that the passion of Christ
            was not sufficient for our redemption, and that the sufferings of
            the saints were added to complete it. But this is heretical, because
            the blood of Christ is sufficient to redeem many worlds: “He is the
            expiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins
            of the whole world” (1 Jn 2:2). Rather, we should understand that
            Christ and the Church are one mystical person, whose head is Christ,
            and whose body is all the just, for every just person is a member of
            this head: “individually members” (1 Cor. 12:27). Now God in his
            predestination has arranged how much merit will exist throughout the
            entire Church, both in the head and in the members, just as he has
            predestined the number of the elect. And among these merits, the
            sufferings of the holy martyrs occupy a prominent place. For while
            the merits of Christ, the head, are infinite, each saint displays
            some merits in a limited degree. This is why he says, I complete
            what is lacking in Christ’s afflictions, that is, what is lacking in
            the afflictions of the whole Church, of which Christ is the head. I
            complete, that is, I add my own amount; and I do this in my flesh,
            that is, it is I myself who am suffering. Or, we could say that Paul
            was completing the sufferings that were lacking in his own flesh.
            for what was lacking was that, just as Christ had suffered in his
            own body, so he should also suffer in Paul, his member, and in
            similar ways in others. And Paul does this for the sake of his body,
            which is the Church that was to be redeemed by Christ: “That he
            might present the Church to himself in splendor, without spot or
            wrinkle” (Eph 5:27). In the same way all the saints suffer for the
            Church, which receives strength from their example. The Gloss says
            that “afflictions are still lacking, because the treasure house of
            the Church’s merits is not full, and it will not be full until the
            end of the world.”

            verbum caro factum est, nullus scire potuit. Sed dicis: nonne fuit
            scitum per prophetas? Respondeo. Dicendum est quod sic, tamen

            and so Paul says, to make fully known this mystery (it is called a
            mystery insofar as it is hidden), because this mystery which has
            been hidden is this word: “I have a secret, I have a secret” (Is
            24:16) [Vulgate]. This mystery was hidden for ages, that is, from
            the beginning of the ages, and it was hidden from all the
            generations of men, who were unable to know this: “the plan of the
            mystery hidden for ages in God” (Eph 3:9). For even though the early
            philosophers seem to have said something about Christ’s divinity,
            either as being his own or appropriated (as Augustine found in the
            works of Plato, such as that “in the beginning was the Word,” and
            things like that), yet none could know that the Word was made flesh.
            But you ask if this was not known by the prophets? I reply that it
            was, insofar as it pertained to the Gospel; but it was not known as
            explicitly as the apostles knew it.

            but because of God’s good pleasure; thus Paul says, to them God
            chose to make known the riches of the glory of this mystery: “All
            that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you. You did
            not choose me, but I chose you” (Jn 15:15); “Yea, Father, for such
            was thy gracious will” (Mt 11:26). To make known the riches of the
            glory of this mystery, because by the fact that such things had been
            hidden, God now appears superabundantly glorious. For God was
            formerly known in Judea, but through this mystery of the conversion
            of the Gentiles the glory of God is made known to the entire world:
            as we read in John (17:4), “1 glorified thee on earth.” And this is
            to be done among the Gentiles, that is, it is to be accomplished
            among them: “Let us rejoice in our hope of sharing the glory of God”
            (Rom 5:2); “O the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of
            God!” (Rom 11:33). This mystery, which is Christ, i.e., which we
            obtain through Christ, is the hope of glory, which had formerly been
            promised only to the Jews: “The believers from among the circumcised
            were amazed because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out
            even on the Gentiles” (Acts 10:45); “Justified by faith, let us have
            peace toward God; and let us glory in the hope of the glory of the
            sons of God” (Rom 5:1-2); “The root of Jesse, who stands as an
            ensign of the people, will be called on by the Gentiles” (Is 11:10).

            perfection; and so he says, that we may present every man, that is,
            of any condition, mature, not in the law, but in Christ. “You,
            therefore, must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect” (Mt
            5:48). But is everyone bound to perfection? No, but it should be the
            goal of the preacher. Now the perfection of charity is of two kinds.
            One is from a necessity of precept, that is, that one not allow into
            his heart anything opposed to God: “You shall love the Lord your God
            with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind”
            (Mt 22:37). The other perfection of charity is from a necessity of
            counsel, which is that one give up even those things that are
            lawful; and this kind of perfection goes beyond what is required.

            were with him, but also for others. And so he says, for you, whom I
            have not seen in person, but in my mind’s eye. And his concern is
            also for all who have not seen my face. In fact, Paul cared about
            the whole world: “For upon his long robe the whole world was
            depicted” (Wis 18:24); “And, apart from other things, there is the
            daily pressure upon me of my anxiety for all of the churches” (2
            Cor. 11:28). But about whom was Paul most concerned? I answer that
            in a certain sense he was most concerned about those whom he could
            not see, because he did not know what was happening to them. But he
            was not concerned more about them in an absolute sense.

            First, the one we have here. Secondly, the one found in the Gloss:
            “that the hearts of those instructed in love might be consoled...”
            so that they might know “the mystery of God, the Father, and of
            Jesus Christ.” But the meaning is the same. When one is instructed
            in wisdom, he is consoled against temporal evils. But here a person
            should be instructed about the way; and so Paul says, in love, which
            is the way to God: “I will show you a still more excellent way. If I
            should speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love,
            I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal” (1 Cor. 13:1). Having been
            instructed in love, that is, in the love with which God loves us,
            and in the love with which we love him; for we are consoled by each
            of these loves. We are consoled because God loves us: “It is no
            longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me... who loved me and
            gave himself for me” (Gal 2:20); “Rich in mercy, out of the great
            love with which he loved us, even when we were dead through our
            trespasses, he made us alive together with Christ” (Eph 2:4). And we
            are also consoled because we love God, for it is consoling to a
            friend of God to endure evils for his sake: “If any evil happen to
            me because of him, I will bear it” (Sir 22:31) [Vulgate].

            extent of their capacity. Our intellect is in potency to know
            things, while the intellect of the angel was filled at its creation
            with a knowledge of understandable things. And so our human
            intellect must acquire its knowledge; and it does this either by
            study (and this is insufficient, because a thing can never be known
            so well so that it fulfills the capacity of our intellect); or it
            acquires its knowledge by a divine revelation and as a gift from
            God: and this is sufficient. “She [wisdom] will feed him with the
            bread of understanding, and give him the water of wisdom to drink”
            (Sir 15:3). And so he says, of a full understanding, that is, of an
            understanding in abundance: “What is richer than wisdom?” (Wis 8:5);
            “The riches of salvation are wisdom and knowledge” (Is 33:6). In
            short, they are to be instructed with such an abundance of divine
            wisdom that it fulfills the capacity of their intellect. We will
            have this abundance of divine wisdom by knowing God; and so Paul
            says, so as to know the mystery of God the Father and of Jesus
            Christ, that is, to know the truth of this mystery which had been
            hidden, which is that God is the Father of Jesus Christ. Or, we
            could say, to know the mystery of God the Father, which mystery is
            Christ. And so Matthew says about the apostles: “Thou hast hidden
            these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to
            babes” (Mt 11:25). Or, we will have this abundance of the divine
            wisdom by our knowledge of the eternal generation and of the
            incarnation of Christ: “To fix one’s thought on her [wisdom] is
            perfect understanding” (Wis 6:15). As Augustine says, “Happy are
            those who know you, and unhappy those who do not.” It is by knowing
            God that man has all fullness: “This is eternal life, that they know
            thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent,” as we
            read in John (17:4).

            is because in him are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
            God has a knowledge of all things, and this knowledge is called a
            treasure: “It is an unfailing treasure for men; those who get it
            obtain friendship with God” (Wis 7:14). Now a treasure is a
            collection of riches; they are not called a treasure when scattered
            about, but only when collected in one place. “God has poured out his
            wisdom upon all his works” (Sir 1:10) [Vulgate]; from this point of
            view his wisdom does not have the nature of a treasure. But his
            wisdom is a treasure when the ideas behind all his works are
            considered collected together, that is, in the divine wisdom. And
            all such treasures are in Christ. Wisdom is the knowledge of divine
            things, and science [scientia] is the knowledge of created things.
            Now whatever can be known about God, which pertains to wisdom, God
            knows in himself, and exhaustively. And likewise, whatever can be
            known about created things, God knows in himself, and in an
            super-eminent way. Now whatever is in the wisdom of God is in his
            single Word, because he knows all things by one simple act of his
            intellect, for in God knowledge is neither in potency nor in a
            habitual state. And thus in this Word are all the treasures of
            wisdom and knowledge [sapientia et scientia].

            reasons why something might be hidden from me: either because my
            intellect is weak, or because the thing is somehow covered. Thus, a
            person may not see a candle either because he is blind, or because
            the candle has been covered. And so, in the Word of God there are
            all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, but they are hid from us
            because our eyes are not clear but bleary: “A little light is in
            you” (Jn 12:35); and they are hid because they are covered with two
            veils: the veil of creatures, because at this time our intellect
            cannot come to this knowledge except through the likeness of
            creatures: “Ever since the creation of the world his invisible
            nature, namely, his eternal power and deity, has been clearly
            perceived in the things that have been made” (Rom 1:20); and the
            veil of the flesh: “The Word became flesh” (Jn 1:14). And even if we
            do know something about God, yet we do not see all: “Truly, you are
            a God who hides yourself” (Is 45:15); “Open your treasure for him”
            (Num. 20:6). Let us suppose that a person has a candle that is
            covered; he would not look then for another light, but wait for the
            light he has to become uncovered. And in the same way we do not have
            to look for wisdom anywhere but in Christ: “For I decided to know
            nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified” (1 Cor.
            2:2). And we read in 1 John (3:2): “When he appears,” that is, is
            revealed, “we shall be like him,” that is, knowing all things. In
            other words, if I had a book in which all knowledge was contained, I
            would seek to know only that book; similarly, it is not necessary
            for us to seek any further than Christ.

            not in a distorted way, so live in him. “Hold fast to what is good,”
            as we read in Romans (12:9). Sometimes the Church is compared to a
            spiritual building: “God’s temple is holy, and that temple you are”
            (1 Cor. 3:17). At other times it is compared to a tree, because it
            produces fruit. Now the foundation of a building is related to the
            building as the roots of a tree are related to the tree, because the
            foundation and roots are the source of strength; and this source is
            Christ. “In that day the root of Jesse shall stand as an ensign to

            est adinventio rationis, quando scilicet aliquis vult metiri ea quae
            sunt fidei, secundum principia rerum et non secundum sapientiam
            divinam. Ex hoc enim multi decipiuntur. Et ideo dicit

            92. – But how are they being deceived? One who deceives another must
            have something which seems reasonable, and something which is not
            really so. So first Paul shows the basis of this seeming
            reasonableness. It is based on two things, the first being the
            authority of the philosophers. And about this he says, according to
            human tradition, that is, according to what is handed down by some,
            basing themselves on their own judgment: “The Lord knows the
            thoughts of man, that they are but a breath” (Ps 94:11). The second
            source of an apparent reasonableness are the contrivances of reason,
            that is, when a person wishes to measure or judge about the things
            of faith according to the principles of things, and not by divine
            wisdom. And many are deceived in this way. And so Paul says, they
            should not be deceived by those judging according to the elements of
            the universe, and not according to Christ: “They were unable from
            the good things that are seen to know him who exists” (Wis 13:1).
            Now the higher a cause is, the more superior is its effect. And so
            those who wish to investigate certain effects in terms of causes
            that are inferior are deceived. For example, if one were to consider
            the movement of water in terms of the power of water, he would not
            be able to know the cause of the tides of the sea; to do this he
            would have to consider water in terms of the power of the moon.
            Thus, those people are even more deceived who consider the proper
            effects of God in terms of the elements of the world. And this is
            the reason for the seeming plausibility of what they say.

            in him the whole fulness of deity dwells bodily. Now God is in all
            things. He is in some things because they participate in a likeness
            to his goodness, as a stone and things like that. Such things are
            not God, but they have in themselves something of God; not his
            substance, but a likeness of his goodness. Consequently, the fulness
            of divinity does not dwell in them, because he is not there
            according to his substance. Again, he is in holy minds by an
            activity, minds which attain God by love and knowledge; and thus God
            is in them by grace, not bodily, but according to the effect of
            grace. And he is not there in his fulness, but only by some limited
            effects. But God is present in Christ bodily; and this is explained

            97. – A body is distinguished from its shadow: “These are only a
            shadow of what is to come; but the substance belongs to Christ” (Heb
            2:17). And so God can indwell in two ways, either as a shadow or
            bodily, that is, really. The first way is the way he dwelt in the
            Old Law, but in Christ he dwells bodily, that is, really and truly.
            This passage is explained in a second way by saying that God dwells
            in the other saints only with respect to their souls, and not in
            their bodies: “For I know that nothing good dwells within me, that
            is, in my flesh” (Rom 7:18). But the divinity dwells in Christ
            bodily, because the indwelling of God in the saints is by an
            activity, that is, by love and knowledge, which are actions of a
            rational mind alone, but God dwells in Christ by assuming a man into
            the unity of his person. And thus whatever relates to this man is
            indwelt by God; and thus his flesh and mind are indwelt because both
            are united to the Word: “And the Word became flesh” (Jn 1:14). The
            third explanation of this passage is as follows: God is in things in
            three ways. One way is common, that is, by his power, presence and
            essence. He is present in another way in the saints, that is, by
            grace. The third way is found only in Christ, and he is present here
            by union. Now a body has three dimensions, and the fulness of the
            divinity superabounds in Christ in these ways. And so the deity is
            said to be in him bodily. The fulness of the divinity is in Christ,
            as it were, by length, because it extends to all things; it is in
            him by breadth, that is, in its charity, and it is in him in its
            depth, that is, in its incomprehensibility.

            was brought about entirely by an indwelling, the Word dwelling in
            the flesh. But the Apostle does not agree with this, for he says in
            Philippians (2:7): “He emptied himself, taking the form of a
            servant” Now when one dwells in a man he does not empty himself; one
            empties oneself by becoming man. And so Paul continues, “being born
            in the likeness of man.” And so Christ is indwelt, but not in the
            sense that the one indwelling and the one dwelt in are distinct, but
            in the sense that Christ is both man and God, in whom dwells the
            fulness of the deity.

            104. – By putting off the body of flesh. This can be understood in
            two ways. In the first way Paul says that you were circumcised with
            a circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body of flesh,
            that is, by putting off the corruption of the flesh, as mentioned in
            1 Corinthians (15:50): “Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom
            of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.” He is
            saying in effect: You have been circumcised because you no longer
            have the vices of the flesh: “You have put off the old nature with
            its practices” (Col 3:9). Another explanation would be: You have
            been circumcised with a circumcision made not with hands, which
            circumcision made with hands consists in a putting off the body of
            flesh which is cut from it. And so in another version of this
            passage we find “skin of the flesh,” instead of “body of flesh,”
            that is, putting off a small part of the body which is flesh. (The
            meaning is not that the body is one thing and the flesh another).
            Paul uses the word “flesh” to refer us back to the law, where it
            speaks of flesh: “You shall be circumcised in the flesh of your
            foreskins” (Gen 17:11). He uses this word also to show that it is a
            carnal observance.

            This bond or written decree can be understood in two ways. In one
            way it is the Old Law: “By abolishing in his flesh the law of
            commandments and ordinances, that he might create in himself one new
            man in place of the two” (Eph 2:15). This is its meaning when he is
            here speaking in reference to the Jews, as if to say: and you... God
            made alive. Again, a written bond is a warranty usually employed in
            contracts. And whoever violates God’s bond is subject to a debt of
            punishment. This violation is retained in the person’s memory, which
            it disturbs and stains; it is retained in God’s memory, who is to
            judge such matters; and in the memory of the devils, who will
            torment them. Now the memory of this violation is called a bond. And
            it is Christ who has forgiven all by having canceled the bond, that
            is, the memory of the transgression, which stood against us. The
            bond, in both its meanings, was against us: the Law, because it gave
            mankind a knowledge of sin, but did not help [in overcoming sin],
            and the memory of our transgressions, for which we deserved to be
            punished. The term bond is used because its violation is not
            forgiven in such a way as to bring it about that there was never any
            sin. Rather, such sin is not remembered by God as something to be
            punished; it is not remembered by the devils as something to accuse
            us of; and we do not remember our sins as reasons for sorrow:
            “Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is
            covered” (Ps 32:1).

            116. – Then (v. 15), he shows how Christ freed us from the slavery
            of sin. For if a creditor holds a man captive on account of a debt
            that he owes, it is not enough merely to pay the debt; the person
            himself must also be freed. This is what Christ did. So Paul says,
            he disarmed [rather, “despoiled”] the principalities and powers.
            This despoiling can refer to those saints who had died before
            Christ’s passion; in this sense, Christ freed them from the lower
            world by despoiling the devil: “As for you also, because of the
            blood of my covenant with you, I will set your captives free from
            the waterless pit” (Zech 9:11); “Even the captives of the mighty
            shall be taken, and the prey of the tyrant be rescued” (Is 49:25).
            But if we understand this as referring to the living, then he
            despoiled them from the devils: “But when one stronger than he
            assails him and overcomes him, he takes away his armor in which he
            trusted, and divides his spoil” (Lk 11:22); “Now shall the ruler of
            this world be cast out” (Jn 12:31). Thus he says, he despoiled the
            principalities and powers, that is, the devils themselves: “Against
            the principalities, against the powers, against the world rulers of
            this present darkness, against the spiritual hosts of wickedness in
            heavenly places” (Eph 6:12). And made a public example of them, that
            is, the saints, as one who had authority in heaven, over the dead
            and the living, in the kingdom of his glory or of his grace. Or we
            could say he made a public example of them, that is, he drove out
            the principalities from mankind, “Awake, and put on strength, O arm
            of the Lord” (Is 51:9), and with a public judgment, so it could be
            known that they were expelled. For at one time the world did serve
            idols, but not now. Or we could say there was a public example, that
            is, before the multitude of angels, because Christ descended into
            the lower world of the saints and ascended into heaven. Triumphing
            over them in him, that is, in himself, in his own power. “By the
            power which enables him even to subject all things to himself” (Phil
            3:21).

            and exemplified the principalities and powers, triumphing
            confidently.” “He put off his flesh,” that is, his mortality. “Flesh
            and blood,” that is, the mortality of bodily corruption, “cannot
            inherit the kingdom of God” (1 Cor. 15:50); “Christ being raised
            from the dead will never die again; death no longer has dominion
            over him” (Rom 6:9), “Even though we once regarded Christ from a
            human point of view, we regard him thus no longer” (2 Cor. 5:16).
            “He exemplified,” he gave us an example of how the principalities
            and powers are to be overcome. The meaning of the rest stays the
            same.

            acknowledgment of the law. Here, he concludes that they are not
            obliged to observe the ceremonial commands of the law. There were
            four kinds of ceremonial matters: sacrifices, sacred things,
            sacraments, and observances. The sacrifices were those things which
            were immolated to God, such as sheep, oxen and the like. The sacred
            things included utensils and religious festivals. There were three
            sacraments: circumcision, the paschal lamb, and the consecration of
            priests. The observances were those matters that were related to the
            unique customs in the life of the people of Israel, things such as
            food, clothing and the like. Some of the above matters, such as the
            sacrifices, the utensils and so on, pertained only to some of the
            people; other matters were connected to all the people. Paul does

            temporale, et hoc quantum ad totum hominum statum; et sic sunt duo,

            120. – He also mentions sacred matters related to the religious
            festivals and ceremonies. Under the Old Law there were continuous
            religious ceremonies, like the morning and evening sacrifices. There
            were other ceremonies held at certain definite times. Some of these
            were held several times during the year, as the sabbath every week,
            and the now moon every month. Others came only once a year, as the
            Passover, the Feast of Tabernacles and Pentecost. The reason for all
            this is that all religious ceremonies are held for the honor of God.
            Now we give honor to God either because of something which is
            eternal, and thus we have continuous religious ceremonies; or we
            honor him because of certain temporal benefits which affect all
            people. There are two such benefits. First, the gift of creation;
            and thus we have the religious ceremony of the sabbath: “Remember
            the sabbath day, to keep it holy” (Ex 20:8). The reason for keeping
            the sabbath is that God rested on the seventh day. The allegorical
            reason for the sabbath is that it signifies Christ’s rest in the
            tomb, and the anagogical reason would be that it signifies the
            soul’s rest in God. The other gift is that of procreation and
            preservation, which are also for a time. And since the Jewish people
            calculated the time by the moon, he says, a new moon. There are also
            other reasons for honoring God, as a special rescue or deliverance;
            and so other festivals were added to the above. And so he says, or
            with regard to a festival or a new moon, every month, or sabbath[s],
            every seventh period. He says sabbath[s] because a sabbath is a
            rest, and they had several sabbaths: the seventh day; and seven
            weeks, that is Pentecost, which is the end of the seventh week
            following the Passover, which is the beginning of the year; and the
            seventh month; and the seventh year, when sins are forgiven; and
            after seven periods of seven years there was a Jubilee. With this in
            mind Paul says, or sabbath[s], meaning: Let no one condemn you for
            not observing these feasts.

            “humility,” bringing in observances taken from the law, for they
            pretended to be holy. But holiness consists of two things: a humble
            manner of life, and the worship of God. Now these people appeared to
            lead a humble life since they seemed to have no care for the things
            of the world; and so Paul says they were insisting on
            self-abasement. “There is one who is humble in an evil way, and
            within he is full of deceit” (Sir. 19:23). Again, they claimed to be
            preaching out of reverence for God; and so Paul says, and [religion]
            of angels: for religion, according to Cicero, consists in ceremonies
            and worship for a divine nature: “Holding the form of religion but
            denying the power of it” (2 Tim 3:5).

            to you in sheep’s clothing yet inwardly are ravenous wolves” (Mt
            7:15). Or, “in the religions of angels,” can be understood in a
            literal sense, because the Old Law was made known by angels, as we
            see from Galatians (3:19); “For if the message declared by angels
            was valid and every transgression or disobedience received a just
            retribution, how shall we escape if we neglect such a great
            salvation?” (Heb 2:2). These people maintained that the worship
            mandated in the law had to be kept, because it had been given
            through angels.

            without reason, in vain, although they pretended to be humble. And
            he mentions two things. First, that their religion was useless,
            because they went about without reason, in vain, that is, doing
            things that were of no value for eternal life: “Their labors are
            unprofitable” (Wis 3:11); “Though her labor be in vain, yet she has
            no fear restraining her” (Job 39:16). They also showed a false
            humility, and so he says that such a one was puffed up by his
            sensuous mind. There is a difference between one who is puffed up
            and one who is robust. A person who is robust is full with truth,
            while one who is puffed up is empty, and just extended with wind.
            Therefore, those who are truly humble are full, but those who are
            only puffed up are empty. “He will burst those who are puffed up”
            (Wis 4:19) [Vulgate]. This is the meaning of 1 Corinthians (8:1):

            129. – Why is Christ the Head? Paul answers: because the entire good
            of the body, which is the Church, depends on him. For there are two
            goods in a natural body: the union or joining together of its
            members and its growth. And the Church obtains these from Christ,
            for the entire body depends on him: “We, though many, are one body
            in Christ” (Rom 12:5). In a body the members are joined in two ways.
            One way is by contact, as the hand is joined to the wrist, and the
            wrist to the forearm, and so on. The other way is by a connection,
            as being joined by nerves. And so Paul refers to joints and
            ligaments. So also in the Church, its members are joined by faith
            and understanding: “One Lord, one faith, one baptism” (Eph 4:5). But
            this is incomplete without the ligaments of charity and the
            sacraments. Thus Paul says, nourished through ligaments, because it
            is through charity that one person supplies another. This body is
            developed by Christ, because it grows with a growth that is from
            God, that is, with a growth that God produces in us: “Blessed are
            the men whose strength is in thee,... they go from strength to
            strength” (Ps 84:5). Or, from God, that is, from Christ, who, as
            God, increases the body, the Church being enlarged: “For the
            equipment of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for building
            up the body of Christ” (Eph 4:12).

            in themselves are a burden. We desire three things: rest, honor and
            a fulness; and these are not produced by these legal observances.
            For the ban on foods is opposed to fulness, and becomes a burden
            because so many rules are involved. Further, these observances do
            not produce honor, but bring much confusion, as when ashes are
            sprinkled about, and the like: “A yoke upon the disciples which
            neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear” (Ac 15:10). Such
            practices lead to a severity to the body, that is, the Church, and
            not to the honor of God; rather they serve only to indulge the
            flesh, i.e., to satisfy carnal desire.

            is preached as raised from the dead, how can some of you say that
            there is no resurrection of the dead?” (1 Cor. 15:12). In the second

            justice: “He was put to death for our trespasses and raised for our
            justification” (Rom 4:25). Paul is saying in effect: When Christ

            Christ, seek the things that are above: “Seek first his kingdom and
            his righteousness, and all these things shall be yours as well” (Mt
            6:33). For this is our end: “One thing have I asked of the Lord,
            that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord
            all the days of my life” (Ps 27:4). Therefore, seek this, where
            Christ is, seated at the right hand of God: “So then the Lord Jesus,
            after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sat down
            at the right hand of God” (Mk 16:19); “Sit at my right hand” (Ps
            110:1). By “the right hand of God” he does not mean a member of a
            body, but he is speaking figuratively, for the right hand of a
            person is the stronger. Christ sits at the right hand of the Father
            because, as man, he shares in the stronger and better goods of the
            Father, while as God, Christ is equal to the Father. Consequently,
            you should have this intention: that just as Christ died and arose,
            and was taken up to sit at the right hand of God, so you should die
            to sin in order to live a life of justice and so be taken up into
            glory. Or, we could say, that we arose through Christ; but he is
            seated at the right hand of God, and so our desire should be to be
            with him: “Wherever the body is, there the eagles will be gathered
            together” (Mt 24:28); “Where your treasure is, there will your heart
            be also” (Mt 6:21).

            earthly way of life. And a person who has died to this kind of life

            you should act if you have died, with Christ, to the elements of
            this world: “So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and
            alive to God in Christ Jesus” (Rom 6:11); “They are dead, they will
            not live” (Is 26:14). When he said [above, in Romans], “consider

            earth]: You ought not to set your minds on things that are on earth,
            but put to death whatever is earthly, and in particular, your
            members that are on earth. We can explain this by making a
            comparison: our life involves many actions, just as our body
            contains many members. In a good life, prudence is like the eye,
            which directs a person; and courage is like the feet, which support
            and carry him. But in an evil life, craftiness becomes the eye, and
            obstinacy becomes the feet. Therefore, these members must be put to
            death. Or we could say that in reference to the members of the body,
            he had said, “you have died” (v. 3), that is, to an earthly way of
            life. But how is this death accomplished? He answers: put to death
            your members. Thus, to the extent we have died to sin, to that
            extent we are alive with grace. For the life of grace heals us with
            respect to our mind; but not entirely as to our body, because it
            retains a tendency to sin: “I of myself serve the law of God with my
            mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin” (Rom 7:25); and he
            said, a little before this: “I see in my members another law at war
            with the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin
            which dwells in my members” (v. 23). Therefore, because you have
            died so far as concerns your mind, put to death the sinful desires
            in your members that are on earth, insofar as they are on earth and
            are earthly bodies: “I pommel my body and subdue it” (1 Cor. 9:27),
            by not allowing it to be drawn to carnal things.

            carnal; secondly, those that are partly carnal. Among the carnal
            sins, we are inclined to lust especially by concupiscence. Lustful
            actions are shameful and although they may accord with the nature of
            man as animal, they are not fitting to it as rational, because every
            sin is opposed to reason. And so Paul says, immorality: “Beware, my
            son, of all immorality” (Job 4:12). Or, a sin can be against nature,
            and so he says, impurity. Again, pleasure might be impure, and so he
            says, passion; and desire can be depraved, and so he says, evil
            desire. Secondly, he lists the intermediate sins. The first of these
            is covetousness, whose object is something corporeal, that is,
            money, but it is completed in a spiritual delight, that is, in the
            ownership of such. And thus it has some part among the carnal sins.
            Paul adds, which is idolatry: “one who is covetous that is, an
            idolater,” as Ephesians (5:5) says.

            very life in money. We have idolatry when someone gives to some
            image the honor owed to God; but a covetous person gives to money
            the honor owed to God, because he builds his whole life around it.
            But because a covetous person intends to act towards money as to
            God, like an idolater, it is a lesser sin.

            <i>Dei, in filios diffidentiae</i>, id est peccatores qui diffidunt

            148. – Then when Paul says, on account of these the wrath of God is
            coming, he gives the reason why these sins should be avoided. There
            are two reasons: the first applies to all; the second applies
            especially to them. The first is God’s punishment, because on
            account of carnal sins the wrath of God, that is, God’s punishment,
            is coming [upon the children of despair], that is, sinners. Such
            sinners despair of God because lust is the offspring of despair,
            since many people abandon themselves entirely to things of the flesh
            because they have despaired of spiritual things. Or, he says
            children of despair, because of themselves there is no hope for
            their correction. And so the wrath of God is coming, as in the flood
            (Gen 6, 7), and on the people of Sodom. The other reason they have
            for avoiding these sins is that once they did live that way; and so
            Paul says, in these you once walked, from bad to worse. He gives
            them this reason, first, because of what Peter says: “Let the time
            that is past suffice for doing what the Gentiles like to do, living
            in licentiousness, passions, drunkenness, revels, carousing, and
            lawless idolatry” (1 Pet. 4:3). Secondly, he mentions this reason
            because they knew from their own experience that such conduct is not
            beneficial, but only brings disorder: “But then what return did you
            get from the things of which you are now ashamed,” as we read in
            Romans (6:21).

            sin in relation to God is [blasphemy]: “Bring out of the camp him
            who blasphemed; and let all who hear him lay their hands upon his
            head, and let all the congregation stone him” (Lev 24:14). And thus

            blaspheming, it is not a grievous sin. But I believe that however
            suddenly, if a person realizes that he is speaking blasphemous
            words, he sins in a grievous way. Secondly, he mentions a disorder

            mouth: “Let no evil talk come out of your mouths” (Eph 4:29).

            garment,” as we read in Matthew (9:16). First, he talks of putting
            off what is old, secondly, of putting on what is new (v. 10).

            154. – So Paul tells us to get rid of these things, put off the old
            nature, because it has grown old by sin: “What is becoming obsolete
            and growing old is ready to vanish away” (Heb 8:13). This old
            nature, this old self, is approaching decay, because sin is the road
            to decay. In addition, sin destroys virtue and spiritual beauty. The
            oldness of our nature, of course, was brought in by the sin of our
            first parent: “Therefore as sin came into the world through one man
            and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all
            men sinned” (Rom 5:12). This old nature, therefore, or old self, is
            the oldness of sin: “We know that our old self was crucified with
            him so that the sinful body might be destroyed” (Rom 6:6). We are to
            put off this old self with its practices: “Put off your old nature
            which belongs to your former manner of life and is corrupt through
            deceitful lusts” (Eph 4:22). The new nature or self is the mind,
            renewed from within, because before grace our mind is subject within
            to sin, and when it is renewed by grace it becomes new: “Your youth
            is renewed like the eagle’s” (Ps 103:5); “For neither circumcision
            counts for anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation” (Gal
            6:15). This new creation is renewing grace. Yet, there is an oldness
            that still remains in our flesh. Nevertheless, if you follow the
            judgment of the new nature, the new self, you are putting on the new
            nature or new self; while if you lust according to the desires of
            the flesh, you are putting on the old self or nature: “Put on the
            new nature, created after the likeness of God in true righteousness
            and holiness” (Eph 4:24).

            says, after [in the sense of “with respect to”] the image of its

            156. – Then (v. 11), he shows that this renewal is for every one,
            otherwise it would not pertain to human nature as such. And this
            renewal pertains to all because it was accomplished with respect to
            what is common to all. Here then we have five ways in which people
            are different. The first way is by sex, which Paul excludes when he
            says, here there cannot be [male and female], because men and women
            do not differ in mind, but in their physical sex. Secondly, people
            are made different by their native lands, and Paul excludes this
            when he says, Greek and Jew. For although the Jews were believers
            and the Greeks unbelievers, yet both have rational minds: “Or is God
            the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles also?” (Rom
            3:29). The third distinction is based on rite [as the rite of
            circumcision], for some had the law, while others did not; yet “The
            same Lord is Lord of all and bestows his riches upon all who call
            upon Him,” as Romans (10:12) says. A fourth difference is in
            language: barbarian, Scythian. Scythia is toward the North. What is
            barbarous is what is foreign or alien. Thus barbarians are
            foreigners, and one is absolutely a barbarian who is alien to human
            nature as such, that is, insofar as it is rational. And so
            barbarians are those people who are not ruled by reason and laws;
            they are slaves by nature. But there is no difference in Christ,
            because although they do not have the civil law, they still have the
            law of Christ. The final difference is based on state: for some are
            slave, and others free; but in Christ they are all alike: “The small
            and the great are there, and the slave is free from his master” (Job
            3:19). Therefore, none of these differences exist in Christ, but
            Christ is all, and in all. For circumcision is obtained through
            Christ alone, and freedom comes from Christ alone. If you are not
            free, Christ is your freedom; if you are not circumcised, Christ is
            your circumcision, and so on. And Christ is in all, because he gives
            his gifts to all.

            neighbor; and so Paul says, compassion: “Through the tender mercy of
            our God, when the day shall dawn upon us from on high” (Lk 1:78);
            “If there is any affection and sympathy” (Phil 3:1), that is,
            compassion springing from love. Secondly, we must show kindness to
            all. Kindness [benignitas] is like a good fire [bona igneitas]. For
            fire melts and thaws what is moist, and if there is a good fire in
            you it will melt and thaw what is moist. It is the Holy Spirit who
            does this: “The Spirit of wisdom is kind” (Wis 1:6); “Be kind to one
            another” (Eph 4:32). Lowliness or humility should be found in your
            hearts: “The greater you are, the more you must humble yourself”
            (Sir 3:18). In external matters you should practice [moderation],
            which consists in a certain limit, so that you do not go to extremes
            in times of prosperity: “Let all men know of your moderation,” as
            Philippians (4:5) says.

            161. – In the bad times of adversity three kinds of armor are
            necessary. First, patience, which keeps the soul from giving up the
            love of God and what is right because of difficulties: “You will
            save your souls by patience” (Lk 21:19). Sometimes it happens that a
            person does what is right if he alone is involved, yet he finds that
            the traits of other persons are insufferable; and to these he says,
            forbearing one another: “For by what that righteous man saw and
            heard as he lived among them, he was vexed in his righteous soul day
            after day with their lawless deeds” (2 Pet 2:8); “We who are strong
            ought to bear with the failings of the weak, and not to please
            ourselves,” as we read in Romans (15:1). Thirdly, the armor of
            pardon is necessary, and so he says, forgiving each other: “What I
            have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, has been for your sake
            in the presence of Christ” (2 Cor 2:10). One forgives an injury when
            he does not hold a grudge against the person who did it to him, and
            does not injure him in return. Still, when punishment is necessary,
            the person committing the injury must be punished. Paul adds the
            reason why they should forgive, as the Lord has forgiven you: “Does
            a man harbor anger against another, and yet seek for healing from
            the Lord?” (Sir 28:3); “1 forgave you all that debt because you
            besought me” (Mt 18:32), and then he continues, “and should not you
            have had mercy on your fellow servant, as I had mercy on you?”

            than all the virtues mentioned above, as we find stated in 1
            Corinthians (13:13). Above all these, that is, more than all the
            others, because love is the end of all the virtues: “The end of the
            commandment is love” (1 Tim 1:5). Or we could say, above all these
            we should have love, because it is above all the rest: “I will show
            you a still more excellent way” (1 Cor 12:31). Love is above all the
            rest because without it the others are of no value. This love is the
            seamless tunic mentioned by John (19:23). The reason we need this
            love is because it binds everything together in perfect harmony.
            According to the Gloss, all the virtues perfect man, but love unites
            them to each other and makes them permanent; and this is why it is
            said to bind. Or, it is said to bind because it binds of its very
            nature, for love unites the beloved to the lover: “I led them with
            cords of compassion, with the bands of love” (Hos 11:4). He says,
            perfect, because a thing is perfect when it holds firmly to its
            ultimate end; and love does this.

            of these acts, peace and thankfulness, and implies a third, joy. He
            says, let the peace of Christ [rejoice] in your hearts. An immediate
            effect of the love of charity is peace, which is, as Augustine
            comments, that composure or calmness of order produced in a person
            by God. Love does this, because when one loves another he harmonizes
            his will with the other: “Great peace have those who love thy law”
            (Ps 119:165). He says rejoice, because the effect of this love is
            joy, and this joy follows peace: “Joy follows those who take
            counsels of peace” (Prov 12:20). Paul does not merely say “peace,”
            because there is a peace of this world which God did not come to
            bring. He says, the peace of Christ, the peace Christ established
            between God and man. Jesus affirmed this peace: “Jesus himself stood
            among them, and said to them: Peace to you” (Lk 24:36). And you
            should have this peace, because it is the peace... to which indeed
            you were called. “God has called us to peace” (1 Cor 7:15). He adds,
            in the one body, that is, that you may be in one body. Another
            effect is thankfulness, and so Paul continues, and be thankful: “The
            hope of the unthankful will melt away like the winter’s ice” (Wis
            16:29).

            richly. “The source of wisdom is God’s word in the highest heaven”
            (Sir 1:5). Therefore you should draw wisdom from the word of Christ:
            “That will be your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the
            peoples” (Deut 4:6); “He was made our wisdom” (1 Cor 1:30). But some

            that this wisdom should dwell in us: “Bind them about your neck,
            write them on the tablet of your heart” (Prov 3:3). For some, a
            little of Christ’s word is enough, but the Apostle wants them to

            to you the whole counsel of God” (Acts 20:27); “The heart of a fool

            you sing psalms and hymns. The psalms show the delight of acting
            well: “Praise him with joy” (Ps 148:2 / 47:1). A hymn is a song of
            praise: “A hymn for all his saints” (Ps 148:14). And spiritual songs
            with thankfulness in your hearts to God, because whatever we do, we
            should relate it to spiritual goods, to the eternal promises, and to
            the worship of God. And so Paul says, in your hearts, not only with
            your lips: “I will pray with the spirit and I will pray with the
            mind also” (1 Cor 14:15); “This people draws near with their mouth
            and honor me with their lips, while their hearts are far from me”
            (Is 29:13). He adds, with thankfulness, that is, acknowledging the

            in Deum referantur actu, sed habitu; qui enim facit contra gloriam

            actions when he says, and whatever you do, in word or deed, do
            everything in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, because even our
            speaking is a work: “Whether your eat or drink, or whatever you do,
            do all to the glory of God” (1 Cor 10:31). Some find a difficulty in
            this statement of Paul: for what he is saying is either a command or
            a counsel. If it is a command, then whoever does not do this sins;
            yet a person sins venially when he does not do this; therefore,
            whoever sins venially sins mortally. My answer is this: Some say
            that this is a counsel; but this is not true. Nevertheless, it is
            not necessary that we refer everything to God in an actual way; it
            can be done habitually. Whoever acts against the glory of God and
            his commands, acts against this command. But one who sins venially
            does not act against this command in an absolute way, because even
            though he does not refer everything to God in an actual way, he does
            so habitually.

            they are to obey. He shows them two ways to obey: first, with
            simplicity and without trickery; secondly, willingly. So Paul says,
            not with eye-service, that is, not merely to the extent that they
            can be seen by their master. This same idea is found in Ephesians
            (6:6). He says, not as men-pleasers, for such persons serve merely
            to please men. As Galatians says (1:10): “If I were still pleasing
            men, I should not be a servant of Christ”. And therefore he adds,

            Lord, as in Job (1:1): “That man was simple and upright, and feared
            God”; “The simplicity of the upright guides them” (Prov 11:3).
            Further, they should serve willingly; and so Paul says, whatever
            your task, work heartily, that is, readily. And they are to do this
            as serving the Lord, because one who serves another because it is
            the right thing to do does this because of God, the source of what
            is right: “He who resists the authorities resists what God has
            appointed” (Rom 13:2); “Doing the will of God from the heart,
            rendering service with a good will as to the Lord and not to men”

            meritorium alicui dare quod suum est. Sed sciendum est quod ex hoc
            quod voluntarie facis, ex hoc ponis aliquid de tuo, quia de
            potestate tua est velle et non velle, et sic est meritorium. Servi
            autem ex debito serviunt domino, et ideo ut habeant mercedem hoc
            faciunt voluntarie. Sed sic servite eis quod a Deo non recedatis.

            179. – Next, he gives two reasons why they should serve this way.
            The first considers their reward, and the second considers their
            devotion to God. So Paul says: Serve readily, because from the Lord
            you will receive the eternal inheritance as your reward: “The lines
            have fallen for me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly
            heritage” (Ps 16:6); “Knowing that whatever good any one does, he
            will receive the same again from the Lord, whether he is a slave or
            free” (Eph 6:8). Some people were of the opinion that it is not
            meritorious to accomplish an act of justice, because this seems to
            be owed to someone, and it is not meritorious to give to someone
            what is his due. But we should remember that by the very fact that
            we do this voluntarily, we are doing something of ourselves, because
            it is in our power to will or not to will; and so such an act is
            meritorious. Now slaves serve their masters because they owe this to
            them; and therefore, in order to receive their reward, they should
            do this voluntarily. But they should serve their masters in such a
            way that they do not separate themselves from God. The second reason
            for serving this way is that this is the way one serves the Lord; as
            we read in Romans (12:11): “Be aglow with the Spirit, serve the
            Lord.”

            not up to you to take revenge by taking away from him what is his;
            rather, wait for the one who can, for the wrong-doer will be paid

            does two things: first, he gives his instructions, secondly, the
            reason for them. There are two ways a master can oppress his slaves.
            First, by acting unjustly against them by violating the laws, for
            according to the laws a master cannot be cruel to his slaves. And so
            Paul says that masters should treat their slaves justly. Secondly,
            by demanding that their slaves accomplish absolutely all their
            duties, which a Christian gentleness would soften; and so Paul says,
            fairly: “If I have rejected the cause of my manservant or my
            maidservant, when they brought a complaint against me; what then
            shall I do when God rises up?” as we read in Job (31:13). Then when
            he says, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven, Paul gives
            the reason why they should act this way, and it is this: just as you
            act towards your slaves, so the Lord will act towards you: “Knowing
            that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven” (Eph 6:9).

            says, as I ought to speak. “But I brethren, could not address you as
            spiritual men, but as men of the flesh” (1 Cor 3:1); “Who then is
            the faithful and wise steward whom his master will set over his
            household, to give them their portion of food at the proper time?”

            describes in three ways. First, as to love, saying, a beloved
            brother, that is, by the love of charity, which makes a person more
            precious than gold: “A man will be more precious than gold” (Is
            13:12). Secondly, he is described as to his faith, a faithful
            minister: “It is required of stewards that they be found
            trustworthy” (1 Cor 4:2). Thirdly, from his humility; and so Paul
            says, fellow servant, in the ministry, but a fellow servant in the
            Lord, because a prelate should be looking out for the honor of God
            and for the benefit of those over whom he has charge. Why is
            Tychicus being sent? To learn the condition of the faithful. “Go
            now, see if it is well with your brothers, and with the flock; and
            bring me word again” (Gen 37:14); “See how your brothers fare, and
            bring some token from them” (1 Sam 17:18). He is also to encourage
            and comfort them: “For I long to see you, that I may impart to you
            some spiritual gift to strengthen you, that is, that we may be
            mutually encouraged by each other’s faith” (Rom 1:11). Our Lord, who
            was sent by the Father, also came for this purpose: “to comfort all
            who mourn” (Is 61:2). Then he mentions his companion, and with him
            Onesimus. These two will tell you of everything that has taken place
            here; they will relate what you are doing to me for correction, and
            tell you what I am doing so you may have an example.

            191. – Then when he says, Aristarchus my fellow prisoner greets you,
            he shows how those who are remaining with the Apostle greet them.
            The text is clear. And Mark the cousin of Barnabas, concerning whom
            you have received instructions. We read in Acts (15:37) that a
            certain person by the name of John, surnamed Mark, had left Paul and
            Barnabas when they set out on one of their journeys; however, he
            later returned to them. Barnabas wanted to take him back, but Paul
            refused. As a result, Paul and Barnabas went their different ways.
            Later, Paul wrote to the Colossians that they were not to receive
            Mark. But now, since Mark had changed, he asks them to receive him.
            Thus, concerning whom you have received instructions: if he comes to
            you, receive him. Or, it could be understood this way: And Mark the
            cousin of Barnabas, concerning whom, that is, Barnabas, you have
            received instructions. And Jesus who is called Justus; he was a holy
            man, and so was called “Justus” [the Just]. These are the only men
            of the circumcision, sent to preach the Good News of Christ: “What
            then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth,
            Christ is proclaimed; and in that I rejoice” (Phil 1:18). Thus he
            mentions the Gentiles first, and then the Jews. Epaphras, who is one
            of yourselves, because he was an Asian. Their wish for the
            Colossians is “that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in
            nothing” (Jas 1:4); that you may stand mature and fully assured in
            all the will of God, that is, in all things relating to the will of
            God. Then he mentions Luke, who it seems, was not Jewish by birth,
            because he was from Antioch, and a physician. He singles him out
            because he had great authority in the Church because of the Gospel
            he wrote while the Apostle was still alive. He also mentions Demas.

            Laodiceans mentioned here, and another to the Corinthians, besides

            are two reasons why they are not in the canon: either there was some
            doubt about their authority, because they were possibly distorted,
            and had been destroyed in the churches, or because they contained
