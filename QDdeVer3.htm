                            quam quae habetur per eius similitudinem. Ergo Deus
                            non cognoscit res per suas similitudines, sed magis
                            per essentias earum; et ita similitudines rerum,
                            quae ideae dicuntur, non sunt in Deo.

                            1. God’s knowledge is most perfect. Now, knowledge
                            had from the essence of a thing is more perfect than
                            knowledge had from its likeness. Consequently, God
                            knows things, not by means of their likenesses, but
                            by means of their essences. Hence, those likenesses
                            of things which are called ideas do not exist in
                            God.

                                Sed dicebat, quod Deus scit res perfectius
                                cognoscens eas per essentiam suam, quae est
                                similitudo rerum, quam si cognosceret res per
                                earum essentias.- Sed contra, scientia est
                                assimilatio ad scitum. Ergo quanto medium
                                cognoscendi est magis simile et unitum rei
                                cognitae, tanto perfectius res per id
                                cognoscitur. Sed essentia rerum creatarum magis
                                est unita eis quam essentia divina. Ergo
                                perfectius cognosceret res si sciret res per
                                essentias earum, quam ex hoc quod scit eas per
                                essentiam suam.

                                2. But it was said that God knows things more
                                perfectly by knowing them through His essence,
                                which is a likeness of things, than He would if
                                He knew them through their own essences.—On the
                                contrary, knowledge is an assimilation to the
                                thing known. Hence, the more the medium of
                                knowing resembles and is united with the thing
                                known, the more perfectly is the thing known by
                                means of that medium. But the essence of created
                                things is more united with things than the
                                divine essence is. Consequently, God would know
                                things more perfectly if He knew them by means
                                of their essences than He does by knowing them
                                through His own essence.

                                    Sed dicebat, quod perfectio scientiae non
                                    consistit in unione medii cognoscendi ad rem
                                    cognitam, sed magis ad cognoscentem.- Sed
                                    contra, species rei quae est in intellectu,
                                    secundum quod habet esse in eo, est
                                    particulata; secundum autem quod comparatur
                                    ad scitum, habet rationem universalis, quia
                                    est similitudo rei secundum naturam
                                    communem, et non secundum conditiones
                                    particulares; et tamen cognitio quae est per
                                    illam speciem, non est singularis, sed
                                    universalis. Ergo cognitio magis sequitur
                                    relationem speciei ad rem scitam quam ad
                                    scientem.

                                    3. But it was said that the perfection of
                                    knowledge consists in the union of the
                                    medium of knowledge with the knower, not
                                    with the thing known.—On the contrary, the
                                    species of a thing, which is in the
                                    intellect, is rendered individual by the act
                                    of existence it has in the intellect; but in
                                    relation to the thing known it has the
                                    character of a universal, since it is a
                                    likeness of the thing according to its
                                    common nature and not according to its
                                    particular conditions. Yet the knowledge
                                    which is made possible by means of that
                                    species is not singular but universal.
                                    Hence, knowledge follows the relation of the
                                    species to the thing known rather than its
                                    relation to the knower.

                                        summo immaterialitatis. Ergo etiam multo
                                        magis inconveniens est ponere ideas in
                                        intellectu divino.

                                        4. The Philosopher criticizes Plato’s
                                        theory of ideas because the latter
                                        asserted that the forms of material
                                        things existed without matter. Now,
                                        these forms would exist without matter
                                        to a much greater extent were they in
                                        the divine intellect instead of being
                                        outside of it, because the divine
                                        intellect is the acme of immateriality.
                                        Therefore, it is much more inconsistent
                                        to say that ideas exist in the divine
                                        intellect.

                                            opinionem Platonis de ideis per hoc
                                            quod ideae positae a Platone non
                                            possunt generare nec generari, et
                                            ita sunt inutiles. Sed ideae, si
                                            ponantur in mente divina, non
                                            generantur, quia omne generatum est
                                            compositum; similiter nec generant,

                                            et generantia sint similia
                                            generatis, oportet etiam generantia
                                            esse composita. Ergo inconveniens
                                            est ponere ideas etiam in mente
                                            divina.

                                            5. The Philosopher criticizes
                                            Plato’s theory of ideas because the
                                            ideas he posited can neither
                                            generate nor be generated, and hence
                                            are useless. But, if the ideas are
                                            said to be in the divine mind, they
                                            also will not be generated—because
                                            whatever is generated is
                                            composite—nor will they generate,
                                            for, since whatever is generated is
                                            composite and whatever generates
                                            resembles what is generated, that
                                            which generates must also be
                                            composite. Hence, it would be
                                            inconsistent to say that there are
                                            ideas in the divine mind.

                                                6. Dionysius says that God knows
                                                existing things by means of the
                                                non-existing, and that He does
                                                not know them by means of ideas.
                                                But the only reason for
                                                affirming the existence of ideas
                                                in God is so He can know things
                                                by their means. Hence, ideas do
                                                not exist in God’s mind.

                          personaliter. Sed pluralitas proprietatum personalium
                          inducit pluralitatem personarum, secundum quas Deus
                          dicitur trinus. Cum ergo ideae sint essentiales, quia
                          sunt communes tribus personis, si sint plures in Deo
                          secundum pluralitatem rerum, sequitur quod non solum
                          sint tres personae in ipso, sed infinitae.

                          1. The things which are predicated essentially of God
                          are not less true of Him than those which are
                          predicated personally of Him. Now, a plurality of
                          personal properties involves a plurality of persons,
                          and for this reason God is said to be triune.
                          Consequently, since ideas are essential perfections
                          because common to all three Persons, if the number of
                          ideas is determined by the number of things that there
                          are, it follows that there are not only three Persons
                          but an infinite number of them.

                              sunt ipsa essentia.- Sed contra, bonitas sapientia
                              et potentia Dei sunt eius essentia, et tamen
                              dicuntur essentialia attributa. Ergo et ideae,
                              quamvis sint ipsa essentia, possunt essentiales
                              dici.

                              essential properties, since they are the essence
                              itself.—On the contrary, God’s goodness, wisdom,
                              and power are His essence, yet they are said to be
                              essential attributes. Therefore, even though they
                              are His essence, ideas can be called His essential
                              properties.

                                  Praeterea, quidquid Deo attribuitur, debet ei
                                  nobilissimo modo attribui. Sed Deus est
                                  principium rerum; ergo debet poni in eo omne
                                  illud quod ad nobilitatem principii pertinet,
                                  in summo. Sed unitas est huiusmodi, quia omnis
                                  virtus unita plus est infinita quam
                                  multiplicata, ut dicitur in libro de causis.
                                  Ergo in Deo est summa unitas; ergo non solum
                                  est unus re, sed ratione; quia magis est unum
                                  quod est unum utroque modo, quam quod altero
                                  istorum tantum; et sic non sunt in eo plures
                                  rationes, sive ideae.

                                  3. Whatever is attributed to God should be
                                  attributed to Him as existing in the most
                                  noble manner possible. Now, God is the
                                  principle of all things; hence, whatever
                                  pertains to the nobility of a principle should
                                  be said to exist in Him in the highest
                                  possible degree. However, unity is a
                                  perfection of this sort, because, as is said
                                  in <i>The Causes</i>: “Every power is more
                                  infinite when it has unity than when it is
                                  multiplied.” Hence, the highest unity is in
                                  God. He is, therefore, not only one in
                                  reality, but also one in concept, because that
                                  which is one in both respects is more
                                  <i>one</i> than that which is one merely in
                                  one respect. Consequently, many intelligible
                                  characters or ideas do not exist in God.

                                      the highest degree, conceptual
                                      distinctions are not applicable to Him;
                                      so, our original position stands.

                                          be unequal, because one idea will
                                          contain only the act of existence,
                                          another, both existence and life, a
                                          third, both of these and intellection
                                          besides—according as the thing, whose
                                          idea it is, resembles God in one or
                                          many respects. But, since it is
                                          inconsistent to say that there is any
                                          inequality in God, it seems that there
                                          cannot be many ideas in Him.

                                              ideae sunt principales formae vel

                                              and final causes can be reduced in
                                              a similar manner. Consequently,
                                              formal causes can also be reduced
                                              to one first form. The end-term of
                                              this reduction, however, will be
                                              ideas, because, as Augustine says:
                                              “these are the principal forms or
                                              intelligible characters of
                                              things.” Hence, there is only one
                                              idea in God.

                      It seems that they belong only to practical knowledge, for

                          Quia, ut dicit Augustinus in l. LXXXIII quaestionum,
                          ideae sunt formae rerum principales, secundum quas
                          formatur omne quod oritur aut interit. Sed secundum
                          speculativam cognitionem nihil formatur. Ergo
                          speculativa cognitio non habet ideam.
                        </td>
                        <td>
                          1. According to Augustine: “Ideas are the principal
                          forms of things, according to which everything is
                          formed that has a beginning or an end.” But, since
                          nothing is formed by reason of speculative knowledge,
                          ideas do not belong to this type of knowledge.
                          <tr valign="top" style="text-align: justify">
                            <td>
                              Sed dicebat, quod ideae non solum habent respectum
                              ad id quod oritur aut interit, sed ad id quod
                              oriri vel interire potest, ut ibidem Augustinus
                              dicit; et sic idea se habet ad ea quae nec sunt,
                              nec erunt, nec fuerunt, tamen esse possunt, de
                              quibus Deus speculativam cognitionem habet.- Sed
                              contra, practica scientia dicitur secundum quam
                              aliquis scit modum operis, etiam si nunquam
                              operari intendat; et sic dicitur practica esse
                              pars medicinae. Sed Deus scit modum operandi ea
                              quae potest facere, quamvis facere non proponat.
                              Ergo etiam de eis Deus habet practicam
                              cognitionem; et sic utroque modo idea ad practicam
                              cognitionem pertinet.

                              2. It was said, however, that ideas are related
                              not only to those things which have a beginning or
                              an end, but also to those which <i>can</i> have a
                              beginning or end, as Augustine says in the same
                              passage. Consequently, ideas are related to those
                              things which do not exist, will not exist, and
                              never have existed, but nevertheless can exist. Of
                              these, God has speculative knowledge.—On the
                              contrary, practical knowledge is said to be that
                              knowledge according to which one knows how a thing
                              is done, even if he never intends to do it. This
                              is why part of medical study is called practical.
                              Now, God knows how the things which He can make
                              are to be made, even though He does not intend to
                              make them. Therefore, God has practical knowledge
                              of them. Hence, in both ways, ideas pertain to
                              practical knowledge.

                                  Praeterea, idea nihil est aliud quam
                                  exemplaris forma. Sed forma exemplaris non
                                  potest dici nisi in practica cognitione, quia
                                  exemplar est ad cuius imitationem fit aliud.
                                  Ergo ideae solum practicam cognitionem
                                  respiciunt.

                                  3. An idea is nothing but the exemplary form.
                                  Now, one can speak of the exemplary form only
                                  in connection with practical knowledge,
                                  because an exemplar is that upon which a thing
                                  else is modeled. Therefore, ideas pertain only
                                  to practical knowledge.

                                      sunt in nobis. Sed ideae in intellectu
                                      divino existentes sunt ideatorum
                                      principia. Ergo ad practicum intellectum
                                      pertinent.

                                      4. According to the Philosopher, the
                                      practical intellect pertains to those
                                      things whose principles are within us. But
                                      the ideas existing in the divine intellect
                                      are principles of the things that are
                                      modeled on the ideas. Therefore, they
                                      belong to the practical intellect.

                                          quae autem sunt ad res, sunt practici
                                          intellectus; quae vero a rebus,
                                          speculativi. Sed nullae formae
                                          intellectus divini sunt a rebus, cum

                                          5. All the forms in the intellect
                                          either are from things or have a
                                          relation to things. The latter type of
                                          forms belongs to the practical
                                          intellect; the former, to the
                                          speculative. But no forms in the
                                          divine intellect are from things,
                                          since it receives nothing from things.
                                          Therefore, the forms in the divine
                                          intellect have a relation to things,
                                          and thus belong to the practical
                                          intellect.

                                              practical intellect were other

                                              not be based on something absolute
                                              in Him; for everything of this
                                              kind in God is one and one only;
                                              nor could it be based on a

                                              exists when a thing is said to be
                                              identical with itself, because
                                              such a relation involves no

                                              diversity, since a cause is not

                          Deus enim habet scientiam simplicis notitiae de malis.
                          Sed idea aliquo modo respondet scientiae simplicis
                          notitiae, secundum quod large sumitur pro similitudine
                          vel ratione. Ergo malum habet ideam in Deo.

                          1. God knows evil things in His science of simple
                          knowledge. But the ideas belong to His science of
                          simple knowledge in some way if <i>idea</i> is taken
                          in its broader meaning of a likeness or intelligible
                          character. Therefore, there is an idea of evil in God.

                              Praeterea, malum nihil prohibet esse in bono quod
                              non est ei oppositum. Sed similitudo mali non
                              opponitur bono, sicut nec similitudo nigri albo,
                              quia species contrariorum in anima non sunt
                              contrariae. Ergo nihil prohibet, in Deo, quamvis
                              sit summum bonum, ponere ideam vel similitudinem
                              mali.

                              2. There is no reason why evil cannot be in a good
                              not opposed to it. Now, the likeness of evil is
                              not opposed to the good, just as the likeness of
                              black is not opposed to white, because the species
                              of contraries in the soul are not contrary.
                              Therefore, there is no reason why there cannot be
                              an idea or likeness of evil in God, even though He
                              is the highest good.

                                  entis praedicationem; unde dicitur in IV
                                  metaphysicorum, quod negationes et privationes
                                  dicuntur entia. Ergo ex hoc ipso quod malum
                                  est privatio boni, habet aliquam similitudinem
                                  in Deo, qui est summum bonum.

                                  3. Wherever there is any community, there is
                                  likeness. Now, from the fact that a thing is a
                                  privation of being, being can be predicated of
                                  it; hence it is said in the
                                  <i>Metaphysics</i> that negations and
                                  privations are called beings. Therefore, from
                                  the fact that evil is the privation of good,
                                  some likeness of it exists in God, who is the
                                  highest good.

                                      Praeterea, omne illud quod per seipsum
                                      cognoscitur, habet ideam in Deo. Sed
                                      falsum per seipsum cognoscitur, sicut et
                                      verum; sicut enim prima principia sunt per
                                      se nota in sua veritate, ita eorum
                                      opposita sunt per se nota in sua

                                      is known in itself; for, just as first
                                      principles are known in themselves in

                                      these principles known in themselves in
                                      their falsity. Hence, the false has its
                                      idea in God. Now, the false is a kind of
                                      evil, just as the true is the good of the
                                      intellect, as we read in the
                                      <i>Ethics.</i> Therefore, evil has an idea
                                      in God.

                                          in God. Now, since vice is the
                                          contrary of virtue, it has a nature
                                          which belongs to the genus of quality.
                                          Therefore, it has an idea in God. But
                                          because it is vice, it is evil.
                                          Therefore, evil has an idea in God.

                                              reason for this is that evil is
                                              non-being. But the forms by which
                                              one knows can have non-beings as
                                              their objects. There is nothing to
                                              prevent us, for example, from
                                              imagining golden mountains or
                                              chimeras. Therefore, there is no
                                              reason why evil cannot have an
                                              idea in God.

                          Idea enim, secundum Augustinum, forma est. Sed materia
                          prima nullam habet formam. Ergo idea in Deo nulla ei
                          respondet.

                          1. According to Augustine: “An idea is a form.”’ But
                          matter has no form. Therefore, in God there is no idea
                          corresponding to matter.

                              Praeterea, materia non est ens nisi in potentia.
                              Si ergo idea debet ideato respondere si habet
                              ideam, oportet quod eius idea sit in potentia
                              tantum. Sed in Deum potentialitas non cadit. Ergo
                              materia prima non habet ideam in ipso.
                            </td>
                            <td>
                              2. Matter is merely a being in potency. Now, if an
                              idea has to correspond to its effect, if matter
                              has an idea, the idea of matter will be merely in
                              potency. There is, however, no potentiality in
                              God. Therefore, first matter has no idea in Him.

                                  Praeterea, ideae sunt in Deo eorum quae sunt
                                  vel esse possunt. Sed materia prima nec est
                                  per se separata existens, neque esse potest.
                                  Ergo non habet ideam in Deo.

                                  3. As they exist in God, the ideas are of
                                  those things which are or can be. But first
                                  matter does not exist separately, that is, by
                                  itself, nor can it so exist. Therefore, it has
                                  no idea in God.

                                      Praeterea, idea est ut secundum ipsam
                                      aliquid formatur. Sed materia prima
                                      nunquam potest formari, ita ut forma sit
                                      de essentia eius. Ergo si haberet ideam,
                                      frustra esset idea illa in Deo; quod est
                                      absurdum.

                                      4. An idea is that according to which a
                                      thing is informed. But first matter can
                                      never be informed so that a form would
                                      belong to its essence. Therefore, if it
                                      did have an idea, that idea would be
                                      useless in God. This, however, is absurd.

                          1. Nothing has an idea in God unless it has a
                          determined act of existence. But that which does not
                          exist, never has existed, and never will exist has no
                          determinate act of existence at all. Therefore,
                          neither does it have an idea in God.

                              Sed dicebat, quod quamvis non habeat esse
                              terminatum in se, habet tamen esse terminatum in
                              Deo. Sed contra, ex hoc est aliquid terminatum
                              quod unum ab alio distinguitur. Sed omnia, prout
                              sunt in Deo, sunt unum, et ab invicem indistincta.
                              Ergo nec etiam in Deo habet esse terminatum.

                              have a determinate act of existence in itself, it
                              has, nevertheless, such a determinate act in
                              God.—On the contrary, a thing is determinate in so
                              far as it is distinguished from another. But all
                              things as they exist in God are one and are not
                              distinct from each other. Therefore, even in God
                              it does not have a determinate act of existence.

                                  Praeterea, Dionysius dicit, quod exemplaria

                                  praedeterminativae et effectivae rerum. Sed
                                  illud quod nec fuit, nec est, nec erit,
                                  nunquam fuit praedeterminatum a divina
                                  voluntate. Ergo non habet ideam vel exemplar

                                  3. According to Dionysius, exemplars are those
                                  good acts of the divine will which cause and
                                  predetermine things. But the things which are
                                  not, have not been, nor will be were never
                                  predetermined by the divine will. Therefore,
                                  they do not have an idea or exemplar in God.

                                      4. An idea is ordained to the production
                                      of a thing. If there is, therefore, an
                                      idea of something which will never be
                                      given existence, it seems that such an
                                      idea is useless. But this would be absurd.

                                              knows those things which are not,
                                              have not been, nor will be.
                                              Therefore, there is an idea in God
                                              of all that does not exist, has
                                              not existed and never will exist.

                                                  2. A cause does not depend on
                                                  its effect. Now, an idea is a
                                                  cause o the existence of
                                                  things. Therefore, it does not
                                                  depend in any way on their
                                                  existence. Consequently, there
                                                  can be ideas of those things
                                                  which do not exist, have not
                                                  existed, and never will exist.

                          res. Sed accidens cognoscitur per substantiam, et ex
                          eius principiis causatur. Ergo non oportet quod in Deo

                          1. An idea is for knowing and causing things. But an
                          accident is known by means of its substance, and is
                          caused by the principles of the substance. Hence, it
                          need not have an idea in God.

                              substantiam cognitione quia est, non autem
                              cognitione quid est.- Sed contra, quod quid est
                              significat definitio rei, et maxime ratione
                              generis. Sed in definitionibus accidentium ponitur
                              substantia, ut dicitur VII Metaphysicor., et
                              subiectum, ita quod subiectum ponitur loco
                              generis, ut Commentator ibidem dicit, ut cum
                              dicitur: simum est nasus curvus. Ergo etiam

                              substantiam cognoscitur.

                              2. But it was stated that the existence, not the
                              essence, of an accident is known by means of its
                              subject.—On the contrary, the definition of a
                              thing signifies what it is, especially by giving
                              its genus. But, in the definitions of accidents,
                              as is said in the <i>Metaphysics</i>, are placed
                              substance and the subject, in the sense in which
                              subject is used instead of the genus, as the
                              Commentator notes. For example, we say: “Snub
                              means a curved nose.” Consequently, we know the
                              essence of an accident by knowing the substance.

                                  participant; cum participare sit tantum
                                  substantiarum, quae aliquid recipere possunt;

                                  3. Whatever has an idea participates in it.
                                  But accidents do not participate in anything,
                                  because participation is proper only to
                                  substances since they alone can receive
                                  something. Accidents, therefore, do not have
                                  ideas.

                                      quia primum est quasi idea secundi. Sed
                                      ens dicitur de substantia et accidente per
                                      prius et posterius. Ergo accidens non
                                      habet ideam sed substantia est ei loco
                                      ideae.

                                      4. In regard to those things that are
                                      predicated as prior and subsequent, in
                                      Plato’s opinion an idea should not be
                                      taken as common, e.g., as applied to
                                      numbers and geometrical figures. This is
                                      clear from the <i>Metaphysics</i> and
                                      <i>Ethics.</i> The reason for this is that
                                      the first is, as it were, the exemplar of
                                      the second. Now, being is predicated of
                                      substance and accident as prior and
                                      subsequent. Therefore, an accident does
                                      not have an idea, but has substance in the
                                      place of an idea.

                                              sed etiam accidentium. Ergo
                                              accidentia habent ideam in Deo.

                                              its idea in God. Now, God causes
                                              not only substances but accidents
                                              as well. Therefore, accidents have
                                              an idea in God.

                                                  should be reduced to the first
                                                  of that genus, just as
                                                  everything that is hot is
                                                  reduced to the heat of fire.
                                                  Now, as Augustine says: “Ideas
                                                  are principal forms.”
                                                  Consequently, since accidents
                                                  are forms, it seems that they
                                                  have ideas in God.

                                                          As the Philosopher
                                                          says, Plato, who first
                                                          introduced the notion
                                                          of ideas, posited
                                                          ideas, not for
                                                          accidents, but only
                                                          for substances. The
                                                          reason for this was
                                                          that Plato thought
                                                          that the ideas were
                                                          the proximate causes
                                                          of things. Hence, when
                                                          he found a proximate
                                                          cause other than an
                                                          idea for a thing, he
                                                          held that the thing
                                                          did not have an idea.
                                                          This also is the
                                                          reason why he said
                                                          that there is no
                                                          common idea for those
                                                          things that are
                                                          predicated as being
                                                          prior and subsequent,
                                                          but that the first is
                                                          the idea of the
                                                          second. Dionysius also
                                                          mentions this opinion,
                                                          attributing it to a
                                                          certain Clement the
                                                          Philosopher, who said
                                                          that superior beings
                                                          were the exemplars for
                                                          inferior. Using this
                                                          argument, namely, that
                                                          accidents are caused
                                                          directly by
                                                          substances, Plato did
                                                          not posit ideas of

                          Quia singularia sunt infinita in potentia. Sed in Deo
                          est idea non solum eius quod est, sed etiam eius quod
                          esse potest. Si ergo singularium esset idea in Deo,
                          essent in ipso ideae infinitae; quod videtur absurdum,
                          cum non possint esse actu infinita.

                          1. Singulars are potentially infinite in number. Now,
                          in God there is an idea, not merely of what exists,
                          but also of what can exist. If, therefore, there were
                          ideas of singulars in God, there would be an infinite
                          number of ideas in Him. This seems absurd, since they
                          could not be actually infinite.

                              Praeterea, si singularia habent ideam in Deo; aut
                              est eadem idea singularis et speciei, aut alia et
                              alia. Si alia et alia: tunc unius rei sunt multae
                              ideae in Deo, quia idea speciei est etiam idea
                              singularis. Si autem est una et eadem; cum in idea
                              speciei omnia singularia quae sunt eadem specie,
                              conveniant, tunc omnium singularium non erit nisi
                              una idea tantum; et sic singularia non habebunt
                              ideam distinctam in Deo.

                            <td>
                              2. If singulars have ideas in God, either there is
                              one idea for the individual and the species, or
                              there are distinct ideas for them. If there were
                              distinct ideas, then there would be many ideas in
                              God for one thing, because the idea of the species
                              is also that of the individual. On the other hand,
                              if there is but one and the same idea for the
                              individual and the species, then, since all the
                              individuals of the same species have the same
                              idea, there would be only one idea for all, and,
                              consequently, singulars would not have distinct
                              ideas in God.

                                  Praeterea, multa singularium casu accidunt.
                                  Sed talia non sunt praedefinita. Cum ergo idea
                                  requirat praedefinitionem, ut ex praedictis,
                                  patet, videtur quod non omnia singularia
                                  habeant ideam in Deo.

                                  3. Many singulars happen by chance. Now, such
                                  beings are not predefined. Since, as is
                                  evident from what has been said previously,
                                  namely, that an idea postulates
                                  pre-definition, it seems that not all
                                  singulars have an idea in God.

                                      Praeterea, quaedam singularia sunt ex
                                      duabus speciebus commixta, sicut mulus ex
                                      asino et equo. Si ergo talia habent ideam,
                                      videtur quod unicuique eorum respondeat
                                      duplex idea; et hoc videtur absurdum, cum
                                      inconveniens sit ponere multitudinem in
                                      causa, et unitatem in effectu.

                                      4. Certain singulars are combinations of
                                      two species. For example, a mule is a
                                      combination of a horse and an ass. Now, if
                                      such things had ideas in God, it would
                                      seem that there would be two ideas for
                                      each one. This seems absurd, since it is
                                      unreasonable to affirm multiplicity in the
                                      cause and unity in the effect.

                                              1. Ideas are in God for the
                                              purpose of knowing and making. But
                                              God is one who knows and makes
                                              singulars. Therefore, there are in
                                              God ideas of singulars.

                                                  existence of things. But
                                                  singulars have acts of
                                                  existence more truly than
                                                  universals do, because the
                                                  latter subsist only in
                                                  singulars. Therefore, it is
                                                  more necessary for singulars
                                                  to have exemplars than it is
                                                  for universals.

                                                          this. First, according

                                                          cause the matter but
                                                          only the forms of
                                                          things here below.
                                                          Now, the principle of
                                                          individuation is
                                                          matter, and it is
                                                          because of the form
                                                          that each singular is
                                                          placed under a
                                                          species. Consequently,
                                                          his ideas did not
                                                          correspond to a
                                                          singular in so far as
                                                          it is singular but
                                                          only by reason of its
                                                          species. His second
                                                          reason may have been
                                                          this: An idea is
                                                          related only to those

                                                          is clear from what was
                                                          said. But the
                                                          intention of nature is
                                                          principally to
                                                          preserve the species.
                                                          Consequently, even

                                                          in that man, the
                                                          intention of nature is
                                                          simply to generate
                                                          man. For this reason,
                                                          the Philosopher also
                                                          says that final causes
                                                          should be assigned for
                                                          the accidents common
                                                          to a species, but not
                                                          for the accidents
                                                          found in singulars.
                                                          For the latter, only
                                                          efficient and material
                                                          causes can be
                                                          assigned;
                                                          consequently, an idea
                                                          does not correspond to
                                                          a singular but to a
                                                          species. Using the
                                                          same argument,
                                                          moreover, Plato did
                                                          not posit-‘ ideas for
                                                          genera, alleging that
                                                          nature does not intend
                                                          to produce the form of
                                                          a genus but only that
                                                          of a species. We,
                                                          however, assert that
                                                          God is the cause of
                                                          singulars, both of
                                                          their form and of
                                                          their matter. We also
                                                          assert that all
                                                          individual things are
                                                          determined by His
                                                          divine providence.
                                                          Hence, we must also
                                                          posit ideas for all
                                                          singulars.
