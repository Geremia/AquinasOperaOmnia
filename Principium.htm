            Secundum Augustinum, in IV de doctrina Christiana, eruditus eloquens
            ita eloqui debet ut doceat, ut delectet, ut flectat: ut doceat
            ignaros; ut delectet tediosos; ut flectat tardos. Haec tria
            completissime sacrae Scripturae eloquium. Docet enim firmiter
            aeterna sua veritate, Psalm.: in aeternum, domine, permanet verbum
            tuum. Delectat suaviter sua utilitate, Psalm.: quam dulcia faucibus
            meis eloquia tua. Flectit efficaciter sua auctoritate, Ier. XXIII:
            nunquid non verba mea sunt quasi ignis, dicit dominus?
          </td>
          <td>
            According to Augustine in On Christian Doctrine 4:12 one skilled in
            speech should so speak as to teach, to delight and to change; that
            is, to teach the ignorant, to delight the bored and to change the
            lazy. The speech of Sacred Scripture does these three things in the
            fullest manner. For it firmly teaches with its eternal truth. Psalm
            118:89: ‘Your word, O Lord, stands firm for ever as heaven.’ And it
            sweetly delights with its pleasantness. Psalm 118.103: ‘How sweet
            are your words to my mouth!’ And it efficaciously changes with its
            authority. Jeremiah 23:29: ‘Are my words not like fire, says the
            Lord?’

            Et ideo sacra Scriptura in verbo proposito commendatur a tribus:
            primo ab auctoritate qua flectit, cum dicit: hic est liber
            mandatorum Dei. Secundo, ab aeterna veritate qua instruit, cum
            dicit: et lex quae est in aeternum. Tertio, ab utilitate qua
            allicit, cum dicit: omnes qui tenent eam pervenient ad vitam.

            Therefore in the text above Sacred Scripture is commended for three
            things. First, for the authority with which it changes: ‘This is the
            book of the commandments of God.’ Second, for the eternal truth with
            which it instructs, when it says, ‘and the law that is for ever’.
            Third, for the usefulness with which it entices, when it says, ‘All
            that keep it shall come to life.’

            Auctoritas autem huius Scripturae ex tribus ostenditur efficax.
            Primo ex origine; quia Deus origo eius est. Unde dicit: mandatorum
            Dei; Baruch III: hic adinvenit omnem viam disciplinae; Hebr. II:
            quae cum initium accepisset enarrari per dominum, ab eis qui
            audierunt, in nos confirmata est. Cui quidem auctori infallibiliter
            credendum est; tum propter naturae suae conditionem, quia veritas
            est, Ioan. XIV: ego sum via, veritas et vita; tum propter scientiae
            plenitudinem, Rom. XI: o altitudo divitiarum sapientiae et scientiae
            Dei; tum propter verborum virtutem, Hebr. IV: vivus est sermo Dei et
            efficax, et penetrabilior omni gladio ancipiti.

          <td>
            The authority of this Scripture is shown in three things. First, its
            origin, because God is its origin. Hence it says, the commandments
            of God’. Baruch 3.37: ‘He found out all the way of knowledge.’
            Hebrews 2:3: ‘For it was first announced by the Lord and was
            confirmed unto us.’ Such an author is infallibly to be believed,
            both on account of the condition of his nature, because he is truth;
            John 14:4: ‘I am the way and the truth and the life.’ And on account
            of his fullness of knowledge; Romans 11:33: ‘Oh, the depth of the
            riches of the wisdom and of the knowledge of God!’ And also on
            account of the power of the words; Hebrews 4:12: ‘For the word of
            God is living and efficient and keener than any two-edged sword.’
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr style="text-align: justify" valign="top">
          <td>
            Secundo, ostenditur efficax ex necessitate quam scilicet imponit,
            Marc. ult.: qui autem non crediderit condemnabitur, et cetera. Unde
            per modum praecepti veritas sacrae Scripturae proponitur; unde
            dicit: mandatorum Dei. Quae quidem mandata intellectum per fidem
            dirigunt, Ioan. XIV: creditis in Deum et in me credite; per
            dilectionem affectum informant, Ioan. XV: hoc est praeceptum meum ut
            diligatis invicem, sicut dilexi vos; quod ad actum et executionem
            inducunt: hoc fac, et vives.
          </td>
          <td>
            Second, it is shown to be efficacious by the necessity with which it
            is imposed. Mark 16.16: ‘He who does not believe shall be
            condemned.’ The truth of Sacred Scripture is proposed in the manner
            of a precept, hence the text says, ‘the commandments of God’. These
            commandments direct the intellect through faith: ‘You believe in
            God, believe also in me’, John 14:1; inform the affections with
            love: ‘This is my commandment, that you love one another’, John
            15:12; and induce to action: ‘Do this and you shall live’, Luke
            10:28.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr style="text-align: justify" valign="top">
          <td>
            Tertio, ostenditur efficax ex dictorum uniformitate, quia omnes qui
            sacram doctrinam tradiderunt, idem docuerunt, I Cor. XV: sive autem
            ego, sive illi sic praedicamus, et sic credidistis. Et hoc necesse
            est quia omnes habuerunt unum magistrum, Matth. XXIII: unus est
            magister vester, etc.; unum habuerunt spiritum, II Cor. XII: nonne
            eodem spiritu ambulavimus? Unum insuper affectum, Act. IV:
            multitudinis credentium una erat anima et cor unum in Deo. Et ideo
            in signum uniformitatis doctrinae dicitur singulariter: hic est
            liber.
          </td>
          <td>
            Third, it is shown to be efficacious by the uniformity of its
            sayings, because all who teach the sacred doctrine teach the same
            thing. 1 Corinthians 15:11: ‘Whether then it is I or they, so we
            preach, and so you have believed.’ And this is necessary because
            they all had one teacher. Matthew 23:8: ‘Your teacher is one.’ And
            they had one spirit, ‘Have we not walked in the same spirit?’ and
            one love from above, ‘Now the multitude of believers were of one
            heart and one soul’ (Acts 4:32). Therefore, as a sign of the
            uniformity of doctrine, it says significantly, ‘This is the book.’

            Veritas Scripturae huius doctrinae est immutabilis et aeterna. Unde
            sequitur: et lex quae est in aeternum. Luc. XXI: caelum et terra
            transibunt; verba autem mea non transibunt. Permanet autem in
            aeternum haec lex propter tria: primo, propter legislatoris
            potestatem, Isa. XIV: Deus exercituum decrevit, et quis poterit
            infirmare? Secundo, propter eius immutabilitatem, Malach. III: ego
            Deus et non mutor. Num. XXIII: non est dominus quasi homo ut
            mentiatur; nec ut filius hominis ut mutetur. Tertio, propter legis
            veritatem, Psal.: omnia mandata tua veritas. Prov. XII: labium
            veritatis firmum erit in perpetuum. III Esdr. IV: veritas manet et
            invalescit in aeternum.

          <td>
            The truth of this teaching of Scripture is immutable and eternal,
            hence the words, ‘and the law that is for ever’. Luke 21.33: ‘Heaven
            and earth will pass away but my words shall not pass away.’ This law
            will endure for ever because of three things: First, because of the
            power of the lawgiver. Isaiah 14:27: ‘For the Lord of hosts hath
            decreed, and who can disannul it.’ Second, on account of his
            immutability. Malachi 3:6: ‘For I am the Lord and I do not change’;
            Numbers 23:19: ‘God is not a man, that he should lie: nor like the
            son of man, that he should be changed.’ Third, because of the truth
            of the law. Psalm 118:86: ‘All your commandments are faithful.’
            Proverbs 12:19: ‘The lip of truth shall be steadfast for ever.’ 3
            Ezra 4:38: ‘Truth remains and gathers strength eternally.’

            Utilitas autem huius Scripturae est maxima, Isai. XLVIII: ego
            dominus Deus tuus docens te utilia. Unde sequitur: omnes qui tenent
            eam pervenient ad vitam; quae quidem triplex est. Prima est vita
            gratiae, ad quam sacra Scriptura disponit, Ioan. VI: verba quae ego
            locutus sum vobis, spiritus et vita sunt. Per hanc enim vitam
            spiritus Deo vivit, Gal. II: vivo autem, iam non ego: vivit vero in
            me Christus. Secunda est vita iustitiae in operibus consistens, ad
            quam sacra Scriptura dirigit, Psal.: in aeternum non obliviscar
            iustificationes tuas; quia in eis vivificasti me. Tertia est vita
            gloriae, quam sacra Scriptura promittit et ad eam perducit, Ioan.
            VI: domine, ad quem ibimus? Verba vitae aeternae habes. Eodem, XX:
            haec autem scripta sunt ut credatis; et ut credentes vitam habeatis
            in nomine ipsius.
          </td>
          <td>
            The usefulness of this Scripture is the greatest: ‘I am the Lord
            your God who teaches you profitable things.’ Hence our text
            continues: ‘All who keep it shall come to life.’ Which indeed is
            threefold: First it is the life of grace, to which Sacred Scripture
            disposes. John 6:64: ‘The words that I have spoken to you are spirit
            and life.’ For through this life the spirit lives in God. Galatians
            2:20: ‘It is now no longer I that live, but Christ lives in me.’
            Second is the life of justice consisting in works, to which Sacred
            Scripture directs. Psalm 118.93: ‘Your decrees I will never forget,
            for by them you have given me life.’ Third is the life of glory
            which Sacred Scripture promises and to which it leads. John 6.69:
            ‘Lord, to whom shall we go? you have the words of everlasting life.’
            John 20:31: ‘But these are written that you may believe that Jesus
            is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life
            in his name.’

            Ad hanc autem vitam sacra Scriptura perducit dupliciter: scilicet,
            praecipiendo et adiuvando. Praecipiendo per mandata quae proponit,
            quod pertinet ad vetus testamentum, Eccli. XXIV: legem mandavit
            nobis Moyses. Adiuvando autem per donum gratiae quod legislator
            largitur, quod pertinet ad novum testamentum. Ioan. I: lex per

          <td>
            Sacred Scripture leads to this life in two ways, by commanding and
            by helping. Commanding through the mandates which it proposes, which
            belong to the Old Testament. Sirach 24-33: ‘Moses commanded a law in
            the precepts of justice.’ Helping, through the gift of grace which
            the lawgiver dispenses, which pertains to the New Testament. Both of
            these are touched on in John 1:17: ‘For the Law was given through
            Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.’

            13:52: ‘So then every Scribe instructed in the kingdom of heaven is
            like a householder who brings forth from his storeroom things new
            and old.’ And Song of Songs 7:13: ‘In our gates are all fruits, the

            rugitus leonis, ita et terror regis. Sed monitorium est praeceptum
            patris qui habet erudire, Eccli. VII: filii tibi sunt? Erudi illos.
            Praeceptum autem regis est duplex, scilicet unum, quo legem statuit;
            aliud quod ad observantiam statutae legis inducit, quod consuevit
            per suos praecones et nuntios promulgare. Et sic distinguuntur tria
            praecepta, scilicet regis, praeconis et patris. Et secundum haec
            tria vetus testamentum dividitur in tres partes, secundum Hieronymum
            in prologo libri regum.
          </td>
          <td>
            The Old Testament is divided according to the teaching of the
            commandments, for the commandment is of two kinds, the binding and
            the warning. The binding is the command of a king who can punish
            transgressors. Proverbs 20:2: ‘As the roaring of a lion, so also is
            the dread of a king.’ But a warning is the precept of a father who
            must teach. Sirach 7:25: ‘Do you have you children? Instruct them.’
            The precept of a king is of two kinds, one which establishes the
            laws, another which induces to observance of the law, which is
            customarily done through his heralds and ambassadors. Thus it is
            that three kinds of command are distinguished, that of the king,
            that of the herald and that of the father. On this basis the Old
            Testament is subdivided into three parts, according to Jerome in his
            prologue to the Book of Kings.

            The first part is contained in the law which is proposed by the king

            of God, and urging them to observance of the law. Haggai 11:13: ‘And

            Jerome mentions a fourth kind of book, namely, the apocryphal, so

            ‘obscure’, because there is doubt about their contents and authors.
            The Catholic Church includes among the books of Sacred Scripture
            some whose teachings are not doubted, but whose authors are. Not
            that the authors are unknown, but because these men were not of
            known authority. Hence they do not have force from the authority of
            the authors but rather from their reception by the Church. Because
            there is the same manner of speaking in them and in the
            hagiographical works, they are for now counted among them.

            The public law is that which is given to the people. For the divine
            law was given to the Jewish people through a mediator, because it
            was not fitting that the people should receive it immediately from
            God. Deuteronomy 5:5: ‘I was the mediator and stood between the Lord
            and You and at that time to show you his words.’ Galatians 3.19:
            ‘What then was the Law? It was enacted on account of transgressors,
            being delivered by angels through a mediator.’ Thus a twofold level
            is found in legislation. First, when the law comes from the Lord to
            the mediator, and this pertains to three books, Exodus, Leviticus
            and Numbers. Hence we frequently read in them, ‘God spoke to Moses.’
            Second, when the law is given to the people by the mediator, and
            this pertains to Deuteronomy, as is evident from its very beginning,

            punishment, arguing by condemnation of sins. Although each of these
            is found in every prophet,
            <i>Isaiah</i>

            saw the things that are come to pass at last, and comforted the
            mourners in Sion.’

            men of war that remain in this city.’ But
            <i>Ezekiel</i>

            They can be distinguished in another way, insofar as

            read during the time of Advent by the Church, and
            <i>Jeremiah</i>
            the mystery of the Passion, hence he is read in Passiontide, and
            <i>Ezekiel</i>
            the mystery of the Resurrection, hence his book finishes with the
            raising of the bones and the repair of the temple.
            <i>Daniel</i>, however, is included among the prophets insofar as he
            predicted future events in a prophetic spirit; although he did not
            speak to the people in the person of the Lord, he dealt with the
            divinity of Christ. Thus the four prophets answer to the four

            Facto autem dupliciter. Uno modo instruendo de futuro ad cautelam;
            et hoc est in Iosue, quem Hieronymus inter Agiographos ponit.
            Quamvis enim propheta ex dono prophetiae esset, non tamen ex
            officio; quia non fuit a domino missus ad prophetandum populo. Unde
            quod Sap. VIII dicitur, de eo intelligi potest: signa et monstra
            scit antequam fiant. Alio modo narrando ad exemplum virtutis
            praeterita. Virtutes autem principales sunt quattuor, scilicet:
            iustitia, qua est bonum commune, cuius exemplum ponitur in
            Paralipomenis, in quo totius populi status describitur qui per
            iustitiam gubernatur. Secunda est temperantia, cuius exemplum

            castitatis exemplum. Iudith XV: fecisti viriliter eo quod castitatem
            amaveris. Tertia est fortitudo, cui duo competunt, scilicet,
            aggredi; et quantum ad hoc ponitur exemplum in libro Machabaeorum;

            hanc autem tentationem ideo permisit dominus evenire illi, ut
            posteris daretur exemplum patientiae eius. Quarta est prudentia,
            cuius est obviare insidiis; et quantum ad hoc ponitur exemplum eius
            in Esdra. In illo enim libro ostenditur quomodo Esdras et Neemias et
            alii principes prudenter caverunt insidias inimicorum volentium
            impedire aedificationem templi et civitatis. Est etiam prudentiae

            By deed, however, in two ways. One, instructing about the future by
            warning, and this in Joshua, whom Jerome places among the
            hagiographs. For although one is a prophet because of the gift of
            prophecy, this is not his office, because he was not sent by God to
            prophesy to the people. Hence what is said in Wisdom 8:8 can be
            applied to the prophet: ‘She knows signs and wonders before they are
            done.’ In another way, speaking of past events as examples of
            virtue. There are four principal virtues, namely justice, which
            serves the common good, an example of which is given in
            <i>Chronicles</i>, in which the condition of a whole people who were
            governed with justice is described. The second is temperance, an
            example of which is given in <i>Judith</i>, which is why Jerome
            says, ‘Take Judith as an example of the chaste widow.’ Judith 15.
            11: ‘For you have acted manfully, and your heart has been
            strengthened, because you loved chastity.’ Third is fortitude, which
            has two attributes. To attack, and an example of this is found in
            the Book of <i>Maccabees</i>; and to endure, and an example of this
            is found in
            <i>Tobit</i>
            2:12: ‘Now this trial the Lord therefore permitted to happen to him,
            that an example might be given to posterity of his patience.’ The
            fourth is prudence, by which dangers are avoided, and an example of
            this is given in
            <i>Ezra</i>. For in that book we are shown how Ezra and Nehemiah and
            other princes prudently guarded against the plots of enemies wishing
            to impede the building of the temple and the city. It also pertains
            to prudence wisely to repel the violent, and an example of this is
            given in <i>Esther</i>, where it is shown how Mordecai and Esther
            handled the deceptions of the most powerful Haman.

            gradus virtutum quos Plotinus distinguit; quia praecepta sapientiae
            non nisi de actibus virtutum esse debent. In primo gradu, secundum
            eum, sunt virtutes politicae, quibus homo moderate rebus mundi
            utitur et inter homines conversatur; et secundum hoc est liber
            proverbiorum. In secundo gradu sunt virtutes purgatoriae, quibus
            homo se a rebus mundi exuit per contemptum; et secundum hoc est
            Ecclesiastes qui ad contemptum mundi ordinatur, ut patet per
            Hieronymum in prologo. In tertio gradu sunt virtutes purgati animi,
            quibus homo, saeculi curis penitus calcatis, in sola sapientiae
            contemplatione delectatur; et quantum ad hoc sunt cantica. In quarto
            autem gradu sunt virtutes exemplares in Deo existentes, de quibus
            praecepta sapientiae non dantur, sed magis derivantur ab eis.

            The hagiographical and apocryphal books which instruct by word, are
            divided insofar as words work in a twofold way to instruct, in one
            way, by asking for the gift of wisdom. Wisdom 7:7: ‘Wherefore I have
            wished, and understanding was given me, and I called upon God, and
            the spirit of wisdom came upon me.’ This is how the
            <i>Psalter</i>
            instructs, speaking to God in prayer. In another way, by teaching
            wisdom, and this in two ways according to the twofold work of
            wisdom, one of which is to expose the liar, and
            <i>Job</i>
            who drove out errors by way of disputation exhibits this. Job
            13.3-4: ‘But yet I will speak to the Almighty and I desire to reason
            with God, having first shown that you are forgers of lies and
            maintainers of perverse opinions.’ The other work is not to lie
            about what it knows, and thus we are instructed in a twofold way,
            because either wisdom is commended to us, and this in the book of
            <i>Wisdom</i>, or the precepts of wisdom are proposed, and this in
            the three books of Solomon, which indeed differ according to the
            three grades of virtue that Plotinus, in Enneads 1.1.2.2-7,
            distinguishes, since the precepts of wisdom ought to concern only
            the acts of virtue. In the first grade, according to him, are
            political virtues, whereby a man moderately uses the things of this
            world and lives among men, and this in the <i>Proverbs</i>. In the
            second grade are the purgative virtues, whereby a man regards the
            world with contempt, and this in <i>Ecclesiastes</i>, which aims at
            contempt of the world, as is clear from Jerome’s prologue. In the
            third grade are the virtues of the purged soul, whereby a man,
            wholly cleansed of worldly cares, delights in the contemplation of
            wisdom alone, and this is found in the <i>Song of Songs</i>. In the
            fourth grade are the exemplar virtues existing in God, concerning
            which precepts of wisdom are not given but are rather derived from
            them.

            Christ is the origin of grace. John 1:16-17: ‘And of his fullness we
            have all received, grace for grace. For the Law was given through
            Moses: grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.’ In Christ a
            twofold nature is to be considered, a divine, and the Gospel of
            <i>John</i>
            is chiefly concerned with this, hence he begins, ‘In the beginning
            was the Word and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.’ And a
            human, and the other Gospels treat chiefly of this, and they are
            distinguished according to the threefold dignity that belongs to the
            man Christ. With respect to his royal honour,
            <i>Matthew</i>
            speaks. Hence in the beginning of his Gospel he shows that Christ
            descended from kings and was adored by the Magi kings. With respect
            to his prophetic honour,
            <i>Mark</i>
            speaks, hence he begins with the preaching of the Gospel. With
            respect to his priestly dignity,
            <i>Luke</i>
            speaks, and he begins with the temple and the priesthood and ends
            his Gospel in the temple, and frequently returns to the temple, as
            the Gloss says about Luke 2.46: ‘And they found him sitting in the
            temple in the midst of the teachers.’

            beginning of the Church, and this is treated in the
            <i>Acts of the Apostles</i>, hence Jerome says, in his preface to
            the Pentateuch, that ‘The Acts of the Apostles seem to give the bare
            history of the birth and to clothe the infant Church.’ Second, the
            progress of the Church, and to this is ordered the apostolic
            instruction of the <i>canonical epistles</i>. Third, the end of the
            Church, with which the whole content of Scripture concludes in the
            <i>Apocalypse</i>, with the spouse in the abode of Jesus Christ
            sharing the life of glory, to which Jesus Christ himself conducts,
            and may he be blessed for ever and ever. Amen.

            Quae quidem lex, non solum in spiritualibus, sed etiam in
            corporalibus invenitur. Unde Augustinus III de Trinitate:
            quemadmodum igitur crassiora et infirmiora per corpora subtiliora et
            potentiora quodam ordine reguntur, ita omnia corpora per spiritum
            vitae rationalem. Et ideo Psalmo praedictam legem in communicatione
            spiritualis sapientiae observatam sub metaphora corporalium rerum
            proposuit dominus: rigans montes, et cetera. Videmus autem ad
            sensum, a superioribus nubium imbres effluere, quibus montes rigati
            flumina de se emittunt, quibus terra satiata fecundatur. Similiter,
            de supernis divinae sapientiae rigantur mentes doctorum, qui per
            montes significantur, quorum ministerio lumen divinae sapientiae
            usque ad mentes audientium derivatur.

          <td>
            This is found to be a law not only in spiritual things but also in
            corporeal. Hence Augustine in
            <i>On the Trinity</i> 3.4: ‘Therefore, as the more crass and least
            are ruled in a given order by more subtle bodies, so all bodies are
            ruled by the rational spirit of life.’ Therefore, in the psalm the
            Lord proposed this law observed in the communication of spiritual
            wisdom in a metaphor of bodily things: ‘Watering the mountains...’
            It is plain to the senses that from the highest clouds rain flows
            forth by which the mountains and rivers are refreshed and send
            themselves forth so that the satiated earth can bear fruit.
            Similarly, from the heights of divine wisdom the minds of the
            learned, represented by the mountains, are watered, by whose
            ministry the light of divine wisdom reached to the minds of those
            who listen.

            Second, because of the subtlety of its matter, Sirach 24:7: ‘I dwelt

            There are some heights of divine wisdom to which all come, though
            imperfectly, because, as Damascene says in
            <i>On Orthodox Faith</i> I.1, ‘knowledge of the existing God is
            naturally inserted in all’. In this respect, it is said in Job
            36:25, ‘All men see him: every one gazes from afar.’ Other things
            are higher and only the wit of the wise achieves them. Romans 1:19:
            ‘What is known about God is manifest to them.’ Some are so high that
            they completely transcend human reason, of which it is said in Job
            28:21, ‘It is hidden from the eyes of all the living,’ and Psalm

            known by the Holy Spirit, ‘Now we have received not the spirit of
            this world, but the Spirit that is from God,’ instructing holy
            teachers who passed it on in the text of Sacred Scripture; and these
            are the highest, in which this wisdom is said to dwell.

            beams of divine wisdom. Psalm 75:5: ‘You came shining with light,
            powerful, from the everlasting hills. The foolish of heart have been

            of Israel do not put their trust in lance or bow, but the mountains
            defend them. Ezekiel 13.5: ‘You have not gone up to face the enemy,

            <i>On Pastoral Care</i>, ‘The preaching of those whose life is
            despised will also be despised.’ Ecclesiastes 12:11: ‘The words of
            the wise are as goads, and as nails deeply fastened in, which by the
            counsels of masters are given from one shepherd.’ For the heart

            First with respect to the order of communicating, because not
            everything that is contained in divine wisdom can be grasped by the
            minds of the teachers. Hence he does not say from the highest
            mountains, but from the upper; Job 26:14: ‘Lo, these things are said
            in part.’ Similarly, not everything that the teachers grasp is
            passed on to the hearers; 1 Corinthians 12:4: ‘...and heard secret
            words that a man may not repeat’. Hence he does not say, passing on
            to earth the fruits of the mountains, but ‘the earth is sated with
            the fruit of your works’. This is what Gregory, in the
            <i>Morals on Job</i>
            26 says in explaining Job 26:8, ‘He binds up the waters in his
            clouds, so that they break not out and fall down together’: ‘For the
            teacher should not preach to the simple as much as he knows, because
            he himself is unable to know how many divine mysteries there are.’

            XXIV: rigabo hortum plantationum, et inebriabo prati mei fructum.
            Sed auditores eam participant ad sufficientiam, et hoc significat

            Second, the order with respect to the mode of having is touched
            upon, because God has wisdom naturally. Hence his ‘upper rooms’ are
            what is natural to him; Job 12:13: ‘With him is wisdom and strength;
            he hath counsel and understanding.’ But teachers share in wisdom
            abundantly. Hence they are said to be watered from on high. Sirach
            24:42: ‘I said I will water my garden of plants, and I will water
            abundantly the fruits of my meadow.’ But listeners sufficiently
            participate in it, and the satiety of the earth signifies this;
            Psalm 16:15: ‘I shall be satisfied by seeing you.’

            except as ministers. Hence the fruits of the mountains are not
            attributed to them but to the divine works, ‘By the fruit of your
            works’. 1 Corinthians 3-45: ‘What then is Paul’ and later, ‘His

            non quod sufficientes simus cogitare aliquid ex nobis, quasi ex
            nobis; sed sufficientia nostra ex Deo est. Debet autem petere a Deo,
            Iac. I: si quis indiget sapientia postulet a Deo, qui dat omnibus
            affluenter et non improperat, et dabitur ei.

            But although no one by himself, of himself, is sufficient for such a
            ministry, he can hope to have this sufficiency from God; 2
            Corinthians 3:5: ‘Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think
            anything, as from ourselves, but our sufficiency is from God.’ He
            must ask it of God; James 1:5: ‘But if any of you is wanting in
            wisdom, let him ask it of God, who gives abundantly to all men, and
            does not reproach; and it will be given to him.’
