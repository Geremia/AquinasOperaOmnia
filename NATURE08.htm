<P>TIME</CENTER></H2></P>

<BR>
<P><STRONG>8.1  Arguments against its existence</STRONG> (Book 4, Lesson 15)</P>

<P>1) Time includes the past, present and future.  But the past and the future do not exist.  Therefore time does not exist.</P>

<P>2) Even present time does not exist, because time is divisible, whereas the "now" which exists, being indivisible, is
not a part of time.</P>

<P>	The question arises whether successive "nows" are distinct or the same.  On the one hand it seems they are
not distinct, since two parts of time cannot exist together unless one contains the other, as a year contains a month.
But between two "nows" there are an infinity of "nows", so that one can never contain or even touch the other.
Therefore, if time is continuous, the same "now" must perdure.</P>

<P>	On the other hand, it seems that each "now" is distinct:  No finite divisible thing can have just one boundary;
thus a line must have two terminal points.  But the "now" is a demarcation of time, and periods of time are determined
by two points of time (= past or future "nows").  Therefore each "now" must be distinct.  Likewise, if the same
"now" perdured through all time, there would be no way of distinguishing the time of things that happened a thousand
years ago from things that exist today.</P>

<P><STRONG>8.2  How time is related to motion</STRONG> (Book 4, Lesson 16)</P>

<P>Time is not the same as motion, because motion exists in the particular things that are in motion, whereas time is
everywhere and among all things.  Besides, every motion is either slow or fast, but time is neither; rather it is the
measure of what is fast or slow, since something is fast if it is moved a great distance in a short time.</P>

<P>	On the other hand, time is not independent of motion.  A sign of this is that we think little or no time has
passed (or time has gone fast) if nothing is happening around us or we become so absorbed in something that we are
unaware of what is happening around us.</P>

<P>	Therefore time is not motion, but it does not exist without motion.</P>

<P><STRONG>8.3  Definition of time</STRONG> (Book 4, Lesson 17)</P>

<P>Time is connected with motion.  This is obvious by our perceiving the two together.  Even if we in a silent dark room,
we perceive the succession of our thoughts and imaginings, and by this are aware that time is elapsing.</P>

<P>	The latter case would make it appear that time depends on the motion of the mind.  In that case time will not
be a thing of nature but a rational being.  On the other hand, if time follows upon any and every motion, then there
are as many times as there are motions, which is absurd.</P>

<P>	The problem of multiple times is solved if we measure the multiple motions of this world by reference to
regular cosmic motions, such as the daily revolution of the earth on its axis, the annual orbital movement of the earth
around the sun, and the 28 day orbital movement of the moon around the earth.  These are the constants of our world
of experience, and it is by these motions that time is calculated.</P>

<P>	If time is calculated according to such a basic local motion, and this motion is the continuous passage of the
earth over a continuous orbit or position in reference to the sun, then time must be continuous.  Because positions can
be demarcated in the path of these motions, the motions themselves can be demarcated by points which are before or
after each other.  Because there is a priority and posteriority of motion, there is a priority and posteriority of time.</P>

<P>	The priority and posteriority of motion are the same as motion as to subject, but are different formalities.
<EM>Time</EM>, precisely, is <STRONG>the number of motion</STRONG>.  That is because time is a counting of the different "befores" and "afters"
of a motion.  We could re-phrase our definition to say that <EM>time</EM> is <STRONG>the numbering of motion according to before
and after</STRONG>.  The "before" and "after" are not those of time, so that the definition would be circular, but the "before"
and "after" of motion as it crosses different points of place.</P>

<P>	As a number, time is not an abstract number, such as used in pure mathematics, but a concrete quantity that
we can call a "numbered number", as when we say ten men or 100 horses.  <EM>Time</EM> is the <STRONG>number of before and after
in motion</STRONG>.  Although number is discrete quantity, time is a continuous quantity on account of the thing counted, just
as ten measures of cloth is a continuous quantity, even though ten is a discrete quantity.</P>

<P><STRONG>8.4  The meaning of "now"</STRONG> (Book 4, Lesson 18 &amp; 21)</P>

<P>Just as the parts of motion are always other and other, so also the parts of time.  But what always exists throughout
the whole of time is the same, namely, the "now" which, as to its nature is always the same, although in conception
it varies according as it is prior and subsequent.  Thus the "now" measures time not in as much as it is always the
same thing, but in as much as in conception it is other and other, i.e. "before" and "after".</P>

<P>	[Other words for "now" are: a "point in time", an "instant", a "moment", but the latter two are more often
understood as infinitismal segments of time.]</P>

<P>	In so far as the "now" constantly changes with the succession of time and of motion, in that sense it is other
and not always the same, but in so far as the "now" is a certain being, abstracted from "before" and "after", in that
sense it is always of the same nature.  "Now" is comparable to a moving car along a road; in its nature it is always
the same, yet different when considered located at different positions along its path.  Just as the mobile object is more
known to us than motion, and motion is known through the mobile object, so time is known through the "now".</P>

<P>	It is plain that if there is no time there will be no "now", and if there is no "now" there will be no time.
Time is the number of local motion, but a single "now" is not the number of motion (since it is indivisible), but a
principle of motion, just as "one" is the principle of number.</P>

<P>	Just as the unity of the mobile (e.g. the car on the road) gives unity to the movement (since a change of
vehicles would mean different movements), so time derives its unity from the moving "now".  And like the moving
point of a line as it is drawn, the on-going "now" both gives unity to time and distinguishes its parts.  Points are only
potential in a line and are actualized only when demarcated as the end of one segment and the beginning of another,
as at an angle, which is one point serving two lines.  Angular motion (like a bouncing ball), however, is multiple,
with the two motions connected at two contiguous points.</P>

<P>	The "now" of time is continuous like the point of a line, being at the same time a potential end of the past
and beginning of the future.  Only when we designate one "now" as the end of one period of time and the beginning
of another is it an actualized point.  [Compare the separate frames of a video film with the continuity of actual
motion.]  The distinction of the "now" is a work of the human mind taking it as a boundary; in reality there is no
break into contiguous "nows", but it is continuous.</P>

<P>	Thus the "now" is not a part of time, but a boundary of time; in that way it is a number, and is applicable
to all things that are moved in time.</P>

<P>	Besides its meaning as a point in time, "now" is commonly used for a period of time that includes the present,
as we say "He has now come" because he has come today.</P>

<P>	Similarly, we say something happened "then", meaning either at a precise moment in the past or at a more
or less broad period of time including that moment.</P>

<P>	The words "presently" or "just now" mean "now" in the broad sense of the present time, while "long ago"
refers to a period of time in the distant past.  Something occurs "suddenly" when the time in which it takes place is
imperceptibly small.</P>

<P>	"Now" in its strict sense has the double function of being an end of the past and a beginning of the future.
Thus, of its nature, time does not necessarily have a beginning or an end.  Only were the whole universe and its
motion to have a beginning would the first "now" serve only as a beginning and not as an end.  And were the whole
universe and its motion to have an end, then the last "now" would serve only as an end and not as a beginning.</P>

<P><STRONG>8.5  Explanations about time</STRONG> (Book 4, Lesson 19)</P>

<P>We have seen that <EM>time</EM> is <STRONG>the number of motion according to before and after</STRONG>.  It is a type of continuum; although
it does not have continuity in so far as it is a number, it does by reason of that of which it is the number: for it is the
number of a continuum, namely, of motion.  For time is not a number absolutely but a number of something
numbered.</P>

<P>	Does time have a minimum?  As a number, the minimum is one: a year, day or second etc., but as a
continuum, any given time can be divided into smaller parts, just as a magnitude.</P>

<P>	Why is time not said to be slow or fast, but is said to be much or little, and short or long?  In so far as time
is a continuum it is said to be long or short; in so far as it is a number it is said to be much or little.  But it cannot
be called fast or slow, because that is said of something that can be counted in a short or long time, whereas time is
the number of a constant motion.</P>

<P>	In what ways is time the same and different?  Time is the same everywhere, but is different by reason of
before and after in the basic motion of which it is the number; just as different segments of motion are different, so
different segments of time.</P>

<P>	How is time everywhere, when motion is not everywhere?  The answer is that time accompanies motion,
whether motion be actual or potential.  For things that are capable of motion, and are not actually being moved, are
at rest.  But time measures not only motion but rest as well.</P>

<P>	How can time be repeated?  Since the same motion may be repeated specifically, but not numerically, so time
can be duplicated in the same day.  Thus each year we have a rainy season, specifically the same but numerically
different.</P>

<P>	Does time measure motion or motion time?  Each is defined in terms of the other.  The basic continuum is
that of a magnitude (e.g. a road); motion imitates this in quantity, continuity and divisibility, and likewise time
imitates motion.  Fundamentally, time is the number and measure of motion, but it is not always the most known to
us.  Sometimes we say a certain town is two hours away, not knowing the exact distance.  Other times we say that
it is 60 kilometres, not knowing the time it takes to get there.</P>

<P><STRONG>8.6  How things are or are not in time</STRONG> (Book 4, Lesson 20)</P>

<P>Motion is measured by time both in its duration (so many hours, days) and in its being, which is essentially
continuous and numerable.  Other things, like a stone or a man, are measured by time in their duration (i.e. in so far
as they have motion), but not in their being, which merely co-exists with time.</P>

<P>	Anything that exists in time tends to waste away with age.  Even though it could be argued that some things
get better with time, nonetheless one does not necessarily learn with time but one does forget with time.  Time is <EM>per
se</EM> corruptive, and <EM>per accidens</EM> generative, whereas generation and being is attributed <EM>per se</EM> to the agent and
generator.  The latter are not required for corruption, but simply old age.</P>

<P>	Thus whatever is contained in time is subject to decay and corruption.  But whatever is outside time exists
forever.  Aristotle and Thomas wrongly thought this applies to the heavenly bodies which have only local motion but
are subject to no other change.  But if heavenly bodies, like the sun, moon and stars, are corruptible like everything
else, then only spiritual beings are outside of time and exist forever.  Besides, universal truths, such as mathematical
axioms, are not subject to time and are forever true, but that is because they are abstracted from the real sensible
existence of things.</P>

<P><STRONG>8.7  Problems regarding the existence and unity of time</STRONG> (Book 4, Lesson 23)</P>

<P>1) Can there be time without the soul?  An argument for the negative is that without anyone to count nothing is
countable, and there is no number.  On the other hand, motion is a reality independent of the soul, and so is its
"before" and "after", which is numerable.  Consequently, just as there can be things perceptible to sense even though
no sense exists, and intelligible things even though no intelligence exists, so there can exist both countable things and
number, even though no counter exists.  It is true that if it is impossible for a counter to exist, then nothing countable
could exist, but it does not follow that if there is no one counting that there is nothing countable.</P>

<P>	Motion, however, does not have a fixed existence in reality, nor is any par of motion actually found in things
but a certain indivisible of motion which divides motion; indeed, the totality of motion comes to be on account of the
mind considering and comparing a previous state of the mobile to a subsequent state.</P>

<P>	According to this, then, time also has no existence outside the soul except according to its indivisible, while
the totality of time is had by an ordering process of the mind enumerating what is prior and subsequent in motion.
Therefore, apart from the soul time is "a sort of being", i.e. an imperfect being, just as motion exists imperfectly
without a soul knowing it.</P>

<P>	2) Of which motion is time the number?  Since every motion has a before and an after, it would seem that
time is the number of each and every motion.  But in this case two simultaneous motions would each have their own
time (or calendar) and two equal measures of time would exist simultaneously.  The only way to compare them is by
some regular constant motion, such as the spinning of the earth, which gives us day and night, and the revolution of
the earth around the sun, which gives us a year.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000"><STRONG>OTHER STATEMENTS FOR COMPARISON</STRONG></P>

<P>Thomas Aquinas, <EM>De veritate</EM>, q. 28, a. 2:</FONT></P>
<P> (Objection 10 to Whether there can be forgiveness of sin without grace): Grace and guilt cannot be in the soul together.
If, then, grace is infused for the forgiveness of guilt, the guilt must first have been in the soul when grace was not.  Now
since the guilt has ceased to be, a last instant can be designated in which the guilt existed.  Similarly, since the grace
begins to be, a first instant can be designated in which grace exists in the soul.  But these must be two distinct instants,
because grace and guilt cannot exist in the soul at the same time, as has been said.  Between any two instants, however,
there is an intervening time, as in proved in the <EM>Physics</EM>.  There will therefore be a time in which man has neither guilt
nor grace, and so grace is seemingly not necessary for the forgiveness of guilt. <B>(Reply):</B> To this and similar difficulties a number of answers are ordinarily given.</P>

<P> 	The first is that, although that instant is really one, it is nevertheless several in thought, being the beginning of
the future and the end of the past; and so nothing prevents guilt and grace from being in the soul at the same time, but
in such a way that guilt is in that instant in so far as it is the end of the past, whereas grace is in it in so far as it is the
beginning of the future. </P>

<P> 	But this again cannot stand.  Because a line is an intrinsic measure, it is divided according to the distinction of real things.  But time is an extrinsic measure and is one with regard to all things that are in time; for the existence of guilt is not measured by one time and that of grace by another, unless we mean by another time another part of the same continuous time.  It is therefore necessary that between any two instants, whatever the things to which they may be referred, there should be an intervening time.  Furthermore, two points on two line-segments in contact described on located bodies are united at a single point designated on an external line on the locating body; for contiguous beings are those whose extremities coincide.  If, then, it is granted that distinct beings have distinct times which are not continuous but in a sense contiguous, it will nevertheless be necessary that in the time serving as the extrinsic measure there correspond to their end-points a single indivisible instant.  Consequently the same inadmissible conclusion mentioned above, that guilt and grace are together, comes back again. </P>

<P> 	On this account others say that, just as a line extends between two points on a single line but not between two
points on two line-segments in contact at their end-points; in the same way it is not necessary that between the instant
which is the last of the time in which guilt was present and the instant which is the first of the time in which grace is
present, there be any intervening time, since they are instants of distinct times. </P>

<P> But this again cannot stand.  For the distinction given implies different aspects of the instant which do not multiply its substance but leave it one.  The real consequence is that guilt and grace are in the soul in the same indivisible point of time; for the term instant means an indivisible point of time.  But this is to be together at the same time; and so it follows that contraries are in the same subject at the same time.  Furthermore, according to the Philosopher [Physics, VII, 8; 262a22-27, b5-7], when anything in moving makes use of one point as two, a period of rest must intervene.  It is by this argument that he proves that reciprocating motions (bouncing) are not continuous.  Likewise, if anyone makes use of one instant as two, he must understand some interval; as a consequence the soul would at some time be without guilt or grace.  But this is inadmissible.
	On this account others say that, just as a line extends between two points on a single line but not between two points on two line-segments in contact at their end-points; in the same way it is not necessary that between the instant which is the last of the time in which guilt was present and the instant which is the first of the time in which grace is present, there be any intervening time, since they are instants of distinct times.
	But this again cannot stand.  Because a line is an intrinsic measure, it is divided according to the distinction of
real things.  But time is an extrinsic measure and is one with regard to all things that are in time; for the existence of guilt
is not measured by one time and that of grace by another, unless we mean by <EM>another time</EM> another part of the same
continuous time.  It is therefore necessary that between any two instants, whatever the things to which they may be
referred, there should be an itervening time.  Furthermore, two points on two line-segments in contact described on located
bodies are united at a single point designated on an external line on the locating body; for contiguous beings are those
whose extremities coincide.  If, then, it is granted that distinct beings have distinct times which are not continuous but in
a sense continguous, it will nevertheless be necessary that in the time serving as the extrinsic measure there correspond
to their end-points a single indivisible instant.  Consequently the same inadmissible conclusion mentioned above, that guilt
and grace are together, comes back again. </P>

<P> 	For this reason others say that such spiritual changes are not measured by a time which is the number of the
movement of the heavens, because the soul and every spiritual substance are above time; but they have their own time
inasmuch as there is found in them a before an after.  But this time is not continuous, since according to the Philosopher
[<EM>Physics</EM>, IV, 11; 219a 12-13] the continuity of time is dependent upon the continuity of motion, whereas the affections
of the soul are not continuous. </P>

<P> 	But this likewise has no place in the matter at hand.  For not only things essentially in time, but also those having
an accidental reference to the movement of the heavens because they are dependent upon things that have an essential
reference to the time just mentioned.  And this holds even for the justification of sinners, which is dependent upon
thoughts, conversations, and other such motions that are essentially measured by the time of the movement of the heavens. </P>

<P> 	A different explanation must therefore be given: we cannot indicate the last instant in which the sinner had guilt,
but the last time.  We can, however, indicate the first instant in which he has grace, and this instant is the end of the time
in which he had guilt; but between a time and the end of that time nothing intervenes.  We therefore do not have to
indicate any time or instant in which a person would have neither guilt nor grace. </P>

<P> 	This is explained as follows.  Since the infusion of grace takes place in an instant, it is the end of a continuous
movement, such as a meditation by which the will is disposed for the reception of grace; and the end of the same
movement is the forgiveness of guilt, for guilt is forgiven by the very fact that grace is infused.  In that first instant, then,
there is the end of the forgiveness of guilt, that is, the absence of guilt, and the end of the infusion of grace, that is, the
possession of grace.  Then in the whole preceding time that ends at this instant, by which the movement of the meditation
just mentioned was measured, the sinner had guilt and not grace, except only at the last instant, as we have said.  But
before the last instant of this time we cannot pick out another immediately next to it, because, if any instant at all other
than the last is taken, between it and the last there will be an infinite number of intervening instants. </P>

<P> 	Thus it is clear that we cannot distinguish a last instant in which the person justified would have guilt and not have
grace; but we can distinguish a first instant in which he has grace and does not have guilt.  This solution can be gathered
form the words of the Philosopher [<EM>Physics</EM>, VIII, 8; 263b9-264b7]. </P>
