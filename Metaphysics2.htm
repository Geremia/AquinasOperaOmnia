                                    fact that, while no one can attain an
                                    adequate knowledge of it, all men together

                                                        we agree but also to
                                                        those who until now have
                                                        spoken in a superficial
                                                        way; for they too have
                                                        made some contribution
                                                        because they have made
                                                        use of the habit which
                                                        we now exercise. Thus if
                                                        there had been no
                                                        Timotheus, we would not
                                                        have a great part of our
                                                        music; and if there had
                                                        been no Phrynis, there
                                                        would have been no
                                                        Timotheus. The same is
                                                        true of those who have

                                                        the truth; for we have
                                                        accepted certain
                                                        opinions from some of

                          opinions about the first principles of things, with
                          which first philosophy is chiefly concerned, the

                              Each of the particular sciences considers a

                              whereas first philosophy considers what is
                              universally true of things. Therefore, it pertains
                              to this science to consider in what respects man
                              is capable of knowing the truth.

                                  274. This part is divided into two sections.
                                  In th first (144: C 274) he deals with the
                                  things that belogn to a universal
                                  consideration of truth. In the second (176:C
                                  338) he begins to investigate what is true of
                                  first principles and of everything else with
                                  which this philosophy deals. He does this in
                                  Book III, which begins with the words “With a
                                  view to.”

                                      the truth. In the second (151: C 290) he
                                      indicates to what science the knowledge of
                                      truth principally belongs ("It is only
                                      right to call"). In the third (171: C 331)
                                      he explains the method by which truth is
                                      investigated (“The way in which people are

                                          things. First, he shows in what
                                          respect it is easy to know the truth.
                                          Second (149: C 279), he gives the
                                          reason for the difficulty involved
                                          (“However, since the difficulty is
                                          twofold”). Third (150: C 2876), he
                                          shows how men assist each other to
                                          know the truth (“"Now it is only
                                          right”).

                                151. It is only right to call philosophy the
                                science of truth. For the end of theoretical
                                knowledge is truth, whereas that of practical
                                knowledge is action; for even when practical men
                                investigate the way in which something exists,
                                they do not consider it in itself but in
                                relation to some particular thing and to the
                                present moment. But we know a truth only by
                                knowing its cause. Now anything which is the
                                basis of a univocal predication about other
                                things has that attribute in the highest degree.
                                Thus fire is hottest and is actually the cause
                                of heat in other things. Therefore that is also
                                true in the highest degree which is the cause of
                                all subsequent things being true. For this
                                reason the principles of things that always

                                because they are not sometimes true and
                                sometimes not true. Nor is there any cause of
                                their being, but they are the cause of the being
                                of other things. Therefore insofar as each thing
                                has being, to that extent it is true.

                                        152. Further, it is evident that there
                                        is a [first] principle, and that the
                                        causes of existing things are not
                                        infinite either in series or in species.
                                        For it is impossible that one thing
                                        should come from something else as from
                                        matter in an infinite regress, for
                                        example, flesh from earth, earth from
                                        air, air from fire, and so on to
                                        infinity. Nor can the causes from which
                                        motion originates proceed to infinity,
                                        as though man were moved by the air, the
                                        air by the sun, the sun by strife, and
                                        so on to infinity. Again, neither can
                                        there be an infinite regress in the case
                                        of the reason for which something is
                                        done, as though walking were for the
                                        sake of health, health for the sake of
                                        happiness, and happiness for the sake of
                                        something else, so that one thing is
                                        always being done for the sake of
                                        something else. The same is true in the
                                        case of the quiddity.

                                          290. He argues from the first of these
                                          to the first conclusion in this way.
                                          Theoretical, i.e., speculative,
                                          knowledge differs from practical
                                          knowledge by its end; for the end of
                                          speculative knowledge is truth,
                                          because it has knowledge of the truth
                                          as its objective. But the end of
                                          practical knowledge is action,
                                          because, even though “practical men,”
                                          i.e., men of action, attempt to
                                          understand the truth as it belongs to
                                          certain things, they do not seek this
                                          as an ultimate end; for they do not
                                          consider the cause of truth in and for
                                          itself as an end but in relation to
                                          action, either by applying it to some
                                          definite individual, or to some
                                          definite time. Therefore, if we add to
                                          the above the fact that wisdom or
                                          first philosophy is not practical but
                                          speculative, it follows that first
                                          philosophy is most fittingly called
                                          the science of truth.

                                              philosophia prima maxime
                                              consideret veritatem, propter id

                                              causarum. Et ideo argumentatur
                                              sic. Scientia de vero non habetur
                                              nisi per causam: ex quo apparet,
                                              quod eorum verorum, de quibus est
                                              scientia aliqua, sunt aliquae
                                              causae, quae etiam veritatem
                                              habent. Non enim potest sciri
                                              verum per falsum, sed per aliud
                                              verum. Unde et demonstratio, quae
                                              facit scientiam, ex veris est, ut

                                              291. But since there are many
                                              speculative sciences, which
                                              consider the truth, such as
                                              geometry and arithmetic, therefore
                                              it was necessary to show that
                                              first philosophy considers truth
                                              in the highest degree inasmuch as
                                              it has been shown above that it
                                              considers
                                              <b>first causes</b> (48). Hence he
                                              argues as follows. We have
                                              knowledge of truth only when we
                                              know a cause. This is apparent
                                              from the fact that the true things
                                              about which we have some knowledge
                                              have causes which are also true,
                                              because we cannot know what is
                                              true by knowing what is false, but
                                              only by knowing what is true. This
                                              is also the reason why
                                              demonstration, which causes
                                              science, begins with what is true,
                                              as is stated in Book I of the
                                              <i>Posterior Analytics</i>.

                                                  proposition. When a univocal
                                                  predicate is applied to
                                                  several things, in each case
                                                  that which constitutes the
                                                  reason for the predication
                                                  about other things has that
                                                  attribute in the fullest
                                                  sense. Thus fire is the cause
                                                  of heat in compounds.
                                                  Therefore, since heat is
                                                  predicated univocally both of
                                                  fire and of compound bodies,
                                                  it follows that fire is
                                                  hottest.

                                                      which these lower bodies
                                                      receive cannot be of the

                                by some first and last thing must have as their
                                cause the first member of the series, which they
                                follow; because if we had to say which one of
                                these three is the cause of the others, we would
                                say that it is the first. What is last is not
                                the cause, since what is last is not a cause of
                                anything. Neither is the intermediate the cause,
                                because it is the cause of only one; for it
                                makes no difference whether one or several

                                number. Indeed, in series that are infinite in
                                this way or in the infinite in general, all
                                parts are intermediates to the same degree right
                                down to the present one. Therefore, if there is
                                nothing first in the whole series, nothing in
                                the series is a cause.

                                            156. We say, then, that a man comes
                                            from a boy in the sense that what
                                            has come into being comes from what
                                            is coming into being, or in the
                                            sense that what has been completed
                                            comes from what is being completed.
                                            For generation is always midway
                                            between being and non-being, and
                                            thus whatever is coming into being
                                            is midway between what is and what
                                            is not. Now a learner is one who is
                                            becoming learned, and this is the

                                            man of science comes from the
                                            learner. But water comes from air in

                                                and thus a boy does not come
                                                from a man. The reason is that

                                                This is the way in which the day
                                                comes from the dawn, i.e., in

                          this. First (153:C 300, he proves that there are not

                          (170:C 330), that the classes of causes are not

                              of material causes (“Neither is it possible”);

                                  In regard to the first he proceeds as follows.
                                  First, he lays down this premise: in the case
                                  of all those things which lie between two
                                  extremes, one of which is last and the other
                                  first, the first is necessarily the cause of
                                  those which come after it, namely, what is
                                  intermediate and what is last.

                                      Et hanc propositionem manifestat per
                                      divisionem: quia, si oporteat nos dicere
                                      quid sit causa inter aliqua tria, quae

                                      est primum. Non enim possumus dicere id
                                      quod est ultimum, esse causam omnium, quia
                                      nullius est causa; alioquin non est

                                      302. Then he proves this premise by a
                                      process of elimination. For if we had to
                                      say which of the three, i.e., the first,
                                      the intermediate, or the last, is the
                                      cause of the others, we would have to say
                                      that the first is the cause. We could not
                                      say that what is last is the cause of all
                                      the others, because it is not a cause of
                                      anything; for in other respects what is
                                      last is not a cause, since an effect
                                      follows a cause. Nor could we say that the
                                      intermediate is the cause of all the
                                      others, because it is the cause of only
                                      one of them, namely, what is last.

                                          possunt esse prima causa movens. Et
                                          quia ante omnem secundam causam
                                          moventem requiritur prima causa
                                          movens, requiritur quod ante omnem

                                          nullo modo sit media, quasi habens
                                          aliam causam ante se. Sed, si

                                          is only one intermediate or several,
                                          because all intermediates are taken
                                          together as one insofar as they have
                                          in common the character of an
                                          intermediate. Nor again does it make
                                          any difference whether there are a
                                          finite or infinite number of
                                          intermediates, because so long as they
                                          have the nature of an intermediate
                                          they cannot be the first cause of
                                          motion. Further, since there must be a
                                          first cause of motion prior to every
                                          secondary cause of motion, then there
                                          must be a first cause prior to every
                                          intermediate cause, which is not an
                                          intermediate in any sense, as though
                                          it had a cause prior to itself. But if
                                          we were to hold that there is an
                                          infinite series of moving causes in
                                          the above way, then all causes would
                                          be intermediate ones. Thus we would
                                          have to say without qualification that
                                          all parts of any infinite thing,
                                          whether of a series of causes or of
                                          continuous quantities, are
                                          intermediate ones; for if there were a
                                          part that was not an intermediate one,
                                          it would have to be either a first or
                                          a last; and both of these are opposed
                                          to the nature of the infinite, which
                                          excludes every limit, whether it be a
                                          starting-point or a terminus.

                                              304. Now there is another point
                                              that must be noted, i.e., that if
                                              there are several intermediate
                                              parts in any finite thing, not all
                                              parts are intermediate to the same
                                              degree; for some are closer to
                                              what is first, and some to what is
                                              last. But in the case of some
                                              infinite thing in which there is
                                              neither a first nor last part, no
                                              part can be closer to or farther
                                              away from either what is first or
                                              what is last. Therefore all parts
                                              are intermediates to the same
                                              degree right down to the one you
                                              designate now. Consequently, if
                                              the causes of motion proceed to
                                              infinity in this way, there will
                                              be no first cause. But a first
                                              cause is the cause of all things.
                                              Therefore it will follow that all
                                              causes are eliminated; for when a
                                              cause is removed the things of
                                              which it is the cause are also
                                              removed.

                                                          agent is to proceed in

                                                          whereas to pass from

                          316. Having shown that there is no infinite regress
                          either among the causes of motion or among material
                          causes, the Philosopher now shows that the same thing
                          is true of the final cause, which is called “that for
                          the sake of which” something comes to be (160).

                              He proves this by four arguments. The first is as
                              follows. That for the sake of which something
                              comes to be has the character of an end. But an
                              end does not exist for the sake of other things,
                              but others exist for its sake. Now such a thing
                              either exists or not. If there is something of
                              such a kind that all things exist for its sake and
                              not it for the sake of something else, it will be
                              the last thing in this order; and thus there will
                              not be an infinite regress. However, if no such
                              thing exists, no end will exist; and thus the
                              class of cause called “that for the sake of which”
                              will be eliminated.

                                                      acts for the sake of some

                                what they hear depends upon the things to which
                                they are accustomed; for it is in terms of such
                                things that we judge statements to be true, and
                                anything over and above these does not seem
                                similar but less intelligible and more remote.
                                For it is the things to which we are accustomed
                                that are better known.

                                        also is it lacking in arguments.

                          331. Having shown that the study of truth is in one
                          sense difficult and in another easy, and that it
                          belongs preeminently to first philosophy, the

                          things. First (171:C 331), he gives the different
                          methods which men follow in the study of truth. Second
                          (335), he shows which method is the proper one (“For

                                      depends upon the things to which they are

                                          332. Now the reason for this is that
                                          things which are customary become
                                          natural. Hence a <b>habit</b>, which
                                          disposes us in a way similar to
                                          <b>nature</b>, is also acquired by
                                          customary activity. And from the fact
                                          that someone has some special sort of
                                          nature or special kind of habit, he
                                          has a definite relationship to one
                                          thing or another. But in every kind of
                                          cognition there must be a definite
                                          relationship between the knower and
                                          the object of cognition. Therefore, to
                                          the extent that natures and habits
                                          differ, there are diverse kinds of
                                          cognition. For we see that there are
                                          innate first principles in men because
                                          of their human nature, and that what
                                          is proper to some special virtue
                                          appears good to one who has this habit
                                          of virtue; and, again, that something
                                          appears palatable to the sense of
                                          taste because of its disposition.
                                          Therefore, since custom produces a
                                          habit which is similar to nature, it
                                          follows that what is customary is
                                          better known.

                                                              Then there are
                                                              others who do not

                                                              Again there are

                                                              This occurs
                                                              because of the
