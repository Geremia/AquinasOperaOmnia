          WHETHER THE SOUL CAN BE A FORM AND A PARTICULAR THING</b><br>

          [ <i>Summa theol</i> ., I, q.75, a.2; q.76, a.1; <i>Contra Gentiles</i> , II, chaps. 56, 57, 59, 68, 69, and 70; <i>De potentia</i> , q.3, a.9 and 11; <i>De spir. creat.</i> , a. 2; <i>Comm. in De anima</i> , Bk. II, lect. 4; Bk. III, lect. 7; <i>De unit. intell.</i> ]

          <td>In the first article we examine this question: Whether the human soul can be a form and a particular thing.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">

          <td><b>Objections</b>
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et videtur quod non. Si enim anima humana est hoc aliquid, est subsistens et habens per se esse completum. Quod autem advenit alicui post esse completum, advenit ei accidentaliter, ut albedo homini et vestimentum. Corpus igitur unitum animae advenit ei accidentaliter. Si ergo anima est hoc aliquid, non est forma substantialis corporis.
          <td>1. It seems that the human soul cannot be a form and a particular thing. For if the human soul is a particular thing, it is a subsisting thing having a complete act of existing ( <i>esse</i> ) in virtue of its own nature. Now whatever accrues to a thing over and above, its complete [substantial] existence, is an accident of that thing as whiteness and clothing are accidents of man. Therefore, when the body is united to the soul, it is united to it accidentally. Consequently, if the soul is a particular thing, it is not the substantial form of the body.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, si anima est hoc aliquid, oportet quod sit aliquid individuatum; nullum enim universalium est hoc aliquid. Aut igitur individuatur ex aliquo alio, aut ex se. Si ex alio, et est forma corporis, oportet quod individuetur ex corpore (nam formae individuantur ex propria materia); et sic sequitur quod remoto corpore tollitur individuatio animae; et sic anima non poterit esse per se subsistens, nec hoc aliquid. Si autem ex se individuatur, aut est forma simplex, aut est aliquid compositum ex materia et forma. Si est forma simplex sequitur quod anima individuata, ab alia differre non poterit nisi secundum formam. Differentia autem secundum formam facit diversitatem speciei. Sequitur igitur quod animae diversorum hominum sint specie differentes; unde et homines specie differrent si anima est forma corporis, cum unumquodque a propria forma speciem sortiatur. Si autem anima est composita ex materia et forma, impossibile est quod secundum se totam sit forma corporis, nam materia nullius est forma. Relinquitur igitur quod impossibile sit animam simul esse hoc aliquid et formam.
          <td>2. Further, if the soul is a particular thing, it must be an individuated thing, for a universal is not a particular thing. Now the soul is individuated either by something other than itself, or by itself. If the soul is individuated by something other than itself, and is the form of the body, it must be individuated by the body (for forms are individuated by their proper matter). And thus it follows that when the body is separated from the soul, the latter loses its individuation. In that case the soul could not subsist of itself nor be a particular thing. On the other hand, if the soul is individuated by itself, it is either a form in its entirety ( <i>simplex</i> ) or is something composed of matter and form. If it is a form in its entirety, it follows that one individuated soul could differ from another only according to form. But difference in form causes difference in species. Hence it would follow that the souls of different men are specifically diverse; and if the soul is the form of the body, men differ specifically among themselves, because each and every thing derives its species from its proper form. On the other hand, if the soul is composed of matter and form, it would be impossible for the soul as a whole to be the form of the body, for the matter of a thing never has the nature of a form. It follows, then, that the soul cannot be at once both a particular thing and a form.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, si anima est hoc aliquid sequitur quod sit individuum quoddam. Omne autem individuum est in aliqua specie et in aliquo genere. Relinquitur igitur quod anima habeat propriam speciem et proprium genus. Impossibile est autem quod aliquid propriam speciem habens recipiat superadditionem alterius ad speciei cuiusdam constitutionem; quia, ut philosophus dicit VIII Metaph., formae vel species rerum sunt sicut numeri; quibus quidquid subtrahitur vel additur, speciem variat. Materia autem et forma uniuntur ad speciei constitutionem. Si igitur anima est hoc aliquid, non unietur corpori ut forma materiae.
          <td>3. Further, if the soul is a particular thing, it follows that it is an individual. Now every individual belongs to a species and a genus. Consequently the soul will have a proper species and a proper genus. But a thing possessing its own species cannot have anything else super-added to it in order to give it its species, because, as the Philosopher, points out [Metaph., VIII, 3 (1043b 36)], the forms or species of things are like numbers whose species change if a unit is added or subtracted. Matter and form, however, are united in order to constitute a species. Therefore, if the soul is a particular thing, it is not united to the body as a form to matter.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, cum Deus res propter sui bonitatem fecerit, quae in diversis rerum gradibus manifestatur, tot gradus entium instituit, quot potuit natura pati. Si igitur anima humana potest per se subsistere, quod oportet dicere, si est hoc aliquid, sequeretur quod anima per se existens sit unus gradus entium. Formae autem non sunt unus gradus entium seorsum sine materiis. Igitur anima, si est hoc aliquid, non erit forma alicuius materiae.
          <td>4. Further, since God made things because of His goodness, which is manifested in the different grades of things, He instituted as many grades of beings as nature could admit. Hence, if the human soul can subsist in itself (which must be maintained if it is a particular thing), it would then constitute a distinct grade of being. But forms without matter do not themselves constitute a distinct grade of being. Thus, if the soul is a particular thing, it will not be the form of any matter.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, si anima est hoc aliquid, et per se subsistens, oportet quod sit incorruptibilis; cum neque contrarium habeat, neque ex contrariis composita sit. Si autem est incorruptibilis, non potest esse proportionata corpori corruptibili, quale est corpus humanum. Omnis autem forma est proportionata suae materiae. Igitur si anima est hoc aliquid, non erit forma corporis humani.
          <td>5. Further, if the soul is a particular thing, subsisting in itself, it must be incorruptible, for neither has it a contrary, nor is it composed of contraries . But if the soul is incorruptible, it cannot be proportioned to a corruptible body such as the human body is. Now every form is proportioned to its matter. So if the soul is a particular thing, it will not be the form of the human body.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, nihil subsistens est actus purus nisi Deus. Si igitur anima est hoc aliquid, utpote per se subsistens, erit in ea aliqua compositio actus et potentiae; et sic non poterit esse forma, quia potentia non est alicuius actus. Si igitur anima sit hoc aliquid non erit forma.
          <td>6. Further, the only subsisting being that is Pure Act, is God. Therefore, if the soul is a particular self-subsisting thing, it will be composed of act and potentiality, and thus will not be a form, because no potentiality is an act. Consequently, if the soul is a particular thing, it will not be a form.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, si anima est hoc aliquid potens per se subsistere, non oportet quod corpori uniatur nisi propter aliquod bonum ipsius. Aut igitur propter aliquod bonum essentiale, aut propter bonum accidentale. Propter bonum essentiale non, quia sine corpore potest subsistere; neque etiam propter bonum accidentale, quod praecipue videtur esse cognitio veritatis quam anima humana per sensus accipit, qui sine organis corporis esse non possunt. Sed animae puerorum antequam nascantur morientium, dicuntur a quibusdam perfectam cognitionem rerum habere, quam tamen constat quod per sensum non acquisierunt. Si igitur anima est hoc aliquid, nulla ratio est quare corpori uniatur ut forma.
          <td>7. Further, if the soul is a particular thing capable of subsisting in itself, it would need to be united to a body only for a good accruing to the soul, either for an essential good or an accidental one. Not for an essential good, however, because it can subsist without the body. Nor even for an accidental good; for the knowledge of truth which the human soul can acquire through the senses (themselves incapable of existing without bodily organs) is evidently a pre-eminent good of this sort; but some hold that the souls of still-born infants have a perfect knowledge of things, and these certainly never acquired that knowledge through their senses. Consequently, if the soul is a particular thing, there is no reason why it should be united as a form to the body.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, forma et hoc aliquid ex opposito dividuntur; dicit enim philosophus in II de anima, quod substantia dividitur in tria: quorum unum est forma, aliud materia et tertium quod est hoc aliquid. Opposita autem non dicuntur de eodem. Ergo anima humana non potest esse forma et hoc aliquid.
          <td>8. Further, a form and a particular thing are distinguished from each other as opposites; for the Philosopher says in the <i>De anima</i> [III, 2 (414a 15)], that substance has a threefold division: the first is form, the second, matter, and the third, this particular thing. But opposites are not predicated of one and the same thing. Therefore the human soul cannot be a form and a particular thing.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, id quod est hoc aliquid per se subsistit. Formae autem proprium est quod sit in alio, quae videntur esse opposita. Si igitur anima est hoc aliquid, non videtur quod sit forma.
          <td>9. Further, it belongs to the very essence of a particular thing to subsist of itself. But it is proper to a form to exist in something else. These seem to be contradictory. Consequently, if the soul is a particular thing, it is apparently not a form.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed dicebat quod corrupto corpore anima remanet hoc aliquid et per se subsistens, sed tunc perit in ea ratio formae. —Sed contra, omne quod potest abscedere ab aliquo, manente substantia eius, inest ei accidentaliter. Si igitur anima remanente post corpus, perit in ea ratio formae, sequitur quod ratio formae conveniat ei accidentaliter. Sed non unitur corpori ad constitutionem hominis nisi prout est forma. Ergo unitur corpori accidentaliter, et per consequens homo erit ens per accidens; quod est inconveniens.
          <td>10. But it might be said that when the body corrupts, the soul still remains a particular self-subsisting thing, but then loses the nature of a form. On the other hand, whatever can exist apart from a thing and retain the nature of a substance, exists in that thing accidentally. Therefore, if the soul continues to exist after the body corrupts, the soul ceases to have the character of a form; and thus the nature of a form belongs to it only accidentally. But it is only as a form that the soul is united to the body in order to constitute a man. Hence the soul is united to the body accidentally, and thus man will be a being <i>per accidens</i> . This is incongruous.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, si anima humana est hoc aliquid et per se existens, oportet quod per se habeat aliquam propriam operationem; quia uniuscuiusque rei per se existentis est aliqua propria operatio. Sed anima humana non habet aliquam propriam operationem; quia ipsum intelligere, quod maxime videtur esse eius proprium, non est animae, sed hominis per animam, ut dicitur in I de anima. Ergo anima humana non est hoc aliquid.
          <td>11. Further, if the human soul is a particular self-subsisting thing, it must have an operation of its own, because a thing that exists of itself has its own proper operation. But the human soul does not have its own proper operation, because the act of intellection itself, which seems to be proper above all to the soul, is not an activity of the soul, but that of a man through his soul, as is stated in the <i>De anima</i> [I, 4 (408a 14)]. Therefore the human soul is not a particular thing.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, si anima humana est forma corporis, oportet quod habeat aliquam dependentiam ad corpus; forma enim et materia a se invicem dependent. Sed quod dependet ex aliquo, non est hoc aliquid. Si igitur anima est forma corporis, non erit hoc aliquid.
          <td>12. Further, if the human soul is the form of the body, it must depend in some way on the body, for form and matter depend on each other. But whatever depends on something else [in this way] is not a particular thing. Therefore, if the soul is the form of the body, it will not be a particular thing.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, si anima est forma corporis, oportet quod animae et corporis sit unum esse: nam ex materia et forma fit unum secundum esse. Sed animae et corporis non potest esse unum esse, cum sint diversorum generum; anima enim est in genere substantiae incorporeae, corpus vero in genere substantiae corporeae. Anima igitur non potest esse forma corporis.
          <td>13. Further, if the soul is the form of the body, there must be one act of existing ( <i>esse</i> ) common to the soul and the body; because from the union of matter and form there results a thing having one act of existing. But there cannot be one act of existing common to the soul and the body, since they are generically diverse; for the soul belongs to the genus of incorporeal substance, and the body to that of corporeal substance. Hence the soul cannot be the form of the body.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, esse corporis est esse corruptibile, et ex partibus quantitativis resultans; esse autem animae est incorruptibile et simplex. Ergo corporis et animae non est unum esse.
          <td>14. Further, the body’s act of existing is a corruptible one resulting from quantitative parts. The soul’s act of existing, on the other hand, is incorruptible and simple. Therefore there is not one act of existing possessed in common by the body and the soul.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed dicebat quod corpus humanum ipsum esse corporis habet per animam. —Sed contra, philosophus dicit in II de anima, quod anima est actus corporis physici organici. Hoc igitur quod comparatur ad animam ut materia ad actum, est iam corpus physicum organicum: quod non potest esse nisi per aliquam formam, qua constituatur in genere corporis. Habet igitur corpus humanum suum esse praeter esse animae.
          <td>15. But it might be said that the human body itself has the act of existing of a body through the soul. On the contrary, the Philosopher says [Ibid., II, 1 (412b 5)] that the soul is the act of a physical organic body. Therefore that entity which is related to the soul as matter to act, is now a physical organic body; and this body can exist only through a form whereby it is placed in the genus of body. Consequently the human body possesses its own act of existing distinct from that of the soul.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, principia essentialia, quae sunt materia et forma, ordinantur ad esse. Sed ad illud quod potest haberi in natura ab uno, non requiruntur duo. Si igitur anima, cum sit hoc aliquid, habet in se proprium esse, non adiungetur ei secundum naturam corpus, nisi ut materia formae.
          <td>16. Further, the essential principles of matter and form are ordered to the act of existing (esse). But whatever can be brought about in nature by one principle, does not require two. Therefore, if the soul has in itself its own act of existing because it is a particular thing, then the body by nature is united to the soul only as a matter to a form.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, esse comparatur ad substantiam animae ut actus eius, et sic oportet quod sit supremum in anima. Inferius autem non contingit id quod est superius secundum supremum in eo, sed magis secundum infimum; dicit enim Dionysius, quod divina sapientia coniungit fines primorum principiis secundorum. Corpus igitur, quod est inferius anima, non pertingit ad esse quod est supremum in ipsa.
          <td>17. Further, the act of existing is related to the substance of the soul as its act. Hence the act of existing must be supreme in the soul. But an inferior being is not related to a superior one with respect to that which is supreme in the superior, but rather with respect to that which is lowest in it. For Dionysius says [De divinis nominibus, VII, 2] that divine wisdom joins that which is highest ( <i>fines</i> ) in primary things [i.e., those having less perfection] to that which is lowest ( <i>principiis</i> ) in secondary ones [i.e., those having greater perfection]. Therefore the body, which is inferior to the soul, does not attain to that act of existing which is supreme in the soul.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, quorum est unum esse, et una operatio. Si igitur esse animae humanae coniunctae corpori sit commune corpori; et operatio eius, quae est intelligere, erit communis animae et corpori; quod est impossibile, ut probatur in III de anima. Non est igitur unum esse animae humanae et corporis; unde sequitur quod anima non sit forma corporis et hoc aliquid.
          <td>18. Further, things having one and the same act of existing, have one and the same operation. Therefore, if the act of existing of the human soul, when joined to the body, belongs also to the body, the act of understanding, which is the operation of the soul, will belong both to the soul and the body. This is impossible, as is proved in the <i>De anima</i> [, 4 (429a 18)]. Consequently there is not one act of existing for both the human soul and the body. Hence it follows that the soul is not the form of the body and a particular thing.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed contra. Unumquodque sortitur speciem per propriam formam. Sed homo est homo in quantum est rationalis. Ergo anima rationalis est propria forma hominis.

Dicit enim philosophus in praedicamentis, quod primae substantiae indubitanter hoc aliquid significant; secundae vero substantiae, etsi videantur hoc aliquid significare, magis tamen significant quale quid. Individuum autem in genere substantiae non solum habet quod per se possit subsistere, sed quod sit aliquid completum in aliqua specie et genere substantiae; unde philosophus etiam in praedicamentis, manum et pedem et huiusmodi nominat partes substantiarum magis quam substantias primas vel secundas: quia, licet non sint in alio sicut in subiecto (quod proprie substantiae est), non tamen participant complete naturam alicuius speciei; unde non sunt in aliqua specie neque in aliquo genere, nisi per reductionem.
          <td><b>I answer:</b> “A particular thing,” properly speaking, designates an individual in the genus of substance. For the Philosopher says, in the <i>Categories</i> [V, 2a 10], that first substances undoubtedly signify particular things; second substances, indeed, although they seem to signify particular things, rather signify the specific essence ( <i>quale quid</i> ). Furthermore, an individual in the genus of substance is capable not only of subsisting of itself, but is also a complete entity belonging to a definite species and genus of substance. Wherefore the Philosopher, in the <i>Categories</i> [V, 3a 28], also calls a hand and a foot, and things of this sort, parts of substances rather than first or second substances. For although they do not exist in another as a subject (which is characteristic of a substance), they still do not possess completely the nature of a species. Hence they belong to a species or to a genus only by reduction.

          <td>But this position is untenable as regards the vegetal soul, whose operations necessarily require some principle surpassing the active and passive qualities [of the elements] which play only an instrumental role in nutrition and growth, as is proved in the <i>De anima</i> [II, 4. 415b 28]. Moreover, a combination and a harmony do not transcend the elemental qualities. This position is likewise untenable as regards the sentient soul, whose operations consist in receiving species separated from matter, as is shown in the <i>De anima</i> [II, 12, 424a 16]. For inasmuch as active and passive qualities are dispositions of matter, they do not transcend matter. Again, this position is even less tenable as regards the rational soul, whose operation consists in understanding, and in abstracting species not only from matter, but from all individuating conditions, this being required for the understanding of universals. However, in the case of the rational soul something of special importance must still be considered, because not only does it receive intelligible species without matter and material conditions, but it is also quite impossible for it, in performing its proper operation, to have anything in common with a bodily organ, as though something corporeal might be an organ of understanding, just as the eye is the organ of sight, as is proved in the <i>De anima</i> [III, 4, 429a 24]. Thus the intellective soul, inasmuch as it performs its proper operation without communicating in any way with the body, must act of itself. And because a thing acts so far as it is actual, the intellective soul must have a complete act of existing in itself, depending in no way on the body. For forms whose act of existing depends on matter or on a subject do not operate of themselves. Heat, for instance, does not act, but something hot.

          <td>For this reason the later Greek philosophers came to the conclusion that the intellective part of the soul is a self-subsisting thing. For the Philosopher says, in the <i>De anima</i> [III, 5, 430a 24], that the intellect is a substance, and is not corrupted. The teaching of Plato [Phaedrus, 24] who maintains that the soul is incorruptible and subsists of itself in view of the fact that it moves itself, amounts to the same thing. For he took “motion” in a broad sense to signify every operation; hence he understands that the soul moves itself because it moves itself by itself.

          <td>Sed ulterius posuit Plato, quod anima humana non solum per se subsisteret, sed quod etiam haberet in se completam naturam speciei.

Manifestum est enim id quo vivit corpus, animam esse, vivere autem est esse viventium: anima igitur est quo corpus humanum habet esse actu. Huiusmodi autem forma est. Est igitur anima humana corporis forma. Ita si anima esset in corpore sicut nauta in navi, non daret speciem corpori, neque partibus eius; cuius contrarium apparet ex hoc quod recedente anima, singulae partes non retinent pristinum nomen nisi aequivoce. Dicitur enim oculus mortui aequivoce oculus, sicut pictus aut lapideus; et simile est de aliis partibus. Et praeterea, si anima esset in corpore sicut nauta in navi, sequeretur quod unio animae et corporis esset accidentalis. Mors igitur, quae inducit eorum separationem, non esset corruptio substantialis; quod patet esse falsum. Relinquitur igitur quod anima est hoc aliquid, ut per se potens subsistere; non quasi habens in se completam speciem, sed quasi perficiens speciem humanam ut forma corporis; et similiter est forma et hoc aliquid.
          <td>But elsewhere [Alcibiades, 25-26] Plato maintained that the human soul not only subsisted of itself, but also had the complete nature of a species. For he held that the complete nature of the [human] species is found in the soul, saying that a man is not a composite of soul and body, but a soul joined to a body in such a way that it is related to the body as a pilot is to a ship, or as one clothed to his clothing. However, this position is untenable, because it is obvious that the soul is the reality which gives life to the body. Moreover, vital activity ( <i>vivere</i> ) is the act of existing (esse) of living things. Consequently the soul is that, which gives the human body its act of existing. Now a form is of this nature. Therefore the human soul is the form of the body. But if the soul were, in the body as a pilot is in, a ship, it would give neither the body nor its parts their specific nature. The contrary of this is seen to be true, because, when the soul leaves the body, the body’s individual parts retain their original names only in an equivocal sense. For the eye of a dead man, like the eye of a portrait or that of a statue, is called an eye equivocally; and similarly for the other parts of the body. Furthermore, if the soul were in the body as a pilot in a ship, it would follow that the union of soul and body would be an accidental one. Then death, which brings about their separation, would not be a substantial corruption; which is clearly false. So it follows that the soul is a particular thing and that it can subsist of itself, not as a thing having a complete species of its own, but as completing the human species by being the form of the body. Hence it likewise follows that it is both a form and a particular thing.

Super has autem sunt formae mixtorum corporum, quae praeter praedictas operationes, habent aliquam operationem consequentem speciem, quam sortiuntur ex corporibus caelestibus; sicut quod adamas attrahit ferrum, non propter calorem aut frigus aut aliquid huiusmodi, sed ex quadam participatione virtutis caelestis.

In hoc tamen ab eis differunt, quod intellectus animae humanae habent naturam acquirendi cognitionem immaterialem ex cognitione materialium, quae est per sensum.
          <td>Indeed, this can be shown from the order of natural forms. For we find among the forms of lower bodies that the higher a form is, the more it resembles and approaches higher principles. This can be seen from the proper operation of forms. For the forms of the elements, being lowest [in the order of forms] and nearest to matter, possess no operation surpassing their active and passive qualities, such as rarefaction and condensation, and the like, which appear to be material dispositions. Over and above these forms are those of the mixed bodies and these forms have (in addition to the above mentioned operations) a certain activity, consequent upon their species, which they receive from the celestial bodies. The magnet, for instance, attracts iron not because of its heat or its cold or anything of this sort, but because it shares in the powers of the heavens. Again, surpassing these forms are the souls of plants, which resemble not only the forms of earthly bodies but also the movers of the celestial bodies inasmuch as they are principles of a certain motion, themselves being moved. Still higher are brute beasts’ forms, which now resemble a substance moving a celestial body not only because of the operation whereby they move bodies but also because they are capable of knowledge, although their knowledge is concerned merely with material things and belongs to the material order (for which reason they require bodily organs). Again, over and above these forms, and in the highest place, are human souls, which certainly resemble superior substances with respect to the kind of knowledge they possess, because they are capable of knowing immaterial things by their act of intellection. However, human souls differ from superior substances inasmuch as the human soul’s intellective power, by its very nature, must acquire its immaterial knowledge from the knowledge of material things attained through the senses.

          <td>Consequently the human soul’s mode of existing can be known from its operation. For, inasmuch as the human soul has an operation transcending the material order, its act of existing transcends the body and does not depend on the body. Indeed, inasmuch as the soul is naturally capable of acquiring immaterial knowledge from material things, evidently its species can be complete only when it is united to a body. For a thing’s species is complete only if it has the things necessary for the proper operation of its species. Consequently, if the human soul, inasmuch as it is united as a form to the body, has an act of existing which transcends the body and does not depend on it, obviously the soul itself is established on the boundary line dividing corporeal from separate substances.

          <td>1. Although the soul has a complete act of existing of its own, it does not follow that the body is united to it accidentally: first, because the same act of existing that belongs to the soul is conferred on the body by the soul so that there is one act of existing for the whole composite; secondly, because, while the soul can subsist of itself, it does not have a complete species, for the soul needs the body in order to complete its species.

Therefore, although the soul receives its act of existing from God as from an active principle, and exists in the body as in matter, nevertheless the soul’s act, of existing does not cease when the body corrupts, nor does the soul’s individuation cease when the body corrupts, even though it has a relationship to the body.

However, as regards its capacity for existing the soul need not be on a par with the body, because the human soul is not a form totally embraced by matter. This is evident from the fact that one of the soul’s operations transcends matter. However, another explanation can be given in accordance with the position of faith, namely, that in the beginning the human body was in some way created incorruptible and incurred the necessity of dying through sin, from which necessity it will be freed once again at the resurrection. Hence it is accidental that the body does not share in the incorruptibility of the soul.

          <td>Et videtur quod sic. Dicit enim philosophus in III de anima quod sensitivum non sine corpore est; intellectus autem est separatus. Intellectus autem est anima humana. Ergo anima humana est secundum esse a corpore separata.
          <td>1. It seems that it is. For the Philosopher says in the <i>De anima</i> [III, 4, 429b 4] that no sentient power exists without a body. But the intellect is separate and the intellect is the human soul. Therefore the human soul, so far as its act of existing is concerned, is separated from the body.

          <td>Praeterea, anima est actus corporis physici organici, in quantum corpus est organum eius. Si igitur intellectus unitur secundum esse corpori ut forma, oportet quod corpus sit organum eius; quod est impossibile, ut probat philosophus in III de anima.
          <td>2. Further, the soul is the act of a physical organic body inasmuch as the body is its organ. Hence, if the intellect, with respect to its very act of existing, is united as a form to the body, the body must be its organ. This is impossible, as the Philosopher proves in the <i>De anima</i> [ibid.].
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, maior est concretio formae ad materiam quam virtutis ad organum. Sed intellectus propter sui simplicitatem non potest esse concretus corpori sicut virtus organo. Ergo multo minus potest ei uniri sicut forma ad materiam.
          <td>3. Further, a form is united to matter more intimately than a power is to an organ. But the intellect cannot be united to the body as a power is to an organ, because the intellect is simple.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed dicebat quod intellectus, id est potentia intellectiva, non habet organum; sed ipsa essentia animae intellectivae unitur corpori ut forma. —Sed contra, effectus non est simplicior sua causa. Sed potentia animae est effectus essentiae eius, quia omnes potentiae fluunt ab esse eius. Nulla ergo potentia animae est simplicior esse animae. Si ergo intellectus non potest esse actus corporis, ut probatur in III de anima, neque anima intellectiva poterit uniri corpori ut forma.
          <td>4. But it might be said that the intellect, that is, the intellective power, does not have an organ, but that the essence itself of the intellective soul is united as a form to the body. On the other hand, no effect is simpler than its cause. Now a power of the soul is an effect of its essence, because all powers of the soul flow from its essence ( <i>esse</i> ). Consequently no power of the soul is simpler than its essence. If, then, the intellect cannot be the act of the body, as is proved in the <i>De anima</i> [III. 4, 420a 24; 420b 4] neither can the intellective soul be united as a form to the body.

          <td>5. Further, every form united to matter is individuated by matter. Therefore, if the intellective soul is united to the body as the form of the latter, the soul must be an individuated [form]. Then the forms received in the soul are individuated forms. Consequently the intellective soul will be incapable of knowing universals; which is clearly false.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, forma universalis non habet quod sit intellectiva a re quae est extra animam; quia omnes formae quae sunt in rebus extra animam, sunt individuatae. Si igitur formae intellectus sint universales, oportet quod hoc habeant ab anima intellectiva. Non ergo anima intellectiva est forma individuata; et ita non unitur corpori secundum esse.
          <td>6. Further, a universal form does not acquire its universality from the thing existing outside the soul, because all forms existing in such things are individuated. Thus, if the forms in the intellect are universal, they must acquire this universality from the intellective soul. Consequently the intellective soul is not an individuated form, and therefore is not united to the body so far as its act of existing is concerned.

Quanto enim aliquid est calidum, tantum calefacit. Si igitur species rerum quae sunt in anima intellectiva sunt individuatae ex ea parte qua inhaerent animae, cognitio quae sequitur erit individualis tantum, et non universalis.
          <td>7. However, it might be said that inasmuch as intelligible forms inhere in the soul they are individuated; but as the likenesses of things they are universals representing things according to their common nature and not according to their individuating principles. On the contrary, since a form is a principle of operation, an operation proceeds from a form in accordance with the manner in which that form inheres in a subject. For instance, the hotter something is, the more it is capable of heating. Therefore, if the species of things in the intellective soul are individuated because they inhere in the soul, then the knowledge which results will be knowledge only of the individual [as such] and will not be universal.

Cum ergo pars intellectiva non uniatur corpori nisi mediante nutritivo et sensitivo, ex quo nutritivum et sensitivum non sunt actu in intellectivo, intellectiva pars animae non erit corpori unita.
          <td>8. Further, the Philosopher says in the <i>De anima</i> [II, 3, 414b 27], that just as the triangle is contained in the quadrilateral and the quadrilateral in the pentagon, so also is the nutritive part of the soul contained in the sentient part and the sentient in turn contained in the intellective. However, the triangle is not contained actually in the quadrilateral, but only potentially; nor is the quadrilateral contained actually in the pentagon. Therefore, neither is the nutritive nor sentient part of the soul contained, actually in the intellective. Consequently, since the intellective part of the soul is united to the body only through the intermediary of the nutritive and sentient parts, because the sentient and nutritive parts of the soul are not actually contained in the intellective part, the intellective part of the soul will not be united to the body.

          <td>9. Further, the Philosopher says in the <i>De generatione animalium</i> [II, 3, 736b 2] that a man is not at once both an animal and a man, but first is an animal and then a man. Consequently the principle whereby he is an animal and that whereby he is a man are not one and the same. But he is an animal because of his sentient part and a man because of his intellective part. Therefore the sentient and intellective parts are not united in one and the same substance of the soul. Hence the conclusion is the same as the foregoing.

          <td>12. Further, every form united to matter is given actual existence by moving and changing matter. But the intellective soul is not given actual existence [by being educed] from the potentiality of matter, but receives its act of existing from an extrinsic agent, as the Philosopher says in the <i>De generatione animalium</i> [ibid., 736b 27]. Therefore the soul is not a form united to matter.

But the body is the greatest obstacle to the intellective soul in acquiring knowledge of truth, in which its perfection consists, according to that text in the Book of Wisdom: “The body which is corrupted, weighs down upon the soul” (Wis. 9:15). Therefore God did not unite the intellective soul to the body.

Further, the Philosopher proves in the <i>De anima</i> [III, 4, 429a 18] that, if the possible intellect had a bodily organ, it would have a certain determinate sensible nature, and thus could not receive and know all sensible forms. But a form is united to matter more intimately than a power is to an organ. Therefore, if the intellect is united as a form to the body, it will have a certain determinate sensible nature, and thus will be incapable of perceiving and knowing all sensible forms.

Therefore every form united to matter exists in matter according to the mode of matter.

          <td>Respondeo. Ad evidentiam huius quaestionis considerandum est, quod ubicumque invenitur aliquid quandoque in potentia, quandoque in actu, oportet esse aliquod principium per quod res illa sit in potentia: sicut homo quandoque est sentiens actu, et quandoque in potentia; et propter hoc in homine oportet ponere principium sensitivum, quod sit in potentia ad sensibilia: si enim esset semper sentiens actu, formae sensibilium inessent semper actu principio sentiendi. Similiter cum homo inveniatur quandoque intelligens actu, quandoque intelligens in potentia tantum; oportet in homine considerare aliquod intellectivum principium, quod sit in potentia ad intelligibilia. Et hoc principium nominat philosophus in III de anima intellectum possibilem. Hunc igitur intellectum possibilem necesse est esse in potentia ad omnia quae sunt intelligibilia per hominem, et receptivum eorum, et per consequens denudatum ab his: quia omne quod est receptivum aliquorum, et in potentia ad ea, quantum de se est, est denudatum ab eis; sicut pupilla, quae est receptiva omnium colorum, caret omni colore. Homo autem natus est intelligere formas omnium sensibilium rerum. Oportet igitur intellectum possibilem esse denudatum, quantum in se est, ab omnibus sensibilibus formis et naturis; et ita oportet quod non habeat aliquod organum corporeum. Si enim haberet aliquod organum corporeum, determinaretur ad aliquam naturam sensibilem, sicut potentia visiva determinatur ad naturam oculi. Per hanc philosophi demonstrationem excluditur positio philosophorum antiquorum, qui ponebant intellectum non differre a potentiis sensitivis; vel quicumque alii posuerunt principium quo intelligit homo, esse aliquam formam vel virtutem permixtam corpori, sicut aliae formae aut virtutes materiales.
          <td><b>I answer:</b> In order to settle this issue we must take into consideration that, whenever a thing is found to be sometimes in potency and sometimes in act, there must be some principle by which it is in potency; just as a man is sometimes actually sensing and sometimes only potentially. Now on account of this it is necessary to maintain that in man there exists a sentient principle which is in potency to sensible things; for if he were always actually sensing, the forms of sensible things would always actually exist in his sentient principle. Similarly, since a man is found sometimes to be actually understanding and sometimes only potentially, it is necessary to maintain that in man there exists an intellective power which is in potency to intelligibles; and the Philosopher, in the <i>De anima</i> [III, 5, 430a 15], calls this principle the possible intellect. Consequently this possible intellect must be in potency to all things intelligible to man; it must be capable of receiving them and therefore must be devoid of them, because anything capable of receiving other things is in potency to them inasmuch as it lacks them; just as the pupil of the eye, which is capable of receiving all colors, lacks every color. Now man is determined by nature to understand the forms of all sensible things. Therefore, by its very nature the possible intellect must be devoid of all sensible forms and natures, and so also must have no bodily organ. For if it had a bodily organ, it would be limited to some sensible nature, just as the power of vision is limited to the nature of the eye. By means of this proof we exclude the position of the ancient philosophers, who held that the intellect did not differ from the sentient powers, as well as the position of those who maintained that the principle by which a man understands is a certain form or power which is united to the body as other material forms or powers are.

Non enim inquirimus de intellectu possibili nisi secundum quod per eum intelligit homo: sic enim Aristoteles in eius notitiam devenit.

Si autem intellectus possibilis esset substantia separata, impossibile esset quod eo intelligeret homo: non enim est possibile, si aliqua substantia operatur aliquam operationem, quod illa operatio sit alterius substantiae ab ea diversa. Licet enim duarum substantiarum diversarum una possit alteri esse causa operandi ut principale agens instrumento, tamen actio principalis agentis non est actio instrumenti eadem secundum numerum, cum actio principalis agentis sit in movendo instrumentum; actio vero instrumenti in moveri a principali agente, et movere aliquid alterum. Sic igitur, si intellectus possibilis sit substantia separata secundum esse ab hoc homine sive ab illo homine; impossibile est quod intelligere intellectus possibilis sit huius hominis vel illius. Unde cum ista operatio quae est intelligere, non attribuatur alii principio in homine nisi intellectui possibili; sequitur quod nullus homo aliquid intelligat. Unde idem modus disputandi est contra hanc positionem, et contra negantes principia, ut patet per disputationem Aristotelis contra eos in IV Metaph.
          <td>But certain other men avoiding this position, fall into the opposite error. For they think that the possible intellect is devoid of every sensible nature and that it is not present in the body, because it is a certain substance which exists in separation from the body and is in potency to all intelligible forms. But this position cannot be maintained, because we acquire our knowledge of the possible intellect only so far as a man understands by it. Indeed, this is the way Aristotle obtains his knowledge of it, as is evident from what he says in the <i>De anima</i> [III, 4, 429a 10] when he begins to discuss the possible intellect: “Concerning that part of the soul by which the soul knows and perceives... it must be considered...”; and in another place he says: “I speak of the possible intellect by which the soul understands.” But if the possible intellect were a separate substance, it would be impossible for a man to understand by means of it; because, if a substance performs an operation, that operation cannot belong to any other substance than the one performing it. For although one of two substances can be the cause of the other’s operation, as the principal agent is the cause of the activity of the instrument, nevertheless the action of the principal agent is not numerically the same as that of the instrument. For the action of the principal agent consists in moving the instrument, whereas that of the instrument consists in being moved by the principal agent and in moving something else. Consequently, if the possible intellect is a substance existing apart from this or that particular man, it is impossible for the possible intellect’s act of intellection to be the act of any particular man. From this it follows that no man understands anything, because the act of intellection is not attributed to any principle in man except the possible intellect. Hence the same manner of arguing is opposed to this position and to those who deny its principles, as is evident from Aristotle’s arguments against them in the <i>Metaphysics</i> [IV, 3, 1005b 25].

Thus an intelligible species has two subjects: one in which it exists with an intelligible mode of existing, and this is the possible intellect: another in which it exists with a real mode of existing, and this subject is the phantasms. Therefore [according to Averroes] there is a certain union of the possible intellect with the phantasms inasmuch as an intelligible species exists in a certain manner in each of these subjects; and a man understands through the [supposedly separate] possible intellect as a result of this union with the phantasms.

          <td>However, this union is still not sufficient [to account for man’s knowledge], for a thing is capable of knowing, not because intelligible species are present to it, but because it possesses a cognitive power. Now evidently, from what has been said, intelligible species alone will be present to man, whereas the power of understanding, that is, the possible intellect,. exists in complete separation from him. Therefore it does not follow from the aforesaid union that a man will have what is necessary for understanding, but only that a species or something in that intellect will be understood. This clearly appears to be the case from the simile introduced above. For if phantasms are related to the intellect as colors are to sight, the union of the [supposedly separate] possible intellect with us through our phantasms, will be the same as that of sight with a wall through its colors. Now it does not follow that a wall sees because it has colors, but only that it is seen. Nor, similarly, does it follow that a man will understand because phantasms are present within him, but only that he will be understood.

Consequently it is evident on the side of our human nature that the above-mentioned position is impossible. This is also apparent from the nature of separate substances. Since these are most perfect, it is impossible for them in their own operations to stand in need of the operations of material things; nor need they be in potency to any things of this kind, for not even the celestial bodies, which are below the separate substances, require things of this sort. Hence, since the possible intellect is in potency to the species of sensible things, and since its operation may not be completed without phantasms, which depend on our operations, it is impossible and inconceivable for the possible intellect to be one of the separate substances.

And so far as the soul transcends corporeal matter, the potentiality for intelligibles exists in the soul and this [potentiality] belongs to the possible intellect. Certainly the soul, so far as it is united to the body, has operations and powers in common with the body; such, for example, are the powers of the nutritive and sentient part. Thus the nature of the possible intellect is as Aristotle proves it to be,110 for the possible intellect is not a power rooted in any bodily organ. However, a man understands formally by means of it inasmuch as it is rooted in the essence of the human soul, which is the form of man.

Principium enim quo intelligimus, esset intellectus possibilis simul cum suo organo; sicut principium quo videmus, scilicet visus, simul est cum pupilla. Sed si anima humana est forma corporis, et intellectus possibilis est quaedam virtus eius, non sequitur quod intellectus possibilis determinetur ad aliquam naturam sensibilem; quia anima humana excedit corporis proportionem, ut dictum est.
          <td>3. The organ of a power is the principle of that power’s operation. Hence, if the possible intellect were united to an organ, its operation would also be the operation of that organ, and thus it would be impossible for the principle by which we understand, to lack every sensible nature. For this principle by which we understand would then be the possible intellect together with its organ, just as the principle whereby we see, namely, the power of vision, exists concurrently with the pupil of the eye. However, even though the human soul is the form of the body and the possible intellect is one of the soul’s powers, it. does not follow that the possible intellect is limited to some sensible nature; because the human soul transcends the capacity ( <i>proportionem</i> ) of the body, as we have explained.

Sed hoc non prohibet eas esse intellectas in actu: ex hoc enim aliquid est intellectum in actu quod est immateriale, non autem ex hoc quod est universale; sed magis universale habet quod sit intelligibile per hoc quod est abstractum a principiis materialibus individuantibus.— Manifestum est autem substantias separatas esse intelligibiles actu, et tamen individua quaedam sunt; sicut Aristoteles dicit in VII Metaph., quod formae separatae, quas Plato ponebat, individua quaedam erant. Unde manifestum est quod si individuatio repugnaret intelligibilitati, eadem difficultas remaneret ponentibus intellectum possibilem substantiam separatam: sic enim et intellectus possibilis individuus esset individuans species in se receptas. Sciendum igitur, quod quamvis species receptae in intellectu possibili sint individuatae ex illa parte qua inhaerent intellectui possibili; tamen in eis, in quantum sunt immateriales, cognoscitur universale quod concipitur per abstractionem a principiis individuantibus. Universalia enim, de quibus sunt scientiae, sunt quae cognoscuntur per species intelligibiles, non ipsae species intelligibiles; de quibus planum est quod non sunt scientiae omnes, sed sola physica et metaphysica. Species enim intelligibilis est quo intellectus intelligit, non id quod intelligit, nisi per reflexionem, in quantum intelligit se intelligere id quod intelligit.
          <td>5. The human soul is an individuated form and so also is its power which is called the possible intellect, as well as the intelligible forms which are received in the possible intellect. But this does not prevent these forms from being actually known, for a thing is actually known because it is immaterial, not because it is universal. Indeed, the universal is intelligible because it is abstracted from material individuating conditions. Moreover, it is evident that separate substances are actual intelligibles and yet are certain individual entities; just as Aristotle says in the <i>Metaphysics</i> [VII, 14, 1039a 23], that the separated forms which Plato claimed to exist, were individual things. Therefore if individuation is incompatible with intelligibility it is evident that the same difficulty remains when the intellect is considered to be a separate substance; for then the possible intellect would be individuated as well as the species which are received in it. Consequently we must understand that, although the intelligible species received in the possible intellect are individuated inasmuch as they exist in the possible intellect, still the universal, which is conceived by abstraction from individuating principles, is known in these species inasmuch as they are immaterial. For universals with which the sciences are concerned, are what are known (through intelligible species) and not the intelligible species themselves. Moreover, concerning these intelligible species, not all sciences study them, but only physics and metaphysics. For an intelligible species is that by which the intellect knows, but not that which it knows—except by reflection inasmuch as it knows that by which it knows in order to know itself.

The species of an operation is a natural effect of the species of the form which is the principle of that operation, whereas the ineffectiveness of an operation is a natural effect of the form inasmuch as it inheres in a subject. For a thing heats because it is hot, but it heats more or less effectively according as heat perfects it to a greater or lesser degree. Now to understand universals pertains to the species of intellectual operation. Hence this activity is the natural effect of an intellectual species as its proper operation; but so far as this activity is exercised more or less perfectly by the one understanding, it follows that the one understanding does so in a more or less perfect way.

For it cannot be said that there are many different principles in a horse, one making it an animal, another, a horse. But this statement [of the Philosopher] is made for this reason, that in the concept of animal the imperfect operations appear first, and then the more perfect; just as every generation is a transition from the imperfect to the perfect.

However, he did not say souls suffered that innocently, but because of a preceding sin. Hence Origen, in accordance with the position of Plato, held that the human soul was a complete species in itself, and that the body was joined to it accidentally. But since this is false, as we have shown above (Art. 1), it is not detrimental to the soul to be united to a body; on the contrary this union makes for the perfection of its nature.

This fact compels us to maintain that a possible intellect exists. Moreover, it is obvious that not all men possess the same scientific knowledge, because some know sciences which others do not.

And they argue that intelligible species are not the same in all men, because phantasms are not the same in all. In fact, as existing in the possible intellect, intelligible species are not multiple. So it is that one man possesses a science which another lacks, because he has different phantasms. But this is evidently foolish in view of what has previously been said. For species are actually intelligible only by being abstracted from phantasms and by existing in the possible intellect. Therefore diversity of phantasms cannot be the cause of the unity or multiplicity of a perfection having the character of scientific knowledge.

          <td>But an even greater difficulty faces those who maintain that there is one possible intellect for all men. For it is evident that the act of intellection has its origin in the possible intellect as the first principle whereby we understand, just as the operation of sensing has its origin in a sentient power. Also, while it was shown above (Art. 2) that if the possible intellect exists apart from man, the act of understanding, which belongs to the possible intellect, cannot be the operation of this or that man; nevertheless, from the hypothesis of one possible intellect for all men, it follows that this or that man understands by the possible intellect’s own act of understanding. Yet an operation can be multiplied in only two ways: either on the side of the objects [known], or on that of the principle operating. A third way [of multiplying operation] can also be envisaged from the point of view of time, as, for instance, when an operation involves temporal changes. Hence the act of understanding, which is the operation of the intellect, can be multiplied with respect to objects known, so that it is one thing to know a man, another thing to know a horse. The act of understanding can also be multiplied with respect to time, so that to understand what happened yesterday is one act, and to understand what happens today, another, if, of course, the operation is not continuous. However, the act of understanding cannot be multiplied respecting the principle operating, if there is only one possible intellect. Therefore, if the possible intellect’s own act of understanding is this or that man’s act of understanding, this man’s act of understanding, and that man’s, could be different if they were understanding different things. A reason for this can be found in the diversity of phantasms. The act of understanding by different men understanding the same thing, according to the one possible intellect theory, could be multiplied similarly, so that one understands today and another tomorrow. This can also be attributed to the different use of phantasms. But in the case of two men who understand the same thing at the same time, their act of understanding would have to be numerically one and the same; which is clearly impossible. Therefore it is impossible for the possible intellect, by which we understand formally, to be one and the same for all men.

And since the intellect is a certain power or capacity of the human soul, it is multiplied according as the substance of the soul itself is multiplied; which multiplication can be considered in the following way. For if a thing having a certain common character is multiplied materially, it must be multiplied numerically while remaining specifically the same. For instance, flesh and bones belong to the very notion of animal. Hence the distinction between animals, which is based on individual bodily differences, makes them numerically, but not specifically, diverse. Moreover, it is clear from what was said above (Arts. 1 and 1) that the human soul by its very nature is capable of union with the human body, because the human soul is not a complete species in itself, but acquires the completion of its species in the composite itself. Hence the fact that the soul is capable of being united to this or to that body, multiplies the soul numerically, not specifically; just as this whiteness differs numerically from that, because it belongs to this or that subject. But the human soul differs from other forms in this way, that its act of existing does not depend on the body. Nor does this individuated act of existing which it has, depend on the body; for inasmuch as a thing is one, it is undivided in itself and distinct from other things.

          <td>4. It is not necessary for the intellect as such (commune) to completely lack what it understands, but only the intellect in potency; just as every recipient lacks the nature received. Hence, if there exists an intellect which is Act alone (as the divine intellect is), it understands itself through itself. But the, possible intellect is said to be intelligible, just as other intelligible things are, because it understands itself through the intelligible species of other intelligible things.

          <td>6. Those things which exist apart from matter can differ from one another only specifically. Moreover, things which are specifically diverse belong to different grades [of being]. Hence they resemble numbers which differ specifically from one another as a result of the addition and subtraction of a unit. Consequently it follows, from the position of those who maintain that inferior beings are caused by superior ones, that in the case of beings existing in separation from matter there is multiplicity so far as cause and thing caused are concerned.

The intelligible species through which the intellect understands formally, is present in the possible intellect of this and of that particular man, and for this reason it follows that there are many possible intellects. Nevertheless the quiddity ( <i>quod</i> ) known through such a species is one, if we consider this quiddity in relation to the thing known; because the universal which is understood by both of these men is the same in all the things [of which it is the universal representation]. Moreover, the fact that what is one-in-all [i.e., the universal] can be understood through species multiplied among diverse individuals, is made possible by the immateriality of these species. For species represent a thing without the material individuating conditions which give the simple specific nature a multiple existence among diverse things.

Cum enim intellectus noster intelligat aliquid unum in multis; nisi aliqua res esset una participata a multis, videretur quod intellectus esset vanus, non habens aliquid respondens sibi in re. Unde coacti sunt ponere ideas, per quarum participationem et res naturales speciem sortiuntur, et intellectus nostri fiunt universalia intelligentes. Sed secundum sententiam Aristotelis hoc est ab intellectu, scilicet quod intelligat unum in multis per abstractionem a principiis individuantibus. Nec tamen intellectus est vanus aut falsus, licet non sit aliquid abstractum in rerum natura. Quia eorum quae sunt simul, unum potest vere intelligi aut nominari, absque hoc quod intelligatur vel nominetur alterum; licet non possit vere intelligi vel dici, quod eorum quae sunt simul, unum sit sine altero. Sic igitur vere potest considerari et dici id quod est in aliquo individuo, de natura speciei, in quo simile est cum aliis, absque eo quod considerentur in eo principia individuantia, secundum quae distinguitur ab omnibus aliis. Sic ergo sua abstractione intellectus facit istam unitatem universalem, non eo quod sit unus in omnibus, sed in quantum est immaterialis.
          <td>8. According to the Platonists the reason why something is understood as a one-in-many [i.e., universally], is not to be attributed to the intellect, but to the thing. They argue that, because our intellect knows a thing as a one-in-many, it would apparently be empty of any real content unless there were one real nature shared by many individuals. For in that case the intellect would have in itself nothing corresponding to this one-in-many in reality. Hence the Platonists felt obliged to posit Ideas, by participation in which both natural things are given their specific nature, and our intellects made cognizant of universals. But according to Aristotle, the fact that the intellect understands a one-in-many in abstraction from individuating principles, is to be attributed to the intellect itself. And though nothing abstract exists in reality, the intellect is not void of any real content, nor is it misrepresentative of things as they are; because, of those things which necessarily exist together, one can be truly understood or named without another being understood or named. But it cannot be truly understood or said of things existing in this way, that one exists without the other. Thus whatever exists in an individual which pertains to the nature of its species, and in respect of which it is like other things, can be known and spoken of truly without taking into consideration its individuating principles, which distinguish it from all other individuals [of the same species]. Consequently, by its abstractive power the intellect makes this universal unity itself, not as though it were a unity existing in things themselves, but as an immaterial representation of them.

Furthermore, the same [incongruity set forth in this objection] follows logically from the position of those who maintain that there is one possible intellect for all men. For if there is one possible intellect existing as a separate substance, it must be an individual thing. This is the argument that Aristotle employs against Plato’s Ideas. The intelligible species in the intellect would be individuated for the same reason, and would differ in diverse separate intellects as well, because every intelligence is filled with intelligible forms.

Non ergo necessarium est ponere intellectum agentem. Probatio mediae. Potentiae quae radicantur in una essentia animae, compatiuntur sibi invicem; unde ex motu facto in potentia sensitiva relinquitur aliquid in imaginatione; nam phantasia est motus a sensu factus secundum actum, ut dicitur in III de anima. Si ergo intellectus possibilis est in anima nostra, et non est substantia separata, sicut superius dictum est; oportet quod sit in eadem essentia animae cum imaginatione. Ergo motus imaginationis redundat in intellectum possibilem; et ita non est necessarium ponere intellectum agentem, qui faciat phantasmata intelligibilia a phantasmatibus abstracta.
          <td>1. It seems unnecessary to admit that an agent intellect exists. For whatever can be accomplished in nature by one thing is not done by many. Now a man can understand quite well by means of one intellect, namely, the possible intellect. Therefore it is unnecessary to admit that an agent intellect exists. The minor proposition is proved thus: powers that are rooted in one and the same essence of the soul influence one another. It is for this reason that an impression is made on the imagination as a result of a change in the [external] sense powers, for the imagination is moved [i.e., actuated or informed] when the external senses are actuated, as is said in the <i>De anima</i> [III, 3, 429a 1]. Therefore, if the possible intellect belongs to our soul, and is not a separate substance, as we have explained above (Art. 2), it must belong to the same essence of the soul as the imagination does. Hence a change in the imagination flows into the possible intellect, and thus it is unnecessary to admit that an agent intellect exists which makes phantasms intelligible by abstracting [species] from the phantasms themselves.

Si igitur intellectus possibilis est quaedam potentia animae, pari ratione ex motu imaginationis resultabit aliquid in intellectum possibilem; et ita non est necessarium ponere intellectum agentem.
          <td>2. Further, touch and sight are different powers. Now in the case of one who is [born] blind, it happens that the imagination is moved to imagine something that belongs to the sense of sight from a change produced in the imagination by the sense of touch, and this occurs because sight and touch are rooted in one and the same essence of the soul. Therefore, if the possible intellect is a certain power of the soul, then, for a similar reason, an impression will be produced in the possible intellect from a change in the imagination. Thus it is unnecessary to admit that an agent intellect exists.

Sed hoc potest fieri sine intellectu agente; nam intellectus possibilis, cum sit immaterialis, immaterialiter necesse est quod recipiat, cum omne receptum sit in recipiente per modum recipientis. Nulla igitur necessitas est ponendi intellectum agentem.
          <td>3. Further, an agent intellect is held to exist in order that the potentially intelligible may be made actually intelligible. Moreover, some things are made actually intelligible by being abstracted from matter and from material conditions. Thus an agent intellect is held to exist in order that intelligible species may be abstracted from matter. However, this can be accomplished without an agent intellect, for, since the possible intellect is immaterial, it must receive things in an immaterial way, because whatever is received is in the recipient according to the mode of the recipient. Therefore it is unnecessary to admit that an agent intellect exists.

Sed intellectus agens non est necessarius ad hoc quod faciat intellectum possibilem aptum ad recipiendum; quia secundum id quod est, est in potentia ad intelligibilia. Ergo non est necessarium ponere intellectum agentem.
          <td>4. Further, in the <i>De anima</i> [III, 5, 430a 15],Aristotle compares the agent intellect to light. But light is necessary for sight only inasmuch as it makes the medium ( <i>diaphanus</i> ) to be actually luminous; for color is visible in virtue of its own nature, and moves the medium which is actually luminous, as is explained in the <i>De anima</i> [II, 7, 418a 26; 418b 27]. However, the agent intellect is not required in order to prepare the possible intellect for the reception of species, because the possible intellect is in potency to intelligible species by its very nature. Therefore it is unnecessary to maintain that an agent intellect exists.

Ergo nec intelligibilia indigent aliquo alio intellectu agente.
          <td>5. Further, just as our intellect is related to intelligible things, so are our senses related to sensible things. Now sensible things require no agent [sense] in order that they may move the senses, yet sensible things are present with an immaterial mode of existence, both in the senses, which are receptive of sensible things without matter, as is said in the <i>De anima</i> [III, 8, 431b 25], as well as in the medium [e.g., the air], which receives the species of sensible things in an immaterial way. This is evident from the very fact that the species of contrary qualities, such as white and black, are received in the same part of the medium. Therefore neither do intelligible things require an agent intellect.

Non est igitur necessarium ponere intellectum agentem, ut videtur.
          <td>6. Further, in order for something in potency to be made actual in the case of natural things, something actual belonging to the same genus is sufficient; for example, in the case of matter, whatever is ablaze potentially is set ablaze actually by fire, which is in act. Therefore, for our intellect, which is in potency, to be actuated, nothing more is required than the intellect in act, either of the knower himself, as when we proceed from a knowledge of principles to a knowledge of conclusions, or of someone else, as when someone learns from a teacher. Consequently it seems unnecessary to maintain that an agent intellect exists.

Et eadem ratione intellectus accipit naturam generis abstrahendo a differentiis specificis, ut unum in multis et de multis speciebus.
          <td>I answer: We must admit that an agent intellect exists. To make this evident we must observe that, since the possible intellect is in potency to intelligibles, the intelligibles themselves must move [i.e., actuate] the possible intellect. But that which is non-existent cannot move anything. Moreover, the intelligible as such, that which the possible intellect understands, does not exist in reality; “ for our possible intellect understands something as though it were a one-in-many and common to many [i.e., universal]. However, such an entity is not found subsisting in reality, as Aristotle proves in the <i>Metaphysics</i> [VII, 13, 1039a 15]. Therefore, if the possible intellect has to be moved by an intelligible, this intelligible must be produced by an intellective power. And since it is impossible for anything in potency, in a certain respect, to actuate itself, we must admit that an agent intellect exists, in addition to the possible intellect, and that this agent intellect causes the actual intelligibles which actuate the possible intellect. Moreover, it produces these intelligibles by abstracting them from matter and from material conditions which are the principles of individuation. And since the nature as such of the species does not possess these principles by which the nature is given a multiple existence among different things, because individuating principles of this sort are distinct from the nature itself, the intellect will be able to receive this nature apart from all material conditions, and consequently will receive it as a unity [i.e., as a one-in-many]. For the same reason the intellect receives the nature of a genus by abstracting from specific differences, so that it is a one-in-many and common to many species.

          <td>Si autem universalia per se subsisterent in rerum natura, sicut Platonici posuerunt, necessitas nulla esset ponere intellectum agentem; quia ipsae res intelligibiles per se intellectum possibilem moverent. Unde videtur Aristoteles hac necessitate inductus ad ponendum intellectum agentem, quia non consensit opinioni Platonis de positione idearum. Sunt tamen et aliqua per se intelligibilia in actu subsistentia in rerum natura, sicut sunt substantiae immateriales; sed tamen ad ea cognoscenda intellectus possibilis pertingere non potest, sed aliqualiter in eorum cognitionem devenit per ea quae abstrahit a rebus materialibus et sensibilibus.
          <td>However, if universals subsisted in reality in virtue of themselves, as the Platonists maintained, it would not be necessary to admit than an agent intellect exists; because things which are intelligible in virtue of their own nature move the possible intellect. Therefore it appears that Aristotle was led by this necessity to posit an agent intellect, because he did not agree with the opinion of Plato on the question of Ideas. Nevertheless there are some subsistent things in the real order which are actual intelligibles in virtue of themselves; the immaterial substances, for instance, are of this nature (see Art. 7). However, the possible intellect cannot attain a knowledge of these immediately, but acquires its knowledge of them through what it abstracts from material and sensible things (see Art. 16).

Vel etiam quantum ad hoc quod una potentia ab alia movetur, sicut imaginatio a sensu. Et hoc quidem possibile est, quia formae imaginationis et sensus sunt eiusdem generis; utraeque enim sunt individuales. Et ideo formae quae sunt in sensu, possunt imprimere formas quae sunt in imaginatione movendo imaginationem quasi sibi similes. Formae autem imaginationis, in quantum sunt individuales, non possunt causare formas intelligibiles, cum sint universales.
          <td>1. Our act of intellection cannot be accomplished by the possible intellect alone, for the possible intellect can understand only when it is moved by an intelligible, and this intelligible, since it does not already exist in the real order, must be produced by the agent intellect. Moreover, it is true that two powers, which are rooted in one and the same substance of the soul, do influence each other; but this influence can be understood to occur in two ways: first, inasmuch as one power is hindered or totally prevented from performing its operation when another power operates intensely; however, this has no bearing on the problem; secondly, inasmuch as one power is moved by another, as the imagination is moved by the [external] senses. Now this is possible because the forms in the imagination and those in the external senses are generically the same, for all are individual forms. Therefore the forms which are in the external senses can impress those forms which exist in the imagination by moving the imagination, because they are similar to these forms. However, the forms in the imagination, since they represent things as individuals, cannot cause intelligible forms, because these are universal.

The species received in the imagination from the sense of touch are not enough to cause the imagination to produce forms belonging to the sense of sight, unless forms previously received by the sense of sight are stored up in the repertory of memory or imagination.

Quidam enim dixerunt quod lumen necessarium est ad videndum, quantum ad hoc quod dat virtutem coloribus, ut possint movere visum; quasi color non ex seipso sit visibilis, sed per lumen. Sed hoc videtur Aristoteles removere, cum dicit in II de anima, quod color est per se visibilis; quod non esset, si solum ex lumine haberet visibilitatem. Et ideo alii aliter dicunt, et melius, quod lumen necessarium est ad videndum in quantum perficit diaphanum, faciens illud esse lucidum actu; unde philosophus dicit in III de anima, quod color est motivus lucidi secundum actum. Nec obstat quod ab eo qui est in tenebris, videntur ea quae sunt in luce, et non e converso. Hoc enim accidit ex eo quod oportet illuminari diaphanum, quod circumstat rem visibilem, ut recipiat visibilem speciem, quae usque ad hoc visibilis est quousque porrigitur actus luminis illuminantis diaphanum; licet de propinquo perfectius illuminet, et a longinquo magis debilitetur. Comparatio ergo luminis ad intellectum agentem non est quantum ad omnia; cum intellectus agens ad hoc sit necessarius ut faciat intelligibilia in potentia esse intelligibilia actu. Et hoc significavit Aristoteles in III de anima, cum dixit, quod intellectus agens est quasi lumen quoquo modo.
          <td>4. There are two opinions concerning light, as the Commentator points out in the <i>De anima</i> [II, 67]. For some said that light is necessary for sight inasmuch as it gives to colors the power of moving the sense of sight, as if color were not visible of itself, but only through light. But this seems to contradict Aristotle, since he points out in the <i>De anima</i> [II, 7, 418a 29]. that color is visible in virtue of itself, and this would not be the case if it were made visible by light alone. For this reason others offer a different and more acceptable explanation, namely, that light is necessary for sight inasmuch as it perfects the medium, making it to be actually luminous. Wherefore the Philosopher says in the <i>De anima</i> [II, 7, 418a 33] that color has the power of moving what is actually luminous. Nor is this position rendered untenable by the fact that someone in the dark sees things which are in the light, but not vice versa. For this occurs because the medium, which surrounds a visible thing, must be illuminated in order that the medium may receive the visible species; and this remains visible as long as the act of light continues to illuminate the medium, although it illuminates it more perfectly the nearer it is, and more weakly the farther it is away. Consequently the comparison between light and the agent intellect does not hold in all respects, because the agent intellect is necessary for this reason, that it may make the potentially intelligible to be actually intelligible. Aristotle pointed this out in the <i>De anima</i> [III, 5, 430a 15] when he said that the agent intellect is like light in some respects.

Et ideo in intelligibilibus indigemus intellectu agente, non autem in sensibilibus alia potentia activa; sed omnes potentiae sensitivae sunt potentiae passivae.
          <td>5. Since a sensible is something particular, it does not impress a species of a higher genus, either on the sense or on the medium, because the species existing in the medium and in the sense is a particular and nothing more. The possible intellect, however, receives species of a higher genus than those present in the imagination; because the possible intellect receives universal species, whereas the imagination contains only particular species. Therefore we require an agent intellect in the case of intelligible things, but need no additional agent power in the case of sensible things. Indeed, all the sentient powers are passive powers.

Et per quod est in actu potest reduci, etiam quantum ad id quod est in potentia, in actum; sicut per id quod est actu cognoscens principia, fit in actu cognoscens conclusiones, quas prius cognoscebat in potentia. Sed tamen actualem cognitionem principiorum habere non potest intellectus possibilis nisi per intellectum agentem. Cognitio enim principiorum a sensibilibus accipitur ut dicitur in fine libri posteriorum. A sensibilibus autem non possunt intelligibilia accipi nisi per abstractionem intellectus agentis. Et ita patet quod intellectus in actu principiorum non sufficit ad reducendum intellectum possibilem de potentia in actum sine intellectu agente; sed in hac reductione intellectus agens se habet sicut artifex, et principia demonstrationis sicut instrumenta. Si autem loquamur de intellectu in actu docentis, manifestum est quod docens non causat scientiam in addiscente, tamquam interius agens, sed sicut exterius adminiculans; sicut etiam medicus sanat sicut exterius adminiculans, natura autem tamquam interius agens.
          <td>6. The possible intellect in act is not sufficient to, cause knowledge in us unless an agent intellect is presupposed. For if we speak of the intellect in act of one who is learning, it so happens that his possible intellect is in potency with respect to some things, and in act with respect to others; and his intellect can be put into act, so far as the things to which it is in potency are concerned, by the things that are already actually known; just as one is made to be actually knowing conclusions,, which were previously known only potentially, by actually knowing principles. However, the possible intellect can be actually knowing principles only through the activity of the agent intellect; for our knowledge of principles is received from sensible things, as is stated at the end of the <i>Posterior Analytics</i> [II, 19, 100a 10]. Moreover, intelligibles can be derived from sensible things only by the abstractive activity of the agent intellect. Thus it is evident that the intellect in act with respect to principles, does not suffice to move the possible intellect from potentiality to act without the agent intellect. Indeed, in this actuating of the possible intellect, the agent intellect acts like an artisan and the principles of demonstration like tools. However, if we speak of the intellect in act of the teacher, it is evident that when the teacher causes knowledge in one who is learning, he does not act as an interior agent, but as an external administrator, just as in the production of health a physician acts as an external administrator, whereas the nature of the patient acts as an interior agent.

For the activity of the possible intellect consists in receiving intelligibles, whereas that of the agent intellect consists in abstracting them.

However, the agent intellect is in act with respect to them, because it is the act [producing] them. Therefore it seems that the possible and agent intellect cannot be rooted in the same substance of the soul. Hence, since the possible intellect is rooted in the essence of the soul, as is evident from the preceding articles (Arts. 1, 2 and 2), the agent intellect will exist apart from the soul.

But it might be said that the possible intellect is in potency to intelligible species, and the agent intellect in act with respect to them according to different modes of existence. —On the other hand, the possible intellect is not in potency to intelligible species when it possesses them, because then it is actuated by them. Hence it is in potency to intelligible species as existing in phantasms. But the agent intellect is related to such species as the act [which produces them], because it makes them actually intelligible by abstraction. Hence the possible intellect is in potency to intelligible species with respect to that mode of existence according to which the agent intellect is related to them as the one producing them.

Therefore, if the possible intellect, which is the patient in cognition, is a part of our substantial principle, as was previously shown (Art. 3), and the agent intellect is also a part of our soul, it seems that we possess within ourselves everything necessary in order that we may be able to understand. Hence we require nothing more in order to be able to do so. But this is clearly false. For we need the senses through which we acquire the experience necessary for cognition. This is the reason why a man deprived of a sense, for instance, sight, lacks a knowledge of colors. In order to learn we also require instruction, which is given by a teacher. And above all we stand in need of the illumination given by God, for it is said: “It was the true Light that enlightens every man who comes into this world” (John 1:9).

But one light existing apart from things, that is, the sun, suffices to make all things actually visible. Consequently one [intellectual] light existing apart from men, suffices to make everything actually intelligible. Hence it is unnecessary to maintain that an agent intellect exists in each one of us.

Sed quia fides Catholica Deum, et non aliquam substantiam separatam in natura et animabus nostris operantem ponit, ideo quidam Catholici posuerunt, quod intellectus agens sit ipse Deus, qui est lux vera quae illuminat omnem hominem venientem in hunc mundum.
          <td>For this reason many maintained that the agent intellect is a separate substance, and that the possible intellect is a part of our soul. Furthermore they held that this agent intellect is a specific kind of separate substance, which they call an intelligence. They held that it is related to our souls, and to the entire sphere of active and passive qualities, as superior separate substances (which they also call intelligences) are related to the souls of the celestial bodies (for they considered these to be animated), and to the celestial bodies themselves. Hence they maintained that, as superior bodies receive their motion from these separate substances, and the souls of the heavenly bodies .their intelligible perfections, so also do all the bodies of this inferior sphere receive their forms and movements from the separate agent intellect, while our soul receives its intelligible perfections from it. But because the Catholic Faith maintains that God is the agent operating in our souls and not some separate substance in nature, some Catholics asserted that the agent intellect is God himself, who is “the true Light that enlightens every man who comes into this world” (John 1: 9).

          <td>But this position, if anyone examines it carefully, is seen to be implausible, because the superior substances are related to our souls as celestial bodies are to inferior bodies. For, as the powers of superior bodies are certain universal active principles in relation to inferior bodies, so also are the divine power and the powers of different secondary substances (if the latter do influence us in any way) related to our souls as universal active principles.

Inveniuntur enim quaedam animalia imperfecta, ad quorum productionem sufficit virtus caelestis corporis, sicut patet de animalibus generatis ex putrefactione; sed ad generationem animalium perfectorum praeter virtutem caelestem requiritur etiam virtus particularis, quae est in semine. Cum igitur id quod est perfectissimum in omnibus corporibus inferioribus, sit intellectualis operatio, praeter principia activa universalia, quae sunt virtus Dei illuminantis, vel cuiuscumque alterius substantiae separatae, requiritur in nobis principium activum proprium, per quod efficiamur intelligentes in actu; et hoc est intellectus agens.
          <td>However, we see that there must exist in addition to the universal active principles of the celestial bodies, certain particular active principles which are powers of inferior bodies, limited to the proper operation of each and every one of them. This is particularly necessary in the case of perfect animals, because certain imperfect animals are found, for whose production the power of a celestial body suffices, as is evident in the case of animals generated from decomposed matter.” However, in the generation of perfect animals a special power is also required in addition to the celestial power, and this power is present in the seed. Therefore, since intellectual operation is the most perfect thing existing in the entire order of inferior bodies, we need in addition to universal active principles (namely, the power of God enlightening us, or the powers of any other separate substance) an active principle existing within us by which we are enabled to understand actually. This power is the agent intellect.

Manifestum est enim quod ultima beatitudo sive felicitas hominis consistit in sua nobilissima operatione, quae est intelligere; cuius ultimam perfectionem oportet esse per hoc quod intellectus noster suo activo principio coniungitur.

For it is evident that man’s ultimate beatitude or happiness depends upon his noblest operation, intellection, which operation, in order to be fully completed, requires the union of our [possible] intellect with its active principle. For, indeed, anything passive in any way whatever is perfected [i.e., fully actuated] only when joined with the proper active principle which is the cause of its perfection. Therefore those maintaining that the agent intellect is a substance existing apart from matter, say that man’s ultimate happiness consists in being able to know the agent intellect.

Utramque autem harum operationum experimur in nobis ipsis. Nam et nos intelligibilia recipimus et abstrahimus ea. Oportet autem in unoquoque operante esse aliquod formale principium, quo formaliter operetur: non enim potest aliquid formaliter operari per id quod est secundum esse separatum ab ipso.

Non autem sufficit ad hoc, quod actio intellectus agentis, quae est abstrahere intelligibilia, conveniat nobis per ipsa phantasmata, quae sunt in nobis illustrata ab ipso intellectu agente. Unumquodque enim artificiatum consequitur actionem artificis: cum tamen intellectus agens comparatur ad phantasmata illustrata sicut ad artificiata.
          <td>Moreover, if we give the matter further careful consideration, we will find that the agent intellect cannot be a separate substance for the same reason that the possible intellect cannot be, as was shown above (Arts. 1-3). For, as the operation of the possible intellect consists in receiving intelligible [species], so also does the proper operation of the agent intellect consist in abstracting them, for it makes them actually intelligible in this way. Now we experience both of these operations in ourselves, because we receive our intelligible species, and abstract them as well. However, in anything that operates there must be some formal principle whereby it operates formally, because a thing cannot operate formally through something that possesses existence distinct from itself. But, although the motive principle of an activity [i.e., an efficient cause] is separate from the thing which it causes, nevertheless there must be some intrinsic principle whereby a thing operates formally, whether it be a form or some sort of impression. Therefore there must exist within us a formal principle through which we receive intelligible species, and one whereby we abstract them. These principles are called the possible and the agent intellect respectively. Consequently each exists within us. Moreover, [the formal intrinsic existence in us of the agent intellect] is not accounted for simply by the fact that the action of the agent intellect, namely, the abstracting of intelligible species, is carried out through phantasms illumined in us by its action. For every object produced by art is the effect of the action of an artificer, the agent intellect being related to the phantasms illumined by it as an artificer is to the things made by his art.

Non enim est impossibile aliquid esse in potentia respectu alicuius, et in actu respectu eiusdem, secundum diversa. Si ergo consideremus ipsa phantasmata per respectum ad animam humanam, inveniuntur quantum ad aliquid esse in potentia, scilicet in quantum non sunt ab individuantibus conditionibus abstracta, abstrahibilia tamen, quantum vero ad aliquid inveniuntur esse in actu respectu animae, in quantum scilicet sunt similitudines determinatarum rerum. Est ergo in anima nostra invenire potentialitatem respectu phantasmatum, secundum quod sunt repraesentativa determinatarum rerum. Et hoc pertinet ad intellectum possibilem, qui, quantum est de se, est in potentia ad omnia intelligibilia; sed determinatur ad hoc vel aliud per species a phantasmatibus abstractas. Est etiam in anima invenire quamdam virtutem activam immaterialem, quae ipsa phantasmata a materialibus conditionibus abstrahit; et hoc pertinet ad intellectum agentem, ut intellectus agens sit quasi quaedam virtus participata ex aliqua substantia superiori, scilicet Deo. Unde philosophus dicit quod intellectus agens est ut habitus quidam et lumen; et in Psal. IV, dicitur: signatum est super nos lumen vultus tui, domine. Et huiusmodi simile quodammodo apparet in animalibus videntibus de nocte, quorum pupillae sunt in potentia ad omnes colores; in quantum nullum colorem habent determinatum in actu, sed per quamdam lucem insitam faciunt quodammodo colores visibiles actu.
          <td>Now it is not difficult to see how both of these can be present in one and the same substance of the soul: that is, the possible intellect, which is in potency to all intelligible objects, and the agent intellect which makes them actually intelligible; because it is not impossible for a thing to be in potency and in act with respect to one and the same thing in different ways. Therefore, if we consider the phantasms themselves in relation to the human soul, in one respect they are found to be in potency, inasmuch as they are not abstracted from individuating conditions, although capable of being abstracted. In another respect they are found to be in act in relation to the soul, namely, inasmuch as they are [sensible] likenesses of determinate things. Therefore potentiality with respect to phantasms must be found within our soul so far as these phantasms are representative of determinate things. This belongs to the possible intellect which is, by its very nature, in potency to all intelligible objects, but is actuated by this or that object through species abstracted from phantasms. Our soul must also possess some active immaterial power which abstracts the phantasms themselves from material individuating conditions. This belongs to the agent intellect, so that it is, as it were, a power participated from the superior substance, God. Hence the Philosopher says [De Anima, III, 5, 430a 14] that the agent intellect is like a certain habit and light. In the Psalms it is also said: “The light of Thy countenance is signed upon us, O Lord” (Ps. 4:7). Something resembling this in a certain degree is apparent, in animals who see by night. The pupils of their eyes are in potency to every color inasmuch as they have no one determinate color actually, but make colors actually visible in some way by means of a certain innate light.

          <td>Indeed, some men thought that the agent intellect does not differ from our <i>habitus</i> of indemonstrable principles. But this cannot be the case, because we certainly know indemonstrable principles by abstracting them from singulars, as the Philosopher teaches in the Posterior Analytics [II, 19, 100b 4]. Consequently the agent intellect must exist prior to the <i>habitus</i> of first indemonstrable principles in order to be the cause of it. Indeed, the principles themselves are related to the agent intellect as certain of its instruments, because the intellect makes things actually intelligible by means of such principles.

Nam postquam Aristoteles determinavit de intellectu possibili et agente, necessarium fuit ut determinaret de intellectu in actu, cuius primo differentiam ostendit ad intellectum possibilem. Nam intellectus possibilis et res quae intelligitur, non sunt idem; sed intellectus sive scientia in actu est idem rei scitae in actu, sicut et de sensu idem dixerat, quod sensus et sensibile in potentia differunt, sed sensus et sensibile in actu sunt unum et idem. Iterum ostendit ordinem intellectus possibilis ad intellectum in actu: quia in uno et eodem prius est intellectus in potentia quam in actu, non tamen simpliciter; sicut et multoties consuevit hoc dicere de his quae exeunt de potentia in actum. Et postea subdit verbum inductum, in quo ostendit differentiam inter intellectum possibilem et inter intellectum in actu: quia intellectus possibilis quandoque intelligit, et quandoque non; quod non potest dici de intellectu in actu.

          <td>1. The Philosopher’s statement that “the intellect is not at one time knowing and at another not” [De Anima, III, 5, 430a 22] is not understood of the agent intellect, but of the intellect-in-act. For after Aristotle had determined the role of the possible and agent intellect, he had to determine the role of the intellect-in-act. He first distinguishes it in relation to the possible intellect, because the possible intellect and the thing known are not one and the same. However, the intellect or science-in-act is the same as the thing actually known. Aristotle had said the same thing about sense, namely, that sense and what is potentially sensible differ from each other, but that sense and what is actually sensed are one and the same. Secondly, he shows how the possible intellect is related to the intellect-in-act, because in one and the same individual, intellect in potency precedes intellect-in-act. However, it does not precede it absolutely, for he very often uses this manner of speaking concerning things that pass from potentiality to actuality. Then he makes the statement quoted above, in which he shows the difference between the possible intellect and the intellect-in-act, because the possible intellect sometimes understands and sometimes does not, which cannot be said of the intellect-in-act. He points out a similar difference, in the <i>Physics</i> [III, 1, 201a 20] between causes in potency and causes in act.

For Aristotle had also previously stated that the possible intellect is separate. However, they must be understood to apply to the intellect-in-act in view of the context in which they occur, as was shown above (Ans. obj. 1). For intellect-in-act embraces both the possible intellect and the agent intellect.

          <td>6. Although our soul possesses an agent and a possible intellect, nevertheless something extrinsic is required so that we may be able to understand. First of all, indeed, we need phantasms, derived from sensible things, by means of which the likenesses of particular things are presented to the intellect. For the agent intellect is not an act in which the determinate species of all things can be received in order to be known, any more than light can cause sight to apprehend particular kinds of colors, unless those particular kinds of colors are present to sight. Moreover, since we maintained above that the agent intellect is a certain power in which our souls share, as a kind of light, we must maintain that some exterior cause exists from whom such light is participated, and we call this exterior cause, God, who teaches within us inasmuch as He infuses light of this kind into our soul. Because of His munificence He bestows upon us, in addition to this natural light, a richer one in order that we may be, able to know those things which the natural light of reason cannot attain. Such, for instance, is the light of faith and of prophecy.

Therefore, although the exterior light of the sun is adequate for making colors actually visible, nevertheless in order that phantasms may be made actually intelligible, an interior light is required, and this is the light of the agent intellect. Furthermore, the intellective part of the soul is more perfect than the sensory. Hence it is even more necessary that adequate principles be present to the intellect for the performance of its proper operation. Also, for this reason: it is a matter of experience that by the intellective part of our soul we both receive intelligible species and abstract them, which indicates that there exists in us intellectually not only a passive but also an active power.

          <td>1. It seems that the soul is composed of matter and form. For Boethius says in his book, the <i>De Trinitate</i> : “A simple form cannot be a subject.” But the soul is the subject of sciences and virtues. Therefore the soul is not a form in its entirety ( <i>simplex</i> ) and, consequently, is composed of matter. and form.

Sed anima aliquid participat, ea scilicet quibus informatur anima. Ergo non est forma tantum; est ergo composita ex materia et forma.
          <td>2. Further Boethius says in the <i>De hebdomadibus</i> , “Whatever exists, can participate in something else; but the act of existing (esse) itself cannot participate in anything.” For a similar reason, subjects participate in something but forms do not; for example, a white thing can participate in something besides whiteness, but whiteness itself cannot participate in anything. Now the soul participates in something, namely, in those things by which it is informed. Therefore the soul is not a form alone, but is composed of matter and form.

Further, if the soul is a form in its entirety and is in potency to something, it seems that its act of existing ( <i>esse</i> ) above all is its act, for the soul is not its own act of existing. But act will be the simplest thing belonging to a simple potency. Therefore the soul could not be the subject of anything else than its own act of existing. However, it is evident that it is the subject of other things. Therefore the soul is not a simple substance, but is composed of matter and form.

This appears to be false, however, because music and grammar and things of this sort do not belong to the entire species. Therefore the soul is not a form alone, but is composed of matter and form.

The operation of the agent intellect, on the other hand, consists in acting, for it makes the potentially intelligible, actually intelligible, as is said in the <i>De anima</i> [III, 5, 430a 14].

Et quia omnis transmutatio et motus reducitur ad motum localem, sicut ad primum et communiorem, ut probatur in VIII Physic.; relinquitur quod materia in illis tantum invenitur in quibus est potentia ad ubi. Huiusmodi autem sunt solum corporalia, quae loco circumscribuntur. Unde materia non invenitur nisi in rebus corporalibus, secundum quod philosophi de materia sunt locuti; nisi aliquis materiam sumere velit aequivoce.

          <td>Now the weakness of this argument become’s apparent if we consider that to receive, to be a subject, and other things of this sort, are not found in the soul and in prime matter in the same specific way. For prime matter is actuated by means of change and motion, and since every change and motion may be reduced to local motion, as the primary and most universal type of motion, as is proved in the <i>Physics</i> [VIII, 7, 260b 6], it follows that matter is present only in those things in which there is potency to place ( <i>ab ubi</i> ). Moreover, things of this kind, which are circumscribed by place alone, are corporeal. Hence, in accordance with the way in which the philosophers have spoken about matter, matter is present only in corporeal things; unless, of course, someone wishes to employ matter in an equivocal sense. The soul, however, does not receive something by means of motion and change, but, on the contrary, by being separated from motion and from movable things. Accordingly, it is said in the <i>Physics</i> [VII, 3, 247b 10] that the soul becomes cognitive and possesses prudence when at rest. Wherefore the Philosopher also states, in the <i>De anima</i> [III, 4, 429a 30] that intellection is referred to as a passion, but is a passion of a different nature from that present in corporeal things. Therefore, if anyone wishes to conclude that the soul is composed of matter because it is receptive or is acted upon, he is clearly deceived by an equivocation.

However, a thing which possesses a specific nature in its own right, is not united to some other thing in order to constitute a species, unless each is corrupted in some manner: just as, for example, the elements are united in order to constitute the species of the mixed bodies. The soul, therefore, is not united to the body in order to constitute the human species, but the complete human species is comprised of the soul alone.

This could not be said of the soul if it were composed of matter and form.

The whole soul, therefore, will not be the form of the body, but only a part of the soul will be so. The soul, however, is certainly that entity which is the form of the body.

Indeed, some of the adherents of the aforesaid position do maintain this. For they say that a soul is united to its body by the instrumentality of light; the vegetal soul by the mediating light of the sidereal heaven, the sentient soul by the mediating light of the crystalline heaven, and the rational soul by the mediating light of the empyrean heaven.

Quomodo autem in anima actus et potentia inveniantur sic considerandum est ex materialibus ad immaterialia procedendo. In substantiis enim ex materia et forma compositis tria invenimus, scilicet materiam et formam et ipsum esse. Cuius quidem principium est forma; nam materia ex hoc quod recipit formam, participat esse. Sic igitur esse consequitur ipsam formam. Nec tamen forma est suum esse, cum sit eius principium. Et licet materia non pertingat ad esse nisi per formam, forma tamen in quantum est forma, non indiget materia ad suum esse, cum ipsam formam consequatur esse; sed indiget materia, cum sit talis forma, quae per se non subsistit. Nihil ergo prohibet esse aliquam formam a materia separatam, quae habeat esse, et esse sit in huiusmodi forma. Ipsa enim essentia formae comparatur ad esse sicut potentia ad proprium actum.
          <td>It becomes evident, then, that the soul cannot be composed of matter and form. However, act and potency are not excluded from the soul, for potency and act are found not only in immovable things, but in movable things as well; and they are more common here, as the Philosopher points out in the Metaphysics [VIII, 5, 1044b 26], because matter itself may not exist in immovable things. Now the manner in which act and potency are found in the soul must be discovered by proceeding from material things to immaterial ones. For we observe three things in substances composed of matter and form: namely, matter, form, and the act of existing itself, the principle of which is the form; for matter receives an act of existing because it receives a form. Therefore a thing’s act of existing is the natural effect of the form itself of that thing. However, the form is not identical with its own act of existing, because the form is the principle of that act of existing. And although matter receives its act of existing only through some form, yet a form as such does not stand in need of matter in order to exist, because the act of existing is the natural effect of the form itself. However, a form requires matter in order to exist when it is a form of that specific type which does not subsist of itself. Consequently a form having its act of existing in itself is not prevented in any way from existing apart from matter and the act of existing is found in a form of this kind. For the very essence of a form is related to its act of existing as a potency is to its proper act.

Et hinc est quod Boetius dicit in Lib. de hebdomadibus quod in aliis quae sunt post Deum, differt esse et quod est; vel, sicut quidam dicunt, quod est et quo est. Nam ipsum esse est quo aliquid est, sicut cursus est quo aliquis currit.

          <td>It is in this way, then, that both potency and act are found in forms which subsist of themselves, inasmuch as the act of existing itself is the act of a subsisting form which is not its own act of existing. Moreover, if there is a thing which is its own act of existing, and this is proper to God alone, it does not contain potency and act, but is pure act. It is for this reason that Boethius says, in his <i>De hebdomadibus</i> , that in the beings which are beneath God in perfection, the act of existing ( <i>esse</i> ) and quiddity ( <i>quod est</i> ) are really distinct; or as some say, that which is ( <i>quod est</i> ) and that by which it is (quo est) differ from each other.” For the act of existing itself of a thing is that by which a thing exists; just as running is that by which someone runs. Consequently, since the soul is a certain form which subsists of itself, it can be composed of act and potency, that is, of an act of existing and an essence, but not of form and matter.

Therefore, if there is a being which is itself a subsisting act of existing (ipsum esse subsistens), just as we speak of God, we say that it does not participate in anything. However, this is not true of other subsisting forms which necessarily participate in the act of existing itself, and which are related to it as potency is to act; and thus, since these forms are in potentiality in some measure, they can participate in something else.

Et similiter nihil prohibet formas subsistentes, quae sunt Angeli et animae, non solum esse susceptiva ipsius esse, sed etiam aliarum perfectionum.

Not only is a form related to its act of existing as potency is to act, but, indeed, nothing prevents one from being related to another as potency is to act; just as the transparent medium is related to light, and light in turn to color. Hence, if transparency were a separate form subsisting in virtue of its own nature, it would be receptive not only of an act of existing, but of light as well. Similarly, nothing prevents subsisting forms like the angels and the soul from receiving not only the act of existing itself, but other perfections as well.

The sort of passion which is in the soul, and which is attributed to the possible intellect, does not belong to the same genus as the passions attributed to matter; for in these two cases matter is spoken of equivocally, as is evident from what the Philosopher says in the <i>De anima</i> [III, 4, 430a 3] because the passion of the possible intellect consists in a reception inasmuch as it receives something immaterially. In like manner, the action of the agent intellect is not of the same mode as the action of natural forms, for the action of the agent intellect consists in abstracting forms from matter, whereas the action of natural agents consists in impressing forms on matter. Consequently it does not follow, from the kind of action and passion present in the soul, that the soul is composed of matter and form.

          <td>7. Although the fire of hell, by which the soul is acted upon, is material and corporeal, nevertheless the soul is not acted upon by it in a material way, as material bodies themselves are, but undergoes a spiritual affliction by means of it, inasmuch as it is the instrument of the judgment of divine justice.

The action of a generator terminates in something composed of matter and form, because a natural generator only produces something from matter; creative activity, however, does not depend upon matter.

          <td>10. An agent, by its motion, brings something from potentiality to act. However, an agent that acts without any motion does not bring something from potentiality to actuality, but gives actual existence to what by nature is potentially existing. Creating is action of this kind.

          <td>16. Intelligibility does not belong to many beings, as though it were one specific form divided among many because of a division of matter, for it is a spiritual and immaterial form; rather is it diversified because of a diversity of forms, whether the forms be specifically different, like the soul of a man and an angel, or numerically different only, like the souls of different men.

          <td>1. It seems that they are not. For things which possess the same proper and natural operation have the same species, because the nature of a thing is known by its operations. Now the same proper and natural operation of intellection belongs to the soul and to the angel. Consequently the soul and the angel are of the same species.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed dicebat quod intelligere animae est cum discursu, intelligere vero Angeli est sine discursu; et sic non est eadem operatio secundum speciem animae et Angeli. —Sed contra, diversarum operationum secundum speciem non est eadem potentia.

Ergo intelligere cum discursu et sine discursu non diversificant speciem.
          <td>2. But it will be said that the soul’s act of understanding is discursive whereas the angel’s is not. Thus the [proper] operation of the soul and that of the angel are not specifically the same. On the other hand, operations which are specifically diverse are not operations of the same power. But by one and the same power, that is, the possible intellect, we understand certain things without discourse, namely, first principles, and understand certain other things discursively, namely, conclusions. Hence understanding discursively and understanding without discourse do not diversify species.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, intelligere cum discursu et sine discursu videntur differre sicut esse in motu et esse in quiete: nam discursus est quidam motus intellectus de uno in aliud.

Unde et philosophus ibidem dicit quod tot sunt species motus, quot et species entis sunt, scilicet terminantis motum. Ergo nec intelligere cum discursu et sine discursu differunt secundum speciem.
          <td>3. Further, to understand discursively and to do so without discourse, are seen to differ as being-in-motion differs from being-at-rest, for discourse is a certain movement of the intellect from one thing to another. But to be in motion and to be at rest do not differ specifically, because a motion belongs to that genus wherein the termination of the motion is found, as the Commentator says in the <i>Physics</i> [III, 1]. Hence the Philosopher also says, in the same work [III, 1, 201a 8], that “there are as many species of motion as there are species of being,” that is, terminations of motion. Consequently, to understand discursively and to do so without discourse do not differ specifically from each other.

          <td>4. Further, as the angels understand things in the Word, so also do the souls of the blessed. But the knowledge contained in the Word is not discursive. Hence Augustine says, in the De Trinitate,” that there will be no discursive knowledge in heaven. Therefore the soul does not differ from an angel because the former understands discursively, the latter without discourse.

          <td>5. Further, all angels are not specifically the same as many maintain. But every angel understands without discourse. Therefore to understand discursively and to do so without discourse do not cause specific diversity in the case of intellectual substances.

          <td>6. But it must be said too that some angels understand more perfectly than others. On the other hand, more and less do not diversify species. But to understand more perfectly and to do so less perfectly, differ only in terms of more and less. Therefore angels do not differ in species because some understand more perfectly, others less perfectly.

          <td>Praeterea, anima humana dicitur intelligere discurrendo, per hoc quod intelligit causam per effectum et e converso.

Ergo non differt Angelus ab anima per hoc quod est intelligere cum discursu et sine discursu.
          <td>8. Further, the human soul is said to understand discursively, in view of the fact that it understands a cause through its effect, and vice versa. But this also occurs in angels, for it is said in the book <i>De causis</i> [VIII], that an intelligence is cognizant of the being that is above it, because it is caused by that being. It also knows the being beneath it because it is the cause of this being. Hence the angel does not differ specifically from the soul because the latter understands discursively and the former without discourse.

          <td>9. Further, things perfected by the same perfections evidently belong to the same species, for a particular actuality perfects a particular potency. But the angel and the soul are perfected by the same perfections, namely, grace, glory, and charity. Therefore they are specifically the same.

XX, quod filii resurrectionis erunt sicut Angeli in caelo; et Gregorius dicit quod animae assumuntur ad ordines Angelorum. Ergo Angelus et anima sunt eiusdem speciei.
          <td>10. Further, things having the same end are seen to be specifically the same, for a thing is directed to its end by its form, which is the principle of its species. But the end of the angel and that of the soul is the same, namely, eternal beatitude, as is clear from the statement that the children of the resurrection shall be as the angels in heaven (Matt. 22:30). Gregory also says that souls are elevated to the ranks of the angels [In Evang., II, 34]. Therefore the angel and the soul are specifically the same.

          <td>11. Further, if the angel and the soul differ specifically, the angel must be superior to the soul in the order of nature, and so will be midway between the soul and God. But there is nothing midway between our soul and God, as Augustine says [De Trin., XV, 1]. Consequently the angel and the soul are not specifically diverse.

          <td>Praeterea, impressio eiusdem imaginis in diversis non diversificat speciem; imago enim Herculis in auro et in argento sunt eiusdem speciei. Sed tam in anima quam in Angelo est imago Dei. Ergo Angelus et anima non differunt specie.
          <td>12. Further, impressions of the same image in different individuals are not thereby made specifically diverse, for the image of Hercules in gold and that in silver are specifically the same. Now the image of God is present in the soul and in the angel as well. Therefore the angel and the soul do not differ specifically.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, quorum est eadem definitio, est eadem species.

Haec autem omnia animae humanae conveniunt. Ergo anima et Angelus sunt eiusdem speciei.
          <td>13. Further, things having the same definition are specifically the same. But the definition of the angel is the same as that of the soul, for Damascene says [De fide orth., II, 3] that an angel is “an incorporeal substance always moved by free choice, ministering to God by grace, not by nature, and remaining unchanged.” Now this is proper to every human soul. Consequently the soul and the angel are specifically the same.

Ergo Angelus et anima non differunt specie.
          <td>14. Further, things agreeing in an ultimate difference are specifically the same, because an ultimate difference determines the species. But the angel and the soul share a common ultimate difference, namely, the possession of intellectual being. This must be an ultimate difference, because there is nothing nobler than this in the nature of the soul or in that of the angel, for an ultimate difference is always most complete. Therefore the angel and the soul do not differ specifically.

          <td>Praeterea, ea quae non sunt in specie, non possunt specie differre. Sed anima non est in specie, sed magis est pars speciei. Ergo non potest specie differre ab Angelo.
          <td>15. Further, things not found in a species, cannot differ specifically. Now the soul is not found in a species, rather is it part of a species. Hence it cannot differ specifically from an angel.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, definitio proprie competit speciei. Ea ergo quae non sunt definibilia, non videntur esse in specie. Sed Angelus et anima non sunt definibilia, cum non sint composita ex materia et forma, ut supra ostensum est; in omni enim definitione est aliquid ut materia, et aliquid ut forma, ut patet per philosophum in VII Metaph.: ubi ipse dicit quod si species rerum essent sine materia, ut Plato posuit, non essent definibiles. Ergo Angelus et anima non proprie possunt dici specie differre.
          <td>16. Further, the definition coincides expressly with the species. Consequently things not definable apparently do not exist in a species. But the angel and the soul are not definable, because they are not composed of matter and form, as has been shown above (Art. 2). For in every definition there is something like matter and something like form, as is evident from what the Philosopher says in the <i>Metaphysics</i> [VII, 6, 1031b4] where he himself points out that, if the species of things were devoid of matter, as Plato held, they would not be definable. Therefore the angel and the soul cannot properly be said to differ in species.

          <td>Praeterea, omnis species constat ex genere et differentia. Genus autem et differentia in diversis fundantur; sicut genus hominis, quod est animal, in natura sensitiva; et differentia eius, quae est rationale, in natura intellectiva. In Angelo autem et anima non sunt aliqua diversa super quae genus et differentia fundari possint; essentia enim eorum est simplex forma, esse autem eorum nec genus nec differentia esse potest. Philosophus enim probat in III Metaph., quod ens nec est genus nec differentia. Ergo Angelus et anima non habent genus et differentiam, et ita non possunt specie differre.
          <td>17. Further, every species is comprised of a genus and a [specific] difference. Now genus and difference have their foundation in different things. For instance, the genus of man, which is “animal,” has its foundation in his sensory nature, and his difference, which is “rational,” is rooted in his intellective nature. However, in the angel and the soul there are no diversities on which genus and difference can be based, because their essence is constituted of form alone. Furthermore, their act of existing can be neither a genus nor a difference, for the Philosopher proves in the <i>Metaphysics</i> [III, 3, 998b 20] that the act of existing is neither a genus nor a species. Consequently the angel and the soul have neither a genus nor a specific difference, and so cannot differ specifically.

          <td>Praeterea, Angelus et anima praecipue differre videntur per hoc quod Angelus non unitur corpori, anima vero unitur.

Nullo igitur modo Angelus et anima differunt specie.
          <td>19. Further, the angel and the soul are seen to differ above all because the angel is not united to a body, whereas the soul is. But this cannot make the soul differ specifically from the angel, since the body is related to the soul as matter, and matter does not give species to form, but rather the reverse. Therefore the angel and the soul do not differ specifically in any way whatever.

          <td><b>On the contrary,</b> things differing not specifically, but numerically, differ only because of matter. But the angel and the soul do not have matter, as is clear from the preceding question. Therefore, if the angel and the soul do not differ specifically, neither do they differ numerically; which is evidently false. Therefore it follows that they differ specifically.

          <td>Respondeo. Dicendum quod quidam dicunt animam humanam et Angelos eiusdem esse speciei. Et hoc videtur primo posuisse Origenes: volens enim vitare antiquorum haereticorum errores, qui diversitatem rerum diversis attribuebant principiis, diversitate boni et mali introducentes, posuit omnium rerum diversitatem ex libero arbitrio processisse. Dixit enim, quod Deus fecit omnes creaturas rationales a principio aequales; quarum quaedam Deo adhaerentes, in melius profecerunt secundum modum adhaesionis ad Deum; quaedam vero a Deo per liberum arbitrium recedentes, in deterius ceciderunt secundum quantitatem recessus a Deo. Et sic quaedam earum sunt incorporatae corporibus caelestibus, quaedam vero corporibus humanis, quaedam vero usque ad malignitatem Daemonum perversae sunt: cum tamen ex suae creationis principio essent omnes uniformes. Sed quantum ex eius positione videri potest, Origenes attendit ad singularum creaturarum bonum, praetermissa consideratione totius. Sapiens tamen artifex in dispositione partium non considerat solum bonum huius partis aut illius, sed multo magis bonum totius; unde aedificator non facit omnes partes domus aeque pretiosas, sed magis et minus secundum quod congruit ad bonam dispositionem domus. Et similiter in corpore animalis non omnes partes habent oculi claritatem, quia esset animal imperfectum; sed est diversitas in partibus animalis, ut animal possit esse perfectum. Ita etiam Deus secundum suam sapientiam non omnia produxit aequalia, sic enim imperfectum esset universum, cui multi gradus entium deessent. Simile igitur est quaerere, in operatione Dei, quare unam creaturam fecerit alia meliorem, sicut quaerere, quare artifex in suo artificio partium diversitatem instituerit.
          <td><b>I answer:</b> Some say that the human soul and the angels are of the same species, and this seems to have been maintained first by Origen. Wishing to avoid the errors of the ancient heretics, who attributed the diversity of things to different principles by introducing a duality of good and evil, Origen held that the diversity of all things had proceeded from free choice. For he said that God made all rational creatures equally perfect in the beginning: certain of these adhering to God, acquired greater perfection in proportion to the measure of their adherence; others, falling away from God through an act of free choice, descended to positions of lesser importance in proportion to the extent of their fall. Accordingly some were incorporated into the celestial bodies, others were perverted to the point of demonic maliciousness, though all were equally perfect in the beginning. So far as Origen’s position [Peri Archon, I, 7] is concerned, it can be seen that he regarded the good of singular creatures and neglected to consider the good of the whole. Now a wise artificer arranging the parts [of his work], takes into consideration not only the good of the individual parts, but the good of the whole even more. For this reason a builder does not make all parts of a house equally valuable, but gives them greater or lesser importance inasmuch as this is required for the good disposition of the house. Likewise, in an animal’s body, not all parts have the transparency of the eye, because the animal would then be imperfect, but in an animal’s parts there is diversity in order than the animal may be perfect. In the same way, God, in His wisdom, did not make all things in the universe of equal worth, because if He had, the universe, lacking many grades of being, would be imperfect. Consequently to inquire why God, by His activity, made one creature better than another, is the same as asking why an artificer introduced a diversity of parts into his work.

Sed hoc non ponitur communiter; et si hoc poneretur, non proficeret ad hanc positionem; quia manifestum est quod illa corpora specie differrent ab humanis corporibus quibus animae uniuntur; et diversorum corporum secundum speciem, diversas perfectiones secundum speciem oportet esse. Hoc igitur dempto, quod Angeli non sint formae corporum, si non sint compositi ex materia et forma, non remanet Angelorum ab invicem vel ab anima differentia, nisi formalis. Formalis autem differentia speciem variat. Nam forma est quae dat esse rei. Et sic relinquitur quod non solum Angeli ab anima, sed ipsi etiam ab invicem, specie differant.
          <td>Hence this view of Origen having been shown to be false, there are some who adopt a similar position, claiming that all intellectual substances are specifically the same for the reasons mentioned in the objections. However, this position is seen to be impossible. For if angels and the soul are not composed of matter and form, but are forms alone, as was explained in the preceding question, every difference whereby angels are distinguished from one another, or from the soul as well, must be a formal one; unless perhaps it might be maintained that angels, like souls, were also united to bodies in order that there might be a material difference in them resulting from this relationship with bodies, as we explained above is true of souls. But this view is not commonly held, and even if it were it would not lend any weight to this position, because it is evident that the bodies [which angels would have] would, differ specifically from human bodies to which souls are united. Moreover, there must be different specific perfections for bodies that are specifically diverse. Therefore, this position that angels are forms of bodies having been shown to be false, since they are not composed of matter and form, it follows that angels differ from one another, or from the soul, only by reason of a formal difference. But a formal difference diversifies species, for the form gives a thing its mode of existing. Hence it follows that angels not only differ specifically from the soul, but also from each other.

Cum autem de ratione materiae sit quod de se careat omni forma, non poterit intelligi divisio materiae ante receptionem formae, quae secundum materiae divisionem multiplicatur, nisi per dimensiones quantitativas; unde philosophus dicit in I Physic., subtracta quantitate, substantia remanet indivisibilis. Quae autem componuntur ex materia dimensioni subiecta, sunt corpora, et non solum corpori unita. Sic igitur Angelus et anima sunt corpora, quod nullus sanae mentis dixit; praesertim cum probatum sit quod intelligere non potest esse actus corporis ullius. Si vero materia Angelorum et animae non sit una et communis, sed diversorum ordinum; hoc non potest esse nisi secundum ordinem ad formas diversas; sicut ponitur quod corporum caelestium et inferiorum non est una materia communis: et sic talis materiae differentia speciem faciet diversam.
          <td>However, even if someone claims that angels and souls are composed of matter and form, this position [that souls and angels are specifically the same] cannot be upheld. For if there were one matter common to angels and souls alike (just as there is one matter for inferior bodies, diversified only by form), the division of that one common matter would have to be the principle whereby angels are made distinct from one another, and from the soul. Now since it is of the very nature of matter in itself to be void of all form, the division of matter could not be understood to exist before it received a form (which form is given a multiple existence as a result of the division of matter), unless matter itself were divided by quantitative dimensions. Hence the Philosopher says in the <i>Physics</i> [I, 2, 185b3] that substance remains indivisible when quantity is removed. However, things which are composed of matter determined by dimensions are themselves bodies, not merely things united to a body. According to this argument, therefore, the angel and the soul are bodies. Now no one of sound mind maintained this, particularly because it has been proved that intellection cannot be the act of a body. Certainly, if the matter of the angels and that of the soul is not one and common (just as it is maintained that there is not one common matter for celestial and earthly bodies), but belongs to diverse orders, this can only be because it is ordered to different forms and thus material diversity of this sort causes specific diversity.

We must acquire our knowledge of intellectual substances by considering material substances. Now in material substances different grades of natural perfection constitute different species. Indeed this becomes quite obvious if we reflect upon the genera of material substances. For it is evident that mixed bodies surpass the elements in the order of perfection; plants surpass minerals; animals surpass plants; and in singular genera a diversity of species is found in accordance with the order of natural perfection. For among the elements, earth is lowest, and fire most noble. Likewise in the case of minerals [i.e., mixed bodies], nature is found to ascend by degrees through diverse species up to the species of gold. In plants also, nature ascends progressively up to the species of perfect trees; and in animals up to the species of man. Moreover, certain animals are more like plants, that is the immobile ones which have touch only. Similarly, certain plants are more like inanimate bodies, as is clear from what the Philosopher says in the book <i>De plantis</i> [I, 1, 815b 35].

Ita igitur et in substantiis immaterialibus diversus gradus perfectionis naturae facit differentiam speciei; sed quantum ad aliquid differenter se habet in substantiis immaterialibus et materialibus. Ubicumque enim est diversitas graduum, oportet quod gradus considerentur per ordinem ad aliquod unum principium. In substantiis igitur materialibus attenduntur diversi gradus speciem diversificantes in ordine ad primum principium, quod est materia. Et inde est quod primae species sunt imperfectiores, posteriores vero perfectiores et per additionem se habentes ad primas; sicut mixta corpora habent speciem perfectiorem quam sint species elementorum, utpote habentes in se quidquid habent elementa, et adhuc amplius; unde similis est comparatio plantarum ad corpora mineralia, et animalium ad plantas.
          <td>For this reason the Philosopher, in the <i>Metaphysics</i> [VIII, 3, 1043b 33] says that the species of natural things are like the species of numbers, wherein the addition or subtraction of a unit changes the species. Consequently in immaterial substances also a different grade of natural perfection causes difference in species. But a grade of perfection is in some respect different in the case of immaterial substances from what it is in the case of material substances. For wherever diversity of grades exists, the grades must be considered through their order to some one principle. Therefore in material substances diverse grades acre observed to diversify species in relation to the first principle, matter. For this reason first species [i.e., those nearest to matter] are most imperfect, whereas species farther removed [from matter] are more perfect, and related to the first by the addition [of higher perfections]. For instance, mixed bodies have a more perfect species than the elements have, because they possess in themselves the perfections of the elements and higher perfections as well. Hence the relation of plants to mineral bodies, and that of animals to plants, is similar.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>In substantiis vero immaterialibus ordo graduum diversarum specierum attenditur, non quidem secundum comparationem ad materiam, quam non habent, sed secundum comparationem ad primum agens, quod oportet esse perfectissimum. Et ideo prima species in eis est perfectior secunda, utpote similior primo agenti; et secunda diminuitur a perfectione primae et sic deinceps usque ad ultimam earum. Summa autem perfectio primi agentis in hoc consistit, quod in uno simplici habet omnimodam bonitatem et perfectionem. Unde quanto aliqua substantia immaterialis fuerit primo agenti propinquior, tanto in sua natura simplici perfectiorem habet bonitatem suam et minus indiget inhaerentibus formis ad sui completionem. Et hoc quidem gradatim producitur usque ad animam humanam, quae in eis tenet ultimum gradum, sicut materia prima in genere rerum sensibilium; unde in sui natura non habet perfectiones intelligibiles, sed est in potentia ad intelligibilia, sicut materia prima ad formas sensibiles. Unde ad propriam operationem indiget ut fiat in actu formarum intelligibilium, acquirendo eas per sensitivas potentias a rebus exterioribus; et cum operatio sensus sit per organum corporale, ex ipsa conditione suae naturae competit ei quod corpori uniatur, et quod sit pars speciei humanae, non habens in se speciem completam.
          <td>In the case of immaterial substances the order of diverse grades of species is certainly not considered in relationship to matter, which they do not have, but in relationship to the First Agent [i.e., God], who must be most perfect. Consequently in the case of immaterial substances the first species [i.e., the one nearest to God] is more perfect than the second, inasmuch as the former bears greater likeness to the First Agent. The second species has less perfection than the first, and so on successively down to the last of them. Now the entire perfection of the First Agent consists in this, that He has in one simple nature all His goodness and perfection. Therefore the nearer an immaterial substance is to the First Agent, the more does it have its perfection and goodness in one simple nature, and the less does it require inhering forms for its perfection. This continues progressively down to the human soul which occupies the lowest place [among immaterial substances], just as prime matter holds the lowest place in the genus of sensible things. Hence the soul does not have intelligible forms in its very nature, but is in potency to them, just as matter is to sensible forms. Therefore in order to perform its proper operation, the soul requires to be actuated by intelligible forms by acquiring them from external realities through its sensory powers. And since the operation of a sense is performed through a bodily organ, it is proper to the soul, according to the very condition of its nature, to be united to the body, and to be part of the human species, not having a complete species in itself.

Manifestum est enim, quod si formae quae sunt principia operationum, differunt specie, necesse est et operationes ipsas specie differre; sicut calefacere et infrigidare differunt secundum differentiam caloris et frigoris. Species autem intelligibiles quibus animae intelligunt sunt a phantasmatibus abstractae; et ita non sunt eiusdem rationis cum speciebus intelligibilibus quibus Angeli intelligunt, quae sunt eis innatae, secundum quod dicitur in libro de causis quod omnis intelligentia est plena formis. Unde et intelligere hominis et Angeli non est eiusdem speciei.

          <td>1. The act of understanding of the angel and that of the soul are not specifically the same. For it is evident that if forms, which are principles of operation, differ in species, their operations must differ in species as well. For instance, the act of heating and that of cooling differ from each other because heat and cold differ. Now the intelligible species, through which the soul understands, are abstracted from phantasms, and thus are not of the same nature as the intelligible species through which angels understand, because these are innate in the angels. Accordingly it is said in the book <i>De causis</i> [X] that every intelligence is filled with forms. Therefore the act of understanding of a man and that of an angel are not specifically the same. In view of this difference it follows that the angel understands without any discourse, whereas the human soul understands discursively. It does this of necessity in order to know the powers of causes from their sensible effects, and to understand the essences of things, not perceived by the senses, from their sensible accidents.

          <td>3. A motion is reduced to the genus and species of that particular order in which the motion is terminated, inasmuch as it is the same form that is in potency only before the motion begins, midway between act and potency during the motion itself, in complete act at the termination of the motion. However, an angel’s act of understanding, which takes place without any discourse, is not specifically the same as that of the soul so far as the form is concerned. Consequently it is not necessary that these two ways of understanding be specifically one and the same.

A thing’s species is declared to be such in virtue of the operation that belongs to it by its own nature, and not in virtue of one that belongs to it because it participates in a higher nature. The species of iron, for instance, is not judged to be such because it is combustible, which belongs to it inasmuch as it is set on fire, for then the species of iron and that of wood, which also may be set on fire, would be considered to be the same. Moreover, I say that the act of intellection in the Word is an operation surpassing the nature of the soul and that of an angel, yet proper to each according as they participate in a superior nature, namely, the divine nature, through the light of glory. Consequently it cannot be concluded that an angel and the soul are specifically the same.

Unde dicitur in Lib. de causis, quod superiores intelligentiae intelligunt per formas magis universales; et Dionysius dicit, quod superiores Angeli habent scientiam magis universalem. Et ideo intelligere diversorum Angelorum non est eiusdem speciei, licet utrumque sit sine discursu; quia intelligunt per species innatas, non aliunde acceptas.

Intelligible species are not of the same nature in different angels; for the more superior an intellectual substance is, and the nearer to God (whom all understand through one thing, His essence), the more elevated are the intelligible forms within that substance, and thus more capable of knowing many things. Wherefore it is said in the book <i>De causis</i> [ibid.] that superior intelligences understand through more universal forms. Dionysius also says [De cael. hier., XII, 2] that superior angels have greater universal knowledge. Therefore the act of understanding of different angels is not specifically the same, although each takes place without discourse, because they understand through innate species and not through species received in some other way.

Secondly, when something known is understood through the species whereby it is understood, as when we see a stone through the species of the stone, which [species] exists in the eye.

        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et videtur quod non. Anima enim rationalis est subtilissima formarum corpori unitarum. Terra autem est infima corporum. Non ergo fuit conveniens quod corpori terreno uniretur.
          <td>1. It seems that it should not. For the rational soul is the subtlest of all forms united to a body. Now earth is the lowest of all [elemental] bodies. Therefore the soul is not fittingly united to an earthly body.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed dicebat, hoc corpus terrenum ex hoc quod reductum est ad aequalitatem complexionis, similitudinem habere cum caelo, quod omnino caret contrariis; et sic nobilitatur, ut ei anima rationalis convenienter possit uniri. —Sed contra, si nobilitas corporis humani in hoc consistit quod corpori caelesti assimiletur, sequitur quod corpus caeleste nobilius sit. Sed anima rationalis nobilior est omni forma, cum capacitate sui intellectus omnia corpora transcendat. Ergo anima rationalis magis deberet corpori caelesti uniri.
          <td>2. But in view of the fact that an earthly body is reduced to a harmonious combination [of the elements], it must be said that such a body is similar to a celestial body, which is without contraries altogether, and thus is ennobled in order that a rational soul may be fittingly united to it. On the other hand, if the nobility of the human body consists in its likeness to a celestial body, it follows that a celestial body is nobler. But the rational soul is nobler than all other forms, because it transcends all bodies by its intellectual capacity. Therefore the rational soul should be united rather to a celestial body.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed dicebat quod corpus caeleste nobiliori perfectione perficitur quam sit anima rationalis. Sed contra, si perfectio corporis caelestis nobilior est anima rationali, oportet quod sit intelligens: quia quodcumque intelligens quolibet non intelligente nobilius est. Si igitur corpus caeleste aliqua substantia intellectuali perficitur, aut erit motor eius tantum, aut erit forma. Si tantum motor, adhuc remanet quod corpus humanum sit nobiliori modo perfectum quam corpus caeleste: forma enim dat speciem ei cuius est forma, non autem motor. Unde etiam nihil prohibet aliqua quae secundum sui naturam ignobilia sunt, esse instrumenta nobilissimi agentis. Si autem substantia intellectualis est forma corporis caelestis, aut huiusmodi substantia habet intellectum tantum, aut cum intellectu sensum et alias potentias. Si habet sensum et alias potentias, cum huiusmodi potentias necesse sit esse actus organorum quibus indigent ad operandum, sequetur quod corpus caeleste sit corpus organicum; quod ipsius simplicitati et uniformitati et unitati repugnat. Si vero habet intellectum tantum a sensu nihil accipientem, huiusmodi substantia in nullo indigebit unione corporis; quia operatio intellectus non fit per organum corporale. Cum igitur unio corporis et animae non sit propter corpus, sed propter animam, quia materiae sunt propter formam, et non e converso; sequetur quod intellectualis substantia non uniatur corpori caelesti ut forma.
          <td>3. But it must be said that a celestial body is perfected by a nobler perfection than the rational soul. On the other hand, if the perfection of a celestial body is nobler than that of a rational soul, it must be intelligent, because any intelligent being is nobler than any non-intelligent being whatever. Therefore, if a celestial body is perfected by an intellectual substance, this substance will be either the mover only of such a body, or will be its form. If it is only a mover, it follows that the human body is perfected in a nobler way than a celestial body is, for a form gives species to the thing of which it is the form, whereas a mover does not. Again, nothing prevents certain things ignoble by nature from being instruments of the noblest agent. However, if an intellectual substance is the form of a celestial body, such a substance has either an intellect alone, or senses and other powers together with an intellect. If it has senses and other powers, it follows that a celestial body is an organic body, because powers of this sort must be the acts of organs, which are required for the operations of such powers. This is opposed to the simplicity, uniformity, and unity of a celestial body. If, indeed, such a substance has an intellect alone and receives nothing from sense, then it does not need to be united to a body, because the operation of an intellect is not performed through a bodily organ. Therefore, since the body is united to the soul not for the sake of the body but for that of the soul (because any matter exists for the sake of form, and not vice versa), it follows that an intellectual substance is not united as a form to a celestial body.

          <td>Praeterea, omnis substantia intellectualis creata habet ex sui natura possibilitatem ad peccatum, quia potest averti a summo bono quod est Deus. Si igitur aliae substantiae intellectuales uniantur corporibus caelestibus ut formae, sequitur quod peccare poterunt. Poena autem peccati mors est, id est separatio animae a corpore, et cruciatio peccantium in Inferno. Potuit ergo fieri quod corpora caelestia morerentur per separationem animarum et quod animae in Inferno retruderentur.
          <td>4. Further, every created intellectual substance is capable of sinning by reason of its nature, because it can turn away from the Highest Good, which is God. Therefore, if intellectual substances were united [substantially] as forms to celestial bodies, it would follow that they could commit sin. But the punishment for sin is death, that is, the separation of the soul from the body, and the punishment of the sinners in hell. Consequently it could happen that celestial bodies would corrupt by having their souls separated from them, and that these souls would be cast into hell.

          <td>5. Further, every intellectual substance is capable of attaining beatitude. Therefore, if celestial bodies are animated by intellectual souls, such souls are capable of beatitude; and thus not only angels and men, but also certain intermediate natures enjoy eternal beatitude. However, when the holy doctors consider this matter, they say that the society of the blessed is composed of men and angels.

Ergo huiusmodi corpora, qualia nos habemus, non sunt proportionata animae rationali.
          <td>6. Further, the body of Adam was proportioned to a rational soul. But our body is unlike his, for his body was immortal and unchangeable before he sinned. Our bodies do not have these characteristics. Therefore bodies such as we possess are not proportioned to a rational soul.

          <td>Praeterea, nobilissimo motori debentur instrumenta optime disposita et obedientia ad operationem. Anima autem rationalis est nobilior inter motores inferiores.

Huiusmodi autem non est corpus quale nos habemus; quia caro resistit spiritui, et anima propter pugnam concupiscentiarum distrahitur hac atque illac. Non igitur anima rationalis tali corpori debuit uniri.
          <td>7. Further, the best disposed instruments, and those which cooperate in operation, belong to the noblest mover. Now the rational soul is nobler than all other inferior movers. Hence the rational soul should have a body that cooperates with it to the fullest extent in carrying out its operations. However, a body such as ours is not of this sort, because the flesh lusts against the spirit (Gal- 5:17), and the soul is drawn here and there as a result of the struggle between concupiscences. Consequently the rational soul should not be united to a body such as we possess.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, animae rationali contingit abundantia spirituum in corpore perfectibili; unde cor hominis est calidissimum inter caetera animalia quantum ad virtutem generandi spiritus; quod significat ipsa corporis humani rectitudo, ex virtute caloris et spirituum proveniens. Convenientissimum igitur fuisset quod anima rationalis totaliter spirituali corpori fuisset unita.
          <td>8. Further, an abundance of spirits falls to the lot of a rational soul in a perfectible body. Hence in contrast to other animals, the heart of man is the hottest so far as the power of generating spirits is concerned. The human body’s erectness, resulting from the power of heat and spirits, is a sign of this. Therefore it would be most fitting for the rational soul to be united entirely to a spiritual body.

          <td>10. Further, the rational soul is united to the body in order to constitute the human species. Now the human species would be better preserved if the body to which the rational soul is united, were incorruptible, because then it would not be necessary for the human species to be preserved by generation, for it would be preserved numerically in the same individuals. Hence the human soul should be united to an incorruptible body.

          <td>Praeterea, corpus humanum, ut sit nobilissimum inter inferiora corpora, debet esse simillimum corpori caelesti, quod est nobilissimum corporum.

Corpora autem nostra non habent minimum de contrarietate; alia enim corpora, ut lapidum et arborum, sunt durabiliora, cum tamen contrarietas sit principium dissolutionis. Non ergo anima rationalis debuit talibus corporibus uniri qualia nos habemus.
          <td>11. Further, the human body, being the noblest of inferior bodies, should resemble most a celestial body, which is the noblest of bodies. However, a celestial body lacks contrariety altogether. Therefore the human body ought to have the least contrariety. But our bodies do not have the least contrariety, because other bodies, such as stones and trees, are more enduring, and contrariety is the principle of disintegration. Consequently the rational soul should not be united to bodies such as we have.

          <td>Praeterea, anima est forma simplex. Formae autem simplici competit materia simplex. Debuit igitur anima rationalis alicui simplici corpori uniri utpote igni vel aeri, vel alicui huiusmodi.
          <td>12. Further, the soul is a simple form. Now a simple matter befits a simple form. Hence the rational soul should be united to some simple body such as fire or gold or something of this kind.

          <td>13. Further, the human soul seems to have something in common with principles. Hence the ancient philosophers maintained that the soul is composed of principles, as is clear in the <i>De anima</i> [I, 2, 404b 7]. Now the principles of bodies are the elements. Therefore, if the soul is not an element, nor composed of elements, it should at least be united to some elementary body such as fire or gold, or something of this sort.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, corpora similium partium minus recedunt a simplicitate quam corpora dissimilium partium. Cum igitur anima sit forma simplex, magis debuit uniri corpori similium partium quam corpori dissimilium.
          <td>14. Further, bodies composed of similar parts come closer to being simple than bodies composed of dissimilar parts. Consequently the soul should be united to a body composed of similar parts rather than to one composed of dissimilar parts, because the soul is a form in its entirety ( <i>simplex</i> ).
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, anima unitur corpori ut forma et ut motor. Debuit igitur anima rationalis, quae est nobilissima formarum, uniri corpori agillimo ad motum, cuius contrarium videmus; nam corpora avium sunt agiliora ad motum, et similiter corpora multorum animalium quam corpora hominum.
          <td>15. Further, the soul is united both as a form and as a mover to the body. Therefore the rational soul, which is the noblest of forms, should be united to a body best adapted for movement. But we see that the contrary of this is true, for the bodies of birds and those of many other animals as well, are better adapted for movement than the human body is.

          <td>16. Further, Plato says” that forms are conferred by the giver of forms according to the merits of matter, which are called material dispositions. But apparently the human body does not have a disposition in keeping with the nobility of its form, for the body is “gross” and corruptible. Therefore the soul should not be united to such a body.

          <td>17. Further, the intelligible forms existing in the human soul, in contrast to those in superior intellectual substances, are in the highest degree representative of particulars. But such forms befit the operation of a celestial body, which is the cause of the generation and corruption of these particulars. Consequently the human soul should be united to a celestial body.

          <td>18. Further, nothing is moved naturally so long as it occupies its [proper place], but only when it is outside its proper place. However, a heaven is moved while it exists in its [proper] place. Therefore it is not moved naturally. Consequently it is moved with respect to place by a soul, and thus has a soul united to it.

          <td>19. Further, “to proclaim” is an act of an intellectual substance. But “the heavens proclaim the glory of God,” as is said in the Psalms (Ps. 18:5). Hence the heavens are intelligent, and therefore possess an intellective soul.

          <td>20. Further, the soul is the most perfect of forms. Therefore it should be united to a most perfect body. However, the human body seems to be most imperfect, for it neither has arms to defend itself and to fight, nor covering nor anything of this sort which nature has bestowed on the bodies of other animals. Therefore a soul of this kind should not be united to a body such as ours.

          <td>Respondeo. Dicendum quod cum materia sit propter formam, et non e converso, ex parte animae oportet accipere rationem, quale debeat esse corpus cui unitur. Unde in II de anima dicitur quod anima non solum est corporis forma et motor, sed etiam finis. Est autem ex superius disputatis quaestionibus manifestum, quod ideo naturale est animae humanae corpori uniri, quia cum sit infima in ordine intellectualium substantiarum, sicut materia prima est infima in ordine rerum sensibilium; non habet anima humana intelligibiles species sibi naturaliter inditas, quibus in operationem propriam exire possit quae est intelligere, sicut habent superiores substantiae intellectuales, sed est in potentia ad eas, cum sit sicut tabula rasa, in qua nihil est scriptum, ut dicitur in III de anima. Unde oportet quod species intelligibiles a rebus exterioribus accipiat mediantibus potentiis sensitivis, quae sine corporeis organis operationes proprias habere non possunt. Unde et animam humanam necesse est corpori uniri.
          <td><b>I answer:</b> Since matter exists for the sake of form and not vice versa, we must discover, on the side of the soul, the reason why the body should be united to it. Hence it is said, in the <i>De anima</i> [II, 4, 415b 10] that the soul is not only the form and mover of the body but also its end. Moreover, it is evident, from the preceding Disputed Questions [De spiritualibus creaturis, 3] that it is natural for the human soul to be united to the body. For, although the soul is lowest in the order of intellectual substances (as primary matter is lowest in the order of sensible things), it does not have intelligible species naturally impressed on it, as superior intellectual substances have, whereby it can perform its proper operation of intellection; but is in potency to them because it is like “ a wax tablet on which nothing is written, as is said in the <i>De anima</i> [III, 4, 429b 32]. For this reason it must receive its intelligible species from external things through its sensory powers, which cannot perform their proper operations without bodily organs. Consequently it is necessary for the human soul to be united to a body.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Si ergo propter hoc anima humana unibilis est corpori, quia indiget accipere species intelligibiles a rebus mediante sensu; necessarium est quod corpus, cui anima rationalis unitur, tale sit ut possit esse aptissimum ad repraesentandum intellectui species sensibiles, ex quibus in intellectu intelligibiles species resultent. Sic ergo oportet corpus cui anima rationalis unitur, esse optime dispositum ad sentiendum. Sed cum plures sint sensus, unus tamen est qui est fundamentum aliorum, scilicet tactus, in quo principaliter tota natura sensitiva consistit. Unde et in II de anima dicitur, quod propter hunc sensum primo animal dicitur. Et inde est quod immobilitato hoc sensu, ut in somno accidit, omnes alii sensus immobilitantur. Et iterum omnes alii sensus non solum solvuntur ab excellentia propriorum sensibilium, sicut visus a rebus multum fulgidis et auditus a maximis sonis; sed etiam ab excellentia sensibilium secundum tactum, ut a forti calore vel frigore. Cum igitur corpus cui anima rationalis unitur debeat esse optime dispositum ad naturam sensitivam, necessarium est ut habeat convenientissimum organum sensus tactus. Propter quod dicitur in II de anima quod hunc sensum habemus certiorem inter omnia animalia; et quod propter bonitatem huius sensus etiam unus homo alio est habilior ad intellectuales operationes. Molles enim carne (qui sunt boni tactus) aptos mente videmus.
          <td>Therefore, if the human soul is capable of being united to a body, because it needs to receive intelligible species from things through the intermediary of the senses, then the body, to which the rational soul is united, must be one which can most adequately present to the intellect those sensible species from which are derived the intelligible species existing in the intellect. Hence the body to which the rational soul is united must be best disposed for sensory operation. But although there are several sensory powers, still there is one which is the basis of the others, namely, touch, in which every sensible nature is principally rooted. For this reason it is also said in the <i>De anima</i> [II, 2, 413b8] that an animal derives its name from this sense. This is the reason why, when this sense is unmoved, as occurs during sleep, all other senses are unmoved. Again, not only are all the other senses rendered inactive by an excess of their proper sensible [objects] as sight, for instance, is made inoperative by very bright objects, and hearing by too intense sounds, but so also is the sense of touch rendered incapable of performing its proper operation ( <i>solvuntur</i> ) by an excess of its sensible object, for example, excessive warmth or cold. Therefore, since the body to which the rational soul is united must be best disposed for a sentient nature, it must have the most competent organ of touch. And so it is said in the <i>De anima</i> [II, 9, 421a 20] that among all animals we have this sense to a greater degree, and also that one man is more adept than another in intellectual operations as a result of this sense. For we see that those who have tender flesh (those who are of good touch) are well-endowed mentally.

          <td>Cum autem organum cuiuslibet sensus non debeat habere in actu contraria, quorum sensus est perceptivus, sed esse in potentia ad illa, ut possit ea recipere, quia recipiens debet esse denudatum a recepto; aliter necesse est hoc esse in organo tactus, et in organis aliorum sensuum. Organum enim visus, scilicet pupilla, caret omnino albo et nigro, et universaliter omni genere coloris; et similiter est in auditu et in olfactu. Hoc autem in tactu accidere non potest. Nam tactus est cognoscitivus eorum ex quibus necesse est componi corpus animalis, scilicet caloris et frigoris, humidi et sicci; unde impossibile est quod organum tactus omnino sit denudatum a genere sui sensibilis, sed oportet quod sit reductum ad medium, sic enim est in potentia ad contraria. Corpus ergo cui anima rationalis unitur, cum debeat esse convenientissimum ad sensum tactus, oportet quod sit maxime reductum ad medium per aequalitatem complexionis.
          <td>Now since the organ of any sense must not possess actually any of the contraries of which a sense is perceptive, but must be in potency to them in order that it may be able to receive them (because the recipient must be deprived of the thing received), the case must be otherwise for the organ of touch than it is for the organs of the other senses. For the organ of sight, that is, the pupil of the eye, is deprived completely of white and of black, and of every kind of color whatever. It is similar in the case of hearing and smell. But this cannot occur in the case of the sense of touch, for touch is capable of experiencing those qualities which the animal body must be composed of, namely, hot and cold, wet and dry. For this reason it is impossible for the organ of touch to be deprived completely of its sensible objects; rather must it be reduced to a mean, because in this way it is in potency to contraries. Therefore, since the body to which the rational soul is united must be best disposed for the sense of touch, it must be brought in the fullest measure to an intermediate state by the harmonious combination [of its constituent elements and their qualities].

          <td>In this way it is evident that the total operation of an inferior nature reaches its highest peak in man as a most perfect being. For we see that the operation of nature ascends progressively from the simple elements, by blending them, until it reaches the most perfect mode of combination, which is the human body. Consequently this disposition of the human body, to which the rational soul is united, must exist in order that the body may possess the most tempered combination.

Ideo factus est homo habens maius cerebrum inter omnia animalia, secundum proportionem suae quantitatis; et ut liberior sit eius operatio habet caput sursum positum; quia solus homo est animal rectum, alia vero animalia curva incedunt. Et ad hanc rectitudinem habendam et conservandam necessaria fuit abundantia caloris in corde, per quam multi spiritus generentur; ut per caloris abundantiam et spirituum, corpus possit in directum sustineri.

Therefore man, in proportion to his size, has a larger brain than any other animal, because a good disposition of the brain is necessary for the good condition of the internal sentient powers, namely, the imagination, the memory, and the cogitative power. And in order that his operation may be freer, he has his head placed on high. For man is the only erect animal, the others, indeed, are bent over. Furthermore, in order to have this erectness and to preserve it, there must exist in the heart an abundance of heat (by which many spirits are generated) so that the body may be maintained erect by this copious amount of heat and spirits. The fact that a man stoops over when he is old is a sign of this, because his natural heat is diminished.

Sic igitur et in corpore humano contingit: quod enim taliter sit commixtum et secundum partes dispositum ut sit convenientissimum ad operationes sensitivas, est electum in hac materia a factore hominis; sed quod hoc corpus sit corruptibile, fatigabile et huiusmodi defectus habeat, consequitur ex necessitate materiae. Necesse est enim corpus sic mixtum ex contrariis subiacere talibus defectibus. Nec potest obviari per hoc quod Deus potuit aliter facere: quia in institutione naturae non quaeritur quid Deus facere potuit, sed quid rerum natura patitur ut fiat, secundum Augustinum super Genes. ad Litter.
          <td>In the light of what is stated above, the nature of a disposition of the human body must be determined in relation to the particular [dispositions] proper to man. However, we must take into consideration that in those things which are constituted of matter, some dispositions exist in the matter itself, and that on account of these a definite matter is chosen for a definite form. There are also some dispositions which proceed from the necessary character of matter, and not from the choice of the agent. For instance, when an artisan chooses hardness in iron to make a saw in order that it may be useful for sawing. But the fact that sharpness can be given to iron, and that it can rust, results from the necessary character of matter. For the artisan would rather choose a matter in which defects are not present, if it could be found. But because it cannot be found, the artisan does not neglect to work with the available matter of this kind simply because of the defects intrinsic to such matter. This also occurs in the human body, for, likewise, whatever is combined and disposed according to parts in order that such a body may be best fitted for sentient operations, is selected in this matter by the Maker of man. But that this body is corruptible, that it may become fatigued, and have defects of this kind, follows from the necessary character of this matter. For the body, as a mixture of contraries, must be subject to such defects. Nor can any objection be raised in view of the fact that God could make it otherwise, because we do not investigate what God could make in the establishment of nature, but what the nature of things undergoes as made, as Augustine says in the <i>Super Genesim ad litteram</i> [II, 1].

          <td>Sciendum tamen est, quod in remedium horum defectuum Deus homini in sua institutione contulit auxilium iustitiae originalis, per quam corpus esset omnino subditum animae, quamdiu anima Deo subderetur; ita quod nec mors nec aliqua passio vel defectus homini accideret, nisi prius anima separaretur a Deo. Sed per peccatum anima recedente a Deo, homo privatus est hoc beneficio; et subiacet defectibus secundum quod natura materiae requirit.
          <td>Moreover, it must be recognized that when God remedied these defects in man at his creation, He employed the help of original justice whereby the body was made subject completely to the soul and the soul to God, so that neither death nor passion nor any defect could affect man unless the soul were first separated from God. But when the soul turned away from God through sin, man was deprived of this gift, and is subject to the defects which are intrinsic to the nature of matter.

          <td>Ad primum ergo dicendum quod, licet anima sit subtilissima formarum in quantum est intelligens — quia tamen, cum sit infima in genere formarum intelligibilium, indiget corpori uniri, quod fit mediante complexione, ad hoc quod per sensus species intelligibiles possit acquirere — necessarium fuit quod corpus cui unitur haberet plus in quantitate de gravibus elementis, scilicet terra et aqua. Cum enim ignis sit efficacissimae virtutis in agendo, nisi secundum quantitatem inferiora elementa excederent, non posset fieri commixtio et maxime reducta ad medium; ignis enim alia elementa consumeret. Unde in II de Generat., philosophus dicit, quod in corporibus mixtis materialiter abundat plus terra et aqua.
          <td>1. The soul, being intellectual, is the subtlest of forms, but it is lowest in the order of intellectual forms, and must be united to a body in order to acquire intelligible species through the senses. This union is effected through a combination of the elements. The body, to which the soul is united, had to contain a greater quantity of the heavy elements, namely, of earth and water [than the light elements, fire and air]. For fire is the most active of all the elements. If the lower elements [earth and water] were not present in greater quantity, the aforesaid combination could not be brought about nor above all be reduced to a mean, because fire would consume the other elements. For this reason the Philosopher, in the <i>De generatione et corruptione</i> [II, 8, 334b 31], states that earth and water are more abundant [than air and fire] in mixed bodies.

Sed tamen, secundum opinionem Avicennae, unitur tali corpori proprie propter similitudinem caeli: ipse enim voluit inferiora a superioribus causari, ut scilicet corpora inferiora causarentur a corporibus caelestibus; et cum pervenirent ad similitudinem corporum caelestium per aequalitatem complexionis, sortirentur formam similem corpori caelesti, quod ponitur esse animatum.
          <td>2. The rational soul is united to this kind of body, not because it is like a celestial body, but because it is composed of a harmonious combination [of the elements]. But it follows that it bears some likeness to a celestial body, in this way, by being relatively independent of contraries. However, according to the opinion of Avicenna, the soul is united to such a body particularly because of its likeness to a celestial body. For he desired that inferior things be caused by the superior beings, in order that inferior bodies might be caused by the celestial bodies. And [he maintained] that these inferior bodies possess a form similar to that of a celestial body (which is considered to be animated), since such inferior bodies bear some likeness to celestial bodies because of their harmonious combination.

          <td>Ad tertium dicendum quod de animatione corporum caelestium est diversa opinio et apud philosophos et apud fidei doctores. Nam apud philosophos Anaxagoras posuit intellectum agentem esse omnino immixtum et separatum, et corpora caelestia esse inanimata; unde etiam damnatus ad mortem dicitur esse propter hoc quod dixit solem esse quasi lapidem ignitum, ut Augustinus narrat in libro de Civit. Dei. Alii vero philosophi posuerunt corpora caelestia esse animata. Quorum quidam dixerunt Deum esse animam caeli, quod fuit ratio idololatriae, ut scilicet caelo et corporibus caelestibus cultus divinus attribueretur. Alii vero, ut Plato et Aristoteles, licet ponerent corpora caelestia esse animata, ponebant tamen Deum esse aliquid superius ab anima caeli omnino separatum. Apud doctores etiam fidei Origenes et sequaces ipsius posuerunt corpora caelestia esse animata. Quidam vero posuerunt ea inanimata, ut Damascenus ponit: quae etiam positio apud modernos theologos est communior: quod Augustinus relinquit sub dubio, II super Genes. ad litteram, et in libro Enchir. Hoc igitur pro firmo tenentes quod corpora caelestia ab aliquo intellectu moventur, saltem separato, propter argumenta utramque partem sustinentes, dicamus aliquam substantiam intellectualem esse perfectionem corporis caelestis ut formam, quae quidem habet solam potentiam intellectivam, non autem sensitivam ut ex verbis Aristotelis accipi potest in II de anima, et in XI Metaph. Quamvis Avicenna ponat quod anima caeli cum intellectu etiam habeat imaginationem. Si autem habet intellectum tantum, unitur tamen corpori ut forma, non propter operationem intellectualem, sed propter executionem virtutis activae, secundum quam potest adipisci divinam similitudinem in causando per motum caeli.
          <td>3. There is a diversity of opinion, both among philosophers and among the doctors of the faith, concerning the animation of the celestial bodies. For among the philosophers, Anaxagoras maintained that the agent intellect was altogether simple ( <i>immixtum</i> ) and existed apart from things, and that the celestial bodies were inanimate. Hence it is said that he was even condemned to death because he claimed that the sun was a fiery stone, as Augustine relates in the work <i>De civitate Dei</i> [18:41]. Other philosophers, indeed, maintained that the celestial bodies are animated. Some of these stated that God is the soul of the heavens, which was idolatrous inasmuch as it attributed divine worship to the heavens and the heavenly bodies. Others, indeed, such as Plato and Aristotle, who, although they claimed that the celestial bodies are animated, nevertheless maintained that God is a supreme being, quite distinct from the soul of the heavens. Among the doctors of the faith as well, Origen [Peri Archon, II, 7]and his followers held that such bodies are inanimate, as Damascene did [De fide ortho., II, 6]. This is also the more common position among modern theologians. That Augustine remained in doubt [on the question, is shown in] the <i>Super Genesim ad litteram</i> [II, 18] and in the work <i>Enchiridion</i> [58]. Therefore, holding this for a fact, that the celestial bodies are moved by an intellect which is separate, we say (maintaining both positions on account of the arguments supporting both sides) that an intellectual substance, as a form, is the perfection of the celestial body, and that it has an intellective power alone but no sensory power, as can be seen from the words of Aristotle in the <i>De anima</i> [II, 1, 413a6] and in the <i>Metaphysics</i> [XI, 2, 1060a 10], even though Avicenna maintains that the soul of the heavens has an imagination in addition to its intellect. However, if it has an intellect only, it is still united as a form to the body, not for the sake of intellectual operation, but for the sake of executing its active power according to which it can attain a certain likeness to divine causality by moving the, heavens.

          <td>4. Although all created intellectual substances by nature are capable of committing sin, still many are preserved from so doing by divine choice and predestination through the aid of grace. One can maintain that the souls of the celestial bodies are among this number, particularly if the demons who sinned were of an inferior order, as Damascene held [De fide orth., II, 4].

          <td>5. If the celestial bodies are animated, their souls belong to the society of the angels. For Augustine says in the <i>Enchiridion</i> [58]: “I do not hold for certain that the sun and moon, and the other stars belong to the same society,” namely, that of the angels, “for although some are luminous bodies, still they do not appear to be sentient or intellective.”

          <td>7. The struggle which occurs in man as a result of contrary concupiscences, also results from the necessary character of matter. For, given the fact that man has sense, it is necessary that he sense delectable objects, and that he pursue his concupiscence for such objects, which is generally opposed to reason. But in the state of innocence, man was also given a remedy against this through grace so that the inferior powers were not moved in any way contrary to reason. However, man lost this through sin.

Nihilominus tamen in animalibus causa longitudinis vitae est ut humidum non sit facile desiccabile vel congelabile et calidum non sit facile extinguibile: quia vita in calido et humido consistit. Hoc autem in homine invenitur secundum aliquam mensuram, quam requirit complexio reducta ad medium. Unde quaedam sunt homine durabiliora, et quaedam minus durabilia; et secundum hoc quidam homines durabiliores sunt aliis.
          <td>11. Those things which are most akin in nature to the elements, and possess greater contrariety, such as stones and metals, are more enduring, because in them the elements are less subtly proportioned ( <i>harmonia</i> ), and thus they are not easily disintegrated. For the blending of the elements in those things which are subtly proportioned, is easily destroyed. Notwithstanding, the cause of longevity in animals is attributed to the fact that the moisture which they contain is not easily dried up or made inactive, nor is their heat easily extinguished, because heat and moisture are indispensable for life. Moreover, this is found in man to the extent that it is necessary for a combination [of the elements] reduced to a mean. Hence in men some combinations are more enduring, others less so, and as a result of this some men live longer than others.

Aristoteles autem postmodum ostendit quod anima cognoscit omnia in quantum est similis omnibus in potentia, non in actu. Unde oportet corpus cui unitur, non esse in extremo, sed in medio, ut sic sit in potentia ad contraria.
          <td>13. The nature philosophers of antiquity thought that the soul, which knows all things, must actually be like all things. And therefore they maintained that the soul possessed the nature of an element, which they held was the principle from which all things are said to be constituted, so that in this way the soul knew all things inasmuch as it was like all things. However, Aristotle later showed that the soul knows all things inasmuch as it is like all things potentially, not actually. Consequently the body to which it is united must be composed not of extremes but of a mean, so that it may thus be in potency to contraries.

          <td>15. The soul is not united to the body for the sake of local motion; rather is the local motion of man, like that of other animals, directed to conserving the body which is united to the soul. But the soul is united to the body for the sake of intellection, which is its proper and principal operation. For this reason the body, being united to the rational soul, must be best disposed to serve the soul with respect to the things necessary for intellection. It is also necessary that the body possess agility and other things of this kind, so far as such a disposition permits this.

Sed secundum sententiam Aristotelis, formae naturales non per se subsistunt; unde unio formae ad materiam non est propter materiam, sed propter formam. Non igitur quia materia est sic disposita talis forma sibi datur; sed ut forma sit talis oportuit materiam sic disponi. Et sic supra dictum est quod corpus hominis dispositum est secundum quod competit tali formae.
          <td>16. Plato maintained that the form of things subsisted of themselves, and that the participation of forms by material things is for the sake of material things inasmuch as they are thereby perfected, and not for the sake of the forms themselves, which subsist of themselves. From this it follows that forms are given to material things so far as they merit them. Now according to the view of Aristotle, natural forms do not subsist of themselves. Hence a form is united to matter not for the sake of matter, but for the sake of form. Therefore a certain form is given to matter not because matter is so disposed, but because a certain form requires matter to be so disposed. For this reason it was said above that the human body is disposed in a manner befitting such a form as the human soul.

Unde motor corporis caelestis non oportet quod habeat formas particulares sed universales, sive sit anima sive motor separatus. Avicenna tamen posuit, quod oportebat animam caeli habere imaginationem, per quam particularia comprehenderet. Cum enim sit causa motus caeli, secundum quem revolvitur caelum in hoc ubi et in illo, oportet animam caeli, quae est causa motus, cognoscere hic et nunc; et ita oportet quod habeat aliquam potentiam sensitivam. Sed hoc non est necessarium. Primo quidem, quia motus caelestis est semper uniformis et non recipit impedimentum; et ideo universalis conceptio sufficit ad causandum talem motum. Particularis enim conceptio requiritur in motibus animalium propter irregularitatem motus, et impedimenta quae possunt provenire. Deinde, quia etiam substantiae intellectuales superiores possunt particularia cognoscere sine potentia sensitiva, sicut alibi ostensum est.
          <td>17. Although a celestial body is the cause of the particular things which are generated and corrupted, nevertheless it causes them as a common agent. For this reason determinate agents of a particular species are required beneath it. Hence it is not necessary for the mover of a celestial body, whether it be a soul or a separate mover, to have particular forms, but only universal ones. Now Avicenna maintained that the soul of a celestial body had to have an imagination through which it could apprehend particulars. For the soul of a heaven, being the cause of its motion, must know the here and the now, and therefore must have some sensory power, because it is the cause of the celestial motion whereby a heaven revolves in this or that [particular] place. But this is not necessary. First, indeed, because celestial motion is always uniform and is not hindered, and therefore a universal conception is sufficient to cause such movement. For a knowledge of the particular is required in the case of animal movements on account of the irregularity of such movement, and because obstacles can hinder such movement. Secondly, because superior intellectual substances can apprehend particulars without a sensory power, as was shown elsewhere.

Corpus autem quod circulariter movetur totum quidem non mutat locum subiecto, sed ratione tantum; unde nunquam est extra suum ubi.
          <td>18. The movement of a heaven is natural on account of a passive principle or of movement received, because such movement belongs naturally to such a body. But the active principle of this movement is a certain intellectual substance. Now the statement that no body is moved naturally when it is in its proper place, is understood of a body moved by rectilinear movement, and this body changes place with respect to the whole of itself not only from the point of view of reason, but also from that of the subject itself. But a body which is moved circularly does not change place with respect to the whole of itself [from the point of view of the subject] but only from that of reason. Hence it never is outside its [proper] place.

          <td>19. This argument is foolish despite the fact that Rabbi Moses proposes it. Because, if “to proclaim” is taken in its proper sense, when it is said that “the heavens proclaim the glory of God,” the heavens would require not only an intellect but also a ton(rue. Therefore the heavens are said to proclaim the glory of God, if taken in a literal sense, inasmuch as through them the glory of God is made manifest to men. In this way, also, insensible creatures are said to praise God.

And certainly a thing is a principle of operation inasmuch as it is an act, because a thing acts inasmuch as it is actual. Hence the soul is the form and mover of the body in the same respect. Consequently no distinction is to be drawn between the soul as the mover of the body and as its form.

Further, inasmuch as the soul is the mover of the body, it is not united to the body accidentally, because then a being that is substantially one ( <i>unum per se</i> ) would not result from the union of soul and body.

But a thing that moves itself is divided into two parts, one of which is a mover, the other a thing moved, as is proved in the <i>Physics</i> [VIII, 4, 254b 15]. Now the part causing movement is a soul; however, the moved part cannot be matter alone, because whatever is in potency only is not moved, as is said in the <i>Physics</i> [V, 1, 225a 20]. Hence although heavy and light bodies have movement in themselves, they do not move themselves because they are divided only into matter and into form, which cannot be moved. It follows, then, that an animal is divided into a soul and into some part which is composed of matter and form. Consequently the soul is united to corporeal matter by means of some form.

Est autem hoc proprium formae substantialis quod det materiae esse simpliciter; ipsa enim est per quam res est hoc ipsum quod est. Non autem per formas accidentales habet esse simpliciter, sed esse secundum quid: puta esse magnum, vel coloratum, vel aliquid tale. Si qua ergo forma est quae non det materiae esse simpliciter, sed adveniat materiae iam existenti in actu per aliquam formam, non erit forma substantialis. Ex quo patet quod inter formam substantialem et materiam non potest cadere aliqua forma substantialis media, sicut quidam voluerunt, ponentes quod secundum ordinem generum, quorum unum sub altero ordinatur, est ordo diversarum formarum in materia; utpote si dicamus, quod materia secundum unam formam habet quod sit substantia in actu, et secundum aliam quod sit corpus, et iterum secundum aliam quod sit animatum corpus, et sic deinceps.
          <td><b>I answer:</b> Among all [principles] the act of existing ( <i>esse</i> ) is that which most immediately and intimately belongs to things, as is pointed out in the book <i>De causis</i> [IV]. Hence the form which gives matter its act of existing, must be understood to come to matter prior to anything else, and to be present in it more immediately than anything else, because matter receives its act of existing from a form. Moreover, it is proper to a substantial form to give matter its act of existing pure and simple ( <i>esse simpliciter</i> ), because it is through its form that a thing is the very thing that it is. For a thing is not given an act of existing pure and simple through accidental forms, but only a relative one ( <i>esse secundum quid</i> ), such as to be large or colored, and so on. Therefore, if there is a form which does not give to matter its act of existing pure and simple, but comes to matter already possessing an act of existing through some form, such a form will not be a substantial one. From this it is obvious that an intermediary substantial form cannot intervene between a substantial form and matter, as some wished to maintain. For these men held that there exists in matter an order of diverse forms, one of which is arranged under another in accordance with the order of genera; as if one were to say, for instance, that matter is given the act of existing of a substance through one form; the act of existing of a body through another; the act of existing of a living body through still another; and so on.

Relinquitur ergo dicendum quod cum formae rerum naturalium sint sicut numeri, in quibus est diversitas speciei addita vel subtracta unitate, ut dicitur in VIII Metaphys.; oportet intelligere diversitatem formarum naturalium, secundum quas constituitur materia in diversis speciebus, ex hoc quod una addit perfectionem super aliam, ut puta quod una forma constituit in esse corporali tantum (hunc enim oportet esse infimum gradum formarum animalium, eo quod materia non est in potentia nisi ad formas corporales. Quae enim incorporea sunt, immaterialia sunt, ut in praecedentibus ostensum est). Alia autem perfectior forma constituit materiam in esse corporali, et ulterius dat ei esse vitale.
          <td>But if this position is adopted, only the first form which gives a thing its act of existing as a substance, would be a substantial one. The other forms, indeed, would all be accidental ones, because it is a thing’s substantial form that makes it be a substance ( <i>hoc aliquid</i> ), as we have already shown (Art. 1). Therefore it is necessary to say that a thing has substantiality, exists in the ultimate species, under which there are no other species ( <i>specialissima</i> ), and in all intermediate genera, through one and the same form. Now the forms of natural things are like numbers, whose species change when a unit is added or subtracted, as is pointed out in the Metaphysics.” It follows, therefore, that the diversity of natural forms, in accordance with which matter is constituted in diverse species, is to be understood as resulting from this fact, that one adds a perfection over and above another. For example, one form gives matter corporeal existence only. (This must be below the grade of animal forms, because matter is in potency only to corporeal forms. For those things which are incorporeal are immaterial, as was shown in the preceding question.) A second more perfect form gives matter vital existence in addition to corporeal existence. Another, still higher, form confers on it sensory existence in addition to vital and corporeal existence; and so on successively.

Utpote materia prima, secundum quod iam constituta est in esse corporeo, est materia respectu ulterioris perfectionis, quae est vita; et exinde est quod corpus est genus corporis viventis; et animatum, sive vivens, est differentia. Nam genus sumitur a materia et differentia a forma; et sic quodammodo una et eadem forma, secundum quod constituit materiam in actu inferioris gradus, est media inter materiam et seipsam, secundum quod constituit eam in actu superioris gradus. Materia autem prout intelligitur constituta in esse substantiali secundum perfectionem inferioris gradus, per consequens intelligi potest ut accidentibus subiecta. Nam substantia secundum illum inferiorem gradum perfectionis necesse est quod habeat quaedam accidentia propria quae necesse est ei inesse. Sicut ex hoc quod materia constituitur in esse corporeo per formas, statim consequitur ut sint in ea dimensiones, per quas intelligitur materia divisibilis per diversas partes, ut sic secundum diversas sui partes possit esse susceptiva diversarum formarum. Et ulterius ex quo materia intelligitur constituta in esse quodam substantiali, intelligi potest ut susceptiva accidentium quibus disponitur ad ulteriorem perfectionem, secundum quam materia fit propria ad ulteriorem perfectionem suscipiendam. Huiusmodi autem dispositiones praeintelliguntur formae ut inductae ab agente in materiam, licet sint quaedam accidentia impropria formae, quae non nisi ex ipsa forma causentur in materia. Unde non praeintelliguntur in materia formae quasi dispositiones, sed magis forma praeintelligitur eis, sicut causa effectibus.
          <td>Therefore a more perfect form, constituting with matter a composite being in the perfection of an inferior grade, must be considered as matter with respect to a higher perfection; and so on up the scale. For instance, prime matter, so far as it now exists in a corporeal mode, is matter with respect to the higher perfection of life. (And so body is the genus of living body, and animated or living is the specific difference. For genus is derived from matter, and difference from form.) Thus, in a certain way, one and the same form actualizing matter in a lower grade of perfection, is midway between matter and that same form actualizing matter in a superior grade. But matter, so far as it is understood to have substantial existence as a perfection of an inferior grade, can, therefore, be regarded as the subject of accidents. For a substance in that inferior grade of perfection must have a proper accident which necessarily inheres in it. Likewise, from the fact that matter has corporeal existence through forms, it immediately follows that there are dimensions in matter whereby it is understood to be divisible into different parts, so that it can receive different forms corresponding to its different parts. Furthermore, from the fact that matter is known to have a certain substantial mode of existing, matter can be understood to receive accidents by which it is disposed to a higher perfection’ so far as it is fittingly disposed to receive that higher perfection. Moreover dispositions of this kind are understood to exist in matter prior to the form, inasmuch as they are given existence in matter by an agent, although there are some improper accidents of the form that are caused in the matter only by the form itself. Hence such accidents are not understood to exist as dispositions in matter prior to the form; rather is the form understood to be prior to the proper accidents as a cause is to its effects.

Sed oportet quod materia secundum quod intelligitur ut recipiens ab ipsa anima rationali perfectiones inferioris gradus, puta quod sit corpus et animatum corpus et animal, intelligatur, simul cum dispositionibus convenientibus, quod sit materia propria ad animam rationalem, secundum quod dat ultimam perfectionem. Sic igitur anima, secundum quod est forma dans esse, non habet aliquid aliud medium inter se et materiam primam.

          <td>Consequently, since the soul is a substantial form, because it places man in a determinate species of substance, no other substantial form intervenes between the soul and prime matter. But man is perfected in different grades of perfection by the rational soul itself, so that he is a body, a living body, and a rational animal. However, matter (being understood to receive from the rational soul itself, perfections of an inferior grade, for instance, that of being a body, a living body, and an animal) must also be understood to have, at the same time, appropriate dispositions so that it may be a matter befitting a human soul, inasmuch as the soul gives the body its ultimate perfection. So, therefore, the soul inasmuch as it is the form which gives the act of existing absolutely, does not have any intermediary between itself and prime matter. But because the same form which gives matter its act of existing, is also a principle of operation (for a thing acts so far as it is in act), then the soul like any other form must be a principle of operation.

Unde formae perfectiores habent plures operationes et magis diversas quam formae minus perfectae. Et inde est quod ad diversitatem operationum in rebus minus perfectis sufficit diversitas accidentium. In rebus autem magis perfectis requiritur ulterius diversitas partium; et tanto magis, quanto forma fuerit perfectior. Videmus enim quod igni conveniunt diversae operationes secundum diversa accidentia; sicut ferri sursum secundum levitatem, calefacere secundum calorem, et sic de aliis. Sed tamen quaelibet harum operationum competit igni secundum quamlibet partem eius. In corporibus vero animatis quae habent nobiliores formas, diversis operationibus deputantur diversae partes; sicut in plantis alia est operatio radicis, alia rami et stipitis. Et quanto corpora animata fuerint perfectiora, tanto propter maiorem perfectionem necesse est inveniri maiorem diversitatem in partibus. Unde cum anima rationalis sit perfectissima formarum naturalium, in homine invenitur maxima distinctio partium propter diversas operationes; et anima singulis earum dat esse substantiale, secundum illum modum qui competit operationi ipsorum. Cuius signum est, quod remota anima, non remanet neque caro neque oculus nisi aequivoce. Sed cum oporteat ordinem instrumentorum esse secundum ordinem operationum, diversarum autem operationum quae sunt ab anima, una naturaliter praecedit alteram, necessarium est quod una pars corporis moveatur per aliam ad suam operationem. Sic ergo inter animam secundum quod est motor et principium operationum et totum corpus, cadit aliquid medium; quia mediante aliqua prima parte primo mota movet alias partes ad suas operationes, sicut mediante corde movet alia membra ad vitales operationes: sed secundum quod dat esse corpori, immediate dat esse substantiale et specificum omnibus partibus corporis. Et hoc est quod a multis dicitur quod anima unitur corpori ut forma sine medio, ut motor autem per medium.
          <td>But it must be considered that a gradation of forms in the order of operation corresponds to the gradation of forms in the order of existence, for an operation is an act of an agent in act. Therefore the greater perfection a form possesses with respect to conferring the act of existing, so much the greater is its power of operating. Hence more perfect forms have a greater number of operations and more diverse ones than less perfect forms. And so it is that a diversity of accidents suffices for a diversity of operations in the case of less perfect things. But in the case of more perfect things a diversity of parts is required as well; and the greater the diversity of parts, the more perfect the form will be. For we see that diverse operations are proper to fire because its accidents differ, for example, to rise upward in virtue of its lightness; to heat in virtue of its heat; and so on. However’ any one of these operations belongs to any part of fire. But in animate bodies which have nobler forms, different operations are allotted to different parts, for instance, in plants there is one operation performed by the roots, another by the trunk, and still another by the branches. And the more perfect that living bodies are, so much the more diverse must their parts be in view of their greater perfection. Therefore, since the rational soul is the most perfect of natural forms, there is found in man the greatest diversity of parts because of his different operations. Furthermore the one soul performing these operations confers substantial existence in a manner befitting the operations of the parts themselves. An indication of this fact is that, when the soul ceases to animate the body, neither flesh nor eye remains except in an equivocal sense. But since there must be an order of instruments in keeping with the order of operations, and since there is a natural precedence among the different operations which flow from the soul, one part of the body must be moved to perform its operations by another part. Thus a medium intervenes between the whole body and the soul as the mover and principle of its operations. For after a certain primary mediating part of the body has been moved, that part moves the other parts to perform their operations. So it is that the soul, by means of the heart, moves the other members of the body to perform their vital operations. But since the soul gives to the body its act of existing, it immediately gives to all parts of the body their substantial and specific mode of existing. And this is what many assert, namely, that as a form the soul is united to the body without an intermediary, but that as a mover it is united to the body through an intermediary.

For this reason some held that there is a certain spirit and humor existing as a medium between soul and body; other posited light; still others, the powers of the soul, or something else of this sort. But none of these [entities] are necessary if the soul is the form of the body, because anything whatever, inasmuch as it is a being, is one. Hence a form is united to prime matter by virtue of itself and not by any other bond, because a form, by its very nature, gives to matter its act of existing.

          <td>Ad primum ergo dicendum quod vires animae sunt qualitates eius quibus operatur; et ideo cadunt media inter animam et corpus, secundum quod anima movet corpus, non autem secundum quod dat ei esse. Tamen sciendum, quod liber qui inscribitur de spiritu et anima non est Augustini, et quod auctor illius opinatus est quod anima sit suae potentiae. Unde totaliter cessat obiectio.
          <td>1. The powers of the soul are the qualities by which it operates. Therefore they serve as intermediaries between the soul and the body inasmuch as the soul moves the body, but not inasmuch as it gives to the body its act of existing. Moreover, it must be understood that the work which is called <i>De spiritu et anima</i> is not a work of Augustine, and that its author is of the opinion that the soul is its powers. Hence the objection fails completely.

          <td>2. Although the soul is a form inasmuch as it is an act, and similarly is a mover inasmuch as it is an act, and thus is a form and a mover in one and the same respect, nevertheless the effect which it produces as a form differs from that which it produces as a mover. The distinction is made for this reason.

One being pure and simple ( <i>unum per se</i> ) does not result from the union of a mover and a thing moved inasmuch as they are mover and moved, but from [the union of] this mover which is the soul, inasmuch as the soul is the form of the body, and this mobile thing which is the body.

          <td>4. Nothing intervenes between the soul and any part of the body with respect to any operation of the soul which is an operation of the composite. However, there is one part of the body through which the soul first exercises its operation, which [part] falls midway between the soul, so far as it is the principle of that operation, and all the other parts of the body which share in that operation.

Materia enim secundum seipsam est prima respectu infimi gradus perfectionis, quia secundum seipsam est in potentia ad esse substantiale corporeum. Nec ad hoc requirit aliquam dispositionem; sed hac perfectione praesupposita in materia requiruntur dispositiones ad ulteriorem perfectionem. Tamen sciendum est quod potentiae animae sunt accidentia propria animae, quae non sunt sine ea. Unde non habent rationem dispositionis ad animam secundum quod sunt eius potentiae, nisi secundum quod potentiae inferioris partis animae dicuntur dispositiones ad superiorem partem; sicut potentia animae vegetabilis ad animam sensibilem, secundum quod ex praemissis intelligi potest.
          <td>5. The accidental dispositions which dispose matter properly for [receiving] some form are not media absolutely between form and matter, but between form inasmuch as it bestows the highest perfection, and matter inasmuch as it is already perfected by some perfection of an inferior order. For matter by its very nature is first with respect to the lowest grade of perfection, because matter of itself is in potency to substantial corporeal existence. Moreover, it does not require to be disposed in this way. But matter, having this perfection already in existence, requires dispositions to a higher perfection. Moreover it must be recognized that the powers of the soul are its proper accidents and do not exist without the soul. Therefore, inasmuch as they are its powers, they do not have the nature of a disposition in relation to the soul except so far as the powers of the inferior part of the soul are called dispositions in relation to the powers of the superior part, just as the powers of the vegetal soul are dispositions in relation to the sentient soul, as can be seen from the preceding argument.

          <td>Ad sextum dicendum quod ratio illa concludit quod anima vel animal dividatur in duas partes, quarum una est sicut corpus mobile, et alia sicut motor. Quod quidem verum est. Sed oportet intelligere quod anima movet corpus per apprehensionem et appetitum. Apprehensio autem et appetitus in homine duplex est. Una quidem quae est animae tantum, non per organum corporale, quae est partis intellectivae. Alia quae est coniuncti, et est partis sensitivae. Illa autem quae est partis intellectivae non movet corpus nisi mediante ea quae est partis sensitivae; quia, cum motus sit circa aliquod singulare, apprehensio universalis quae est intellectus, non movet nisi mediante particulari, quae est sensus. Sic igitur homo vel animal cum dividitur in partem moventem et partem motam, non est haec divisio in solam animam et solum corpus; sed in unam partem corporis animati, et animam. Nam illa pars animati corporis cuius operatio est apprehendere et appetere, movet totum corpus. Sed si supponatur quod pars intellectiva immediate moveat, ita quod pars movens in homine sit anima tantum; adhuc remanebit responsio, secundum praehabita. Nam anima humana erit movens secundum id quod est supremum in ipsa, scilicet per partem intellectivam; motum autem erit non materia prima tantum, sed materia prima secundum quod est constituta in esse corporali et vitali, non per aliam formam nisi per eamdem animam. Unde non erit necessarium ponere formam substantialem mediam inter animam et materiam primam. Sed quia in animali est quidam motus qui non est per apprehensionem et appetitum, sicut motus cordis, et etiam motus augmenti et decrementi, et motus alimenti diffusi per totum corpus, quod etiam est commune plantis; quantum ad huiusmodi motus dicendum est quod (cum anima animali non solum det id quod est proprium sibi, sed etiam id quod est inferiorum formarum, ut ex dictis patet), sicut inferiores formae sunt principia naturalis motus in corporibus naturalibus, ita etiam anima in corpore animalis. Unde philosophus dicit in II de anima, quod anima est naturalis corporis; et propter hoc operationes animae distinguuntur in animales et naturales. Ut illae dicantur animales quae sunt ab anima secundum id quod est proprium sibi; naturales autem quae sunt ab anima secundum quod facit effectum inferiorum formarum naturalium. Secundum hoc ergo dicendum, quod sicut ignis per formam suam naturalem habet naturalem motum quo tendit sursum; ita aliqua pars corporis animati in qua primo invenitur motus qui non est per apprehensionem, habet hunc motum naturaliter per animam. Sicut enim ignis naturaliter movetur sursum ita sanguis naturaliter movetur ad loca propria et determinata. Et similiter cor naturaliter movetur motu sibi proprio: licet ad hoc etiam cooperetur resolutio spirituum facta ex sanguine, quibus cor dilatatur et constringitur, ut Aristoteles dicit ubi agit de respiratione et inspiratione. Sic ergo prima pars in qua talis motus invenitur, non est movens seipsam, sed movetur naturaliter, sicut ignis; sed ista pars movet aliam. Et sic totum animal est movens seipsum, cum una pars eius sit movens, et alia sit mota.
          <td>6. This argument concludes that the soul or the animal is divided into two parts, one of which is like a mobile thing, the other like a mover. This, indeed, is true, but we must understand that the soul moves the body through knowledge and appetite. Now knowledge and appetite in man are of two kinds. First, that which belongs to the soul alone and which does not depend on a bodily organ. This belongs to the intellective part of the soul. Secondly, that which belongs to the composite. This belongs to the sentient part of the soul. Now whatever belongs to the intellective part moves the body only by means of that which belongs to the sentient part. For when a movement has to do with some particular thing, the universal apprehension which belongs to the intellect causes movement only by means of something particular belonging to sense. Hence when we divide a man or an animal into a part that causes movement and one that is moved, we do not divide them into a soul and a body exclusively, but into a soul and an animated body. For that part of the animated body whose operation it is to apprehend and to desire, moves the whole body. But if it be supposed that the intellective part moves [the body] directly, so that the, part causing movement in man is the soul alone, then the answer will be in accordance with the preceding explanation (i.e., the one given in the Answer). For the human soul will be a mover in virtue of what is supreme i n itself, namely, its intellective part. Moreover, the moved part will not be prime matter alone, but prime matter inasmuch as it is given a corporeal and vital act of existing ( <i>esse</i> ). Nor will it be moved by any other form than the soul. Hence it will not be necessary to maintain that a substantial form acts as an intermediary between the soul and prime matter. However, there is a certain movement in the animal which is not the result of apprehension and desire, that is, the movement of the heart, the movement also of growth and decay, and the movement of nutrition which is diffused throughout the whole body, and which the animal has in common with plants. Now with respect to this kind of movement, we must maintain that, as inferior forms are the principles of movement in natural bodies, so also is the soul the principle of movement in animal bodies. For the animal soul not only bestows what is proper to its nature as such, but also gives those perfections which belong to a lower order of forms, as is evident from what has been said. Hence the Philosopher says, in the <i>De anima</i> [II, 2, 414a 18] that the soul is the nature of this specific type of body. For this reason the operations of the soul are divided into animal operations and natural operations. That is to say, those operations which proceed from the soul in keeping with its proper nature, are called animal operations, whereas those which come from the soul inasmuch as it produces the effect of inferior natural forms, are called natural operations. According to this, therefore, it must be said that, as fire through its natural form has a natural movement whereby it tends upwards, so also does any part of an animated body in which there is found movement not resulting from apprehension, have this movement naturally through its soul. For as fire tends upward by nature, so also is the blood moved naturally to its proper and determinate place. Similarly, the heart is moved naturally by its proper movement, although the dissolution of spirits, made from the blood, by which the heart is expanded and contracted, cooperates in this activity, as Aristotle points out in the place where he treats of exhalation and inhalation. Consequently the first part of the body in which such movement is found is not a self-mover, but is moved naturally, just as fire is. However, this part moves another part, and thus the whole animal is a self-mover, because one part of it is a mover, and another is moved.

          <td>9. Matter is in potency to forms with respect to a certain order, not that it receives different substantial forms in a certain order, but because it receives whatever is proper to a superior form only through the medium of what is proper to an inferior form, as was shown.

Dicere etiam quod formae elementorum recipiant magis et minus, ut Averroes dicit, ridiculum est; cum sint formae substantiales, quae magis et minus recipere non possunt. Nec aliquid est medium inter substantiam et accidens, ut ipse fingit. Nec dicendum est quod totaliter corrumpantur; sed quod maneant virtute, ut Aristoteles dicit. Et hoc est in quantum manent accidentia propria elementorum secundum aliquem modum, in quibus manet virtus elementorum.
          <td>10. The forms of the elements do not exist according to their very essence in a mixed body, although Avicenna maintained this, for they cannot exist in one and the same part of matter. However, if they were to exist in different parts of matter, there would not be a mixture with respect to the whole, as is the case in a true mixture, but there would be a mixture of the most insignificant kind, that is to say, one which appears to be a mixture to the senses. Again, to say that the forms of the elements may receive more and less, as Averroes does, is ridiculous, because there are substantial forms which cannot receive more and less. Nor is there a medium between a substance and an accident as he imagined. Moreover it must be said that the forms of the elements are not corrupted completely, but that they remain virtually, as Aristotle says. And they are virtually present inasmuch as the proper accidents of the elements, in which the power of the elements is found, remain in some measure.

Furthermore, because a form perfects a matter not only with respect to its act of existing, but also with respect to its operation, it is necessary that the parts of the body be perfected in different ways by the soul, even though it is a form in its entirety, and that each part be perfected in a way befitting its operation. For this reason there must be an order among the parts of the body in accordance with the order among operations, as was explained. However, this order exists inasmuch as the operation of the body belongs to the soul as the mover of the body.

For when order is once established in it, there is no further need of a separate monarch to preside over each particular work. But each individual performs the task to which he is directed by the authority of the ruler, and these things are done continually in a customary manner. In animals, however, the same order results from their nature, and each part performs the proper work for which it has been constituted by nature. Hence there is not a soul for each part, but one single principle of the body exists, and the different parts of the body live because they are connected to one another. Moreover, they perform the proper operation allotted to them by nature.” Therefore the soul does not exist in each part of the body, but only in one part.

Cum enim corpus hominis, aut cuiuslibet alterius animalis, sit quoddam totum naturale, dicetur unum ex eo quod unam formam habeat qua perficitur non solum secundum aggregationem aut compositionem, ut accidit in domo, et in aliis huiusmodi. Unde oportet quod quaelibet pars hominis et animalis recipiat esse et speciem ab anima sicut a propria forma. Unde philosophus dicit quod recedente anima, neque oculus neque caro neque aliqua pars remanet nisi aequivoce. Non est autem possibile quod aliquid recipiat esse et speciem ab aliquo separato sicut a forma; hoc enim simile esset Platonicorum positioni, qui posuerunt huiusmodi sensibilia recipere esse et speciem per participationem formarum separatarum. Sed oportet quod forma sit aliquid eius cui dat esse; nam forma et materia sunt principia intrinsecus constituentia essentiam rei.
          <td><b>I answer:</b> The true solution to this question depends on the preceding one. For it was shown that the soul as the form of the body is not united to the whole body through the medium of any of its parts, but is united directly to the whole body, because it is the form of the body as a whole and of each of its parts. And this must be maintained, for, since the body of a man or that of any other animal is a certain natural whole, it will be said to be one because it has one form whereby it is perfected, and not simply because it is an aggregate or a composition, as occurs in the case of a house and other things of this kind. Hence each part of a man and that of an animal must receive its act of existing and species from the soul as its proper form. Therefore the Philosopher says [De anima, II, 1, 412b 20] that when the soul leaves the body, neither the eye nor the flesh nor any part remains except in an equivocal sense. Moreover, it is impossible for a thing to receive its act of existing and species, as it does from a form, from a principle existing in separation from it, because this would he similar to the position of the Platonists, who maintained that such sensible things receive their act of existing and species by participating in forms which exist apart from things themselves. But a form must be an intrinsic principle of the thing whose act of existing it is responsible for, because form and matter are the intrinsic principles constituting the essence of a [corporeal] thing.

          <td>Unde oportet quod si anima dat esse et speciem, ut forma, cuilibet parti corporis, secundum sententiam Aristotelis, sit in qualibet parte corporis; nam et ea ratione dicitur anima esse in toto, quia est forma totius. Unde, si est forma cuiuslibet partis, oportet quod sit in qualibet parte; et non in toto tantum, nec in una parte tantum. Et haec definitio animae convenit; est enim anima actus corporis organici. Corpus autem organicum est constitutum ex diversis organis. Si ergo anima esset in una parte tantum ut forma, non esset actus corporis organici; sed actus unius organi tantum, puta cordis, aut alicuius alterius, et reliquae partes essent perfectae per alias formas.

And for this reason the soul is said to exist in the whole body because it is the form of the whole. Therefore, if it is the form of each part [of the body], it must exist in each part and not in the whole alone, nor in one part alone. Moreover, this definition of the soul is an appropriate one, for the soul is the act of an organic body. However, an organic body is composed of different organs. Hence, if the soul as a form existed in one part of the body only, it would not be the act of an organic body, but that of one organ alone, for instance, the heart or some other part; and the remaining parts would be perfected by different forms. And thus the whole would not be one thing by nature but merely by composition. Hence it follows that the soul exists in the whole body and in each of its parts.

          <td>Sed quia etiam quaeritur an sit tota in toto et in qualibet parte eius, considerandum est qualiter hoc dicitur.

Uno enim modo aliquid habet partes secundum divisionem quantitatis, prout scilicet dividitur numerus aut magnitudo. Uni autem formae non competit totalitas numeri nec magnitudinis, nisi forte per accidens, puta in formis quae per accidens dividuntur divisione continui, sicut albedo per divisionem superficiei. Alio modo dicitur aliquid totum per comparationem ad partes essentiales speciei; sicut materia et forma dicuntur partes compositi; genus et differentia partes quodammodo speciei. Et hic modus totalitatis attribuitur etiam essentiis simplicibus ratione suae perfectionis; eo quod sicut composita habent perfectam speciem ex coniunctione principiorum essentialium, ita substantiae et formae simplices habent perfectam speciem per seipsas. Tertio modo dicitur totum per comparationem ad partes virtutis, seu potestatis; quae quidem partes accipiuntur secundum divisionem operationum.
          <td>But since it is also asked whether the whole soul exists in the whole body and in each of its parts, we must consider how this is to be explained. For totality can be attributed to a form in a threefold manner, according to the three ways in which it is proper for a thing to have parts. For a thing has parts, in one way, resulting from quantitative division, that is, according as a number or a magnitude is divided. However, totality of number or that of magnitude does not apply to a form, except perhaps in an accidental way; for instance, in the case of forms which are divided accidentally by the division of a continuum, as whiteness is divided as a result of dividing a surface. A thing is said to be a totality in another way in relation to the essential parts of its species, as matter and form are said to be parts of a composite, and genus and difference, in a certain respect, parts of a species. This kind of totality is also attributed to simple essences by reason of their perfection, in this way, that as composites have a perfect species from the union of their essential principles, so also do substances and simple forms which have a perfect species in virtue of themselves. A thing is said to be a totality in a third way in relation to its active and passive powers, inasmuch as these are considered to be parts of it which are distinguished from one another because their operations differ.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Si qua igitur forma accipiatur quae dividitur per continui divisionem, et quaeratur de ea utrum sit in qualibet parte corporis tota, utpote utrum albedo sit in parte superficiei tota: si accipiatur per comparationem ad partes quantitativas (quae quidem totalitas pertinet ad albedinem per accidens), non est tota in qualibet parte, sed tota in toto, et pars in parte. Si autem quaeratur de totalitate quae pertinet ad speciem, sic tota est in qualibet parte; nam aeque intensa est albedo in aliqua parte sicut in toto. Sed verum est quod adhuc secundum virtutem non est tota in qualibet parte. Non enim potest tantum in disgregando albedo quae est in parte superficiei, sicut albedo quae est in tota superficie; sicut neque tantum potest calor qui est in parvo igne ad calefaciendum, sicut calor qui est in magno igne.
          <td>Therefore, if we take a form which is divided as a result of dividing a continuum, and inquire whether the whole form is in each part of the body (for example, whether whiteness exists in its entirety in a part of the surface), and if the form is considered in relation to quantitative parts (which totality, indeed, pertains to whiteness accidentally), then the whole form does not exist in each part [of the body], but the whole form exists in the whole [body], and a part of the form in a part of the whole. However, if it is a question of totality so far as the species is concerned, then the whole [form] exists in each part [of the body]; for whiteness is as equally intense in any part [of the surface] as it is in the whole. But so far as its power is concerned, it is true that the whole form does not exist in each part [of the body], for the whiteness existing in a part of the surface cannot disperse as much light as the whiteness existing in the whole surface; just as the heat in a small fire alone, cannot cause warmth like the heat in a large fire.

          <td>Now if we suppose, for the present, that there is only one soul in the human body (we will explain this later), we must maintain that it is not divided by dividing that species of quantity which is numerical in nature. It is also obvious that the soul is not divided by dividing a continuum. This is particularly true of the souls of perfect animals which do not live when dissected. However, it would perhaps be different in the case of the souls of ring-worms, in which there is one soul actually and many potentially, as the Philosopher teaches [De anima, II, 2, 413b 13]. Therefore, in the case of the soul of man and that of any perfect animal, it follows that totality can be considered only so far as the soul’s species and its passive or active power are concerned. Hence we say that the soul by its very essence is the form of the body, and that it exists as such in each part of the body, as has been shown, because the perfection of the species comes from the soul in virtue of its very essence. Consequently the whole soul exists in each part of the body according to the whole of its specific perfection.

For it was shown in the preceding articles (Arts. 1, 2 and 5) that the human soul possesses the power of performing certain operations without communicating in any way with the body, that is, the acts of understanding and willing, as it exceeds the capacity of the body. Hence the intellect and the will are not the acts of any bodily organ. However, with respect to those operations which the soul exercises through bodily organs, the soul’s active and passive powers as a whole exist in the whole body, although not in each part of the body, because different parts of the body are proportioned to different operations of the soul. Consequently, with respect to any one power, the soul exists only in that part of the body which takes care of the operations exercised by that particular part.

          <td>1. Since matter exists for the sake of form, and since a form is directed to a proper operation, the matter to which a form is united must be one that is suitable for the proper operations of that form, just as the matter of a saw must be iron, which is suitable for sawing due to its hardness. Hence, since the soul can exercise different operations because of the perfect power which it has, its matter must be a body composed of different parts (which parts are called organs) suitable for the different operations of the soul. And for this reason the whole body, to which the soul is related principally as a form, is the organ of the soul. However, parts exist for the sake of the whole. Hence it is only by being intrinsically related to the body as a whole, that a part of the body is related to the soul as that which is properly and principally capable of being perfected by the soul. Consequently it is not necessary for each part of an animal to be an organic body, even though the soul is the form of each of the animal’s parts.

Et ideo dicit quod, sicut anima est in toto corpore, ita pars animae in parte corporis; quia sicut totum corpus organicum se habet ut deserviat operationibus animae quae per corpus exercentur, ita se habet unum organum ad unam determinatam operationem.
          <td>9. The Philosopher does not distinguish parts in the soul with respect to its essence, but with respect to its powers. Hence he says that, as the soul exists in the whole body, so also does a part of the soul exist in a part of the body. For as the whole organic body is so constituted that it may serve the operations of the soul which are exercised through it, so also is one organ disposed to one particular operation.

          <td>10. A power of the soul is rooted in its essence. Therefore, wherever a power of the soul exists, there also does the essence of the soul exist. Hence the Philosopher’s statement that, if the eye of an animal were itself an animal, sight would be its soul, is not to be understood of a power of the soul without its essence; just as the sentient soul is said to be the form of the whole body through its essence, not through its sensory power.

Et pro tanto vita aliarum partium dependet a corde, quia postquam desinit esse in aliqua parte debita dispositio, anima non unitur ei ut forma. Non autem propter hoc removetur quin anima sit immediate forma cuiuslibet partis corporis.
          <td>11. Since the soul operates in different parts of the body through one particular power (moreover the body is disposed in this way that it is proportioned to the soul’s act of existing through the action of the soul itself which is the efficient cause of the body, as Aristotle says in the <i>De anima</i> [II, 4, 415b 9]) it is necessary that the disposition of the different parts of the body, inasmuch as they are capable of being perfected by the soul, depend on one first part of the body, namely, on the heart. For this reason the life of the other parts depends upon the heart, because, after the necessary dispositions cease to exist, the soul is not united as a form to the body. However, this does not prevent the soul from being the form of each part of the body directly.

          <td>12. The soul is moved or at rest only in an accidental way when the body is moved or at rest. Moreover, it is not incongruous for a thing to be moved and at rest accidentally at one and the same time, just as it is not implausible for a thing to be moved accidentally by contrary movements, as for instance, when someone on a ship walks in the direction opposite to that of the course of the ship.

          <td>13. Although all powers of the soul are rooted in its essence, yet each part of the body is informed by the soul in the manner befitting each. Therefore different powers of the soul exist in different parts of the body. But it is not necessary that all of the soul’s powers exist in each part of the body.

Non enim oportet ut id quod est in aliquo habeat naturam et proprietatem eius in quo est; sed quod recipiatur in eo secundum capacitatem ipsius. Manifestum est enim quod aqua non habet naturam amphorae; unde nec oportet quod anima habeat istam naturam corporis, ut ubi est una pars eius, ibi sit alia.
          <td>14. When it is said that one thing exists in another in accordance with the mode of the thing in which it exists, this is understood of the mode of its capacity, not of its nature. For it is not necessary that whatever exists in something else have the nature and Properties of that thing in which it exists, but that it be received in that thing according to the thing’s capacity; because it is obvious that water does not have the nature of the vessel [in which it exists]. Hence it is not necessary for the soul to possess this characteristic of a body, namely, that wherever one part exists, another may not exist.

Unde, cum retineat dispositionem per quam totum corpus est perfectibile ab anima, remanet in eo anima. Secus autem est in animalibus perfectis.
          <td>15. Ring-worms continue to live after they have been dissected, not only because their soul exists in each part of the body, but because their soul, being imperfect and performing a minimum of operations, requires the least diversity of parts. This is also found in any part segregated from a living thing of this sort. Hence a soul remains in each part because each part retains that disposition whereby the whole body is made capable of being perfected by a soul. However, the soul exists differently in perfect animals.

          <td>16. The form of a house, like other artificial forms, is an accidental one. Hence it does not give to the whole house and to each of its parts their act of existing and species. Indeed, a whole [of this sort] is not a substantial unity, but is a one by aggregation. However, the soul is the substantial form of the body, giving to the whole body and to each of its parts their act of existing and species. Furthermore, the whole constituted of these parts is a substantial unity. Hence there is no similarity.

          <td>17. Although the soul is one and simple in essence, yet it is capable of performing different operations. And because the soul by nature gives to its perfectible its act of existing and species, inasmuch as it is the form of the body by its very essence (moreover, those things existing naturally, exist for an end), the soul must establish a diversity of parts in the body inasmuch as this is required for its different operations. It is also true in the light of such diversity (which is to be attributed to the end, and not to the form alone) that it is more apparent that nature acts for an end in the constitution of living things than it is in the case of other natural things in which one form perfects, in a uniform way, the thing capable of being perfected by it.

Unde totum illud quod virtute Angeli contingitur, respondet Angelo, qui non unitur ut forma, ut locus unus; et animae, quae unitur ut forma, ut perfectibile unum. Et sicut Angelus est in qualibet parte sui loci totus, ita et anima in qualibet parte sui perfectibilis, tota.
          <td>18. The simplicity of the soul and that of an angel must not be thought of in terms of the simplicity of the point, which has a definite position in a continuum, and, therefore, because it is simple cannot exist in different parts of the continuum at one and the same time. But the angel and the soul are said to be simple because they lack quantity altogether, and thus are related to a continuum only by contact of power. Hence that whole, which it contacted by an angel’s power, is present to the angel (which is not united to it as a form) as a single place; and it is present to the soul (which is united to it as a form) as a single perfectible thing. And just as the whole angel exists in each part of the place it is present in [by contact of power], so also does the whole soul exist in each part of the thing perfectible by it.

        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et videtur quod non. Ubicumque enim est actus animae, ibi est et anima. Sed in embryone actus animae vegetabilis praecedit actum animae sensibilis, et actus animae sensibilis actum animae rationalis. Ergo in concepto primum est anima vegetabilis, quam sensibilis, et sensibilis quam rationalis; et ita non sunt idem secundum substantiam.
          <td>1. It seems that they are not substantially one and the same. For wherever an act of a soul exists, there also does a soul exist. Now in the embryo the act of a vegetal soul precedes that of a sentient soul, and the act of a sentient soul precedes that of a rational soul. Therefore in pregnancy the vegetal soul is prior to the sentient, and the sentient is prior to the rational. Consequently they are not substantially one and the same.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed dicebat quod actus animae vegetabilis et sensibilis non est in embryone ab anima quae sit in embryone, sed a virtute in eo existente ab anima parentis. —Sed contra, nullum agens finitum agit sua virtute nisi secundum determinatam distantiam, ut patet in motu proiectionis. Proiiciens enim usque ad locum determinatum proiicit secundum modum suae virtutis. Sed in embryone apparent motus et operationes animae, quantumcumque parens distet, cuius tamen virtus finita est. Non igitur operationes animae sunt in embryone per virtutem animae parentis.
          <td>2. But it has been said that the act of a vegetal soul and that of a sentient soul which are present in the embryo, do not belong to a soul existing in the embryo, but to a power of the parent’s soul existing therein. On the other hand, a finite agent acts by its power only with respect to a limited distance, as is evident in the motion of throwing. For a thrower casts an object to a definite place according to the power which he possesses. But the movements and operations of a soul appear in the embryo no matter how distant the [male] parent may be, although his power is finite. Therefore the operations of a soul do not exist in the embryo as a result of a power of the parent’s soul.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, philosophus dicit in libro de Generat. animalium, quod embryo prius est animal quam homo.

          <td>3. Further, the Philosopher states, in the work <i>De generatione animalium</i> [II, 3, 736a 35], that the embryo is an animal before it is a man. But an animal is such because of its sentient soul, and a man is a man because of his rational soul. Therefore a sentient soul, and not merely a power of such a soul, exists in the embryo prior to a rational soul.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, vivere et sentire sunt operationes quae non possunt esse nisi a principio intrinseco: sunt enim actus animae. Ergo cum embryo vivat et sentiat antequam habeat animam rationalem, vivere et sentire non erunt ex anima exteriori parentis, sed ab anima intus existente.
          <td>4. Further, living and sensing are operations which can issue only from an intrinsic principle, because they are acts of a soul. Hence, since the embryo lives and senses before it has a rational soul, the acts of living and sensing in the embryo will not come from the soul of the external parent, but from a soul existing within the embryo itself.

Ergo ante infusionem animae rationalis est in embryone anima, et non solum animae virtus.
          <td>5. Further, the philosopher says in the <i>De anima</i> [II, 4, 415b 9] that the soul is not only the formal cause of the body, but its efficient and final cause as well. But it would not be the efficient cause of the body unless it were present to the body when it is formed. However, the body is formed before the rational soul is infused. Therefore there is a soul and not merely a power of a soul in the embryo preceding the infusion of the rational soul.

Sed movens seipsum componitur ex movente et moto, ut probatur in VIII Phys. Ergo principium generationis, quod format corpus vivum, est anima quae est in embryone.
          <td>6. But it has been said that the formation of the body is brought about, not by a soul existing in the embryo, but by the soul of the parent. On the other hand, living bodies move themselves by their own movements. But the generation of a living body is a certain movement of its own, because the generative power is one of its principles. Therefore with respect to this activity, a living thing moves itself. But a thing .that moves itself is composed of a part that causes movement and one that is moved, as is proved in the <i>Physics</i> [VIII, 4, 254b 30]. Hence the principle of generation, which forms the living body, is a soul existing in the embryo.

          <td>7. Further, it is obvious that the embryo increases in size. Now increase is a species of local motion, as is stated in the <i>Physics</i> [IV, 6, 213b 19]. Therefore, since the animal moves itself locally, it will also move itself augmentatively. Hence this movement must come from a principle existing in the embryo and not from an extrinsic soul.

          <td>9. But it has been argued that the Philosopher does not mean that a soul exists in the embryo actually, but only potentially. On the other hand, a thing acts only so far as it is in act. But there are activities of a soul in the embryo. Therefore a soul actually exists there, and thus it follows that [the souls in the embryo] are not substantially one and the same.

Ergo non est idem in homine secundum substantiam anima vegetabilis, sensibilis et rationalis.
          <td>10. Further, it is impossible for one and the same thing to be caused both by an intrinsic principle and by an extrinsic one. But the rational soul in man is caused by an extrinsic principle. The vegetal and sentient souls, however, are caused by an intrinsic principle contained in the semen, as is clear from what the Philosopher says in the book <i>De generatione animalium</i> [II, 3, 736b, 21]. Therefore in man the vegetal, sentient, and rational souls are not substantially one and the same.

          <td>11. Further, it is impossible for a substantial principle of one thing to be an accident of another. Consequently the Philosopher says in the Metaphysics,” that heat is not the substantial form of fire, because heat is an accident of other things. But the sentient soul is a substantial principle in brute animals. Therefore it is not merely a power in man, because powers are certain properties and accidents of a soul.

          <td>12. Further, man is a nobler animal than the brute. Now an animal is said to be such because it possesses a sentient soul. Therefore the sentient soul in man is nobler than that in brute animals. But it is a certain substantial entity in brute animals, and not merely a power of their soul. Consequently in man the sentient soul is a substance in virtue of its very nature to an even greater degree.

          <td>13. Further, it is impossible for the substance of one and the same being to be both corruptible and incorruptible. Now the rational soul is incorruptible. Sentient and vegetal souls, however, are corruptible. Therefore it is impossible for the rational, sentient, and vegetal souls to be substantially one and the same.

Et ita, cum animal dicatur per animam sensibilem, homo et equus non essent in uno genere animalis; quod patet esse falsum.
          <td>14. But it has been said that the sentient soul in man is incorruptible. On the other hand, the corruptible and the incorruptible differ generically, as the Philosopher states in the <i>Metaphysics</i> [X, 10, 1058b 26]. Now the sentient soul in brutes is corruptible. Therefore, if the sentient soul in man is incorruptible, the sentient soul in man and that in a horse will not be generically the same. Hence, since an animal is said to be such because of its sentient soul, a man and a horse would not exist in one and the same genus; which is obviously false.

But the genus of man is “animal,” his difference, “rational.” Therefore, since an animal is said to be such because of its sentient soul, it appears that not only the body but also the sentient soul is related as matter to the rational soul.

Posuit enim Plato quod anima unitur corpori ut motor, et non ut forma; dicens animam esse in corpore sicut est nauta in navi: ubi autem apparent diversae actiones secundum genus, oportet ponere diversos motores; sicut in navi alius est qui gubernat, et alius qui remigat. Nec eorum diversitas repugnat unitati navis: quia sicut actiones ordinatae sunt, ita et motores qui sunt in navi, ordinati sunt, unus sub alio. Et similiter non videtur repugnare unitati hominis vel animalis, si sint plures animae in uno corpore, ut motores ordinati sub invicem secundum ordinem operationum animae.
          <td><b>I answer:</b> There are different opinions about this question, not only among the moderns, but also among the ancients. For Plato maintained [Timaeus 32, Phaedrus 34] that there are different souls in the body and, indeed, this followed from his principles; because he maintained that the soul is united as a mover and not as a form to the body, saying that the soul exists in the body as a sailor in a ship. Moreover he maintained that it is necessary to posit different movers wherever there are generically different operations. For instance, in a ship there is one who steers, and another who rows. [Hence Plato argued in this way]: the fact that these movers hold different positions does not destroy the unity existing in the ship, because just as the actions of these movers are subordinated to one another, so also are the movers themselves. In like manner it does not seem to be inconsistent with the unity of a man or that of an animal, if in one body there exist many souls subordinated to one another as movers in accordance with the subordination of operations.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed secundum hoc cum ex motore et mobili non fiat unum simpliciter et per se, homo non esset unum simpliciter et per se, neque animal; neque esset generatio aut corruptio simpliciter, cum corpus accipit animam vel amittit. Unde oportet dicere, quod anima unitur corpori non solum ut motor, sed ut forma; ut etiam ex superioribus manifestum est.
          <td>However, according to this position, neither a man nor an animal would have its unity absolutely and in virtue of its very nature, because a being that has unity absolutely and in its own right, does not result from the conjunction of a mover and something movable. Nor, on Plato’s hypothesis, would generation and corruption strictly speaking exist when a body receives a soul or loses it. Consequently it must be said that the soul is united to the body not only as a mover but as a form. This is also evident from the preceding arguments (Arts. 8 and 9).
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed etiam hoc posito, adhuc secundum Platonis principia consequens est quod sint plures animae in homine et in animali. Posuerunt enim Platonici universalia esse formas separatas, quae de sensibilibus praedicantur in quantum participata sunt ab eis: utpote Socrates dicitur animal in quantum participat ideam animalis, et homo in quantum participat ideam hominis. Et secundum hoc relinquitur quod alia sit forma secundum essentiam, secundum quam Socrates dicitur esse animal, et alia secundum quam dicitur esse homo. Unde ad hoc sequitur quod anima sensibilis et rationalis secundum substantiam differant. Sed hoc non potest stare: quia ex diversis actu existentibus non fit aliquid unum per se. Quia si de aliquo subiecto praedicentur aliqua secundum diversas formas per se, unum illorum praedicatur de altero per accidens. Sicut de Socrate dicitur album secundum albedinem, et musicum secundum musicam; unde musicum de albo secundum accidens praedicatur. Si igitur Socrates dicatur homo et animal secundum aliam et aliam formam, sequeretur quod haec praedicatio homo est animal, sit per accidens; et quod homo non sit vere id quod est animal. Contingit tamen secundum diversas formas fieri praedicationem per se, quando habent ordinem ad invicem; ut si dicatur quod habens superficiem est coloratum. Nam color est in substantia mediante superficie. Sed hic modus praedicandi per se non est quia praedicatum ponatur in definitione subiecti; sed magis e converso. Superficies enim ponitur in definitione coloris sicut numerus in definitione paris. Si ergo hoc modo esset praedicatio per se hominis et animalis, cum anima sensibilis quasi materialiter ordinetur ad rationalem, si diversae sint, sequetur quod animal non praedicabitur per se de homine, sed magis e contrario.
          <td>But even if this position is adopted, it still follows from Plato’s principles that there are several souls in man and in the animal. For the Platonists maintained that universals are separate forms [i.e., existing apart from things] which are predicated of sensible things inasmuch as sensible things participate in them. For example, Socrates is called an animal inasmuch as he participates in the Idea, “animal,” and a man inasmuch as he participates in the Idea, “man.” The consequence of this is that there is one form essentially in virtue of which Socrates is said to be an animal, and another in virtue of which he is said to be a man. Whence it follows in turn that the sentient and rational soul differ substantially. But this cannot be maintained, for a being having unity in its own right cannot be constituted of diverse things having actual existence [in their own right]; because if terms are predicated of some subject by reason of diverse forms having existence of themselves, one is predicated of another accidentally. For instance, it is said of Socrates that he is white according to whiteness, and musical according to music. Therefore musical is predicated of white accidentally. Hence, if Socrates is said to be a man and an animal according to different forms, it would follow that this predication, man is an animal, is an accidental one, and that man is not really what an animal is. However, it happens that an essential predication is made through different forms when they are intrinsically related to one another, as when it is said that a thing having surface is colored. For color exists in a substance through the medium of its surface. But this mode of essential predication occurs, not because the thing predicated is placed in the definition of the subject, but rather the reverse. For surface is placed in the definition of color just as number is placed in the definition of the equal. Therefore, if animal were predicated of man through this mode of essential predication, when the sentient soul is related as matter to the rational soul, assuming they are diverse, it would follow that animal is not predicated essentially of man but rather the reverse.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sequitur etiam aliud inconveniens. Ex pluribus enim actu existentibus non fit unum simpliciter, nisi sit aliquid uniens et aliquo modo ligans ea ad invicem. Sic ergo, si secundum diversas formas Socrates esset animal et rationale, indigerent haec duo, ad hoc quod unirentur simpliciter, aliquo quod faceret ea unum. Unde, cum hoc non sit assignare, remanebit quod homo non erit unum nisi aggregatione; sicut acervus, qui est secundum quid unum et simpliciter multa. Et ita etiam non erit homo ens simpliciter, quia unumquodque in tantum est ens, in quantum est unum.
          <td>An additional difficulty follows. For a being having unity absolutely cannot be constituted of diverse things having actual existence [in their own right], unless there is something uniting them and binding them to one another in some manner. Therefore, if Socrates were an animal and rational according to different forms, these two forms would need a unitary principle to make them substantially one. Therefore, since, on Plato’s hypothesis, no such unitary principle is to be found, it will follow that the unity of a man will be a unity of aggregation alone, like that of a heap of things which is relatively one and absolutely many. So neither will man be a being absolutely, because so far as a thing is a being to that extent it is one.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Iterum aliud inconveniens sequitur. Cum enim genus sit substantiale praedicatum, oportet quod forma secundum quam individuum substantiae recipit praedicationem generis, sit forma substantialis. Et ita oportet quod anima sensibilis, secundum quam Socrates dicitur animal, sit forma substantialis in eo; et sic necesse est quod det esse simpliciter corpori, et faciat ipsum hoc aliquid. Anima ergo rationalis, si est alia secundum substantiam, non facit hoc aliquid nec esse simpliciter, sed solum esse secundum quid; cum adveniat rei iam subsistenti. Unde non erit forma substantialis, sed accidentalis; et sic non dabit speciem Socrati, cum etiam species sit praedicatum substantiale.
          <td>Still another incongruity follows. For the form in accordance with which an individual substance receives a generic predication, must be a substantial one, because a genus is a substantial predicate. And thus the sentient soul in virtue of which Socrates is said to be an animal, must be his substantial form, and so must give to the body its act of existing in the absolute sense ( <i>per se</i> ), and make it to be this particular thing ( <i>hoc aliquid</i> ). Therefore, if the rational soul differs substantially from the sentient, it does not make the body to be this particular thing, nor does it give to the body an act of existing in the absolute sense, but only relatively. For in that case a rational form will accrue to a thing already actually subsisting. Consequently it will not be a substantial form but an accidental one, and thus will not make Socrates to be specifically what he is, for a species also is a substantial predicate.

          <td>It follows, therefore, that a man’s soul, which is rational, sentient, and vegetal, is substantially one only. This is a consequence of the argument given in a preceding article (Art. 9) concerning the order of substantial forms, namely, that no substantial form is united to matter through the medium of another, but that a more perfect form gives to matter whatever an inferior form does, and something over and above. Hence the rational soul gives to the human body everything that the sentient soul gives to the brute and the vegetal soul gives to the plant, and something over and above. For this reason the soul in man is both vegetal, sentient, and rational.

Quidam enim dicunt quod in embryone ante animam rationalem non est anima, sed quaedam virtus procedens ab anima parentis, et ab huiusmodi virtute sunt operationes quae in embryone apparent: quae dicitur virtus formativa. Sed hoc non est omnino verum: quia in embryone apparet non solum formatio corporis, quae potest attribui praedictae virtuti; sed etiam aliae operationes, quae non possunt attribui nisi animae, ut augeri, sentire, et huiusmodi. Posset tamen hoc sustineri, si praedictum principium activum in embryone pro tanto diceretur virtus animae, non anima, quia nondum est anima perfecta, sicut nec embryo est animal perfectum. Sed tunc eadem remanebit difficultas. Dicunt enim aliqui quod, licet primo in embryone sit anima vegetabilis quam sensibilis et sensibilis quam rationalis, non tamen est alia et alia. Sed primo quidem reducitur semen in actum animae vegetabilis per principium activum, quod est in semine. Quae quidem anima in processu temporis magis ad ulteriorem producitur perfectionem per processum generationis, et ipsamet fit anima sensibilis; quae quidem ulterius producitur in maiorem perfectionem a principio extrinseco, et fit anima rationalis. Sed secundum hanc positionem sequetur quod ipsa substantia animae rationalis sit a principio activo quod est in semine, sed alia perfectio adveniat ibi ultimo a principio extrinseco. Et ita sequeretur quod anima rationalis secundum suam substantiam sit corruptibilis: non enim potest esse incorruptibile quod a virtute quae est in semine causatur. Et ideo aliter dicendum est, quod generatio animalis non est tantum una generatio simplex; sed succedunt sibi invicem multae generationes et corruptiones. Sicut dicitur quod primo habet formam seminis, et secundo formam sanguinis, et sic deinceps quousque perficiatur generatio. Et ideo cum corruptio et generatio non sint sine abiectione et additione formae, oportet quod forma imperfecta quae prius inerat abiiciatur et perfectior inducatur; et hoc quousque conceptum habeat formam perfectam. Et ideo dicitur quod anima vegetabilis prius est in semine; sed illa abiicitur in processu generationis, et succedit alia, quae non solum est vegetabilis, sed etiam sensibilis. Ad istam iterum additur alia quae simul est vegetabilis, sensibilis et rationalis.
          <td>1. Having premised that the soul existing in the human body is substantially one only, this argument is answered in different ways by diverse men. For some claim that no soul exists in the embryo prior to the rational soul, but a certain power deriving from the soul of the parent. They maintain that the operations perceived in the embryo are caused by this power, which is called a formative one. But this is not altogether true, because there appears in the embryo not only the forming of the body (which can be attributed to the aforesaid power) but other operations as well; and these cannot be attributed to anything but a soul, such as growth, sensation, and the like. Nevertheless this position could be held if the aforesaid active principle in the embryo were called a power of a soul temporarily, and not a soul, because it is not yet a perfect one, just as the embryo is not a perfect animal. But then the same difficulty will remain. For some say that the vegetal soul exists in the embryo before the sentient soul, and the sentient before the rational, but not concomitantly. Indeed, they maintain that the semen gives rise to an actual vegetal soul as a result of an active principle existing in the semen. This soul in the course of time is brought to a higher degree of perfection by the process of generation and itself becomes a sentient soul, which in turn is brought to a still higher degree of perfection by an extrinsic principle, and becomes the rational soul. Now according to this position it follows that the substance itself of the rational soul comes from an active principle existing in the semen, but that an additional perfection accrues to it finally from an extrinsic principle. And thus it would follow that the very substance of the rational soul is corruptible. For that cannot be incorruptible which is caused by a power existing in the semen. Therefore our explanation must be different, namely, that the generation of an animal is not one simple generation alone, but that many generations and corruptions follow one another. For it is said that first the animal has the form of semen, then the form of blood, and so on successively until generation is completed. And therefore since corruption and generation do not take place without the loss of one form and the acquisition of another, the imperfect form which first exists within the embryo must be discarded and a more perfect one assumed. This continues until the thing conceived has acquired its perfect form. Consequently it is said that the vegetal soul first exists in the semen, but that it is lost in the process of generation, and that another soul succeeds it which is not only vegetal, but also sentient. Then another soul is added to this which is at once vegetal, sentient, and rational.

Non enim virtus activa quae est in semine potest esse a matre, licet hoc quidam dicant, quod femina non est principium activum, sed passivum.

The power existing in the semen which is derived from the father is a permanent intrinsic power, not one coming from an extrinsic principle, just as the power of the mover which exists in the thing thrown is intrinsic. Hence the power which is in the semen operates no matter how far away the father may be. For the active power which is in the semen cannot be caused by the mother (although some indeed maintain this), because the woman is not an active principle but a passive one. Nevertheless there is some similarity here, because, just as the thrower’s power, which is finite, moves an object to a definite place some distance away by local motion, so does the power of one generating move a thing to a determinate form by the movement of generation.

Now powers of a soul are principles of substantial differences, for a thing is said to be sensible in virtue of sense, and to be rational in virtue of reason.

          <td><b>I answer:</b> There are different opinions about this question For some say that the soul is its powers, and others deny this, holding that the powers of the soul are certain properties of it. In order to see wherein these opinions differ we must understand that a power is nothing but a thing’s principle of operation, whether it be an action or a passion [i.e., the undergoing of an action]. Indeed, a principle is not the subject acting or undergoing an action, but that by which an agent acts or a patient undergoes an action; just as the art of building is a power in the builder who builds by means of that power; and as heat is a power of fire, which heats by means of its heat; and as dryness is a power in pieces of wood, because they are combustible in virtue of this dryness. Consequently those who maintain that the soul is its powers, think that the essence itself of the soul is the immediate principle of all its operations. They say that a man understands, senses, and acts, and other things of this sort, by the essence of the soul, and that the soul is referred to by different names inasmuch as its operations differ. It is called sense inasmuch as it is the principle of sensation, intellect inasmuch as it is the principle of intellection and so on for the other powers; just as if, for example, we were to call the heat of fire its liquifying power, its heating power, and its drying power, because it does all of these.

          <td>Sed haec opinio stare non potest. Primo quidem, quia unumquodque agit secundum quod actu est, illud scilicet quod agit; ignis enim calefacit non in quantum actu est lucidum, sed in quantum est actu calidum: et exinde est quod omne agens agit sibi simile. Unde oportet quod ex eo quod agitur, consideretur principium quo agitur; oportet enim utrumque esse conforme. Unde in II Physic. dicitur quod forma et generans sunt idem specie. Cum ergo id quod agit non pertinet ad esse substantiale rei, impossibile est quod principium quo agit sit aliquid de essentia rei; et hoc manifeste apparet in agentibus naturalibus. Quia enim agens naturale in generatione agit transmutando materiam ad formam, quod quidem fit secundum quod materia primo disponitur ad formam, et tandem consequitur formam, secundum quod generatio est terminus alterationis; necesse est quod ex parte agentis id quod immediate agit sit forma accidentalis correspondens dispositioni materiae. Sed oportet ut forma accidentalis agat in virtute formae substantialis, quasi instrumentum eius; alias non induceret agendo formam substantialem. Et propter hoc in elementis non apparent aliqua principia actionum, nisi qualitates activae et passivae, quae tamen agunt in virtute formarum substantialium. Et propter hoc earum actio non solum terminatur ad dispositiones accidentales, sed etiam ad formas substantiales. Nam et in artificialibus actio instrumenti terminatur ad formam intentam ab artifice. Si vero est aliquod agens quod directe et immediate sua actione producat substantiam (sicut nos dicimus de Deo, qui creando producit rerum substantias, et sicut Avicenna dicit de intelligentia agente, a qua secundum ipsum fluunt formae substantiales in istis inferioribus), huiusmodi agens agit per suam essentiam; et sic non erit in eo aliud potentia activa et eius essentia.
          <td>Now this opinion cannot be maintained. First, indeed, because anything whatever that acts, acts according as it is in act. For fire heats not inasmuch as it is actually bright, but inasmuch as it is actually hot. It is for this reason that every agent produces an effect similar to itself. Wherefore the principle by which an agent acts must be known from its effects ( <i>quod agitur</i> ), for both must conform. Hence it is said in the <i>Physics</i> [II, 7, 198a 25] that the form and the thing generating are specifically the same.” Therefore when an effect does not result from the substantial mode of existing of the one acting, it is impossible that the principle by which such an effect is brought about, belong in any way to the essence itself of the thing acting. This is quite evident in natural agents. For since a natural agent in generating acts by changing matter with respect to some form (which change occurs inasmuch as matter is first disposed to receive the form, and then acquires it according as generation is the terminus of alteration), the principle which acts immediately on the side of the agent must be an accidental form corresponding to the disposition of the matter. Now an accidental form must act in virtue of a substantial form, and as an instrument of the latter, otherwise it would not induce a substantial form by its activity. For this reason no principles of action appear in the elements except their active and passive qualities,” which still act in virtue of their substantial forms; and on account of this their action is terminated not only in accidental dispositions, but in substantial forms as well. For in things made by art the action of an instrument is terminated in the form intended by the artisan. Indeed, if there is an agent that produces a substance directly and immediately by its action (just as we speak of God who produces the substances of things by creating them, and as Avicenna speaks of the Agent Intellect, which, by virtue of its own power, infuses substantial forms into these inferior things), then an agent of this sort acts through its own essence, and thus its active power will not differ from its own essence.

Quia unumquodque genus dividitur per potentiam et actum. Unde potentia homo est in genere substantiae, et potentia album est in genere qualitatis. Manifestum est autem quod potentiae animae, sive sint activae sive passivae, non dicuntur directe per respectum ad aliquid substantiale, sed ad aliquid accidentale. Et similiter esse intelligens vel sentiens actu non est esse substantiale, sed accidentale, ad quod ordinatur intellectus et sensus; et similiter esse magnum vel parvum, ad quod ordinatur vis augmentativa. Generativa vero potentia et nutritiva ordinantur quidem ad substantiam producendam vel conservandam, sed per transmutationem materiae; unde talis actio, sicut et aliorum agentium naturalium, fit a substantia mediante principio accidentali. Manifestum est ergo quod ipsa essentia animae non est principium immediatum suarum operationum, sed operatur mediantibus principiis accidentalibus; unde potentiae animae non sunt ipsa essentia animae, sed proprietates eius.
          <td>Concerning passive power, it is clear that a passive power which is ordered to substantial act, belongs to the genus of substance, whereas one that is ordered to accidental act, belongs to the genus of accident by reduction as a principle and not as a complete species, because every genus is divided by potency and act. Accordingly a potential man belongs to the genus of substance, and potentially white belongs to the genus of quality. Now it is evident that the powers of the soul, whether active or passive, are spoken of directly with respect to something substantial, but not with respect to something accidental. Similarly, to be understanding or sensing actually, is not a substantial mode of existing, but an accidental one to which the intellect and sense are directed. It is similar with respect to being large or small, to which the augmentative power is ordered. Indeed, the generative and nutritive powers are directed to the production or conservation of a substance, but by changing matter. Wherefore an action of this kind, like that of other natural agents, is performed by a substance through the medium of an accidental principle. Hence it is evident that the essence of the soul is not the immediate principle of its operations, but that it operates through accidental principles. Consequently the powers of the soul are not the essence itself of the soul but are properties of it.

Et ita, cum essentia animae sit unum principium, non potest esse immediatum principium omnium suarum actionum; sed oportet quod habeat plures et diversas potentias correspondentes diversitati suarum actionum. Potentia enim ad actum dicitur correlative, unde secundum diversitatem actionum oportet esse diversitatem potentiarum.

          <td>This is also evident from the very diversity of the soul’s actions, which differ generically and cannot be attributed to one immediate principle; because some are actions and some are passions, and are distinguished by other differences of this sort which must be attributed to different principles. Consequently, since the essence of the soul is one principle, it cannot be the immediate principle of all its actions, but must have many different powers corresponding to its different actions; for a power is said to be reciprocally related to its act. Hence there must be a diversity of powers in accordance with the diversity of operations. For this reason the Philosopher says, in the <i>Ethics</i> [VI, 1, 1139a 5] that the scientific power of the soul, which is concerned with necessary things, and the ratiocinative power, which is concerned with contingent things, are different powers, because the necessary and the contingent differ generically.

So far as its act of existing is concerned an accident does not go beyond its subject, but in so far as its operation is concerned it does; for the heat of fire heats something external to fire. It is in this way that the powers of the soul go beyond the soul itself, inasmuch as the soul understands and seeks not only itself but other things as well. Moreover, Augustine introduces this notion when he relates knowledge and love to the mind, not as the thing knowing and loving, but as that known and loved. For if he were to relate them to the soul itself in this way, as an accident to a subject, it would follow that the soul would know and love only itself. Perhaps it is in accordance with this meaning that he said, they are one life, one essence; because actual knowledge is the thing known in a certain respect, and actual love, the thing loved.

There are three genera of accidents: some are caused by the principles of the species, and are called proper accidents, for example, risibility in man; others are caused by the principles of the individual, and this class is spoken of [in two ways]: first, those that have a permanent cause in their subject, for example, masculine and feminine, and other things of this kind, and these are called inseparable accidents; secondly, those that do not have a permanent cause in their subject, such as to sit and to walk, and these are called separable accidents. Now no accident of any kind ever constitutes part of the essence of a thing, and thus an accident is never found in a thing’s definition. Hence we understand the essence ( <i>quod quid est</i> ) of a thing without thinking of any of its accidents. However, the species cannot be understood without the accidents which result from the principles of the species [i.e., the proper accidents], although the species can be understood without the accidents of the individual, even the inseparable accidents. Indeed, there can be not only a species but also an individual without the separable accidents. Now the powers of the soul are accidents in the sense of properties. Therefore, although the essence of the soul is understood without them, still the existence of the soul is neither possible nor intelligible without them.

Moreover, the powers of the sentient and nutritive parts are in the composite as a subject; because whatever has an act, has a power, as is shown by the Philosopher in the work <i>De somno et vigilia</i> [I, 458b 34].

          <td>1. It seems that the powers of the soul are not distinguished in this way. For the things which differ most from one another are contraries. But a contrariety of objects does not diversify powers, because the same power of vision apprehends both white and black. Therefore a difference [i.e., a specific diversity] of objects does not diversify powers.

          <td>2. Further, things which differ substantially differ more than those which differ accidentally. Now a man and a stone differ substantially, whereas a sound and something colored differ accidentally. Therefore, since a man and a stone are apprehended by the same power, so much the more so are a sound and something colored. Hence a diversity of objects is not the cause of the diversity of powers.

Ergo differentia obiectorum non est causa diversitatis potentiarum.
          <td>3. Further, if a difference of objects were the cause of the diversity of powers, one and the same object would necessarily cause powers to be identical. Now we see that one and the same object is apprehended by different powers. For the same object is known and desired, because an intelligible good is the object of the will. Consequently a diversity of objects is not the cause of the diversity of powers.

Relinquitur ergo quod differentia obiectorum non sit causa diversitatis potentiarum.
          <td>4. Further, wherever the cause is the same, the effect is also the same. Therefore, if different objects diversified some powers, they would necessarily have to cause a diversity of powers in every case. However, we do not observe this. For sometimes different objects are certainly related to different powers, as sound and color are related to hearing and to vision respectively; and, at other times, these same objects are related to one and the same power, namely, to the imagination and to the intellect. Hence it follows that a diversity of objects is not the cause of the diversity of powers.

However, only one thing comes directly from a single thing. Therefore, first of all one single power of the soul comes from its essence, and then the other powers proceed therefrom in a certain order through the medium of this [first] power. Hence the powers of the soul differ according to origin and not according to objects.

But it is seen to be impossible for one power of the soul to come from another. First, because all powers of the soul exist simultaneously. Secondly, because accidents have their existence in a subject, and one accident cannot be the subject of another. Therefore the diversity among the soul’s powers cannot be a result of the diversity among objects.

Further, the higher a substance is, the greater is its power and, as a result, less diversified ( <i>multiplicata</i> ), because every simple power is unlimited more than it is multiplied, as is said in the book <i>De causis</i> [27]. Now the soul is the most perfect of all inferior beings. Therefore its power is more unified than theirs, and still extends to many things. Consequently its power is not multiplied because of the diversity among objects.

          <td>10. Further, if the diversity among the soul’s powers depends on the diversity among objects, the order among the soul’s powers must also depend on the order among these objects. However, this is seen not to be the case, for the intellect, whose object is the quiddity ( <i>quod quid est</i> ) and substance, is subsequent to the senses, whose objects are accidents such as color and sound. Furthermore, touch is prior to sight, while the visible is prior to and more common than the tangible. Consequently there is not a diversity of powers merely because there is a difference of objects.

Therefore, since any being naturally desires its perfection, it follows that intellect and sense naturally desire every appetible object. Hence it is unnecessary to admit the existence of any appetitive power other than the sentient.

          <td>12. Further, no appetite exists except the will and the irascible and concupiscible appetite. But the will belongs to the intellective order, and the concupiscible and irascible appetites belong to the order of sense, as is pointed out in the <i>De anima</i> [III, 9, 432b 5]. Therefore no appetitive power must be held to exist in addition to the sentient and intellective.

          <td>14. Further, the powers of the soul are directed to something higher than nature, otherwise there would be powers (vires) of the soul in all natural things. But the powers which are assigned to the vegetal soul do not appear to be directed to anything higher than nature. For the vegetal soul is directed to the conservation of the species through generation; to the preservation of the individual through nutrition; and to the [development] of the individual’s proper size through augmentation. Now in natural things, nature too performs all of these activities. Consequently the powers of the soul must not be directed to such activities.

Non igitur sunt diversae potentiae generativa, nutritiva et augmentativa.
          <td>15. Further, the higher a power, the greater is its unity and the more numerous are the things to which it extends. But a power of the soul is higher than a power of nature. Therefore, since nature by one and the same power gives existence to a natural body, bestows on it its proper size, and preserves it in existence, it seems a fortiori that the soul does these things through one power. Therefore the generative, nutritive, and augmentative powers are not diverse powers.

But certain other accidents differ from one another to a greater degree than do sound and color and the like, which exist not only in the same genus of quality, but also in the same species, namely, the third [kind of quality]. Therefore, if powers are distinguished according to the difference of objects, the powers of the soul should not be distinguished by accidents of this kind, but rather by others which differ from each other to a greater degree.

Therefore, if the sentient powers are diversified because of the different genera of possible qualities, it seems that there are diverse sentient powers wherever there are diverse contraries. Now in some cases this does occur, for sight apprehends both white and black, and hearing apprehends both low and high notes; but in other cases it does not, for touch apprehends both hot and cold, wet and dry, soft and hard, and so on. Consequently powers are not distinguished from one another by’ their objects.

Hence a power must be defined by its act, and powers in turn distinguished ‘from one another inasmuch as their acts are different. Now acts derive their species from their objects, because, if they are acts of passive powers, their objects are active. However, if they are the acts of active powers, their objects are as ends. Now the species of an operation must be considered in both of these ways. For the act of heating and that of making cold are distinguished from one another, because the principle of the former is heat, and that of the latter, cold. Besides, both are terminated in similar ends. For an agent acts in order that it may cause something similar to itself to exist in another. It follows, therefore, that the distinction between the powers of the soul is based on a difference [i.e., a specific diversity] of objects.

Actio enim animae transcendit actionem naturae in rebus inanimatis operantis; sed hoc contingit quantum ad duo: scilicet quantum ad modum agendi, et quantum ad id quod agitur. Oportet autem quod quantum ad modum agendi omnis actio animae transcendat operationem vel actionem naturae inanimati; quia, cum actio animae sit actio vitae, vivum autem est quod seipsum movet ad operandum, oportet quod omnis operatio animae sit secundum aliquod intrinsecum agens. Sed quantum ad id quod agitur, non omnis actio transcendit actionem naturae inanimati. Oportet enim quod fit esse naturale, et quae ad ipsum requiruntur: sic in corporibus inanimatis, sicut in corporibus animatis. Sed in corporibus inanimatis fit ab agente extrinseco, in corporibus vero animatis ab agente intrinseco; et huiusmodi sunt actiones ad quas ordinantur potentiae animae vegetabilis. Nam ad hoc quod individuum producatur in esse, ordinatur potentia generativa; ad hoc autem quod quantitatem debitam consequatur, ordinatur vis augmentativa; ad hoc autem quod conservetur in esse, ordinatur vis nutritiva.

          <td>Now it is necessary to consider the difference between objects in this way and in this way alone, namely, that objects specifically differentiate the actions of the soul. For a species is differentiated in any genus only by the [specific] differences which essentially divide the genus. The species of “animal,” for instance, are not distinguished by white and by black, but by rational and non-rational. Furthermore, it is necessary to consider three grades in the actions of a soul. For the action of a soul transcends that of the nature operating in inanimate things. But this occurs in two ways. First, with respect to the manner of acting; secondly, with respect to what is produced by the action. Now with respect to the manner of acting, every action of a soul must transcend the operation or action of an inanimate nature. For every operation of a soul must proceed from some intrinsic agent, because an action of a soul is a vital action (moreover, every living thing is one that moves itself to operation). However, so far as the effect produced is concerned, not every action of a soul transcends an action of the nature of an inanimate thing. For the effect produced, that is, a natural mode of existing ( <i>esse naturale</i> ), and the things necessary for it, must be present in the case of inanimate bodies just as they are in the case of animate ones. But in the case of inanimate bodies, the effect is brought about by an extrinsic agent, whereas in the case of animate bodies, it is caused by an intrinsic agent. The actions to which the powers of a vegetal soul are directed, are of this sort. For the generative power is directed to giving existence to the individual thing; the augmentative power, to giving the thing its proper size; and the nutritive power, to preserving the thing in existence. But in inanimate things these effects are brought about only by an extrinsic agent. For this reason the aforementioned powers of a soul are said to be natural.

          <td>However, there are other higher actions of a soul which transcend the actions of natural forms, and also the effects produced by them, seeing that all things are disposed by nature to exist in the soul with an immaterial existence. For the human soul, in a certain respect, is all things by sensing and understanding. Moreover, there must be different grades of such immaterial existence. For there is one grade inasmuch as things exist in the soul without their proper matter, but with the singularity and individuating conditions which are the result of matter. This is the grade of sense, which is receptive of individual species without matter, yet receives them in a bodily organ. Now the intellect which receives species completely abstracted from matter and material conditions, and without [the aid of] a bodily organ, constitutes a higher and more perfect grade of immateriality. Furthermore, just as a thing has a natural inclination toward something, and has movement and action in order to pursue that toward which it is inclined through its natural form, so also does the inclination toward a thing apprehended by sense or by intellect, follow upon the apprehension of a sensible or intelligible form. This inclination belongs to the appetitive power. And again, as a consequence of this, there must be some movement by which the thing [having sense or intellect] attains the thing desired. This pertains to the motive power.

          <td>Ad perfectam autem sensus cognitionem, quae sufficiat animali, quinque requiruntur. Primo, quod sensus recipiat speciem a sensibilibus: et hoc pertinet ad sensum proprium. Secundo, quod de sensibilibus perceptis diiudicet, et ea ad invicem discernat: quod oportet fieri per potentiam ad quam omnia sensibilia perveniunt, quae dicitur sensus communis. Tertium est quod species sensibilium receptae conserventur. Indiget autem animal apprehensione sensibilium non solum ad eorum praesentiam, sed etiam postquam abierint: et hoc necessarium est reduci in aliquam potentiam. Nam et in rebus corporalibus aliud principium est recipiendi, et aliud conservandi, nam quae sunt bene receptibilia sunt interdum male conservativa. Huiusmodi autem potentia dicitur imaginatio sive phantasia. Quarto autem, requiruntur intentiones aliquae quas sensus non apprehendit, sicut nocivum et utile et alia huiusmodi. Et ad haec quidem cognoscenda pervenit homo inquirendo et conferendo; alia vero animalia quodam naturali instinctu, sicut ovis naturaliter fugit lupum tamquam nocivum. Unde ad hoc in aliis animalibus ordinatur aestimativa naturalis; in homine autem vis cogitativa, quae est collativa intentionum particularium: unde et ratio particularis dicitur, et intellectus passivus. Quinto autem, requiritur quod ea quae prius fuerunt apprehensa per sensus et interius conservata, iterum ad actualem considerationem revocentur. Et hoc quidem pertinet ad rememorativam virtutem: quae in aliis quidem animalibus absque inquisitione suam operationem habet, in hominibus autem cum inquisitione et studio; unde in hominibus non solum est memoria, sed reminiscentia. Necesse autem fuit ad hoc potentiam ab aliis distinctam ordinari, quia actus aliarum potentiarum sensitivarum est secundum motus a rebus ad animam, actus autem memorativae potentiae est e contrario secundum motum ab anima ad res. Diversi autem motus diversa principia motiva requirunt: principia autem motiva potentiae dicuntur.
          <td>Moreover, five things are required for the perfect sense knowledge which an animal should have. First, that sense receive species from sensible things and this pertains to the proper sense. Secondly, that the animal make some judgment about the sensible qualities received, and distinguish them one from another, and this must be done by a power to which all sensible qualities are related. This power is called the common sense ( <i>sensus communis</i> ). Thirdly, that the species of sensible things which have been received be retained. Now an animal needs to apprehend sensible things not only when they are present, but also after they have disappeared. And it is necessary that this also be attributed. to some power. For in corporeal things there is one principle that receives, and another that retains, because things which are good recipients are sometimes poor retainers. This power is called imagination or “phantasy” ( <i>phantasia</i> ). In the fourth place, the animal must know certain intentions which sense [i.e., the external sense] does not apprehend, such as the harmful, the useful, and so on. Man, indeed, acquires a knowledge of these by investigation and by inference, but other animals, by a certain natural instinct. For example, the sheep flees naturally from the wolf as something harmful. Hence in animals other than man a natural estimative power is directed to this end, but in man there is a cogitative power which collates particular intentions. This is why it is called both particular reason and passive intellect. In the fifth place, it is necessary that those things which were, first apprehended by sense and conserved interiorly, be recalled again to actual consideration. This belongs to a memorative power, which operates without any investigation in the case of some animals, but with investigation and study in the case of men. Therefore in men there is not only memory but also reminiscence.”’ Moreover it was necessary that a power distinct from the others be directed to this end, because the activity of the other sentient powers entails a movement from things to the soul, whereas the activity of the memorative power entails an opposite movement from the soul to things. But diverse movements require diverse motive principles, and motive principles are called powers.

          <td>Quia vero sensus proprius, qui est primus in ordine sensitivarum potentiarum, immediate a sensibilibus immutatur, necesse fuit quod secundum diversitatem immutationum sensibilium in diversas potentias distingueretur. Cum enim sensus sit susceptivus specierum sensibilium sine materia, necesse est gradum et ordinem immutationum quibus immutantur sensus a sensibilibus, accipere per comparationem ad immateriales immutationes. Sunt igitur quaedam sensibilia quorum species, licet immaterialiter in sensu recipiantur, tamen etiam materialem immutationem faciunt in animalibus sentientibus. Huiusmodi autem sunt qualitates quae sunt principia transmutationum etiam in rebus materialibus: sicut calidum, frigidum, humidum et siccum et alia huiusmodi. Quia igitur huiusmodi sensibilia immutant nos etiam materialiter agendo, materialis autem immutatio fit per contactum, necesse est quod huiusmodi sensibilia contingendo sentiantur. Propter quod potentia sensitiva comprehendens ea vocatur tactus. Sunt autem quaedam sensibilia quae quidem non materialiter immutant, sed tamen eorum immutatio habet materialem immutationem annexam; quod contingit dupliciter. Uno modo sic quod materialis immutatio annexa sit tam ex parte sensibilis quam ex parte sentientis; et hoc pertinet ad gustum. Licet enim sapor non immutet organum sensus faciendo ipsum saporosum, tamen haec immutatio non est sine aliquali transmutatione tam saporosi quam etiam organi gustus, et praecipue secundum humectationem. Alio modo sic quod transmutatio materialis annexa sit solum ex parte sensibilis. Huiusmodi autem transmutatio vel est secundum resolutionem et alterationem quamdam sensibilis, sicut accidit in sensu odoratus; vel solum secundum loci mutationem, sicut accidit in auditu. Unde auditus et odoratus, quia sunt sine mutatione materiali sentientis, licet adsit materialis mutatio ex parte sensibilis, non tangendo, sed per medium extrinsecum sentiunt. Gustus autem solum in tangendo sentit, quia requiritur immutatio materialis ex parte sentientis. Sunt autem alia sensibilia quae immutant sensum absque materiali immutatione annexa, sicut lux et color, quorum est visus. Unde visus est altior inter omnes sensus et universalior; quia sensibilia ab eo percepta sunt communia corporibus corruptibilibus et incorruptibilibus.
          <td>Now because the proper sense, which is first in the order of sentient powers, is changed immediately by sensible objects, it was necessary for it to be divided into different powers in accordance with the diversity of sensible modifications. For the grade and order of modifications by which the senses are altered by sensible qualities, must be considered in relation to immaterial modifications, because sense is receptive of sensible species without matter. Hence there are some sensible objects whose species, although they are received immaterially in the senses, still cause a material modification in sentient animals. Now qualities which are also principles of change in material things are of this sort, for instance, hot and cold, wet and dry, and the like. Hence, because sensible qualities of this kind also modify us by acting upon us, and because material modification is made by contact, it was necessary that such sensible qualities be sensed by making contact with them. This is the reason why the sensory power experiencing such qualities is called touch. However, there are some sensible qualities which do not, indeed, change us materially, although their mutation has a material change connected with it. This occurs in two ways. First, in this way, that the material change affects the sensible quality as well as the one sensing. This pertains to taste. For, although the taste of a thing does not change the sense organ by making it the tasted thing itself, nevertheless this modification does not occur without some change taking place in the thing tasted as well as in the organ of taste, and particularly as a result of moisture. Secondly, in this way, that the material change affects the sensible quality alone. Now change of this sort is caused either by a dissipation and alteration of the sensible object, as occurs, for instance, in the sense of smell, or by a local change only, as occurs in the case of hearing. So it is that hearing and smell sense not by contact with an object, but through an extrinsic medium, because they occur without a material change on the side of the one sensing, although material change does take place in the sensible object. However, taste alone senses by contact, because it requires a material modification in the one sensing. Furthermore, there are other <i>sensibilia</i> which modify a sense without a material change being involved, such as light and color, and the sense which apprehends these is sight. Hence sight is the noblest of all the senses and extends to more objects than the other senses do ( <i>universalia</i> ), because the sensible qualities perceived by it are common both to corruptible and incorruptible bodies.

          <td>Similiter autem vis appetitiva, quae consequitur apprehensionem sensus, necesse est quod in duo dividatur.

For a thing is appetible either because it is delightful and suitable to the senses, and the concupiscible power is directed to this; or because the capacity of enjoying things delightful to the senses is made possible through it, which sometimes occurs together with something that is displeasing to sense. For instance, when an animal by fighting makes possible the enjoyment of something properly delightful by driving away anything that hinders this. The irascible power is directed to this end.

Moreover, this must occur in view of the fact that something is changed within a substance by augmentation and is added to that substance. Furthermore, this change is brought about by heat, which transforms both what is taken in from without, and also what exists within the thing itself. Hence a nutritive power is necessary for the conservation of the individual in order that whatever is lost may be continually restored; that whatever is lacking for the completion of its size may be added; and that whatever is necessary for the generation of semen may be produced. This nutritive power serves both the augmentative and the generative power, and thereby preserves the individual in existence.

Nevertheless all are alike in this respect, that they do not sense through an external medium; and all are called touch, so that there is one sense generically, divided into several species. However, it could be said that there is one sense pure and simple ( <i>simpliciter</i> ), because all the contraries of which touch is cognitive are known of themselves ( <i>per se</i> ); for they are known alternately and brought together under one genus, although this is unnamed, since the proximate genus both of heat and of cold is unnamed.

          <td>1. It seems that the soul is corruptible, for we read: “The death of man and the beast is one and the condition of them both is equal” (Eccles. 3: 19). Now when beasts die their soul perishes with them. Consequently when a man dies, his soul perishes along with his body.

Hence, if the soul has the power of remaining in existence for an infinite length of time, it follows that this power is itself infinite. But the essence of an infinite power is not finite. Therefore, if the soul is incorruptible, its essence is infinite. But this is impossible, for the divine essence alone is infinite. Consequently the human soul is not incorruptible.

On the other hand, whatever does not belong to a thing by virtue of its own essence is not essential to it; and, as the Philosopher points out in the <i>Metaphysics</i> [X, 10, 1058b 36–1059a 9] corruptible and incorruptible are predicated essentially of everything whatever.

On the contrary, the soul is not the form of the body in an accidental way, otherwise, since the soul is constitutive of man inasmuch as it is the form of the body, it would follow that man would be a being <i>per accidens</i> . But whatever does not belong to a thing accidentally, belongs to it by its very essence. Consequently the soul is a form according to its very essence.

Now without the body the soul can do nothing; it cannot even perform an act of knowledge. This is evident from the fact that intellection is impossible without a phantasm, as the Philosopher points out [De anima, III, 7, 431a 14], and there are no phantasms without the body. Consequently the soul cannot exist in separation from the body but ceases to exist when the body corrupts.

For the highest part of a being of an inferior nature in some way strives to imitate the action of the being superior to it. Thus the ape in some way imitates the action of a man, and yet does not attain to the human level. Similarly, in view of the fact that man occupies the highest rank in the order of material things, it seems that he in some fashion imitates the action of the separate intellectual substances, namely, the act of intellection, and yet does not really attain to it. Hence there does not seem to be any necessary reason for holding that the human soul is immortal.

Now since the human soul is a form, it appears that it is not a particular thing, and that it does not belong to a species or to a genus as an individual member of the former or as a species of the latter. For to exist in a genus or in a species belongs to a composite [of matter and form], and not to matter or to form taken separately, except by reduction.

Manifestum est autem quod esse per se consequitur formam: unumquodque enim habet esse secundum propriam formam; unde esse a forma nullo modo separari potest. Corrumpuntur igitur composita ex materia et forma per hoc quod amittunt formam ad quam consequitur esse. Ipsa autem forma per se corrumpi non potest, sed per accidens corrupto composito corrumpitur, in quantum deficit esse compositi quod est per formam; si forma sit talis quae non sit habens esse, sed sit solum quo compositum est.
          <td><b>I answer:</b> It must necessarily be granted that the human soul is incorruptible. In proof of this we must take into consideration the fact that whatever belongs to a thing in virtue of its very nature ( <i>per se</i> ), cannot be taken away from it; for example, animality cannot be taken away from man, nor can the even and odd be taken away from number. Moreover it is evident that the act of existing in itself is a result of a form, for everything has its act of existing from its proper form; wherefore its act of existing can in no way be separated from its form. Therefore things composed of matter and form are corrupted by losing the form that gives them their act of existing. Moreover a form itself cannot be corrupted in itself ( <i>per se</i> ), but is corrupted accidentally as a result of the disintegration of the composite, inasmuch as the composite, which exists in virtue of its form, ceases to exist as a composite. This indeed, is the case if the form is one that does not have an act of existing in itself, but is merely that by which a composite exists.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Si ergo sit aliqua forma quae sit habens esse, necesse est illam formam incorruptibilem esse. Non enim separatur esse ab aliquo habente esse, nisi per hoc quod separatur forma ab eo; unde si id quod habet esse, sit ipsa forma, impossibile est quod esse separetur ab eo. Manifestum est autem quod principium quo homo intelligit est forma habens esse in se, et non solum sicut quo aliquid est. Intelligere enim, ut philosophus probat in III de anima, non est actus expletus per organum corporale. Non enim posset inveniri aliquod organum corporale quod esset receptivum omnium naturarum sensibilium; praesertim quia recipiens debet esse denudatum a natura recepti, sicut pupilla caret colore. Omne autem organum corporale habet naturam aliquam sensibilem. Intellectus vero quo intelligimus est cognoscitivus omnium sensibilium naturarum; unde impossibile est quod eius operatio, quae est intelligere, exerceatur per aliquod organum corporale. Unde apparet quod intellectus habet operationem per se, in qua non communicat corpus. Unumquodque autem operatur secundum quod est: quae enim per se habent esse, per se operantur. Quae vero per se non habent esse, non habent per se operationem; non enim calor per se calefacit, sed calidum. Sic igitur patet quod principium intellectivum quo homo intelligit, habet esse elevatum supra corpus, non dependens a corpore.
          <td>Now if there is a form having an act of existing in itself, then that form must be incorruptible. For a thing having an act of existing ( <i>esse</i> ) does not cease to exist unless its form is separated from it. Hence if the thing having an act of existing is itself a form, it is impossible for its act of existing to be separated from it. Now it is evident that the principle by which a man understands is a form having its act of existing in itself and is not merely that by which something exists. For, as the Philosopher proves in the <i>De anima</i> [III, 4, 429b 3], intellection is not an act executed by any bodily organ. The main reason why there is no bodily organ capable of receiving the sensible forms of all natural things, is that the recipient must itself be deprived of the nature of the thing received; just as the pupil of the eye does not possess the color that it sees. Now every bodily organ possesses a sensible nature. But the intellect, by which we understand, is capable of apprehending all sensible natures. Therefore its operation, namely, understanding, cannot be carried out by a bodily organ. Thus it is clear that the intellect has an operation of its own in which the body does not share. Now a thing operates in accordance with its nature ( <i>quod est</i> ), for things that exist of themselves have an operation of their own, whereas things that do not exist of themselves have no operation of their own. For example, heat in itself does not produce warmth, but something hot. Consequently it is evident that the intellective principle, by which man understands, has it own mode of existing superior to that of the body and not dependent upon it.

Relinquitur ergo quod principium intellectivum quo homo intelligit, sit forma habens esse; unde necesse est quod sit incorruptibilis.

The sole conclusion to be drawn from all this, then, is that the intellective principle, by which man understands, is a form having its act of existing in itself. Therefore this principle must be incorruptible. This indeed agrees with the Philosopher’s dictum [De anima, III, 5, 430a 22] that the intellect is something divine and everlasting. Now it was shown in preceding articles (Articles 2 and 5), that the intellective principle, by which man understands, is not a substance existing apart from man but is something formally inhering in him which is either the soul or a part of the soul. Thus, from the foregoing considerations we conclude that the human soul is incorruptible.

Others held that the intellect does not differ from the senses, and so they declared that the intellect does not operate except through a bodily organ; that it does not have a higher mode of existence than that of the body, and, therefore, that it is not a form having an act of existing in its own right. Still others held that the intellect, by which man understands, is a separate substance. But the falsity of all these opinions has been demonstrated in preceding articles. It therefore remains that the human soul is incorruptible.

Est enim intellectus apprehensivus rerum in universali, secundum quem modum non accidit eis corruptio. Secundo, ex naturali appetitu qui in nulla re frustrari potest. Videmus enim hominibus appetitum esse perpetuitatis. Et hoc rationabiliter: quia cum ipsum esse secundum se sit appetibile, oportet quod ab intelligente qui apprehendit esse simpliciter, et non hic et nunc, appetatur esse simpliciter, et secundum omne tempus. Unde videtur quod iste appetitus non sit inanis; sed quod homo secundum animam intellectivam sit incorruptibilis.
          <td>Two additional arguments can be considered as an indication of this: First, respecting the intellect itself, because we see that even those things which are corruptible in themselves are incorruptible so far as they are perceived by the intellect. For the intellect apprehends things in and through universal concepts, and things existing in this [universalized conceptual] mode are not subject to corruption. Secondly, the natural appetite also provides an argument for the incorruptibility of the soul. Natural appetite [desire springing from the nature of man] cannot be frustrated. Now we observe in men the desire for perpetual existence. This desire is grounded in reason. For to exist (esse) being desirable in itself, an intelligent being who apprehends existence in the absolute sense, and not merely the here and now, must desire existence in the absolute sense and for all time. Hence it is clear that this desire is not vain, but that man, in virtue of his intellective soul, is incorruptible.

Or it may be said that the death of man and that of the beast is one and the same so far as the dissolution of the composite is concerned, since, for the one as for the other, this dissolution is brought about by the separation of the soul from the body. But there is this difference: after that separation occurs, the human soul remains in existence, whereas the soul of the brute does not.

Nunc autem anima non est in genere sicut species, sed sicut pars speciei. Utrumque autem compositum corruptibile est: tam illud cuius pars est anima humana, quam illud cuius pars est anima iumentorum; et propter hoc nihil prohibet ea esse unius generis.
          <td>2. Even if the human soul and the soul of brutes were brought under the same [logical] genus, nevertheless they would still exist in different natural genera; for the corruptible and the incorruptible are, of necessity, generically different in reality, although they can be ranged under one common concept; that is, from the standpoint of logic they can be considered under the same generic notion. Moreover, the soul does not exist in a genus as a species thereof, but as a part of a species. Yet both the composites in question are corruptible: the composite of which the human soul is a part, as well as the composite of which the soul of brutes is a part. Hence there is no reason why both types of soul may not belong to one and the same [logical] genus.

          <td>4. The act of existing ( <i>esse</i> ) is related to a form as something consequent upon the form in virtue of its very nature, and not as an effect to its efficient cause, in the manner in which motion, for example, is related to the power of the thing that produces it. Consequently, although the fact that a thing can move in infinite time may prove that its movement is infinite, nevertheless the fact that a thing can exist in infinite time does not prove that the form whereby it exists is infinite; any more than the fact that a given quantity is always equal proves that it is infinite. On the contrary, the fact that a thing exists in infinite time proves the infinite power of that which is the cause of its being.

Although the soul is a form by its very essence, nevertheless inasmuch as it is a form of a particular kind, that is, a subsisting form, it can have a certain character which does not belong to it simply as a form; just as the act of understanding does not belong to man inasmuch as he is an animal, although he is an animal by his very essence.

However, sin does take away something of the inclination toward or aptitude for grace; and inasmuch as every sin stems from a contrary disposition, sin is said to take away some part of that good of nature which is aptitude for grace. But sin never destroys completely the good of nature; because, under contrary dispositions, the potentiality for good always remains, though by sin that potentiality is further and further removed from actualization.

For, as the Philosopher observes in the <i>De anima</i> [I, 4, 408b 20], if an old man acquired the eye of a youth, he would see as well as the youth does. From this it is clear that functional debility does not result from a debility of the soul but from that of a bodily organ.

Ergo intelligere non manet in anima a corpore separata.
          <td>1. It seems that the soul, when separated from the body, is incapable of understanding. For no operation proper to the human composite remains in the soul when it exists apart from the body. Now understanding is an operation of the composite; for the Philosopher says in the <i>De anima</i> [I, 4, 408b, 11] that to say that the soul understands is like saying that it weaves or builds. Therefore the act of understanding does not remain in the soul when it exists in separation from the body.

          <td>Praeterea, philosophus dicit in III de anima, quod nequaquam est intelligere sine phantasmate. Sed phantasmata, cum sint in organis sentiendi, non possunt esse in anima separata. Ergo anima separata non intelligit.
          <td>2. Further, the Philosopher states in the <i>De anima</i> [III, 7, 431a 14] that understanding in no way takes place without a phantasm. Now since phantasms exist in the sense organs, they cannot exist in the separated soul. Hence the soul does not understand when it is separated from the body.

          <td>3. But we must say that the Philosopher is speaking of the soul inasmuch as it is united to the body, and not of the separated soul. On the other hand, the separated soul can understand only by means of its intellective faculty. Now understanding is either [a form] of imagination or is impossible without imagination, as the Philosopher says in the <i>De anima</i> [I, 1, 403a 8]. But the imagination does not exist without the body. Therefore neither is there any understanding without the body. Consequently the soul does not understand when it, is separated from the body.

          <td>4. Further, the Philosopher says in the <i>De anima</i> [III, 7, 431a 16] that the intellect is related to phantasms as sight is to colors. But sight cannot see without colors. Therefore the intellect does not understand without the body.

          <td>5. Further, the Philosopher says in the <i>De anima</i> [I, 4, 408b 18] that understanding is corrupted when certain things within [the body] are corrupted; for example, the heart or the natural heat of the body. However, this is what occurs after the soul is separated from the body. Therefore the soul is incapable of understanding when it is separated from the body.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed dicebat quod anima a corpore separata intelligit quidem, non autem isto modo quo nunc intelligit a phantasmatibus abstrahendo. &amp;8212;Sed contra, forma unitur materiae non propter materiam, sed propter formam; nam forma est finis et perfectio materiae. Unitur autem forma materiae propter complementum suae operationis; unde talem materiam forma requirit per quam operatio formae compleri possit, sicut forma serrae requirit materiam ferream ad perficiendum opus secandi. Anima autem est forma corporis. Unitur ergo tali corpori ad complementum suae operationis. Propria autem eius operatio est intelligere. Ergo si potest sine corpore intelligere, frustra corpori unitur.
          <td>6. But it may be argued that the soul does understand when it is separated from the body, although not by abstracting from phantasms as it does in the present life. On the other hand, a form is not united to matter for the sake of the matter but for the sake of the form; for the form is the end and the perfection of the matter. Now a form is united to matter for the sake of fulfilling its own proper operation. Hence a form requires that specific type of matter by which its operation can be carried to completion, just as the form of a saw requires ferrous matter in order to accomplish the work of cutting. Now the soul is the form of the body. Consequently the soul is united to that specific type of body which is adapted to carrying out the soul’s proper operation. Now the soul’s proper operation consists in understanding. Therefore, if the soul can understand without the body, then the soul is united to the body in vain.

Bonum autem animae est in intelligendo; nam perfectio cuiuslibet substantiae est propria operatio eius. Ergo si anima sine corpore intelligere potest praeter phantasmata, nocivum esset ei corpori uniri; et sic non esset ei naturale.
          <td>7. Further, if the separated soul is capable of understanding, it understands in a more excellent manner when apart from the body than when united to it. For beings which have no need of phantasms in order to understand, do so in a more excellent way than we, who understand through the medium of phantasms. Now the good of the soul lies in its act of understanding; for the perfection of every substance consists in its own proper operation. Therefore, if the soul is capable of understanding without the aid of phantasms, when separated from the body, then it would be harmful to the soul to be united to a body, and hence would not be natural to it.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, potentiae diversificantur penes obiecta. Sed animae intellectivae obiecta sunt phantasmata, ut dicitur in III de anima.

          <td>8. Further, powers are diversified by their objects. But the objects of the intellective soul are phantasms, as the Philosopher says in the <i>De anima</i> [III, 7, 431a 14]. Therefore, if the intellective soul when separated from the body understands without phantasms, it must have powers other than those which it possesses when united to the body. But that is impossible, since the soul’s powers are natural to it and inhere in it inseparably.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, si anima separata intelligit, oportet quod per aliquam potentiam intelligat.

Intellectus enim agens facit phantasmata esse intelligibilia actu, intellectus autem possibilis recipit species intelligibiles a phantasmatibus abstractas. Videtur ergo quod nullo modo anima separata intelligere possit.
          <td>9. Further, if the separated soul understands, it must understand by means of some power. Now there are only two intellective powers in the soul: the agent intellect and the possible intellect. But it seems that the separated soul cannot understand by means of either of these powers. For the operation of each of them bears on phantasms: the agent intellect renders phantasms actually intelligible, whereas the possible intellect receives the intelligible species abstracted from phantasms. Consequently it seems that the separated soul is incapable of understanding in any way.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, unius rei una est propria operatio, sicut et unius perfectibilis una est perfectio.

          <td>10. Further, there is but one proper operation for one thing, just as there is only one perfection for one perfectible thing. Therefore, if the operation of the soul consists in understanding by receiving [intelligible species] from phantasms, it seems that understanding without phantasms cannot be the operation of the soul, and hence that it does not understand when separated from the body.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, si anima separata intelligit, oportet quod aliquo intelligat; quia intelligere est per similitudinem rei intellectae in intelligente.

Unius enim essentia, quia infinita est, omnem in se perfectionem praehabens, similitudo est omnium rerum. Similiter etiam neque per essentiam rei intellectae; quia sic intelligeret solum illa quae per essentiam suam sunt in anima. Neque etiam per aliquas species, ut videtur, intelligere potest. Non per species innatas, sive concreatas: hoc enim videtur redire in opinionem Platonis, qui posuit omnes scientias esse nobis naturaliter inditas.
          <td>11. Further, if the separated soul understands, it must understand by means of something, because understanding takes place when the likeness of the thing understood exists in the one understanding. It cannot be said, however, that the separated soul understands by its own essence. This is true only of God; for His essence, being infinite, possesses in itself from eternity every perfection, and thus is the likeness of all things. Nor can it be said that the separated soul understands through the essence of the thing understood, because in that case it would understand only those things which are in the soul in virtue of its essence alone. Moreover it seems that the separated soul cannot understand through any species whether innate or concreated, for this would apparently be a reversion to Plato’s theory that we are naturally endowed with all knowledge [Phaedo 18, Euthydemus 20, 22].
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, huiusmodi species frustra viderentur esse animae innatae, cum per eas intelligere non possit dum est in corpore. Species autem intelligibiles ad nihil aliud ordinari videntur nisi ut per eas intelligatur.
          <td>12. Further, species of this sort seem to be needlessly implanted in the soul because, so long as it remains in the body, the soul cannot understand through them. However, intelligible species seem to have no other purpose than this, that the soul may understand through them.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed dicebat quod anima, quantum est de se, potest intelligere per species innatas; sed impeditur a corpore, ne per eas intelligere possit. &amp;8212;Sed contra, quanto aliquid est perfectius in sua natura, tanto perfectius est in operando. Sed anima unita corpori est perfectior in sua natura quam cum est a corpore separata; sicut quaelibet pars in suo toto existens perfectior est. Si igitur anima separata a corpore per species innatas intelligere potest, multo magis corpori unita potest intelligere per easdem.
          <td>13. Now it may be argued that, considered in itself, the soul is able to understand through innate species but that, as a matter of fact, it is hindered by the body from understanding through them. On the contrary, the more perfect a thing is in its nature, the more perfect it is in its operation. Now the soul is more perfect in its nature when united to the body than when it is separated from the body, just as every part of a whole is more perfect when it exists in that whole than when separated from, it. Therefore, if the soul existing in separation from the body is able to understand through innate species, it is even more capable of understanding through them when united to the body.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, nihil naturalium alicuius rei totaliter impeditur per id quod ad naturam pertinet. Ad naturam autem animae pertinet ut corpori uniatur, cum sit corporis forma.

          <td>14. Further, none of the natural properties of a thing are totally impeded by anything which pertains to the nature itself. Now it pertains to the very nature of the soul to be united to the body, because the soul is the form of the body. Hence, if intelligible species are naturally implanted in the soul, the soul would not be prevented from understanding through them because of its union with the body.

          <td><b>I answer:</b> The fact that our soul in its present condition needs sensible things in order to understand, is the cause of the difficulty encountered in solving the problem raised in this article. Therefore, to solve this problem, we must consider the various explanations for this need [of sensible things] that have been proposed. For some men (namely, the Platonists [Phaedo 10, 18, Meno], as Aristotle points out [Metaph., I, 6, 987b 4]) have maintained that, in order for the soul to understand it does not need the senses essentially ( <i>per se</i> ), as though knowledge were caused in us by the senses, but only accidentally inasmuch as our soul is stirred by the senses to recollect things which it knew in a previous existence, and of which it possesses a knowledge naturally endowed. To account for this mode of understanding Plato held that the species of things subsisted apart from them, and were actually intelligible entities. He called them “Ideas” and maintained that our soul knows and understands by participating in them, and by some kind of infusion. Moreover, according to Plato, the soul, prior to its union with the body, was able to use this knowledge freely, but as a result of that union it was so weighed down by the body, and somehow smothered by it, that it seemed to have forgotten the things it had previously known. and of which it had possessed connatural knowledge. They also maintained that the soul was in some way stimulated by the senses so that it turned back upon itself and recollected those things which it previously knew and of which it had innate knowledge; just as it sometimes happens that our sense experiences are the occasion for our recollecting vividly certain things which we seemed to have forgotten.

          <td>This position of Plato on knowledge and on sense-objects conforms with his position on the generation of natural things.

Similiter etiam non potest dari quod propter corpus: non enim anima est propter corpus, sed corpus magis propter animam, cum anima sit nobilior corpore. Unde et inconveniens videtur quod anima ad nobilitandum corpus sustineat in sua operatione detrimentum.

For [according to the Platonic view under consideration] this union is not for the sake of the soul, because when the soul is not united to the body it can still exercise perfectly its own proper operation, whereas its proper operation is impeded by its union with the body. Similarly, according to this view, it cannot be argued that the union of soul and body exists for the sake of the body; for the soul does not exist for the sake of the body, but rather the body for the soul, because the soul is nobler than the body. Then, too, it seems incongruous that the soul should suffer a loss in its own operation for the sake of ennobling the body. It also seems to follow from this view that the union of the soul with the body is not natural, for whatever is natural to a thing does not impede the operation proper to that thing. Hence, if union with a body impeded the soul’s understanding, it would not be natural but contrary to the nature of the soul to be united to a body; and in that case man, who is constituted of a soul united to a body, would not be a natural being; which seems absurd.

This is the opinion of Avicenna. For Avicenna maintains that there is a certain separate substance which he calls the intellect or “the Agent Intelligence; that the intelligible species through which we understand flow into our intellect from this Agent Intellect, and that by the operation of the sentient part, the imagination and other things of this sort, our intellect is prepared for orientating itself toward the Agent Intellect and for receiving the influx of intelligible species from it. This theory agrees with Avicenna’s view on the generation of natural things; for he maintains that all substantial forms flow from the Agent Intellect, and that natural agents only dispose the matter for receiving forms from the Agent Intellect.

It is evident also that we have need of certain phantasms in things divinely revealed to us through the influence of superior substances. Thus Dionysius says [De cael. hier., I, 2]: “The divine light cannot shine upon us unless it is screened round about by many sacred veils.” Now this would not be so if we needed phantasms only to orientate us toward superior substances.

Sed sicut colores non sunt visibiles actu nisi per lumen, ita phantasmata non sunt intelligibilia actu nisi per intellectum agentem.

For they are not accidental in the manner of stimuli, as Plato held, nor, are they merely dispositive, as Avicenna claimed, but re-present to the intellective soul its proper object, as Aristotle says in the <i>De anima</i> [III, 7, 431a 14]: “Phantasms are to the intellect what sensible things are to sense.” Now just as colors are made actually visible by light, so phantasms are made actually intelligible only by the agent intellect. This agrees with what we hold about the generation of natural things. For as we maintain that superior agents produce natural forms by means of natural agents, so we maintain that the agent intellect produces knowledge in our possible intellect through phantasms rendered actually intelligible by the agent intellect. The question whether the agent intellect is a separate substance, as some held, or a light in which our soul participates in the manner of superior substances, has no bearing on this last point.

Ad hanc igitur difficultatem tollendam considerandum est, quod anima, cum sit infima in ordine intellectivarum substantiarum, infimo et debilissimo modo participat intellectuale lumen, sive intellectualem naturam. Nam in primo intelligente, scilicet Deo, natura intellectualis est adeo potens quod per unam formam intelligibilem, scilicet essentiam suam, omnia intelligit; inferiores vero substantiae intellectuales per species multas. Et quanto unaquaeque earum est altior, tanto habet pauciores formas, et virtutem magis potentem ad intelligendum omnia per formas paucas.

Anima ergo humana, quae est infima, si acciperet formas in abstractione et universalitate conformes substantiis separatis, cum habeat minimam virtutem in intelligendo, imperfectissimam cognitionem haberet, utpote cognoscens res in quadam universalitate et confusione.

          <td>Now according to this latter theory it seems even more difficult to see how the separated soul can understand. For [on that hypothesis] there will be no phantasms requiring corporeal organs for their apprehension and retention. Yet if these be removed, it is seen that the soul cannot understand; just as the faculty of sight cannot function in the absence of colors. Now in order to solve this problem the fact must be borne in mind that the soul, being lowest in the order of intellectual substances, participates in intellectual light or in intellectual nature, in the lowest and weakest measure. For in the first intelligence, namely, God, intellectual nature is so powerful that He understands all things through one intelligible form, namely, His own essence. Inferior intellectual substances, on the other hand, understand through many species; and the higher each of these substances is, the fewer forms it possesses, and the more potent is its faculty of understanding all things through those few forms. However, even if an inferior intellectual substance possessed forms equally as universal as those of a superior substance, its knowledge would still remain incomplete, since it does not have so great a power of understanding, because that inferior intellectual substance would only know things universally; and, from the few universal forms it apprehends, it could not bring its knowledge to bear on singulars. Therefore, if the human soul, which is lowest in the order of intellectual substances and hence possesses the least intellectual power of them all, received forms abstractly and universally, as separate substances do, then it would have a most imperfect kind of knowledge: that of knowing things in the universal and indistinctly. Hence, in order that the soul’s knowledge may be perfect in its kind and bear directly upon singulars, the soul must acquire a knowledge of truth from singular things. However, the light of the agent intellect is necessary in order that those things may be received in the soul and may exist there in a higher mode than that in which they exist materially. Hence it was necessary that the soul be united to a body for the perfection of its intellectual operation.

Nevertheless an influx of this sort will not produce knowledge as perfect and as directly related to singulars as the knowledge which we acquire here below through the senses, though a much more perfect knowledge will be had in addition to this natural influx by those souls that will enjoy the influx of a supernatural light by which they will know all things most fully and will see God Himself.

          <td>3. In its present state of union with the body, the soul does not participate in intelligible species flowing from superior substances, but only in intellectual light. Consequently the soul is in need of phantasms as objects from which it may receive intelligible species. But after its separation from the body, the soul will indeed participate more fully in intelligible species, and therefore will have no need of external objects.

          <td>5. It is clear from what has been said before that Aristotle refers in this place to the opinion of certain philosophers who held that the intellect has a bodily organ just as a sense faculty does. Now if this were maintained, the separated soul would be entirely incapable of understanding anything. Or we may reply that Aristotle is speaking of that mode of understanding which we possess here and now.

          <td>9. The operation of the agent intellect and that of the possible intellect bear on phantasms so long as the soul remains united to the body; but when the soul will be separated from the body, it will receive, through its possible intellect, the species that flow into it from superior substances, and it will have the power of understanding through its agent intellect.

Intelligible species sometimes exist in the possible intellect only potentially; and when that is the case man knows only potentially, and thus needs to be made actually knowing either by teaching or by discovery. Sometimes, however, intelligible species exist in the possible intellect in a completely actual way, and when that is the case, it knows actually. Sometimes, however, they exist in it in a mode midway between potency and act, that is to say, as a habit; and when that is the case the intellect can understand actually whenever it wishes.

For the operation of a power is distinguished and specified by the formal nature of the object, not by its matter. Hence, if the separated soul understands through intelligible species which are retained in the intellect, and which were previously acquired from phantasms, and not by actually turning itself to phantasms, then the operation which results from the species so acquired, and the operation by which those species are acquired, will not be specifically different.

The possible intellect is disposed by nature to receive [species] from phantasms only so far as the phantasms are actualized by the light of the agent intellect, which is a kind of participation of the light of superior substances.

          <td>Et videtur quod sic. Nulla enim forma impeditur a fine suo per materiam cui naturaliter unitur. Finis enim animae intellectivae videtur esse intelligere substantias separatas, quae sunt maxime intelligibiles. Uniuscuiusque enim rei finis est ut perveniat ad perfectum in sua operatione. Non ergo anima humana impeditur ab intelligendo substantias separatas per hoc quod unitur tali corpori, quod est propria eius materia.
          <td>1. It seems that the soul, when united to the body, can understand separate substances. For no form is prevented from attaining its end by the, matter to which it is naturally united. Now the end of the intellective soul seems to consist in knowing separate substances, which are in the highest degree intelligible; for the end of each and every thing is to attain perfection in its operation. Therefore the human soul is not prevented from understanding separate substances by being united to the body, which is the soul’s own proper matter.

          <td>Praeterea, finis hominis est felicitas. Ultima autem felicitas, secundum philosophum in X Ethic., consistit in operatione altissimae potentiae, scilicet intellectus, respectu nobilissimi obiecti, quod non videtur esse nisi substantia separata. Ergo ultimus finis hominis est intelligere substantias separatas. Inconveniens autem est, si homo totaliter deficiat a fine suo: sic enim vanum esset. Cognoscere ergo potest homo substantias separatas. Sed de ratione hominis est quod anima corpori sit unita. Ergo anima unita corpori intelligere potest substantias separatas.
          <td>2. Further, the end of man is happiness. Now according to the Philosopher, in the <i>Ethics</i> [X, 7, 1177a 11; 8, 1178b 10], ultimate happiness consists in the operation of man’s highest power, namely, the intellect, and is related to the noblest object, which seems to be none other than a separate substance. Hence man’s last end consists in understanding separate substances. Now it would be incongruous if man failed completely to attain his end; for in that case his life would be meaningless. Therefore man can know separate substances. But it belongs to man’s very essence to possess a soul that is united to a body. Therefore the soul, when it is united to the body, can understand separate substances.

          <td>Praeterea, omnis generatio pervenit ad aliquem terminum: nihil enim in infinitum movetur.

Hoc ergo non procedit in infinitum, sed pervenit quandoque ad aliquem terminum, ut scilicet totaliter sit factus in actu. Quod esse non potest nisi omnia intelligibilia intelligat, inter quae praecipue sunt substantiae separatae. Ergo intellectus humanus ad hoc pervenire potest quod intelligat substantias separatas.
          <td>3. Further, every generative process reaches a terminus, for no process goes on to infinity. Now there is a certain intellectual generation whereby the intellect is brought from potency to act, that is to say, is made actually knowing. Therefore this process does not go on to infinity but at some time will reach a terminus, that is, it will be completely actualized. But this end can be attained only when the intellect understands all intelligible things, especially separate substances. Therefore the human intellect is capable of attaining a knowledge of separate substances.

          <td>Praeterea, difficilius videtur facere separata ea quae non sunt separata et intelligere ea, quam intelligere ea quae secundum se sunt separata.

Ergo multo fortius poterit intelligere substantias separatas.
          <td>4. Further, it seems to be more difficult to separate from matter things which do not exist in separation therefrom, and to apprehend those things, than to apprehend things which exist in themselves apart from matter. But even when united to the body, our intellect separates from matter things which do not in themselves exist apart from matter, inasmuch as it abstracts the intelligible species by which it apprehends material things. Therefore our intellect will be even more capable of apprehending separate substances.

          <td>Praeterea, excellentia sensibilia pro tanto minus sentiuntur quia corrumpunt harmoniam organi. Si autem esset aliquod organum sensus quod non corrumperetur ab excellenti sensibili, quanto sensibile esset excellentius, tanto magis sentiret ipsum. Intellectus autem nullo modo corrumpitur ab intelligibili, sed magis perficitur. Ergo ea quae sunt magis intelligibilia magis intelligit. Sed substantiae separatae, quae sunt secundum se actu intelligibiles utpote immateriales, sunt magis intelligibiles quam substantiae materiales, quae non sunt intelligibiles nisi in potentia. Ergo, cum anima intellectiva unita corpori intelligat substantias materiales, multo magis intelligere potest substantias separatas.
          <td>5. Further, sense objects that are excessively intense ( <i>excellentia sensibilia</i> ) are sensed to a lesser degree than others, because they destroy the harmony of a sense organ. However, if there were a sense organ which was not affected adversely by the intensity of its sensible object, then the more intense the sensible object, the more fully would the sense organ experience that object. Now the intellect is not corrupted in any way by an intelligible object, rather is it perfected by it. Hence the more intelligible things are, the better the intellect knows them. But separate substances which are actually intelligible in themselves, because they are immaterial, are more intelligible than material substances, which are intelligible only potentially. Therefore, since the intellective soul when it is united to the body apprehends material substances, it is even more capable of apprehending separate substances.

Cum ergo substantiae separatae nihil aliud sint quam quaedam quidditates per se existentes, videtur quod anima intellectiva unita corpori intelligere possit substantias separatas.
          <td>6. Further, even when the intellective soul is united to the body it abstracts the quiddity from things having a quiddity; and, since it cannot regress to infinity, it must in this abstractive process eventually attain to a quiddity that is not a thing having a quiddity, but is a quiddity only. Therefore, since separate substances are nothing but certain quiddities existing of themselves, it seems that the intellective soul, when united to the body, is capable of apprehending separate substances.

          <td>7. Further, it is natural for us to acquire a knowledge of causes from their effects. However, some of the effects caused by separate substances must be found in sensible and material things; for, as Augustine shows in the <i>De Trinitate</i> [III, 4], all corporeal things are governed by God through the agency of the angels. Therefore the soul, when united to the body, can apprehend separate substances through sensible objects.

However, [these theorists] entertain different opinions as to the way in which we understand such substances. For some have maintained that our soul cannot acquire an understanding of separate substances in the way in which we -acquire an understanding of those other intelligible objects which we learn about in the speculative sciences. The latter type of knowledge is acquired through definitions and demonstrations, whereas a knowledge of separate substances, these theorists maintained, can be acquired only as a result, of the Agent Intellect itself being united to us. For they supposed that the Agent Intellect was a separate substance which by its own nature understands separate substances. Hence, when this Agent Intellect shall be united to us, enabling us thereby to understand through Itself (as we now understand through intellectual habits of scientific knowledge), we shall, consequently, apprehend separate substances.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Modum autem quo iste intellectus agens possit sic continuari nobis, ut per eum intelligamus, talem assignant. Manifestum est enim ex philosopho in II de anima quod quando nos dicimur aut esse aut operari aliquid duobus, unum eorum est quasi forma, et aliud sicut materia. Sicut dicimur sanari sanitate et corpore; unde sanitas comparatur ad corpus sicut forma ad materiam. Manifestum est etiam nos intelligere per intellectum agentem, et per intelligibilia speculata; venimus enim in cognitionem conclusionum per principia naturaliter nota, et per intellectum agentem. Necesse est igitur quod intellectus agens comparetur ad intelligibilia speculata sicut principale agens ad instrumentum, et sicut ut forma ad materiam, vel actus ad potentiam; semper enim quod est perfectius duorum, est quasi actus alterius. Quidquid autem recipit in se id quod est quasi materia, recipit illud etiam quod est quasi forma. Sicut corpus recipiens superficiem, recipit etiam colorem, qui est forma quaedam superficiei; et pupilla recipiens colorem, recipit etiam lumen, quod est actus coloris, eo enim est visibilis actu. Sic igitur intellectus possibilis in quantum recipit intelligibilia speculata, in tantum recipit de intellectu agente. Quando igitur intellectus possibilis receperit omnia speculata, tunc totaliter recipiet in se intellectum agentem; et sic intellectus agens fiet quasi forma intellectus possibilis, et per consequens unum nobis. Unde sicut nunc intelligimus per intellectum possibilem, tunc intelligemus per intellectum agentem, non solum omnia naturalia sed etiam substantias separatas.
          <td>Moreover, they explain the manner in which this Agent Intellect can be united to us so that we may understand. For it is evident, [they argue], from what the Philosopher says in the <i>De anima</i> [II, 2, 414a 4] that whenever we are said to be so-and-so or to do so-and-so, two things are involved, one having the role of form, the other the role of matter; just as we are said to be made healthy by health and with respect to the body, so that health is related to the body as a form to matter. It is clear also [they say] that we understand by the Agent Intellect and through intelligible objects-known ( <i>speculata</i> ); for we arrive at a knowledge of conclusion through principles known naturally, and through the Agent Intellect. Therefore the Agent Intellect must be related to intelligible objects-known as a principal agent is to an instrument, and as a form is to matter, or as act is to potency. For of two things, the more perfect always has the character of an act with respect to the other. Moreover, whatever receives in itself that which has the character of a form, also receives that which has the character of matter; just as a body having a surface is also receptive of color, which is a kind of form possessed by that surface. Likewise, the pupil of the eye which receives color, also receives light, which is the act of color; for by light color is made actually visible. Consequently, in the same way, so far as the possible intellect receives intelligible objects-known, to that extent does it receive from the Agent Intellect. Hence, when the possible intellect receives all objects-known, then at that time it will receive the Agent Intellect unto itself completely; and thus the Agent Intellect will assume the character of a form in the possible intellect, and consequently will become one with us. Hence, as we at present understand through the possible intellect, so shall we then understand through the Agent Intellect; and we shall understand not only all natural things but separate substances as well.

Impossibilis quidem, quia duo impossibilia ponit: scilicet quod intellectus agens sit quaedam substantia separata a nobis secundum esse; et quod nos per intellectum agentem intelligimus sicut per formam. In tantum enim aliquo operamur ut forma, in quantum illo adipiscimur aliquod esse actu. Sicut calidum calore calefacit, in quantum est calidum actu; nihil enim agit nisi secundum quod est actu. Oportet ergo id quod aliquid agit aut operatur formaliter, uniri ei secundum esse. Unde impossibile est quod duarum substantiarum separatarum secundum esse una formaliter operetur per aliam.

          <td>Now it is impossible to maintain this position. It is gratuitous, and it is contrary to the meaning of Aristotle’s doctrine.”’ It is impossible to maintain this position because it premises two contradictory affirmations ( <i>duo impossibilia</i> ): namely, that the Agent Intellect is a separate substance existing apart from us, and that we understand through the Agent Intellect as through a form. Now so far as we carry out an operation by means of something having the character of a form, to that extent do we cause something to exist actually, just as a hot thing heats by its heat inasmuch as it is actually hot. For a thing acts only so far as it is in act. Hence that by which a thing acts or operates formally, must be united to that thing with respect to its very act of existing. Hence in the case of two substances existing in separation from one another, it is impossible for one of them to operate formally through the other. Thus, if the Agent Intellect is a separate substance existing apart from us, we cannot understand by it formally, although we may be able to understand by it actively, as we are said to see by the light of the sun.

          <td>Vana est etiam praedicta positio, quia rationes ad ipsam inductae non de necessitate concludunt. Et hoc patet in duobus. Primo quidem, quia si intellectus agens est substantia separata ut ponunt, comparatio intellectus agentis ad intelligibilia speculata non erit sicut luminis ad colores, sed sicut solis illuminantis. Unde intellectus possibilis per hoc quod recipit intelligibilia speculata, non coniungitur substantiae eius, sed alicui effectui ipsius. Sicut oculus, per hoc quod recipit colores, non unitur substantiae solis, sed lumini eius. Secundo, quia dato quod per hoc quod recipit intelligibilia speculata coniungatur intellectus possibilis ipsi substantiae intellectus agentis aliquo modo, non tamen sequitur quod recipiendo omnia intelligibilia speculata, quae abstrahuntur a phantasmatibus et acquiruntur per principia demonstrationum, perfecte coniungantur substantiae intellectus agentis. Nisi hoc esset probatum quod omnia huiusmodi intelligibilia speculata adaequarent virtutem et substantiam intellectus agentis; quod patet esse falsum: quia intellectus agens est altioris gradus in entibus, si est substantia separata, quam omnia quae fiunt intelligibilia per ipsum in rebus naturalibus.
          <td>The aforesaid position is likewise gratuitous ( <i>vana</i> ), because the arguments advanced for it are not conclusive with necessity. Two considerations make this point clear. First, indeed, because if, as the advocates of this view maintain, the Agent Intellect is a separate substance, then this intellect will not be related to intelligible objects-known as light is to colors, but as the sun shining is to colors. Hence, simply because the possible intellect receives intelligible objects-known, that intellect is not thereby brought into substantial union with the Agent Intellect, but is united only to an effect of it; just as the eye by receiving colors is not united to the substance of the sun, but only to the sun’s light. Secondly, because (supposing we grant that the possible intellect, being receptive of intelligible objects-known, is in some way united substantially to the Agent Intellect), even though the possible intellect receives all intelligible objects-known, the latter being abstracted from phantasms and known demonstratively through the principles of demonstration, it would not follow that the possible intellect had thus been perfectly united with the Agent Intellect. This could be the case only if it were proved that all those intelligible objects together were equivalent in power and in substance to the power and substance of the Agent Intellect itself. This is obviously untrue, for if the Agent Intellect is a separate substance, it is by that fact alone of a higher order of being than all those objects in the natural order which are rendered intelligible by it.

          <td>Mirum est etiam quod ipsimet non intellexerunt defectum suae rationis.

Manifestum est autem quod multo plus excedunt substantiae intelligibiles separatae omnia praedicta, quae dicuntur intelligibilia speculata, quam omnia ea simul accepta excedunt unum vel duo, vel quolibet ex eis. Quia omnia ista sunt unius generis, et eodem modo intelligibilia; substantiae autem separatae sunt altioris generis, et altiori modo intelliguntur. Unde etiam si continuetur intellectus agens nobiscum secundum quod est forma et agens istorum intelligibilium, non sequitur propter hoc quod continuetur nobiscum secundum quod intelligit substantias separatas.
          <td>It is also remarkable that these people did not see the evident error in their reasoning. For, although they maintained that all intelligible objects-known were united by one or two of these objects, still it does not follow for this reason, according to them, that we shall know all the other intelligible objects-known. Now it is evident that separate intelligible substances surpass all those objects which they call intelligible objects-known to a far greater degree than all of the latter taken together exceed one or two or any number of themselves; for these objects are all of one genus and have the same mode of intelligibility, whereas separate substances are of a higher order, and have a higher mode of intelligibility. Hence if the Agent Intellect is brought into union with us as a form, and as the agent of those intelligibles, it does not for this reason follow that it is united to us as a knower of separate substances.

          <td>It is likewise clear that this whole position is contrary to the meaning of the doctrine of Aristotle, who says in the <i>Ethics</i> [I, 9, 1099b 18] that happiness is a common good which all who are not deprived of virtue may possess. But to understand all those things which these theorists call intelligible objects-known is impossible for any man, or at least is so rare that in this life no man ever did in fact attain such understanding, except Christ Himself, who was both God and man. Hence it is impossible that such knowledge should be required for human happiness. Now the ultimate happiness of man consists in knowing the noblest intelligible objects, as the Philosopher says in the <i>Ethics</i> [X, 7, 1177a 20]. Thus it is not necessary for a man to know all intelligible objects-known in order to know those substances which are the noblest intelligibles, and in the knowledge of which human happiness consists. in another way this whole position is evidently contrary to the meaning of Aristotle’s doctrine. For it is said in <i>Ethics</i> [I, 13, 1102a 5] that happiness consists in acting in accordance with perfect virtue. So in order to show clearly and precisely what happiness actually consists in, Aristotle found it necessary, as he says near the end of the <i>Ethics</i> [I, 11-2a 5], to determine the nature of all the virtues. He maintains that some of these are moral virtues, such as fortitude, temperance, and the like; however, others are intellectual virtues, which he held to be five in number: wisdom, understanding, science, prudence, and art. He says that the chief of these is wisdom, and that ultimate happiness consists in the exercise of wisdom, as appears in his text. Moreover, it is clear from his <i>Metaphysics</i> [I, 2, 982b 7], that wisdom is First Philosophy itself. Hence it follows, according to Aristotle, that the ultimate human happiness which can be had in this life, consists in such knowledge of separate substances as can be acquired through the principles of philosophy, and not through any union [with an Agent Intellect] such as some have vainly imagined.

          <td>Unde fuit alia opinio, quod anima humana per principia philosophiae devenire potest ad intelligendum ipsas substantias separatas. Ad quod quidem ostendendum sic procedebat. Manifestum est enim quod anima humana potest abstrahere a rebus materialibus quidditates earum, et intelligere eas; hoc enim contingit quoties intelligimus de aliqua re materiali quid est. Si igitur illa quidditas abstracta non est quidditas pura, sed etiam res habens quidditatem, iterum intellectus noster potest abstrahere illam. Et, cum non possit procedere in infinitum, devenietur ad hoc quod intelligat aliquam simplicem quidditatem et per eius considerationem intellectus noster intelliget substantias separatas, quod nihil aliud sunt quam quaedam simplices quidditates.
          <td>Wherefore there is another theory according to which the human soul can attain to an understanding of separate substances through the principles of philosophy. The upholders of this theory proceeded to demonstrate their position as follows. It is evident [they point out], that the human soul can abstract quiddities from material things and can apprehend them; for this is precisely what happens whenever we grasp what ( <i>quid est</i> ) a material thing is. Now if that abstracted quiddity is not a pure quiddity but is itself a thing having a quiddity, then even so the intellect must eventually succeed in grasping the simple quiddity itself alone, because it is impossible to go on to infinity in the process of abstraction. And by contemplating simply quiddities, our intellect is, in fact, understanding separate substances because the latter are themselves nothing else than simple quiddities.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed haec ratio omnino est insufficiens. Primo quidem, quia quidditates rerum materialium sunt alterius generis a quidditatibus separatis, et habent alium modum essendi. Unde per hoc quod intellectus noster intelligit quidditates rerum materialium, non sequitur quod intelligat quidditates separatas. Item diversae quidditates intellectae differunt specie; et inde est quod etiam qui intelligit quidditatem unius rei materialis, non intelligit quidditatem alterius. Non enim qui intelligit quid est lapis intelligit quid est animal. Unde, dato quod quidditates separatae essent eiusdem rationis cum quidditatibus materialibus, non sequeretur quod qui intelligit has quidditates rerum materialium, intelligeret substantias separatas; nisi forte secundum opinionem Platonis, qui posuit substantias separatas esse species horum sensibilium.
          <td>However, this argument is entirely inadequate: first of all because the quiddities of material things are of a different order from separate quiddities and have a different mode of existing; so it does not follow that our intellect understands separate quiddities simply because it grasps the quiddities of material things. In the second place, the diverse quiddities apprehended by the intellect, themselves differ specifically, so that a person who apprehends the quiddity of one material thing does not thereby apprehend the quiddity of another; for example, to understand what “stone” is, is not to understand what “animal” is. Thus, even if we granted that separate quiddities are of the same formal character ( <i>ratio</i> ) as material quiddities, it would follow that one who understands the latter likewise understands the former, unless one happened to subscribe to Plato’s view that separate substances are the species of these sensible things.

          <td>Et ideo aliter dicendum est, quod anima intellectiva humana ex unione ad corpus habet aspectum inclinatum ad phantasmata; unde non informatur ad intelligendum aliquid nisi per species a phantasmatibus acceptas.

In tantum igitur anima, dum est unita corpori, potest ad cognitionem substantiarum separatarum ascendere, in quantum potest per species a phantasmatibus acceptas manuduci. Hoc autem non est ut intelligatur de eis quid sint, cum illae substantiae excedant omnem proportionem horum intelligibilium, sed possumus hoc modo de substantiis separatis aliquo modo cognoscere quia sunt. Sicut per effectus deficientes devenimus in causas excellentes, ut cognoscamus de eis tantum quia sunt; et dum cognoscimus quia sunt causae excellentes, scimus de eis quia non sunt tales quales sunt earum effectus. Et hoc est scire de eis magis quid non sunt quam quid sunt. Et secundum hoc est aliqualiter verum quod, in quantum intelligimus quidditates quas abstrahimus a rebus materialibus, intellectus noster convertendo se ad illas quidditates potest intelligere substantias separatas, ut intelligat eas esse immateriales, sicut ipsae quidditates sunt a materia abstractae. Et sic per considerationem intellectus nostri deducimur in cognitionem substantiarum separatarum intelligibilium. Nec enim est mirum, si substantias separatas non possumus in hac vita cognoscere intelligendo quid sunt, sed quid non sunt; quia etiam quidditatem et naturam corporum caelestium non aliter cognoscere possumus. Et sic etiam Aristoteles notificat ea in I de caelo et mundo; scilicet ostendens quod non sunt gravia neque levia, neque generabilia neque corruptibilia, neque contrarietatem habentia.
          <td>Consequently, in opposition to this doctrine, we must maintain that the intellectual soul of man, by being united to the body, has its vision turned toward phantasms, and is informed ( <i>informare</i> ) in its intellection only through species acquired from phantasms. This agrees with the statement of Dionysius in Book I of the <i>De caelestia hierarchia</i> [I, 2] for he says: “The divine light can shine upon us only when screened round about by many sacred veils.” Hence the soul, while united to the body, is capable of attaining a knowledge of separate substances only so far as it can be led thereto through species derived from phantasms. But in this way the soul will not attain quidditative knowledge of those substances, because their order of intelligibility transcends completely that of the intelligible species of material things abstracted from phantasms. However, we can in this way attain some [non-quidditative] knowledge of those separate substances, we can know that they exist ( <i>quia sunt</i> ); just as from lowly and deficient effects we proceed to lofty causes, but only to the extent that we know they exist. And while we know that these superior causes exist, at the same time we know that they are not of the same nature as their effects, and this knowledge consists in knowing what they are not, rather than what they are. Consequently it is true to say that, inasmuch as we grasp the quiddities which we abstract from material things, our intellect can, by turning to those quiddities, apprehend separate substances, so that it knows them to be immaterial, just as are the quiddities themselves which are abstracted from matter. Thus, thanks to the reflective power of our intellect, we are brought to a knowledge of intelligible separate substances. Nor is there cause for wonder if in this life we are incapable of knowing separate substances in their very essence, but can know only what they are not. For it is only in this way that we can know even the quiddity and nature of the celestial bodies. Thus in the <i>De caelo et mundo</i> [I, 10, 259b 5] Aristotle shows that the celestial bodies are neither heavy nor light, generable nor corruptible, nor subject to contrariety.

Licet igitur intellectus non habeat organum quod possit corrumpi ab intelligibili excellenti, tamen aliquod excellens intelligibile potest excedere facultatem intellectus nostri in intelligendo. Et tale intellegibile est substantia separata, quae excedit facultatem intellectus nostri, qui secundum quod est unitus corpori, est natus perfici per species a phantasmatibus abstractas.

Therefore, although the intellect does not have an organ which can be made inoperative by an intelligible object of great intensity, yet something supremely intelligible can exceed the intellective power of our intelligence. Such an object is a separate substance, which exceeds the ‘power of our intelligence, for our intelligence, inasmuch as it is united to the body, is naturally disposed to be actuated and perfected by species abstracted from phantasms. Nevertheless, if our intelligence did apprehend separate substances, it would have not less but greater understanding of other things.

Et hoc ideo est, quia nihil est intelligibile secundum quod est in potentia, sed secundum quod est actu, ut dicitur in IX Metaph. Unde, cum intellectus possibilis sit in potentia tantum in esse intelligibili, non potest intelligi nisi per formam suam per quam fit actu, quae est species a phantasmatibus abstracta; sicut et quaelibet alia res intelligitur per formam suam. Et hoc est commune in omnibus potentiis animae, quod actus cognoscuntur per obiecta, et potentiae per actus, et anima per suas potentias.

For this reason the Philosopher says in the <i>De anima</i> [III, 4, 429b 9] that the possible intellect is itself intelligible like other things. The reason for this is that nothing is intelligible so far as it is in potency, but only so far as it is in act, as is said in the Metaphysics [IX, 9, 1051a 30]. Hence, since the possible intellect is only in potency with respect to intelligible being, it can be known only through the form by which it is actuated, namely, by a species abstracted from phantasms; just as everything else is known through the form which it has. That acts are known through objects, powers through acts, and the soul through its powers, is indeed common to all the powers of the soul. So likewise the intellective soul is known through its own act of understanding. However, a species abstracted from phantasms is not the form of a separate substance through which that substance can be known, in the same way as the possible intellect is understood through that form.

This argument is entirely ineffective for two reasons: first, because intelligibles do not exist in order that intellects may know them; they rather exist as the ends and perfections of intellects. Consequently, if an intelligible substance existed which was not actually known by any intellect other than itself, this substance would not for that reason exist in vain. For the expression in vain ( <i>frustra</i> ) is said of that which concerns the end that a thing fails to reach. Secondly, the argument of this objection is ineffective because, even if separate substances are not apprehended by our intellect while united to the body, yet they are apprehended by separate substances.

Similiter nec per speciem eius; quia a substantiis separatis, cum sint simplices, non potest fieri abstractio speciei. Ergo anima separata nullo modo cognoscit substantias separatas.
          <td>4. Further, if the soul, when separated from the body, knows a separate substance, it must know such a substance either through that substance’s essence, or through a species of it. But the soul does not know a separate substance through its essence, because the essence of a separate substance is not the same as that of a separated soul. Similarly, the soul cannot know a separate substance through a species of such a substance, for no species can be abstracted by the soul from separate substances, because they, are simple. Consequently, when the soul exists apart from the body, it can in no way know separate substances.

          <td>5. Further, if the soul, existing in separation from the body, knows a separate substance, the soul apprehends that substance either by its senses or by its intellect. Now it is obvious that the soul does not apprehend a separate substance by its senses, because separate substances are not sensible things. Neither are separate substances apprehended by the soul’s intellect, because its intellect does not know singulars, and separate substances are singular substances. Therefore the soul, existing apart from the body, can in no way understand separate substances.

Further, our possible intellect differs from an angel to a greater degree than our imagination does from our possible intellect, because our imagination and possible intellect are rooted in one and the same substance of the soul.

Now if the souls of the damned understand separate substances, which we here on earth cannot understand, it seems that the damned are nearer to happiness than we are. This is incongruous.

Further, there are two ways of acquiring knowledge: first, by proceeding from what is subsequent to what is prior, and thus things which are better known absolutely ( <i>simpliciter</i> ) are known by us through those things which are less known absolutely. Secondly, by proceeding from what is prior to what is subsequent, and thus things which are better known absolutely are known first by us. Now the first manner of knowing cannot be found in souls existing apart from bodies for that manner of knowing is proper to us so far as we derive our knowledge from the senses. Consequently the separated soul understands in the second manner, namely, by proceeding from what is prior to what is subsequent; and then those things which are better known absolutely are known first by the soul. But that which is best known is the divine essence. Therefore, if the separated soul knows separate substances by its nature, it seems that it can grasp the divine essence, which is life eternal, through natural things alone. This is contrary to the Apostle, who says: “The grace of God is life eternal” (Rom. 4:23).

          <td>Moreover, the fact that souls existing apart from bodies know separate substances wherever they may be, is in accord with reason. For it is clear that the human soul, when joined to the body, has a direct knowledge of inferior things because of its union with the body. Wherefore the soul is perfected only by what it receives from inferior things, namely, by species abstracted from phantasms. Consequently the soul can acquire a knowledge of itself, and of other things, only inasmuch as it is led thereto through the aforementioned species, as was explained above (Art. 16).

Et sic seipsam cognoscet directe suam essentiam intuendo, et non a posteriori, sicut nunc accidit.

The soul will be actuated by infused species of this kind and thus will know itself directly by understanding its own essence, and not in an a posteriori fashion as it does in its present state. Moreover, by its essence the soul belongs to the genus of separate intellectual substances, although it is the lowest in this genus, and possesses the same mode of subsisting; for every separate substance is a subsisting form. Therefore, just as one separate substance knows another by immediately understanding ( <i>intuendo</i> ) its own essence, inasmuch as there is in its own essence some likeness of the other substance which it knows (either because it receives infused species from that substance, or from a superior one that is the common cause of both of them), so also does the separated soul, by immediately understanding its own essence, know separate substances by reason of the infused species received from them, or from the highest cause, namely, God.

Moreover it must be observed that a species through which something is known is not always abstracted from the thing that is known through that species, but only when the knower receives the species from the thing itself. When this is the case the species is received in a simpler and more immaterial way in the knower than it is in the thing that is known through it. Indeed, if the opposite were true, namely, that the thing known is more immaterial and simpler than the knower, then the species of the thing known in the knower is not said to be abstracted, but to be impressed and infused.

To know a singular is incompatible with our intellectual cognition only inasmuch as the singular is individuated by this matter; for our intelligible species must be abstracted from matter.

However, these are more in keeping with the species and nature ( <i>ratio</i> ), because both of these belong to a thing having an intellective mode of existing. Moreover, an action is the natural effect of the form according to the nature of its species, and not of the subject itself. Therefore, so far as conformity of action is concerned, more attention must be paid to the conformity of two forms that are specifically the same existing in different substances, than to the conformity of specifically different forms existing in the same subject.

Moreover, their wills do tend toward some good, because even the demons, as Dionysius says [De div. nom., IV, 23], desire what is good and best, to live, to exist, and to understand; but this good is not ordered to the highest good, and hence their wills are perverse. Therefore nothing prevents the souls of the damned from understanding many truths, but they do not understand the First Truth, namely, God, the vision of whom causes happiness.

Qui autem te et illa novit, non propter illa beatior, sed propter te solum beatus.

The ultimate happiness of man does not consist in knowing any created thing, but in knowing God alone; wherefore Augustine says, in his <i>Confessions</i> : “Happy is he who knows you, though he does not know not these,” namely, creatures; “but unhappy is he who knows these and does not know you. And whoever knows both you and them, is not the happier for them but for you only” [V, 4].

Sicut enim substantiae separatae alterius modi esse habent quam substantiae materiales, ita Deus alterius modi esse habet quam omnes substantiae separatae. In rebus enim materialibus tria est considerare, quorum nullum est aliud: scilicet individuum, naturam speciei et esse. Non enim possumus dicere quod hic homo sit sua humanitas, quia humanitas consistit tantum in speciei principiis; sed hic homo supra principia speciei addit principia individuantia, secundum quod natura speciei in hac materia recipitur et individuatur. Similiter etiam nec humanitas est ipsum esse hominis. In substantiis autem separatis, quia immateriales sunt, natura speciei non recipitur in aliqua materia individuante, sed est ipsa natura per se subsistens. Unde non est in eis aliud habens quidditatem, et aliud quidditas ipsa. Sed tamen aliud est in eis esse, et aliud quidditas. Deus autem est ipsum suum esse subsistens. Unde, sicut cognoscendo quidditates materiales non possumus cognoscere substantias separatas, ita nec substantiae separatae per cognitionem suae substantiae possunt cognoscere divinam essentiam.
          <td>10. Although that mode of knowing by which the soul knows better the things which are better known in themselves, is proper to the separated soul, nevertheless it does not follow that the separated soul, or any other created separate substance, through its own nature and essence, can understand God; for just as separate substances possess a more excellent mode of existing -than material substances do, so does God possess a more excellent mode of existing than all separate substances. For in material beings three things have to be taken into consideration, no one of which is the same as the others; namely, the individual, the specific nature, and the act of existing (esse). For we cannot say that this man is his humanity, because humanity is comprised only of the principles of the species; but this man adds individuating principles over and above the principles of the species inasmuch as the nature of the species is received and individuated in this matter. Likewise humanity is not a man’s act of existing. However, in separate substances the nature of the species is not received in any individuating matter, because separate substances are immaterial, but the nature of the species is the nature itself subsisting in virtue of itself. Consequently in them the thing having a quiddity and the quiddity itself are one and the same, although their act of existing and quiddity differ from each other.” Only God is His own subsisting act of existing. Therefore, as we cannot know separate substances by knowing material quiddities, neither can separate substances know the divine essence by knowing their own substance.

Therefore, if souls existing in separation from bodies know all natural things, it seems that they acquire this knowledge after their separation from the body. But some souls acquire a knowledge of some natural things in this life. Consequently after separation from their bodies, these souls will possess a twofold knowledge of the same things: one acquired in this life, another, when they exist apart from the body. This seems impossible, for two forms of the same species do not exist in the same subject.

Therefore, since the possible intellect, when it exists apart from the body, has only one order [of objects], because in that state it is not attracted to different things by the senses, it seems that the possible intellect is capable of receiving only one intelligible form, and thus of knowing only one natural thing instead of all natural things.

In the second case, since individuals are infinite in number, it would follow that an infinite number of likenesses exists in the separated soul. This seems impossible. Therefore the separated soul does not know all natural things.

For if I know that every [female] mule is sterile, I can apply this knowledge only to this particular mule which I know.

However, it is evident that, so long as it remains united to the body, the human soul is in potency with respect either to all things, or at least to most of the things which can be known naturally, for the intellect does not know all things actually. Therefore if, after its separation from the body, the soul knows all natural things, it must be actuated by something. Now this is apparently none other than the agent intellect, “by which all things are made,” as is said in the <i>De anima</i> [III, 5, 430a 15]. But the agent intellect cannot actualize the soul with respect to all those intelligibles which it did not apprehend. Thus the Philosopher, in the <i>De anima</i> [III, 5, 430a 15; 7, 431a 14], compares the agent intellect to light, and phantasms to colors. Now light does not suffice to make all visible things actually visible unless colors be present also. Therefore neither will the agent intellect be able to actuate the possible intellect with respect to all intelligibles, for, since phantasms reside in bodily organs, they cannot be present to the separated soul.

On the other hand, whenever a thing is actuated by an external agent differing generically from itself, such actuation is not natural. Thus if something curable is cured by art or by divine power, the cure will be either artificial [i.e., a work of medical art] or miraculous; however, a cure will be natural only when it is effected through an intrinsic principle. Now the proper and connatural agent so far as the possible intellect of man is concerned, is the agent intellect. Therefore, if the possible intellect is not actuated by an agent intellect but by some higher agent, then the natural knowledge, of which we have been speaking, Will not exist. Hence no such knowledge will be had by all separated souls in common, because it is only with respect to natural things that all separated souls are united.

Likewise it would appear incongruous if the souls of the damned received from God, after death, such great perfection that they were cognizant of all natural things.

Therefore, if the separated soul apprehends all natural things, then apparently every separate substance, simply because of the separate existence which it enjoys, truly possesses its own ultimate perfection, namely, happiness.

However the active principle from which it receives an influx ( <i>influentiam</i> ), namely, a separate substance, is in act with respect to all of these intelligible objects. Consequently the separate substance brings the soul from potentiality to act either with respect to all intelligible objects or to none. But obviously not with respect to none, for separated souls apprehend certain things of which they were not cognizant here below. Therefore it actuates them with respect to all intelligible objects.

Similiter etiam et quaecumque sunt in natura corporali, sunt eminentius in natura intellectuali. Formae enim rerum corporalium in ipsis rebus corporalibus sunt materialiter et particulariter; in ipsis vero substantiis intellectualibus sunt immaterialiter et universaliter. Unde et in Lib. de causis dicitur, quod omnis intelligentia est plena formis. Ulterius autem quaecumque sunt in tota creatura, eminentius sunt in ipso Deo.

          <td>In proof of this the fact should be borne in mind that the order among things is such that whatever exists in an inferior nature exists in a higher mode in a superior nature. Thus whatever is found in things susceptible of generation and corruption [terrestrial bodies], exists in a higher mode in celestial bodies as in their universal causes. For example, hot and cold, and other things of this sort, exist in inferior bodies as particular qualities and forms, but exist in celestial bodies as universal powers by which such qualities and forms are conveyed to those inferior bodies. In like manner, whatever exists in a corporeal nature, exists in a higher mode in an intellectual nature. Thus the forms of corporeal things exist materially and particularly in those corporeal things, whereas they exist immaterially and universally in intellectual substances. Wherefore it is said in the book <i>De causis</i> [X] that every intelligence is full of forms. Furthermore, everything that exists in the creature exists in a higher mode in God Himself. For the natures and forms of things exist in creatures in many diverse modes, but in God they exist unitedly, in a simple and undivided way.

Unde considerandum est quod, eo modo quo aliquid est de perfectione naturae, eo modo ad perfectionem intelligibilem pertinet. Singularia namque non sunt de perfectione naturae propter se, sed propter aliud: scilicet ut in eis salventur species quas natura intendit. Natura enim intendit generare hominem non hunc hominem; nam in quantum homo non potest esse, nisi sit hic homo. Et idem est quod philosophus dicit in libro de animalibus quod in assignandis causis accidentium speciei oportet nos reducere in causam finalem, accidentia vero individui in causam efficientem vel materialem. Quasi solum id quod est in specie, sit de intentione naturae. Unde et cognoscere species rerum pertinet ad perfectionem intelligibilem; non autem cognitio individuorum, nisi forte per accidens.
          <td>This existence of things is expressed in three ways (Gen. 1:6 ff.): First, God said: “Let there be a firmament,” by which is understood the existence of things in the Word of God. Secondly, it is said: “And God made the firmament,” by which is understood the existence of the firmament in the angelic intelligence. Thirdly, it is said: “And it was made thus,” by which is understood the existence of the firmament in its proper nature, as Augustine explains. The same applies to the other creations of God. For just as things flowed from God that they might subsist in their proper nature, so from the divine wisdom the forms of things flowed into intellectual substances so that those things might be understood. Hence it must be borne in mind that the mode in which a thing exists in the order of natural perfection is the mode proper to it in the order of intelligible perfection. Now in the order of natural perfection singulars do not exist on their own account but for the sake of something else, namely, that in them the species to which they belong may be preserved. This indeed is what nature intends. For nature intends to generate man, not this man. Or rather, it generates this man only because the species cannot exist unless the individual man exists. Thus the Philosopher, in his work the <i>De generatione animalium</i> [V, 1, 778b 10], states that in assigning the causes of the accidents of a species we must go back to the final cause. But the accidents of the individual, he says, must be reduced to the efficient or material cause, thus suggesting that only what pertains to the species as such falls under the intention of nature. Thus knowledge of the species of things pertains to intellectual perfection, but not the knowledge of individuals, except perhaps accidentally.

For the intelligible forms of things exist in a more united and more universal mode in superior intellectual substances than they do in inferior [intellectual substances] where they are multiplied to a greater extent and are less universal according as they are further and further removed from the first simple Being [God], and come closer and closer to the particularity of things. But thanks to their greater intellective power, superior substances perfect their intelligence through a few forms, so that they know the natures of things down to their ultimate species. Now even if forms as universal as those existing in superior intellectual substances were possessed by inferior substances, the latter would not thereby attain that ultimate intellectual perfection which consists in knowing things down to their individual species, because inferior intellectual substances have an inferior intellective power. Hence their knowledge of things will remain more or less universal and indistinct; and generality and indistinctness are the marks of imperfect knowledge. For it is evident that the more active the intellect, the greater is its ability to acquire much from little. An indication of this is that things must be explained one by one to uncultivated people and to slow learners, and particular examples introduced for each single thing.

          <td>Manifestum est autem quod anima humana est infima inter omnes intellectuales substantias; unde eius capacitas naturalis est ad recipiendum formas rerum conformiter rebus materialibus. Et ideo anima humana unita est corpori ut ex rebus materialibus species intelligibiles possit recipere secundum intellectum possibilem. Nec est ei maior virtus naturalis ad intelligendum, quam ut secundum huiusmodi formas sic determinatas in cognitione intelligibili perficiatur. Unde et lumen intelligibile quod participat, quod dicitur intellectus agens, hanc operationem habet, ut in huiusmodi species intelligibiles faciat actu. Quoniam igitur anima est unita corpori, ex ipsa unione corporis habet aspectum ad inferiora, a quibus accipit species intelligibiles proportionatas suae intellectivae virtuti, et sic in scientia perficitur. Sed, cum fuerit a corpore separata, habet aspectum ad superiora tantum, a quibus recipit influentiam specierum intelligibilium universalium. Et, licet minus universaliter recipiantur in ipsa quam sint in substantiis superioribus, tamen non est sibi tanta efficacia virtutis intellectivae, ut per huiusmodi genus specierum intelligibilium possit perfectam cognitionem consequi, intelligendo specialiter et determinate unumquodque; sed in quadam universitate et confusione, sicut cognoscuntur res in principiis universalibus. Hanc autem cognitionem acquirunt animae separatae subito per modum influentiae, et non successive per modum instructionis, ut Origenes dicit.
          <td>Now the human soul is obviously the lowest among all intellectual substances. Consequently it is capable by nature of receiving the forms of things in the material order. Thus the human soul is united to a body in order that the soul may receive intelligible species from material things through its possible intellect. Nor is its natural intellective power greater than that required for perfecting its knowledge through such forms. Hence the intelligible light in which the human soul participates and which is called the agent intellect, has as its function to actualize intelligible species of the type referred to. Therefore, since the soul is united to the body, the soul’s vision is turned toward inferior things; from these it abstracts intelligible species proportioned to its intellective power, and it is in this way that the soul is perfected in knowledge. But when the soul is separated from the body, its vision is directed toward higher things alone, and from these it receives an influx of universal intelligible species. And although the species thus received have ; less universal mode of existence in the separated soul than they enjoy in those higher substances, nevertheless the intellective power of the soul is not so efficacious that it can acquire a perfect knowledge of those intelligibles through this kind of species. That is to say, it cannot apprehend each one of them individually and determinately, but can know them only generally and indistinctly in the manner in which things are known through universal principles. Moreover, separated souls acquire this knowledge all at once by an influx, and not successively by instruction, as Origen says [Peri Archon, I, 6].

          <td>Consequently, we must say that separated souls know all natural things in a universal way by natural knowledge, but do not know each of them individually.

          <td>Ad primum ergo dicendum quod, secundum Augustinum, Daemones tripliciter res cognoscunt. Quaedam per revelationem bonorum Angelorum: quae scilicet sunt supra cognitionem naturalem eorum, sicut mysteria Christi et Ecclesiae, et alia huiusmodi; quaedam vero cognoscunt acumine proprii intellectus; scilicet ea quae sunt naturaliter scibilia; quaedam vero per experientiam longi temporis: scilicet eventus futurorum contingentium in singularibus, quae non per se pertinent ad cognitionem intelligibilem, ut dictum est. Unde de eis ad praesens non agitur.
          <td>1. According to Augustine [De dviniat. daemon., 3], the demons know things in three ways: First, some demons know things that transcend their natural knowledge through the revelation of the good angels, such as the mystery of Christ and the Church and others of this kind; secondly, some demons know things that are naturally knowable by the native acumen of their own intelligence; thirdly, some demons know the issue of future contingent events in individual cases through experience over a long time. Now as we have pointed out, knowledge of singulars does not pertain essentially to intellectual cognition as such. Consequently the objection is irrelevant, because here there is no question of such knowledge.

          <td>2. In those souls which have acquired the science of certain natural things knowable in this life, there will exist a knowledge of those things which bears directly on the individual. Their knowledge of other things, however, will be universal and indistinct, so that they will not have acquired knowledge uselessly in this life. Nor is there any incongruity in their possessing both types of knowledge with respect to the same objects, since those knowledges are formally diverse.

Unde non repugnat eius cognitioni infinitas specierum quae est in numeris, figuris et proportionibus. Quia tamen eodem modo posset concludere haec ratio contra cognitionem angelicam, dicendum est, quod species figurarum et numerorum et huiusmodi, non sunt infinitae in actu, sed in potentia tantum. Nec est etiam inconveniens quod virtus substantiae intellectualis finitae ad huiusmodi infinita extendat se; quia virtus intellectiva est quodammodo infinita, in quantum non est terminata per materiam. Unde et universale cognoscere potest, quod quodammodo est infinitum, in quantum de sui ratione, potentia continet infinita.
          <td>3. That argument is beside the point. For we do not allege that the separated soul knows all natural things in their individuality. Hence the infinity of species that is found in numbers, figures, and proportions, is not out of proportion to the soul’s cognitive power. But since that same argument would likewise apply to angelic knowledge, it must be said that the species of figures and numbers and things of this sort are not infinite actually but only potentially. Nor is it improper that the power of a finite intellectual substance should extend to infinites of this kind. For an intellective power in a certain respect is itself infinite inasmuch as it is not limited by matter. This is why it can know the universal, which is also infinite in a certain respect inasmuch as it belongs to the universal by nature to contain infinites potentially.

Comparatur igitur forma intellecta ad intellectum possibilem sicut forma naturalis ad materiam primam, prout est intellecta in actu, non prout est habitualiter. Et inde est quod, sicut materia prima simul et semel non informatur nisi una forma, ita intellectus possibilis non intelligit nisi unum intelligibile; potest tamen scire multa habitualiter.
          <td>5. Prime matter is related to forms in a twofold manner only, because with respect to them it is either in pure potency or in complete act. For natural forms have their own operations as soon as they exist in matter, unless there be some impediment, because a natural form is directed to one thing only. Thus, as soon as the form fire exists in matter, it causes the matter to move upward. However, the possible intellect is related to intelligible species in a threefold manner: sometimes, as before learning, it is in pure potency; sometimes, as when actually reflecting upon something, it is in complete act; sometimes, as when possessing a <i>habitus</i> of science but not actually exercising it, it is in a state midway between potency and act. Therefore an apprehended form so far as it is apprehended actually, but not so far as it exists in the possible intellect “habitually,” is related to the possible intellect as a natural form is to prime matter. Hence, as prime matter is informed with but one form at a time, so the possible intellect apprehends but one intelligible object at a time. Nevertheless it can know many things habitually in virtue of its habit of knowledge.

The possible intellect cannot be rendered actually cognizant of all natural things by the light of the agent intellect alone, but only by some superior substance which is actually cognizant of all natural things. And if one considers rightly, he will see that, according to the Philosopher’s own treatment of the matter, the agent intellect is not active directly with respect to the possible intellect, but rather with respect to phantasms which the agent intellect makes actually intelligible. And it is by the phantasms thus actualized that the possible intellect is actualized when, as a result of its union with the body, its vision is turned to inferior things. And for the same reason, when, after its separation from the body, the possible intellect turns toward superior things, it is actualized, as by its own proper agent, by the actually intelligible species which exist in superior substances.

Therefore when a man rises from the dead he will not be the same animal. This is contrary to what is said: “Whom I myself shall see, and my eyes shall behold, and not another” (Job 19: 27).

Et hoc est quod philosophus dicit, in libro de somno et vigilia quod cuius est potentia eius est actio. Circa operationes autem sensuum diversa fuit opinio. Plato enim posuit quod anima sensitiva per se haberet propriam operationem: posuit enim quod anima, etiam sensitiva, est movens seipsam et quod non movet corpus nisi prout est a se mota. Sic igitur in sentiendo est duplex operatio: una qua anima movet seipsam, alia qua movet corpus. Unde Platonici definiunt quod sensus est motus animae per corpus. Unde et propter hoc quidam huiusmodi positionis sectatores distinguunt duplices operationes partis sensitivae: quasdam scilicet interiores, quibus anima sentit, secundum quod seipsam movet; quasdam exteriores, secundum quod movet corpus. Dicunt etiam quod sunt duplices potentiae sensitivae. Quaedam quae sunt in ipsa anima principium interiorum actuum; et istae manent in anima separata, corpore destructo cum suis actibus. Quaedam vero sunt principia exteriorum actuum; quae sunt in anima simul et corpore, et pereunte corpore, pereunt.
          <td>Consequently, in order to discover whether the sentient powers are corrupted when the body is corrupted, or whether they remain in the soul when it exists apart from the body, we must accept the principle of this investigation so that we may learn what the subject of the aforementioned power is. Now it is evident that the subject of a power must be that which is capable of doing something in virtue of its power, for every accident designates its subject. Furthermore, an agent or a patient is nothing more than a thing which can act or undergo some change ( <i>pati</i> ). Hence, whatever is the subject of an action or undergoes a change, must be the subject of a power, the power itself being a principle. And this is what the Philosopher says in the book <i>De somno et vigilia</i> [I, 454a 7], namely, that an action belongs to the thing to which the power belongs. Now there has been a diversity of opinion about the operations of the senses. For Plato held that the sentient soul has a proper operation in virtue of its own nature, for he maintained that the sentient soul is a self-mover, and that it moves the body only inasmuch as it is moved by itself. Thus there is a twofold operation in sensing: one by which the soul moves itself, and another by which it moves the body. Wherefore the Platonists defined sense as the movement of the soul through the body. For this reason, certain followers of this position distinguish two operations in the sentient part of the soul, namely, certain interior operations by which the soul senses inasmuch as it moves itself, and certain external operations inasmuch as it moves the body. They also stated that there are two kinds of sentient powers: some which are principles of acts within the soul itself, and which remain together with their activities in the separated soul when the body is corrupted; others, which are principles of external acts, and these are present in the soul and the body simultaneously, and cease to exist when the body corrupts.

For just as heat itself is not a thing having existence (id quod est), but is that by which something is hot, so heat itself does not heat anything, but is that by which a hot thing heats something. Therefore, if the sentient soul could operate of itself [i.e., without the body], it would follow that it would subsist of itself, and thus would not be corrupted when the body is corrupted; but then the souls of brute animals would also be immortal. This is impossible, yet Plato is said to have conceded this [Phaedo 21].

Consequently the composite is capable of seeing, hearing, and sensing, but [it performs these] because of its soul. Hence it is clear that the powers of the sentient part exist in the composite as their subject, but come from the soul as their principle.

Therefore sense does not remain in the separated soul in the latter way, but sense does remain in the first way spoken Of, for in man the essence of the rational soul and that of the sentient soul is one and the same. Consequently nothing prevents a man who rises from the dead from being the same man numerically, for, in order that something be numerically the same, it is enough that the essential principles remain numerically the same.

Because human evil is a result of one of three things, namely, a wanton imagination which is the principle of error, a love of concupiscence, and irrational anger, Dionysius describes the evil of the demons in likeness to human evil; not that it is to be understood that there is imagination in the demons, or irascible and concupiscible appetites which are in the sentient part of the soul, but that in them there is something proportionate to these as becomes their intellective nature.

          <td>9. We must not understand by these words of Augustine that the soul senses something without a bodily organ, but that it senses something without sensible bodies themselves, for instance, fear and sorrow.

          <td>11. Nothing prevents us from speaking of certain facts metaphorically, for, although the story related in the Gospel about Lazarus and the rich man is a fact, still it is said metaphorically that Lazarus saw and heard, just as it is also said metaphorically that he had a tongue.

          <td>13. just as sense, inasmuch as it is called a power, is not the form of the whole body but the sentient soul itself (moreover, sense is a property of the composite), so neither is the power of vision the act of the eye, but that of the soul itself as the principle of such a power; just as it may be said that the visive soul is the act of the eye as the sentient soul is the act of the body. Moreover the power of vision is a property consequent on this. Therefore it is not necessary that there be a different eye for the resurrected individual, although there is a different sentient power.

Consequently it is not necessary that all the acts by which some one merits reward, should be brought back into existence again when the reward is actually given.

XVII and XVIII). Therefore, concerning those things which the separated soul apprehends in the manner proper to it without phantasms, this knowledge remains in the soul after it returns to its former state. Having been joined to the body again, the soul now understands in a manner befitting it, that is, by turning to phantasms. And for this reason things grasped intelligibly are narrated imaginatively.

          <td>19. The intellect requires the aid of the senses because of the imperfect kind of knowledge which it has, that is, inasmuch as it receives [species] from phantasms.

        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et videtur quod non. Quia de potentiis animae in anima separata remanet solus intellectus. Sed obiectum intellectus est universale et non singulare; scientia enim est universalium, sensus autem singularium, ut dicitur in I de anima. Ergo anima separata non cognoscit singularia, sed tantum universalia.
          <td>1. It seems that the separated soul does not know singular things, because of all the soul’s powers, only the intellect remains in the soul when it exists apart from the body. Now the object of the intellect is the universal and not the singular, for science has to do with the universal, whereas the senses are directed to singulars, as is stated in the <i>De anima</i> [III, 5, 430a 10]. Therefore the separated soul does not know singulars but only universals.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, si anima separata cognoscit singularia aut per formas prius acquisitas, cum esset in corpore; aut per formas influxas. Sed non per formas prius acquisitas. Nam formarum quas anima per sensus acquirit dum est in corpore, quaedam sunt intentiones individuales, quae conservantur in potentiis partis sensitivae; et sic remanere non possunt in anima separata, cum huiusmodi potentiae non maneant in ea, ut ostensum est. Quaedam autem intentiones sunt universales, quae sunt in intellectu, unde hae solae manere possunt. Sed per intentiones universales non possunt cognosci singularia. Ergo anima separata non potest cognoscere singularia per species quas acquisivit in corpore. Similiter autem neque per species influxas; quia huiusmodi species aequaliter se habent ad omnia singularia. Unde sequeretur quod anima separata omnia singularia cognosceret; quod non videtur esse verum.
          <td>2. Further, if the separated soul knows singulars, it does so either through the forms which it acquired previously while it existed in the body, or through infused forms. Now it does not know singulars through forms acquired previously, for some of the forms which the soul acquired through the senses while it existed in the body, are individual intentions, which are conserved in the sentient part [of the soul]; but these cannot remain in the soul when it is separated from the body, because powers of this kind do not remain in the soul, as has been shown (Art. 19). Some intentions, however, that is, those which are in the intellect, are universal; therefore these alone can remain in the separated soul. But singulars cannot be known through universal intentions. Therefore the separated soul cannot know singulars through the species acquired while it existed in the body. Similarly, it cannot know singulars through infused forms, because such forms represent all singulars equally. Therefore it would follow that the separated soul knows all singulars. This does not appear to be the case.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, cognitio animae separatae impeditur per loci distantiam. Dicit enim Augustinus, in libro de cura pro mortuis gerenda, quod animae mortuorum ibi sunt ubi ea quae hic fiunt, omnino scire non possunt. Cognitionem autem quae fit per species influxas, non impedit loci distantia. Ergo anima non cognoscit singularia per species influxas.
          <td>3. Further, the separated soul is prevented from knowing a thing that is located in a different place from itself. For Augustine says in the book <i>De cura pro mortuis agenda</i> [13] that the souls of the dead are in a place where they cannot know in any way whatever the things that occur here. But knowledge that is caused through infused species is not prevented because of a difference of place. Therefore the soul does not know singulars through infused species.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, species influxae aequaliter se habent ad praesentia et futura: non enim influxus intelligibilium specierum est sub tempore.

Cum cognoscere futura sit solius Dei, prout dicitur Is., X: annuntiate quae ventura sunt in fine, et dicam quod dii estis vos.
          <td>4. Further, infused species are related equally both to the present and to the future, for the infusion of intelligible species is not affected by time. Therefore, if the separated soul knows singulars through infused species-, it seems that it does not know the present or the past, but only the future. However, it appears that this cannot be the case, because knowledge of the future belongs to God alone; for it is said: “Show the things that are to come hereafter, and we shall know that you are gods” (Isa. 41:23).

          <td>6. Further, whatever is indistinct cannot be a principle of a distinct knowledge. But the knowledge of singulars is distinct. Therefore, since infused species are indistinct inasmuch as they are universal, it seems that the separated soul cannot know singular things through infused species.

          <td>7. Further, whatever is received in a thing is received according to the mode of the recipient. Now the separated soul is immaterial. Therefore infused forms are received in it immaterially. But what is immaterial cannot be the principle of a knowledge of singular things which are individuated by matter. Therefore the separated soul cannot know singulars through infused forms.

Sed formae influxae animae separatae non sunt materiae factrices, quia non sunt creatrices: hoc enim solius Dei est. Ergo anima separata per formas influxas non potest cognoscere singularia.
          <td>8. But it may be said that singular things can be known by infused forms, even though they are immaterial, because singulars are likenesses of the ideal exemplars by which God knows both universals and singulars. On the contrary, God knows singulars through the ideal exemplars inasmuch as they are productive of matter, which is the principle of individuation. But the forms infused in the separated soul are not productive of matter, because they do not create, for creation belongs to God alone. Therefore the separated soul cannot know singulars through infused forms.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, similitudo creaturae ad Deum non potest esse per univocationem, sed solum per analogiam. Sed cognitio quae fit per similitudinem analogiae, est imperfectissima; sicut si aliquid cognosceretur per alterum, in quantum convenit cum illo in ente. Si ergo anima separata cognoscit singularia per species influxas, in quantum sunt similes rationibus idealibus; videtur quod imperfectissime singularia cognoscat.
          <td>9. Further, the likeness which any creature bears to God cannot be a univocal likeness, but only an analogous one. Now a knowledge that is acquired because of some analogous similarity [between things] is the most imperfect sort of knowledge; for example, if one thing is known through something else inasmuch as it conforms with it in being. Therefore, if the separated soul knows singulars through infused species, inasmuch as they are like the ideal exemplars, it seems that it knows singulars in a most imperfect manner.

          <td>Praeterea, dictum est in praecedentibus, quod anima separata non cognoscit naturalia per formas influxas nisi in quadam confusione, et in universali. Hoc autem non est cognoscere. Ergo anima separata non cognoscit singularia per species influxas.
          <td>10. Further, it was shown in a preceding article (Art. 18), that the separated soul knows natural things through infused forms only indistinctly and in the universal. Now this is not to know them. Therefore the separated soul does not know singulars through infused species.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, species illae influxae per quas anima separata singularia ponitur cognoscere, non causantur a Deo immediate: quia, secundum Dionysium, lex divinitatis est infima per media reducere. Nec iterum causantur per Angelum: quia Angelus huiusmodi species causare non potest neque creando, cum nullius rei sit creator; neque transmutando, quia oportet esse aliquod medium differens. Ergo videtur quod anima separata non habeat species influxas, per quas singularia cognoscat.
          <td>11. Further, those infused species through which the separated soul admittedly knows singular things, are not caused immediately by God; because, according to Dionysius, the divine law ( <i>lex divinitatis</i> ) is to change the lowest thing through an intermediary. On the other hand, neither are infused species caused by an angel; because an angel cannot cause species of this kind, either by creating them, since it never creates anything; or by changing something, because this requires a communicating medium. Therefore it seems that the separated soul does not possess infused species through which it may know singulars.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, si anima separata cognoscit singularia per species influxas, hoc non potest esse nisi dupliciter. Vel applicando species ad singularia, vel convertendo se ad ipsas species. Si applicando ad singularia, constat quod huiusmodi applicatio non fit accipiendo aliquid a singularibus; cum non habeat potentias sensitivas quae natae sunt a singularibus accipere. Relinquitur ergo quod haec applicatio fit ponendo aliquid circa singularia; et sic non cognoscet ipsa singularia, sed hoc tantum quod circa singularia ponit. Si autem per species dictas cognoscit singularia convertendo se ad ipsas, sequetur quod non cognoscet singularia nisi secundum quod sunt in ipsis speciebus. Sed in speciebus praedictis non sunt singularia nisi universaliter. Ergo anima separata non cognoscit singularia nisi in universali.
          <td>12. Further, if the separated soul knows singular things through infused species, this can occur only in one of two ways: either by applying species to singulars, or by turning itself toward the species themselves. If the soul knows singulars by applying species to singulars, it follows that such an application, is not made by deriving something from singular things themselves, because the separated soul does not have sentient powers naturally disposed to receive [species] from singulars. Therefore it remains that this application is made by premising something about singulars; and thus the soul will not know singulars themselves, but only what it premises about them. However, if the separated soul knows singulars through the aforesaid species by turning itself toward them, it follows that it will know singulars only so far as they exist in the species themselves. But singulars exist only universally in the aforesaid species. Therefore the separated soul knows singulars only in the universal.

Cum igitur singularia sint corpora, videtur quod ab anima separata cognosci non possunt.
          <td>14. Further, the separated soul can know a thing only by intellectual vision. Now Augustine says in the <i>De Genesi ad litteram</i> [XII, 24] that separated souls by their intellectual vision know neither bodies nor the likenesses of bodies. Therefore, since singular things are bodies, it seems that they cannot be known by the separated soul.

          <td>15. Further, wherever the nature is the same, the mode of operation is also the same. Now a separated soul possesses the same nature as a soul that is joined to a body. Therefore, since the soul by its intellect cannot know singulars when it is joined to the body, it seems that it cannot know singulars when it exists apart from the body.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, potentiae distinguuntur per obiecta. Sed propter quod unumquodque, illud magis. Ergo obiecta sunt magis distincta quam potentiae. Sed sensus nunquam fiet intellectus. Ergo singulare, quod est sensibile, nunquam fiet intelligibile.
          <td>16. Further, powers are distinguished by their objects. But the cause [in this case, the object] possesses that which it produces [viz., distinction] in a higher degree. Therefore the diversity among objects is greater than that found among powers. But a sense never becomes an intellect. Hence the singular, which is the object of sense, never becomes an object of the intellect.

          <td>Praeterea, potentia cognoscitiva superioris ordinis minus multiplicatur respectu eorumdem cognoscibilium quam potentia inferioris ordinis. Sensus enim communis est cognoscitivus omnium quae per quinque exteriores sensus apprehenduntur. Et similiter Angelus una potentia cognoscitiva, scilicet intellectu, cognoscit universalia et singularia, quae homo sensu et intellectu apprehendit. Sed nunquam potentia inferioris ordinis potest apprehendere id quod est alterius potentiae quae ab ea distinguitur, sicut visus nunquam potest apprehendere obiectum auditus. Ergo intellectus hominis nunquam potest apprehendere singulare, quod est obiectum sensus, licet intellectus Angeli cognoscat utrumque et apprehendat.
          <td>17. Further, a cognitive power of a superior order is less complex ( <i>multiplicatur</i> ), with respect to the same cognizable object, than a power of an inferior order; for the common sense knows all things apprehended by the five external senses; and likewise an angel, by one cognitive power, namely, by its intellect, knows both the universals and singulars which a man apprehends by his senses and his intellect. Now no power of an inferior order can apprehend the object of another power which differs [specifically] from itself, just as sight can never apprehend the object of hearing. Therefore a man’s intellect can never apprehend a singular which is the object of sense, although an angel’s intellect knows and apprehends both.

          <td>18. Further, it is said in the work <i>De causis</i> [23] that an intelligence knows things inasmuch as it causes them or directs them. But the separated soul can neither cause singulars nor direct them. Therefore it does not know singulars.

          <td>1. On the contrary, to form propositions belongs to the intellect alone. Now the soul, when still joined to the body, forms propositions, the subject of which is a singular, and the predicate of which is a universal; for example, when I say: Socrates is a man; but I cannot do this unless I know the singular and its relationship to the universal. Therefore the separated soul really knows singulars by its intellect.

Cum igitur tanto sit magis particularis cognitio, quanto substantia cognoscens est inferioris ordinis; videtur quod anima separata multo fortius singularia cognoscat.
          <td>2. Further, the soul is inferior in nature to every angel. Now the angels of a lower hierarchy receive illuminations about singular effects. In this way they are distinguished from the angels of an intermediary hierarchy, who receive illuminations according to the universal likenesses ( <i>rationes</i> ) of these effects. They are also distinguished from the angels of a supreme hierarchy, who receive their illuminations according to the universal likenesses existing in their cause [i.e., God]. Therefore, since the more particular in nature a knowledge is, the lower is, the order of existence of the substance possessing such knowledge, it seems that the soul knows singulars in a much more desirable way when it exists apart from the body.

Cognoscit etiam quaedam singularia quorum cognitionem accepit post separationem a corpore; aliter enim non affligeretur ab igne Inferni, et ab aliis corporalibus poenis quae in Inferno esse dicuntur. Quod autem non omnia singularia cognoscat anima separata secundum naturalem cognitionem, ex hoc manifestum est quod animae mortuorum nesciunt ea quae hic aguntur, ut Augustinus dicit.
          <td><b>I answer:</b> We must say that, when the soul exists apart from the body it knows some singulars, but not all of them. Now it knows some of the singulars of which it first acquired knowledge while united to the body, otherwise it would not remember the things which it did in this life-, and thus remorse of conscience would vanish from the separated soul. It knows also those singulars of which it acquires knowledge after being separated from the body, otherwise it would not be punished by the fire of hell and by the other corporeal punishments which are said to exist in hell. However, that the separated soul does not know all singulars by its natural knowledge, is shown by the fact that the souls of the dead are not aware of things that occur here, as Augustine says [De cura pro mort., 13].

Unde quidam in tantum erraverunt, ut Deo et Angelis cognitionem singularium subtraherent; quod est omnino impossibile.

          <td>Therefore this inquiry involves two difficulties: one common [to intellectual nature as such] and one proper [to human nature]. The difficulty common to intellectual nature as such arises from the fact that our intellect does not seem to be capable of knowing singulars, but only universals. Therefore, since intelligence. is the only cognitive power proper to God, to the angels, and to the separated soul, it appears difficult to see how they can possess a knowledge of singulars. For this reason some men made the mistake of denying any knowledge of singulars to God and the angels; but this is altogether impossible. For if this position were adopted, divine providence would be excluded from things, the judgment of God concerning human acts would disappear, and the ministering of the angels would also be removed, for we believe that the angels are solicitous of the safety of man, as the Apostle says: “Are they not all ministering spirits, sent to minister for them, who shall receive the inheritance of salvation?” (Heb. 1:14)

Et ponunt exemplum: sicut si aliquis cognosceret totum ordinem caeli et stellarum, et mensuram et motus eorum, sciret per intellectum omnes futuras eclypses, et quantae, et quibus in locis, et quibus temporibus futurae essent. Sed hoc non sufficit ad veram singularium cognitionem. Manifestum est enim quod quantumcumque adunentur aliqua universalia, nunquam ex eis perficitur singulare. Sicut si dicam hominem album, musicum et quaecumque huiusmodi addidero, nunquam erit singulare. Possibile est enim omnia haec adunata pluribus convenire. Unde qui cognoscit omnes causas in universali, nunquam propter hoc proprie cognoscet aliquem singularem effectum. Nec ille qui cognoscit totum ordinem caeli, cognoscit hanc eclypsim ut est hic.

They offer the example that, if anyone should know the whole order of the stars and the heavens, and their measure and movement, he would know, by means of his intellect, all future eclipses, both their number, in what places they would occur, and at what time they would take place in the future. But this is insufficient for a true knowledge of singulars. For it is clear that, no matter how closely universals may be united, a complete singular never results from their union: just as if I say man, white, musical, and will have added whatever others are possible, a singular will never result from them; since it is possible for all these universals, which are joined together, to belong to many men. Therefore anyone who knows all causes universally, never knows expressly any singular effect as a result of such knowledge. Nor does one who knows the whole order of the heavens know this eclipse inasmuch as it is this [i.e., as a singular], for although he knows that a future eclipse will occur at such a position of the sun and moon, at such an hour, and whatever else is to be observed in eclipses of this kind, yet it is possible for an eclipse of this specific kind to occur frequently.

But this is quite incongruous; for, since the greatest difference exists between an intelligible mode of existing and a material and sensible mode of existing, the form of a material thing is not received immediately by the intellect, but is carried to it through a number of intermediaries; for example, the form of a sensible thing first exists in a medium wherein it is more spirituals than in the sensible thing itself; next it exists in a sense organ; and from there is drawn into the imagination and the other inferior [sense] powers; and finally it is carried to the intellect. Now it is inconceivable that such media should play any role either in the knowledge of an angel or in that of a separated soul.

Et quia nulla ars hominis causat materiam, sed accipit eam iam praeexistentem, quae est individuationis principium; ideo artifex per formam, puta aedificator, cognoscit domum in universali, non autem hanc domum ut est haec, nisi in quantum eius notitiam accipit per sensum.
          <td>Therefore it must be said, on the contrary, that the forms of things through which the intellect knows, are related to things in a twofold manner: for some forms are productive of things, while others are derived from them; and forms which are productive of things lead to a knowledge of a thing inasmuch as they are productive of it. Thus the artisan who gives *the form to the thing made, or gives some disposition to matter, knows the thing made by the form of his art as regards that which he causes in the thing. And because no human art causes matter, which is the principle of individuation, but receives matter already in existence, therefore the artisan, for example, a builder, knows the house in a universal way by its form, but he does not know this house as this house, except so far as he acquires knowledge of it through the senses.

Therefore the separate substances know not only universals, but singulars as well, inasmuch as the intelligible species which are infused in them by the divine art are the likenesses of things as regards both their form and their matter.

          <td>Nor is it improper for a form which is productive of a thing, even though the form itself is immaterial, to be the likeness of a thing as regards both its form and its matter, because a thing always exists more simply in a superior nature than it does in an inferior one. Therefore, although form and matter are diverse in the sensible nature, nevertheless that which is higher and the cause of both, is related to both as one existing thing; and for this reason superior substances know material things immaterially, and diverse things unitedly, as Dionysius says.’ However, intelligible forms that are derived from things are acquired by abstraction. Hence they do not give rise to knowledge of the thing as such, but only to a knowledge of what is abstracted from the thing. Therefore, since the forms in our intellect, which are derived from things, are abstracted from matter and from all material conditions, they do not lead to a knowledge of singulars, but to a knowledge of universals alone. This, therefore, is the reason why separate substances can know singulars by their intellect, whereas, on the other hand, our intellect knows only universals.

          <td>Now an angelic intellect and a separated soul are differently situated so far as the knowledge of singulars is concerned. For we explained in a previous article (Art. 18) that the efficacy of the angels’ intellective power is proportioned to the universality of the intelligible forms which they possess; and therefore they know through universal forms of this kind all the things to which these forms extend. Therefore, just as they know all the species of natural things existing under their genera, so they know all the singular natural things contained under their species. However, the efficacy of the separated soul’s intellective power is not proportioned to the universality of infused forms, but, on the contrary, is proportioned to forms abstracted from things. For this reason it is natural for the soul to be united to a body. Therefore it was said above that the separated soul does not know all natural things determinately and completely, even with regard to their species, but that it can know them in a certain general and indeterminate manner. Consequently the infused species [which separated souls possess] are not sufficient for a knowledge of singulars to the point of enabling those souls to know all singulars as the angels do.

          <td>Ad secundum dicendum quod Angeli inferioris hierarchiae illuminantur de rationibus singularium effectuum, non per species singulares, sed per rationes universales, ex quibus cognoscere singularia possunt propter efficaciam virtutis intellectivae, in qua excedunt animam separatam. Et, licet rationes ab eis perceptae sint universales simpliciter, tamen dicuntur particulares per comparationem ad rationes universaliores, quas Angeli superiores recipiunt.
          <td>2. The angels of an inferior hierarchy receive illumination regarding the natures of singular, effects, not through singular species, but through universal likenesses by which they can know singulars by reason of the efficacy of their intellectual power, wherein they surpass the separated soul; and although the likenesses perceived by them are universals absolutely, yet they are said to be particular in comparison to the more universal species, which superior angels receive.

          <td>3. Whatever an inferior power can do, a superior power can also do; not in the same way, however, but in a more excellent manner. Consequently those things which the senses perceive materially and singularly, the intellect knows immaterially and universally.

          <td><b>Objections.</b>
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et videtur quod non. Nihil enim patitur nisi secundum quod est in potentia. Sed anima separata non est in potentia nisi secundum intellectum; quia potentiae sensitivae in ea non manent, ut ostensum est. Ergo anima separata non potest pati ab igne corporeo nisi secundum intellectum, intelligendo scilicet ipsum. Hoc autem non est poenale, sed magis delectabile. Ergo anima non potest pati ab igne corporeo poenam.
          <td>1. It seems that the separated soul cannot suffer punishment by corporeal fire. For a thing suffers ( <i>patitur</i> ) [i.e., is acted upon or undergoes a change] only so far as it is in potency. But when the soul exists in separation from the body it is in potency only so far as the intellect is concerned, because the sentient powers do not exist in the soul, as we have shown above (Art. 19). Consequently the separated soul can be acted upon by corporeal fire with respect to the intellect alone, namely, by understanding this fire. Now this is not punitive, but is, in fact, delightful. Therefore the separated soul cannot suffer punishment by corporeal fire.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, agens et patiens communicant in materia, ut dicitur in I de generatione. Sed anima, cum sit immaterialis, non communicat in materia cum igne corporeo. Ergo anima separata non potest pati ab igne corporeo.
          <td>2. Further, an agent and a patient have the same matter, as is stated in the <i>De generatione et corruptione</i> [I, 7, 324a 324a 34]. But since the soul is immaterial it does not have any matter in common with corporeal fire. Therefore, when the soul exists in separation from the body, it cannot be acted upon by corporeal fire.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, quod non tangit non agit. Sed ignis corporeus non potest tangere animam neque secundum ultima quantitatis, cum anima sit incorporea; neque etiam tactu virtutis, cum virtus corporis non possit imprimere in substantiam incorpoream, sed magis e converso. Nullo igitur modo anima separata potest pati ab igne corporeo.
          <td>3. Further, whatever does not make contact with a thing does not act upon that thing. Now corporeal fire cannot make contact with the soul, either by the elemental [contact] of quantity, because the soul is incorporeal, or by contact of power, because the power of a body cannot make an impression upon an incorporeal substance, but rather the reverse. Therefore the separated soul cannot be acted upon in any way whatever by corporeal fire.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, dupliciter dicitur aliquid pati: vel sicut subiectum, ut lignum patitur ab igne; vel sicut contrarium, ut calidum a frigido. Sed anima non potest pati ab igne corporeo sicut subiectum passionis, quia oporteret quod forma ignis fieret in anima. Et sic sequeretur quod anima calefieret et igniretur; quod est impossibile. Similiter non potest dici quod anima patiatur ab igne corporeo sicut contrarium a contrario; tum quia animae nihil est contrarium, tum quia sequeretur quod anima ab igne corporeo destrueretur; quod est impossibile. Anima igitur non potest pati ab igne corporeo.
          <td>4. Further, a thing is said to be acted upon in two ways: either as an object, as when wood is acted upon by fire, or as a contrary, as when something hot is acted upon by something cold. Now the soul cannot be acted upon by corporeal fire as the subject of a passion, because in that case the form fire would have to arise in the soul, and, as a consequence, the soul would be made hot and would burn, which is impossible. In like manner, we cannot say that the soul is acted upon by corporeal fire as one contrary is acted upon by another: first, because the soul has no contrary, and secondly, because it would follow that the soul would be destroyed by corporeal fire; which is impossible. Therefore the soul cannot be acted upon by corporeal fire.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, inter agens et patiens oportet esse proportionem aliquam. Sed inter animam et ignem corporeum non videtur esse aliqua proportio, cum sint diversorum generum. Ergo anima non potest pati ab igne corporeo.
          <td>5. Further, there must be some proportion between an agent and a patient. Now there does not seem to be any proportion between the soul and corporeal fire, because they belong to different genera. Therefore the soul cannot be acted upon by corporeal fire.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, omne quod patitur movetur. Anima autem non movetur, cum non sit corpus. Ergo anima non potest pati.
          <td>6. Further, whatever is acted upon is moved [i.e., passes from potency to act]. Now the soul is not moved, because it is not a body. Therefore the soul cannot be acted upon by fire.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, anima est dignior quam corpus quintae essentiae. Sed corpus quintae essentiae est omnino impassibile. Ergo multo magis anima.

        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, Augustinus dicit, XII super Genes. ad litteram, quod agens est nobilior patiente. Sed ignis corporeus non est nobilior anima. Ergo ignis non potest agere in animam.
          <td>8. Further, Augustine says in the <i>De Genesi ad litteram</i> [XII, 16] that an agent is nobler than a patient. But corporeal fire is not nobler than the soul. Therefore corporeal fire cannot act upon the soul.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed dicebat, quod ignis non agit in animam virtute propria et naturali, sed in quantum est instrumentum divinae iustitiae. &amp;8212;Sed contra, sapientis artificis est uti convenientibus instrumentis ad finem suum. Sed ignis corporeus non videtur esse conveniens instrumentum ad puniendum animam, cum hoc non conveniat ei ratione suae formae, per quam instrumentum adaptatur ad effectum, ut dolabra ad dolandum, et serra ad secandum. Non enim sapienter ageret artifex, si uteretur serra ad dolandum et dolabra ad secandum. Ergo multo minus Deus, qui est sapientissimus, utitur igne corporeo ut instrumento ad puniendum animam.
          <td>9. But it was said that fire does not act upon the soul in virtue of what is proper and natural to fire, but inasmuch as it is the instrument of divine justice. On the contrary, it is characteristic of a wise builder to use suitable instruments for the end which he intends. Now corporeal fire does not seem to be an adequate instrument for punishing the soul, because this is not proper to fire by reason of its form; and it is by its form that an instrument is adapted to its effect, as an axe for chopping and a saw for cutting, for a builder will not act with greater wisdom if he should use a saw for chopping and an axe for cutting. Therefore even less will God, who is most wise, use corporeal fire as an instrument for punishing the soul.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, Deus, cum sit auctor naturae, nihil contra naturam facit, ut dicit quaedam Glossa super illud Rom. XI: contra naturam insertus es. Sed contra naturam est ut corporeum in incorporeum agat. Ergo hoc Deus non facit.
          <td>10. Further, since God is the Author of nature, He does nothing contrary to nature, as it says in a certain Gloss on the text: “It is implanted contrary to nature” (Rom. 11:24). But it is contrary to nature for the corporeal to act upon the incorporeal. Therefore God does not permit this.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, Deus non potest facere quod contradictoria sint simul vera. Hoc autem sequeretur, si subtraheretur alicui quod est de essentia eius. Puta, si homo non esset rationalis, sequeretur quod esset simul homo et non homo. Ergo Deus non potest facere quod aliqua res careat eo quod est ei essentiale. Sed esse impassibile est essentiale animae; convenit enim ei in quantum est immaterialis. Ergo Deus non potest facere quod anima patiatur ab igne corporeo.
          <td>11. Further, God cannot cause contradictories to be true simultaneously. Now this would occur if He were to withdraw from a thing a constitutive part of its essence; for example, if a man were not rational, it would follow that he would be a man and not be a man at the same time. Therefore God cannot cause a thing to be deprived of any of its essential parts. Now to be unchangeable is essential to the soul, for this is proper to it by reason of its immateriality. Consequently God cannot cause the soul to be acted upon by corporeal fire.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, unaquaeque res habet potentiam agendi secundum suam naturam. Non ergo potest res aliqua accipere potentiam agendi quae sibi non competit sed magis alteri rei, nisi a propria natura immutetur in aliam naturam. Sicut aqua non calefacit, nisi fuerit ab igne transmutata. Sed habere potentiam agendi in res spirituales, non competit naturae ignis corporei, ut ostensum est. Si ergo a Deo hoc habet ut instrumentum divinae iustitiae, quod in animam separatam agere possit; videtur quod iam non sit ignis corporeus, sed alterius naturae.
          <td>12. Further, everything possesses the power of acting in accordance with its nature. Therefore a thing cannot receive a power of acting which is not proper to itself but to something else instead, unless its proper nature is changed into some other nature; water, for example, will not heat unless it is changed [i.e., made hot] by fire. Now it is not proper to fire by nature to have the power of acting upon immaterial things, as we have already shown. Therefore, if God gives fire, as the instrument of divine justice, the power of acting upon the separated soul, it now seems that it is not corporeal fire, but fire of a different nature.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, id quod fit virtute divina, habet propriam et veram rationem rei in natura existentis. Cum enim divina virtute aliquis caecus illuminatur, recipit visum secundum veram et propriam rationem naturalem visus. Si anima igitur virtute divina patiatur ab igne prout est instrumentum divinae iustitiae, sequitur quod anima vere patiatur secundum propriam rationem passionis. Pati autem dupliciter dicitur. Uno modo, secundum quod pati dicitur recipere tantum; sicut intellectus patitur ab intelligibili, et sensus a sensibili. Alio modo, per hoc quod abiicitur aliquid a substantia patientis; sicut cum lignum patitur ab igne. Si igitur anima separata patiatur ab igne corporeo divina virtute, prout ratio passionis consistit in receptione tantum, cum receptum sit in recipiente secundum modum eius, sequitur quod anima separata recipiat ab igne corporeo immaterialiter et incorporaliter secundum modum suum. Talis autem receptio non est animae punitiva, sed perfectiva. Ergo hoc non erit ad poenam animae. Similiter etiam nec potest pati anima ab igne corporeo prout passio abiicit a substantia; quia sic substantia animae corrumperetur. Ergo non potest esse quod anima patiatur ab igne corporeo, etiam prout est instrumentum divinae iustitiae.
          <td>13. Further, what is done by the divine power is in accord with the proper and true specific nature of a thing existing in reality. For when by divine power a blind man is given the power of vision, he receives sight according to the true and proper natural notion of sight. Therefore, if the soul is acted upon by fire, as the instrument of divine justice, by virtue of the divine power itself, it follows that the soul really is acted upon in the true sense of “passion.” Now passion [i.e., being acted upon] is used in two ways. First, to signify merely the reception of something [by a patient], as when the intellect is acted upon by an intelligible, and a sense by a sensible. Secondly, to signify the loss of something on the side of the substance of the thing being acted upon, as when wood is acted upon by fire. Therefore, if the separated soul is acted upon by corporeal fire, in virtue of the divine power, inasmuch as the nature of passion consists merely in receiving something, it follows that the separated soul is receptive of corporeal fire in an immaterial and incorporeal way in keeping with the soul’s own mode; because whatever is received in something is received according to the mode of the recipient. However, a reception of this sort does not punish the soul, but perfects it. Consequently this will not be a punishment for the soul. Similarly the soul cannot be acted upon by corporeal fire so far as passion consists in the loss of something on the side of the substance being acted upon, because then the substance of the soul would be corrupted. Therefore the soul cannot be acted upon by corporeal fire as the instrument of divine justice.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, nullum instrumentum agit instrumentaliter, nisi exercendo operationem propriam. Sicut serra agit instrumentaliter ad perfectionem arcae secando. Sed ignis non potest agere in animam actione propria naturali; non enim potest calefacere animam. Ergo non potest agere in animam ut instrumentum divinae iustitiae.
          <td>14. Further, an instrument acts as an instrument only by exercising its proper operation, just as a saw, by cutting, acts instrumentally in the production of a chest. Now fire by its proper natural operation cannot act upon the soul, because it cannot make the soul hot. Consequently fire as the instrument of divine justice cannot act upon the soul.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed dicebat, quod ignis aliqua actione propria agit in animam, in quantum scilicet detinet eam ut sibi alligatam. &amp;8212;Sed contra, si anima alligatur igni et ab eo detinetur, oportet quod ei aliquo modo uniatur. Non autem unitur ut forma, quia sic anima vivificaret ignem; nec unitur ei ut motor, quia sic magis pateretur ignis ab anima quam e converso. Non est autem alius modus quo substantia incorporea corpori uniri possit. Ergo anima separata non potest alligari ab igne corporeo, nec ab eo detineri.
          <td>15. But it has been said that fire acts upon the soul by a proper action inasmuch as it confines the soul in such a way as to imprison the latter. On the other hand, if the soul is imprisoned by fire and detained by it, the soul must be united to fire in some way. However, the soul is not united as a form to fire, because then the soul would give life to fire. Nor is the soul united as a mover to fire, because then fire would be acted upon by the soul, and not vice versa. Now there is no other way in which an incorporeal substance can be united to a body, so it follows that the separated soul cannot be detained by fire, nor be imprisoned by it.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, id quod est alligatum alicui, non potest ab eo separari. Sed spiritus damnati separantur aliquando ab igne corporeo infernali. Nam Daemones dicuntur esse in hoc aere caliginoso; animae etiam damnatorum interdum aliquibus apparuerunt. Non ergo patitur anima ab igne corporeo ut ei alligata.
          <td>16. Further, whatever is fettered by something cannot be separated from it. But the spirits of the damned are sometimes separated from the corporeal fire of hell, for the demons are said to be in this misty atmosphere, and the souls of the damned have occasionally appeared to certain individuals here, as well. Therefore the soul is not acted upon by corporeal fire, as though imprisoned by it.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, id quod alligatur alicui et detinetur ab eo, impeditur per ipsum a propria operatione. Sed propria operatio animae est intelligere, a qua impediri non potest per alligationem ad aliquid corporeum; quia intelligibilia sua in se habet, ut in III de anima dicitur. Unde non oportet ut ea extra se quaerat. Ergo anima separata non punitur per alligationem ad ignem corporeum.
          <td>17. Further, whatever is fettered to something and detained by it, is thereby prevented from performing its proper operation. Now the proper operation of the soul is intellection; but the soul cannot be prevented from exercising this activity by being bound to something corporeal, because the soul contains its intelligibles within itself, as is said in the <i>De anima</i> [III, 4, 429b 55]. Consequently it is not necessary for the soul to seek these things outside itself. Therefore the separated soul is not punished by being fettered to corporeal fire.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, sicut ignis per modum istum potest detinere animam; ita et alia corporea, vel etiam magis, in quantum sunt grossiora et graviora. Si ergo anima non puniretur nisi per detentionem et alligationem, eius poena non deberet soli igni attribui, sed magis aliis corporibus.
          <td>18. Further, just as fire can detain the soul in this way, so also can other bodies, or to an even greater extent inasmuch as they are larger and heavier. Therefore, if the soul is punished only by being detained and fettered, its punishment should be attributed not only to fire, but even more so to other bodies.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, Augustinus dicit, XII super Genes. ad litteram, quod substantiam Inferorum non est credendum esse corporalem, sed spiritualem. Damascenus etiam dicit, quod ignis Inferni non est materialis. Ergo videtur quod anima non patiatur ab igne corporeo.
          <td>19. Further, Augustine says in the <i>De Genesi ad litteram</i> [XII, 32] that the substance of hell is not believed to be corporeal, but spiritual. Damascene also says that the fire of hell is not corporeal. Therefore it seems that the soul is not acted upon by corporeal fire.

          <td>20. Further, Gregory says in the <i>De moralibus</i> [XXXIV, 19] that the delinquent servant is punished by his master in order that he may be corrected. But the damned in hell are incorrigible. Therefore they should not be punished by the corporeal fire of hell.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, poenae per contrarium fiunt. Sed anima peccavit subdendo se corporalibus rebus per affectum. Ergo non debet per aliqua corporalia puniri, sed magis per separationem a corporalibus.
          <td>21. Further, punishments are inflicted by means of contraries. Now the soul sinned by subjecting itself to corporeal things, under the influence of passion. Therefore it should not be punished by being united to corporeal things, but rather by being separated from corporeal things.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, sicut ex divina iustitia redduntur poenae peccatoribus, ita et praemia iustis. Sed iustis non redduntur praemia corporalia, sed spiritualia tantum. Unde si qua praemia corporalia iustis reddenda in Scriptura traduntur, intelliguntur metaphorice; sicut dicitur Luc. XXII: ut edatis et bibatis super mensam meam in regno meo. Ergo et peccatoribus non infliguntur poenae corporales, sed spirituales tantum; et ea quae de poenis corporalibus in Scripturis dicuntur, erunt metaphorice intelligenda. Et sic anima non patitur ab igne corporeo.
          <td>22. Further, just as punishments are allotted to sinners by divine justice, so also are rewards to the just. Now corporeal rewards are not given to the just, but spiritual rewards only. Consequently, if in Scripture any rewards of a corporeal nature are said to be given to the just, they are to be understood metaphorically; for example, it is said: “That you may eat and drink at My table, in My kingdom” (Luke 22:30). Therefore corporeal punishments are not inflicted on sinners, but spiritual punishments only; and whatever is related in the Scriptures about corporeal punishments, is to be understood metaphorically. Consequently the soul is not acted upon by corporeal fire.

But the bodies of the damned must be punished by corporeal fire. So likewise their separated souls must be punished by corporeal fire.

This was the opinion of Origen [Peri Archon, II, 11]. But, such as it is, it does not seem satisfactory, because as Augustine says in the <i>De civitate Dei</i> [XXI, 10] we must understand that the fire by which the bodies of the damned are tormented, is corporeal; as is also the fire by which both the demons and the souls are tormented, inasmuch as this conclusion is inferred from it.

But this position cannot be maintained, because we have shown above (Art. 19, ans. obj. 6) that the powers of the sentient part of the soul, of which one is the imaginative power itself, do not remain in the soul when it is separated from the body.

Gregory mentions this in his <i>Dialogues</i> [IV, 29] for he says: “The soul suffers by fire in the very things which it sees.” However, since the act of seeing is a perfection of the one seeing, every vision is delightful inasmuch as it is of this sort. Hence nothing is painful inasmuch as it is seen, but inasmuch as it is apprehended as harmful.

          <td>Wherefore others said that when the soul sees this fire and understands that fire is harmful to it, it is tormented by this fact. Gregory mentions this is his <i>Dialogues</i> [ibid.], for he says that the soul is consumed by fire, because it sees itself being consumed by fire. But then we still have to discover whether fire by its very nature is harmful to the soul or not. Indeed, if it is not by its very nature harmful to the soul, then it follows that the soul is deceived in that judgment wherein it apprehends fire as harmful. This seems unlikely, particularly so far as the demons are concerned, because they possess an extensive knowledge of the natural order by reason of their intellectual acumen.

          <td>Oportet ergo dicere quod secundum rei veritatem ille ignis corporeus animae sit nocivus. Unde Gregorius, IV Dialog., concludit dicens: colligere ex dictis evangelicis possumus, quod incendium anima non solum videndo, sed experiendo patiatur. Ad investigandum ergo quomodo ignis corporeus animae vel Daemoni nocivus esse possit, considerandum est quod nocumentum alicui non infertur secundum quod recipit id quo perficitur, sed secundum quod a suo contrario impeditur. Unde passio animae per ignem non est secundum receptionem tantum, sicut patitur intellectus ab intelligibili et sensus a sensibili, sed secundum quod aliquid patitur ab altero per viam contrarietatis et obstaculi.
          <td>Therefore it must be said that corporeal fire in virtue of its true nature is harmful to the soul. Hence Gregory concludes by saying: “We can gather from the aforesaid Gospels that the soul suffers not only by seeing fire but by experiencing it.” Therefore to discover how corporeal fire can be harmful to the soul or to a demon, we must bear in mind that harm does not befall a thing inasmuch as it receives something by which it is perfected, but inasmuch as it is hindered by its contrary. Hence the suffering of the soul by fire does not consist simply in its receiving something as the intellect suffers by an intelligible and sense by a sensible, but in this, that one thing is acted upon by another by way of contrariety and as an obstacle.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Hoc autem contingit dupliciter. Impeditur enim aliquid uno modo a suo contrario quantum ad esse suum quod habet ex aliqua forma inhaerente; et sic patitur aliquid a suo contrario per alterationem et corruptionem, sicut lignum ab igne comburitur. Aliquid autem impeditur ab aliquo obstante vel contrariante quantum ad suam inclinationem. Sicut naturalis inclinatio lapidis est ut feratur deorsum; impeditur autem ab aliquo obstante et vim inferente, ut per violentiam quiescat, vel per violentiam moveatur.
          <td>Now this happens in two ways. For sometimes a thing is hindered in one way by its contrary as regards its very act of existing which it receives from some inhering form; and in this way something is acted upon by its contrary through alteration and corruption, as wood, for example, is consumed by fire. Secondly, a thing is hindered by an obstacle or a contrary with respect to its inclination, just as the natural inclination of a stone is to tend downward, but it is hindered in this by some obstacle and opposing power so that it is brought to rest or is moved contrary to its nature.

          <td>Neuter autem modus passionis poenalis est in re cognitione carente. Nam ubi non potest esse dolor et tristitia, non competit ratio afflictionis et poenae. Sed in habente cognitionem, ab utroque modo passionis consequitur afflictio et poena; sed diversimode. Nam passio quae est secundum alterationem a contrario, infert afflictionem et poenam secundum sensibilem dolorem; sicut cum sensibile excellens corrumpit harmoniam sensus. Et ideo excellentiae sensibilium, et maxime tangibilium, dolorem sensibilem inferunt; contemperationes autem eorum delectant propter convenientiam ad sensum. Sed secunda passio non infert poenam secundum dolorem sensibilem, sed secundum tristitiam quae oritur in homine vel in animali ex hoc quod aliquid interiori aliqua vi apprehenditur ut repugnans voluntati, vel cuicumque appetitui. Unde ea quae sunt contraria voluntati et appetitui affligunt, et magis interdum quam ea quae sunt dolorosa secundum sensum; praeeligeret enim aliquis verberari, et graviter secundum sensum affligi, quam vituperia sustinere, vel aliqua huiusmodi quae voluntati repugnant.
          <td>However, neither of these ways of suffering punishment exists in a thing that lacks knowledge. For where sorrow and sadness cannot exist, the nature of affliction and punishment is not found. However, in a being which possesses knowledge, torment and punishment are the natural effects of both kinds of suffering, although in different ways. For the suffering [or being-acted-upon] which is the effect of change by a contrary, results in ‘affliction and punishment by sensible pain, as when a sensible object of the greatest intensity corrupts the harmony of a sense. Therefore when <i>sensibilia</i> are of too great intensity, particularly those of touch, they inflict sensible pain; but when moderate they cause delight, because then they are proportioned to sense. However, the second kind of suffering (foes not inflict punishment by sensible pain, but by that sadness which arises in a man or in an animal because something is apprehended by an interior power as being repugnant to the will or to some appetite. Hence things which are opposed to the will and to the appetite inflict punishment, and sometimes even more than those which are painful to sense. For some choose beforehand to be whipped and to undergo severe physical punishment rather than be scolded or the like, which is repugnant to the will.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundum igitur primum modum passionis anima non potest pati poenam ab igne corporeo; non enim possibile est quod ab eo alteretur et corrumpatur. Et ideo non eo modo ab igne affligitur ut ex eo dolorem sensibilem patiatur. Potest autem pati anima ab igne corporeo, secundo modo passionis, in quantum per huiusmodi ignem impeditur a sua inclinatione, vel voluntate. Quod sic patet. Anima enim, et quaelibet incorporalis substantia, quantum est de sui natura, non est obligata alicui loco; sed transcendit totum ordinem corporalium. Quod ergo alligetur alicui, et determinetur ad aliquem locum per quamdam necessitatem, est contra eius naturam et contrarium appetitui naturali. Et hoc dico, nisi in quantum coniungitur corpori, cuius est forma naturalis, in quo aliquam perfectionem consequitur.
          <td>Consequently the soul cannot suffer punishment by corporeal fire according to the first kind of suffering [i.e., being acted-upon], because it is impossible for the soul to be altered and corrupted by suffering of this specific kind. Hence the soul is not afflicted by fire in this way, namely, that it suffers sensible pain thereby. However, the soul can suffer by corporeal fire according to the second kind of suffering, inasmuch as it is hindered from its inclination or volition by fire of this kind. This is evident. For the soul and any incorporeal substance, inasmuch as this belongs to it by nature, is not physically confined in any place, but transcends the whole corporeal order. Consequently it is contrary to its nature and to its natural appetite for it to be fettered to anything and be confined in a place by some necessity; and I maintain that this is the case except inasmuch as the soul is united to the body whose natural form it is, and in which there follows some perfection.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quod autem aliqua spiritualis substantia alicui corpori obligetur, non est ex virtute corporis potentis substantiam incorpoream detinere; sed ex virtute alicuius superioris substantiae alligantis spiritualem substantiam tali corpori. Sicut etiam per artes magicas, permissione divina, virtute superiorum Daemonum aliqui spiritus rebus aliquibus alligantur, vel anulis, vel imaginibus, vel huiusmodi rebus. Et per hunc modum animae et Daemones alligantur, virtute divina, in sui poenam, corporeo igni. Unde Augustinus dicit, XXI de Civit. Dei: cur non dicamus, quamvis miris modis, etiam spiritus incorporeos poena corporalis ignis affligi, si spiritus hominum, etiam ipsi profecto incorporei, et nunc possunt includi corporalibus membris, et tunc poterunt corporum suorum vinculis insolubiliter alligari? Adhaerebunt ergo spiritus, licet incorporei, corporalibus ignibus cruciandi; accipientes ex ignibus poenam, non dantes ignibus vitam.
          <td>Moreover, the binding of a spiritual substance to a body is not brought about by any power which a body has for detaining an incorporeal substance; but is the result of the power of some superior substance which unites a spiritual substance to such a body; just as by the magic arts, and with divine permission, some spirits are bound to certain things by the power of superior demons, either by signs or imaginary visions or other things of this kind. It is in this way, through the divine power, that the souls and the demons are confined in their punishment by corporeal fire. Wherefore Augustine says in the <i>De civitate Dei</i> [XXI, 10]: “If men’s souls, having been created incorporeal, are now in this life incarnate in bodily members, and shall one day be bound thereto forever, then why cannot we truly say, though you may marvel at it, that even incorporeal spirits may be afflicted by corporeal fire? Therefore these spirits, even though incorporeal, shall dwell in tormenting corporeal fires... and, instead of giving life to these fires, they shall receive punishment from them.”
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et sic verum est quod ignis ille, in quantum virtute divina detinet animam alligatam, agit in animam ut instrumentum divinae iustitiae. Et in quantum anima apprehendit illum ignem ut sibi nocivum, interiori tristitia affligitur; quae quidem maxima est cum considerat se infimis rebus subdi, quae nata fuit Deo per fruitionem uniri. Maxima ergo afflictio damnatorum erit ex eo quod a Deo separabuntur; secunda vero ex hoc quod rebus corporalibus subdentur, et infimo et abiectissimo loco.
          <td>Thus it is true that this fire, inasmuch as it detains the fettered soul, as a result of the divine power, acts upon the soul as the instrument of divine justice; and inasmuch as the soul apprehends that this fire is harmful to it, it is afflicted by interior sadness. Indeed, this sadness is greatest because the soul, which was born to be united to God through possession, meditates on the fact that it occupies a place below the lowest things in existence. Therefore the greatest affliction of the damned will be caused by the fact that they are separated from God; secondly, by the fact that they are situated below corporeal things, and in the lowest and meanest place.

          <td>1-7. As a result of this the solution to the first seven objections is evident. For we do not say that the soul is acted upon by corporeal fire in the manner of reception only or according to change by a contrary, as the preceding objections maintain.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">

          <td>9. Bodies are appropriate instruments for punishing the damned, because it is proper for those who are unwilling to be subject to their superior, that is, to God, to be made subject to inferior things as a punishment.

          <td>16. The soul is afflicted by corporeal fire inasmuch as the soul apprehends that fire is harmful to it as binding and confining it, as we have already pointed out. Moreover, this apprehension can torment the soul even when it is not actually confined by fire, simply because it sees that it is capable of being so confined; and for this reason the demons are said to bring’hell-fire with them wherever they go.

          <td>18. The punishment of hell-fire ( <i>gehenna</i> ) belongs not only to the soul but also to the body. For this reason this fire above all is said to be the punishment of hell, because fire is particularly capable of tormenting bodies. However, there will also be other torments, according to this: “Fire and brimstone and the storms of winds shall be the portion of their cup” (Ps. 10:7). It is also appropriate to that inordinate love which is the principle of sin, so that as the empyrean heaven rewards the fire of charity, so does the fire of hell reward inordinate desire.

          <td>19. Augustine says this not by way of an answer but by way of an inquiry, or if he stated this as an opinion, he expressly revoked it afterward in the <i>De civitate Dei</i> [XXI, 2]. Or we can say that the substance of hell is said to be spiritual as to the proximate effect produced, namely, that fire is apprehended as harmful inasmuch as it confines and binds the soul.

Inferuntur enim a Deo quaedam poenae vel in hac vita, vel post hanc vitam, ad emendationem vel purgationem; quaedam vero ad ultimam damnationem. Nec tales poenae a Deo infliguntur eo quod ipse delectetur in poenis; sed eo quod delectatur in iustitia, secundum quam peccantibus poena debetur. Sic etiam apud homines quaedam poenae infliguntur ad correctionem eius qui punitur, sicut cum pater flagellat filium; quaedam autem ad finalem condemnationem, sicut cum iudex suspendit latronem.
          <td>20. Gregory introduces this as an objection against certain people who believed that all punishments inflicted by God belong to purgatory and are not perpetual; which indeed is false. For some punishments are inflicted by God, either in this life or after this life, for correction and purgation; others, indeed, for ultimate damnation. Nor are such punishments inflicted by God because He delights in punishment, but because He delights in justice inasmuch as punishment is due to sinners. This is the way it is among men, because some punishments are inflicted for the correction of the one who is punished, as when a father chastises his son, whereas others are inflicted as a final condemnation, as when a judge hangs a bandit.

XI: per quae peccat quis, per haec et torquetur. Unde quia anima peccat corporalibus inhaerendo, ad divinam sapientiam pertinet ut per corporalia puniatur.
          <td>21. Punishments take place by means of contraries so far as the intention of the sinner is concerned, for the sinner intends properly to satisfy his will. Punishment is also contrary to the will itself inasmuch as punishment results from the divine wisdom, so that that wherein someone seeks to satisfy his will is turned into its contrary, as is said in the Book of Wisdom: “That by which a man sins, by the same also is he tormented” (Wis. 11:17). Wherefore, because the soul sins by adhering to corporeal things, it is consistent with the divine wisdom that it be punished by corporeal things.

          <td>22. The soul is rewarded by enjoying things which are superior to it, but is punished by being subjected to things which are inferior to it. Therefore the rewards of the soul are fittingly understood only when regarded spiritually; punishments, however, are understood to be corporeal.
