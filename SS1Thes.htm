              Haec verba competunt materiae huius epistolae. Ecclesia enim
              figuratur per arcam, sicut dicitur I Petr. III, 20, quia sicut in
              arca, caeteris pereuntibus, paucae animae salvatae sunt, ita in
              Ecclesia pauci, id est, soli electi salvabuntur.

              These words are appropriate to the contents of this letter. The
              Church is symbolized by the <i>ark,</i> as is stated in 1 Peter 3,
              for as in the ark a few souls were saved, the others perishing, so
              also in the Church a few, that is, only the elect, will be saved.

              Per aquas autem significantur tribulationes. Primo quia aquae
              impellunt irruendo, sicut tribulationes. Matth. VII, 25:
              <i
                >venerunt flumina, et flaverunt venti, et irruerunt in domum
                illam</i
              >. Sed impulsu fluminum Ecclesia non movetur. Unde subdit
              <i>et non cecidit</i>.
            </td>
            <td>
              The “waters” signify tribulations. First, because flooding waters
              strike like tribulations: “And the rain fell, and the floods came,
              and the winds blew and beat upon that house” (Matt. 7:25). Yet the
              Church is not shaken by the force of the floods; so Matthew adds,
              “but it did not fall.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr style="text-align: justify" valign="top">
            <td>
              Secundo aqua extinguit ignem. Eccli. XXX:
              <i>ignem ardentem extinguit aqua</i>. Sic tribulationes extinguunt
              impetus concupiscentiarum, ne homines ad libitum eas sequantur,
              sed non extinguunt veram charitatem Ecclesiae. Cant. VIII, 7:
              <i
                >aquae multae non poterunt extinguere charitatem, nec flumina
                obruent illam</i
              >.
            </td>
            <td>
              Secondly, because water extinguishes fire: “Water extinguishes a
              blazing fire” (Sir. 3:30). Similarly, tribulations diminish the
              force of desires so that men do not follow them at will; but they
              do not diminish the true charity of the Church: “Many waters
              cannot quench love, neither can floods drown it” (Cant. 8:7).

              Tertio aquae submergunt per inundationem. Thren. III, 54:
              <i>inundaverunt aquae super caput meum</i>. Sed Ecclesia non per
              has submergitur. Iona II, 6:
              <i
                >circumdederunt me aquae usque ad animam meam, abyssus vallavit
                me, pelagus operuit caput meum</i
              >, etc.; et post: <i>rursum videbo templum sanctum tuum</i>, et
              cetera.
            </td>
            <td>
              Thirdly, because waters inundate by flooding: “Water closed over
              my head” (Lam. 3:54). Yet the Church is not overcome by them: “The
              waters closed in over me, the deep was round about me; weeds were
              wrapped about my head” (Jon. 2.6). And just before this, “Yet
              would I again look upon your holy temple.”

              Non ergo deficit, sed sublevatur. Et primo per elevationem mentis
              ad Deum. Gregorius:
              <i>mala quae nos hic premunt, ad Deum nos ire compellunt</i>. Os.
              VI, 1: <i>in tribulatione sua mane consurgent ad me</i>. Secundo
              per spiritualem consolationem. Ps. XCIII, 19:
              <i
                >secundum multitudinem dolorum in corde meo consolationes tuae
                laetificaverunt animam meam</i
              >. II Cor. I, 5:
              <i
                >sicut abundant passiones Christi in nobis, ita per Christum
                abundat consolatio nostra</i
              >. Tertio per multiplicationem fidelium, quia tempore
              persecutionum Deus multiplicavit Ecclesiam. Ex. I, 12:
              <i
                >quantoque magis opprimebant eos, tanto magis multiplicabantur
                et crescebant</i
              >.
            </td>
            <td>
              Therefore, the Church is not destroyed but uplifted: first, by
              lifting the mind to God, as is clear from Gregory: “The evil
              things which bear down upon us here compel us to go to God.” “And
              in their distress they seek me” (Ho. 6: 1). Secondly, the Church
              is raised up through spiritual consolation: “When the cares of my
              heart are many, thy consolations cheer my soul (Ps. 94-19); “For
              as we share abundantly in Christ’s sufferings, so through Christ
              we share abundantly in comfort too” (2 Cor. 1:5). Thirdly, the
              Church is upraised by increasing the number of the faithful; for
              God has spread the Church in time of persecution: “But the more
              they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and the more they
              spread abroad” (Ex. 1: 12).

              Sic ergo convenit huic epistolae, quia isti multas tribulationes

              It seems then that these words are appropriate to this letter
              because the Thessalonians stood firm after suffering many
              tribulations. Let us, therefore, look at the text.

                1 Paul, Silvanus and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians
                in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and
                peace. 2 We give thanks to God always for you all, constantly
                mentioning you in our prayers, 3 remembering before our God and
                Father your work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of
                hope in our Lord Jesus Christ. 4 For we know, brethren beloved
                by God, that he has chosen you; 5 for our gospel came to you not
                only in word, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with
                full conviction. You know what kind of men we proved to be among
                you for your sake. 6 And you became imitators of us and of the
                Lord, for you received the word in much affliction, with joy
                inspired by the Holy Spirit; 7 so that you became an example to
                all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia. 8 For not only has
                the word of the Lord sounded forth from you in Macedonia and
                Achaia, but your faith in God has gone forth everywhere, so that
                we need not say anything. 9 For they themselves report
                concerning us what a welcome we had among you, and how you
                turned to God from idols, to serve a living and true God, 10 and
                to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead,
                Jesus who delivers us from the wrath to come.

              In treating the first point, Paul mentions three things that ought
              to be present in thanksgiving. First, thanksgiving should be
              directed to God: <i>we give thanks to God.</i> “He bestows favor
              and honor” (Ps. 84:11). “Every good endowment and every perfect
              gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights” (Jas.
              1: 17). Thanksgiving should be unceasing; so Paul says,
              <i>always.</i> It should also be universal, so Paul says,
              <i>for you all;</i> and later Paul adds,
              <i>give thanks in all circumstances</i>
              (5:18).

              Then when he says,

              Paul mentions the blessings for which he offers thanks, that is,
              faith, hope, and charity: “So faith, hope, love abide, these
              three” (1 Cor. 13:13). First, he mentions faith because it is an
              essential condition for obtaining the things to be hoped for, a
              means of revelation not based on appearances: “For whoever would
              draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards
              those who seek him” (Heb. 11:6). This, however, is not sufficient
              unless the person practices good works and makes an effort; so
              Paul says,
              <i>your work of faith and labor.</i>
              “Faith apart from works is dead” (Jas. 2:26). The person who gives
              up while laboring for Christ is worth nothing: “They believe for a
              while and in time of temptation fall away” (Lk. 8:13). Paul uses
              the words, <i>work</i> and <i>labor,</i> implying that he is
              mindful of their active and struggling faith.

              Then he gives thanks for their
              <i>hope,</i> which enables them to endure sufferings patiently:
              “Rejoice in your hope, be patient in tribulation” (Rom. 12:12). In
              addition, Paul gives thanks for the
              <i>steadfastness</i>
              of their hope: “You have heard of the steadfastness of Job” (Jas.
              5:11). Finally, Paul gives thanks for
              <i>hope in our Lord,</i>
              that is, the hope we have in Christ, or the hope Christ gave to
              us: “We have been born anew to a living hope through the
              resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead” (I Pet. 1:3). This
              hope is,
              <i>before our God,</i>
              not before the eyes of men; “Beware of practicing your piety
              before men in order to be seen by them” (Matt. 6:1). “We have this
              as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul” (Heb. 6:19). For hope
              in the old dispensation did not lead to God.

              What is said in Ezekiel (3:26) would seem to contradict this: “And
              I will make your tongue cleave to the roof of your mouth, so that
              you shall be dumb. To counter this Paul first calls to mind how
              powerfully he preached to them; secondly, he calls upon their own
              witness with the words: you
              <i>know</i>... Powerfully, because he came not in loftiness of
              speech,
              <i>but in power:</i>
              “And my speech and my message were not in plausible words of
              wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and power” (1 Cor.
              2:4). “For the kingdom of God does not consist in talk but in
              power” (1 Cor. 4:20). Now this may have reference either to the
              authentication of his preaching or to the manner of his preaching.
              If it is the first alternative, then Paul’s preaching to them was
              authenticated not by arguments but by the power of signs, and so
              it is said in Mark (16:20): “The Lord worked with them and
              confirmed the message by the signs that attended it”; and by the
              giving of the Holy Spirit; so Paul says,
              <i>and in the Holy Spirit.</i>
              “While Peter was still saying this, the Holy Spirit fell on all
              who heard the word” (Ac. 10:44). “While God also bore witness by
              signs and wonders and various miracles and by gifts of the Holy
              Spirit” (Heb. 2:4).
              <i>And with full conviction.</i>
              Paul adds this so that they would not believe that they received
              less than the Jews, indicating that the Holy Spirit does not
              discriminate among persons; but that the preaching was in the same
              fulness among them as among the Jews: “And they were all filled
              with the Holy Spirit” (Ac. 2:4).

              In treating the first point, Paul says that they have imitated the
              ones they should, namely, their prelates; so he says: You
              <i>became imitators of us,</i>
              “Brethren, join in imitating me” (Phil. 3:17); that is, you
              imitated me not in my human failings but in those points in which
              I have imitated Christ by patience in the midst of suffering: “If
              any man would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his
              cross and follow me” (Matt. 16:24). “Christ also suffered for you,
              leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps” (I
              Pet. 2:21). Therefore, Paul says,
              <i>in much affliction, with joy,</i>
              that is, although a considerable amount of tribulation threatened
              you because of the gospel, nevertheless you have accepted that
              with joy: “Count it all joy, my brethren, when you meet various
              trials, for you know that the testing of your faith produces
              steadfastness” (Jas. 1:2). “Then they left the presence of the
              council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer
              dishonor for the name of Jesus” (Ac. 5:41).
              <i>With joy,</i>
              Paul says,
              <i>inspired by the Holy Spirit</i>
              who is the love of God, and who imbues joy in those who suffer for
              Christ because they love Him: “If a man offered for love all the
              wealth of his house, it would be utterly scorned” (Cant. 8:7).

              So Paul says: you have imitated us so perfectly that you

              that is, an example of life not only in your own surroundings, but
              in other places as well: “Let your light so shine before men, that
              they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is
              in heaven” (Matt. 5:16). You became an example to all believers to
              whom your faith has become known. Your goodness was added to this,
              <i>for the word of the Lord sounded forth from you,</i>

              blessings coming to others: “Your zeal has stirred up most of

              Finally, Paul makes known how, from whom, and to what they have
              been converted. In regard to the first point Paul says: and
              <i>how you turned to God,</i>
              that is, how readily and completely. “Return to me with all your
              heart” (Joel 2:12). “Do not delay to turn to the Lord, nor
              postpone it from day to day (Sir. 5:7). In regard to the second
              point, Paul says,
              <i>from idols,</i>
              as is mentioned in 1 Cor. (12:2): “You know that when you were
              heathens, you were led astray to dumb idols.” In regard to the
              third point he says,
              <i>to serve a living and true God</i>
              by the practice of adoration, not of creatures, but of God, which
              is in contrast with what is stated in Romans (1:25): “They
              worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is
              blessed forever.” And Paul says,
              <i>living,</i>
              in order to exclude the cult of idolatry, because the idolaters
              worshipped certain dead people whose souls they regarded as
              deified, such as Romulus and Hercules. And so Paul insists on
              <i>living.</i>
              “As I live forever” (Deut. 32:40). Also, since the Platonists
              considered some separate substances to be gods by participation,
              he says
              <i>true,</i>
              meaning, not by participation in the divine nature.

              Since those who serve Him deserve a reward, and because this is
              the case with the Thessalonians, it remains for them to expect a
              reward; so Paul says to them,
              <i>to wait for his Son,</i>
              that is, God, descending
              <i>from heaven.</i>
              “Be like men who are waiting for their master to come home from
              the marriage feast” (Lk. 12:36). “Blessed are all those who wait
              for him” (Is. 30:18). These, however, are the men who girded their
              loins. We, however, are waiting for two things: first, for the
              resurrection, in order that we may clearly conform to Christ;
              hence Paul says:
              <i>whom he raised from the dead.</i>
              “He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will give life to your
              mortal bodies” (Rom. 8: 11). “Who will change our lowly body to be
              like his glorious body” (Phil. 3:21). Secondly, we are waiting to
              be freed from the punishment which awaits the guilty. For we shall
              be freed by Christ from sin, the cause of punishment. So Paul
              says:
              <i>Jesus who delivers us from the wrath to come.</i>
              “Hide us from the face of him who is seated on the throne, and
              from the wrath of the Lamb” (Rev. 6:16). No one can free us from
              this wrath but Christ: “Who warned you to flee from the wrath to
              come?” (Matt. 3:7).

                1 For you yourselves know, brethren, that our visit to you was
                not in vain; 2 but though we had already suffered and been
                shamefully treated at Philippi, as you know, we had courage in
                our God to declare to you the gospel of God in the face of great
                opposition. 3 For our appeal does not spring from error or
                uncleanness, nor is it made with guile; 4 but just as we have
                been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, so we
                speak, not to please men, but to please God who tests our
                hearts. 5 For we never used either words of flattery, as you
                know, or a cloak for greed, as God is witness; 6 nor did we seek
                glory from men, whether from you or from others, though we might
                have made demands as apostles of Christ. 7 But we were gentle
                among you, like a nurse taking care of her children. 8 So, being
                affectionately desirous of you, we were ready to share with you
                not only the gospel of God but also our own selves, because you
                had become very dear to us. 9 For you remember our labor and
                toil, brethren; we worked night and day, that we might not
                burden any of you, while we preached to you the gospel of God.
                10 You are witnesses, and God also, how holy and righteous and
                blameless was our behavior to you believers; 11 for you know
                how, like a father with his children, we exhorted each one of
                you and encouraged you and charged you 12 to lead a life worthy
                of God, who calls you into his own kingdom and glory.

              role of the Apostle in their conversion. So Paul first treats of
              his visit; secondly, of their conversion (3:13). In treating the
              first point Paul does three things. First, he recalls the
              perseverance which he had maintained before he came to them;
              secondly, he recalls the sound character of the doctrine with
              which he converted them (2:3); thirdly, he recalls the genuine
              quality of his dialogue with the converts (2: 10). Again, Paul
              divides the first point into two parts. First, he mentions the
              hardships which he had endured before he came to them; secondly,
              how le did not lose his confidence as a result of these hardships
              (2:2).

              But we had already suffered bodily trials: “Good sense makes a man

              declaring how just is the Lord” (Ps. 92:15). In addition to this,

              woman. This city was in Macedonia. In spite of all this his
              confidence in his preaching was not diminished: “God is my
              salvation; I will trust, and will not be afraid” (Is. 12:2);

              for your conversion: “He who presides, gives aid with zeal, with

              A doctrine, however, may become corrupt either because of the
              matter taught or because of the teacher’s intention. In relation
              to the first point, a doctrine may be corrupted in two ways:
              through error, for example, to teach that salvation is through
              Christ according to the Law: “Evil men and imposters will go on
              from bad to worse, deceivers and deceived” (2 Tim. 3:13). So Paul
              remarks,
              <i>our appeal does not spring,</i>
              like that of some,
              <i>from error.</i> Or the corruption may occur through
              adulteration, as is the case with those saying that one should
              indulge in pleasures. This teaching is derived from a certain
              Nicolaus who permitted promiscuous marriages and even gave his
              wife to others. So Paul adds, <i>or uncleanness:</i> “But I have
              this against you, that you tolerate the woman Jezebel, who calls
              herself a prophetess and is teaching and beguiling my servants to
              practice immorality and to eat food sacrificed to idols” (Rev.
              2:20). “Is there any wrong on my tongue?” (Job 6:30).

              Thus his preaching is not tainted, but rather sound. But something
              is sound because it serves its nature. As a result, preaching is
              sound when someone teaches in that manner in which Christ taught;
              and so Paul says,
              <i>but just as we have been approved,</i>
              that is, in that manner and with that intention with which God
              chose and approved us for the preaching of the gospel, so
              <i>we speak.</i> “I had been entrusted with the gospel to the
              uncircumcised, just as Peter had been entrusted with the gospel to
              the circumcised” (Gal. 2:7). “For he is a chosen instrument of
              mine to carry my name before the Gentiles and kings and the sons
              of Israel” (Ac. 9:15).

              he shows that his preaching is not meant to be deceptive. First,
              by ruling out the manner in which it might appear to be
              misleading; secondly, by making this point evident through a sign
              (2:5); thirdly, he shows the same thing by reason of a causal

              Aliquando tamen debent velle placere hominibus propter gloriam
              Dei, ut praedicatio magis fructificet, sicut dicitur I Cor. X, 33:
              <i>ego per omnia omnibus placeo</i>, et cetera. <i>Sed Deo</i>, et

              In elaborating the first point Paul says: My preaching is not of
              such a nature that it is ultimately pleasing to men. [God has
              scattered the bones of those who please men” (Ps. 52:6).] “If I
              were still pleasing men, I should not be a servant of Christ”
              (Gal. 1:10). Sometimes, however, Paul and his companions sought to
              please men for the sake of God’s glory, so that their preaching
              might be more fruitful, as is remarked in 1 Cor. (10:33): “Just as
              I try to please all men in everything I do, not seeking my own
              advantage, but that of many, that they may be saved.”
              <i>But to please God who tests our hearts:</i>
              “All the ways of a man are pure in his own eyes” (Prov. 16:2). A
              sign of this, however, is that we did not employ flattery, that
              is, only speaking of pleasant things to them. “Do not deceive with
              your lips” (Prov. 24:28). “Prophesy not to us what is right; speak
              to us smooth things, prophesy illusions” (Is. 30:10).

              Et idem ostendit per causam. Propter duo enim aliquis quaerit

              <i>neque fuimus</i>, et cetera. Quia non solum adulationem
              devitamus, sed etiam omnem occasionem avaritiae. I Tim. VI, 5:

              oneri esse, quia debebant ei gloriam et sustentationem; unde dicit
              <i>cum possemus</i>. Et vocat onus, quia perverse eis praedicantes
              ultra modum haec ab eis quaerebant. Is. III, 14:

            <td>
              And Paul makes the same point with a causal analysis. For someone
              wishes to please men for two reasons, that is, for the sake of
              advantages, or for the sake of glory; however, he excludes these
              from consideration here. He rules out the first possibility by
              saying:
              <i>for we never used words of flattery:</i>
              we avoided not only any flattery, but every occasion of
              <i>greed</i> as well: “There is great gain in godliness with
              contentment” (1 Tim. 6:6). “Every one is greedy for unjust gain”
              (Jer. 6:13). Then he rules out the other possibility when he says,
              <i>nor did we seek glory from men,</i>
              whether from you or from others, by reason of our teaching;
              although we might have been pampered, accepted favors and even
              been a burden to the Thessalonians, for they owed him attention
              and support. Thus Paul says,
              <i>though we might have made demands as apostles of Christ.</i>
              Paul terms it a demand because those preaching heretically to them
              sought to acquire favors from them beyond measure: “It is you who
              have devoured the vineyard, the spoil of the poor is in your
              houses” (Is. 3:14).

              In handling the first point Paul does two things. First, he gives

              simile (2:7).

              Paul makes the first point by saying that
              <i>we were as children,</i>
              that is, humble. “If they make you master of the feast, do not
              exalt yourself; be among them as one of them” (Sir. 32:1). Then he
              employs the simile saying,
              <i>like a nurse taking care of her children,</i>
              who bends down to an infant and speaks to the stammering child, so
              that the child may learn to speak; the nurse even makes use of
              gestures: “I have become all things to all men” (1 Cor. 9:22); “As
              babes in Christ, I fed you with milk, not solid food” (1 Cor.
              3:1). So,
              <i
                >being affectionately desirous of you, we were ready to share
                with you not only the gospel of God but also our own selves.</i

              “The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep” (Jn. 10: 11).
              <i>Because you had become very dear to us.</i>
              “I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls” (2 Cor.

              <i>for you remember our labor and toil.</i>
              And some do indeed labor, but out of comfort seeking; but we do
              not labor in that manner, but rather with honest hard work. So
              Paul comments:
              <i>our labor,</i>
              not merely for the sake of discipline of the body, but with
              genuine toil. Therefore Paul adds, you
              <i>remember our toil.</i>
              Some people work during the day, but we in reality work
              <i>night and day.</i>
              By this remark Paul wishes to protect them from the misleading
              people who were over-receptive and also from the lethargic people
              among them: “And we labor, working with our own hands” (1 Cor.

              <i>and righteous</i>

                became imitators of the churches of God in Christ Jesus which
                are in Judea; for you suffered the same things from your own
                countrymen as they did from the Jews, 15 who killed both the
                Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove us out, and displease God
                and oppose all men 16 by hindering us from speaking to the
                Gentiles that they may be saved-so as always to fill up the
                measure of their sins. But God’s wrath has come upon them at
                last! 17 But since we were bereft of you, brethren, for a short
                time, in person not in heart, we endeavored the more eagerly and
                with great desire to see you face to face; 18 because we wanted
                to come to you—I, Paul, again and again—but Satan hindered us.
                19 For what is our hope or joy or crown of boasting before our

              So Paul says, <i>and,</i> since I have carefully preached to you,
              as a father to his children, I therefore <i>thank God</i> as a
              father does for the welfare of his children: “No greater joy can I
              have than this, to bear that my children follow the truth” (3 Jn.
              1:3). “With thanksgiving” (Phil. 4:6). But for what reason?
              <i
                >For this, that when you received the word of God which you
                heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men but as
                what it really is, the word of God.</i
              >
              The preacher should give thanks when his preaching proves to be
              effective in the lives of his congregation. Paul tells them, you
              <i>heard the word of God from us,</i> that is, through us: “Let me
              hear what God the Lord will speak” (Ps. 85:8). “Faith comes from
              what is heard, and what is heard comes by the preaching of Christ
              (Rom. 10: 17). You <i>accepted it,</i> that is, you kept it firmly
              in your heart, <i>not as the word of men;</i> for the words of man
              are empty: “You desire proof that Christ is speaking in me” (2
              Cor. 13:3). “No prophecy ever came by the impulse of man, but men
              moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God” (2 Pet. 1:21). And why
              does he give thanks? Because the fact that you have believed, God
              has worked in you. “For God is at work in you, both to will and to
              work for his good pleasure” (Phil. 2:13). “Thou hast wrought for
              us all our works” (Is. 26:12).

              that a man dies for the sake of Christ is testimony to the fact
              that the words of the faith are the words of God; and, therefore,
              “martyrs” means the same as “witnesses.” <i>In Judea,</i> for it
              is there that the faith of Christ was first proclaimed: “For out
              of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from
              Jerusalem” (Is. 2:3). In addition, it was also there that the
              first persecution of the faith occurred, as is evident from Acts
              (8:1): “On that day a great persecution arose against the church
              in Jerusalem.” “But recall the former days when, after you were
              enlightened, you endured a hard struggle with sufferings” (Heb.
              10:32). The Thessalonians endured similar difficulties, so Paul
              remarks:
              <i>for you suffered the same things from your own countrymen,</i>
              that is, from the incredulous Thessalonians: “And a man’s foes
              will be those of his own household” (Matt. 10:36).

              him: “My heritage has become to me like a lion in the forest, she
              has lifted up her voice against me” (Jer. 12:8). Paul then speaks
              of the prophets when he mentions:
              <i>and the prophets.</i> “Which of the prophets did not your
              fathers persecute? And they killed those who announced beforehand
              the coming of the Righteous One, whom you have now betrayed and
              murdered” (Ac. 7:52). Paul next speaks of the apostles when he
              comments: <i>and drove us out,</i> that is, the apostles. “Beware
              of men, for they will deliver you up to councils, and flog you in
              their synagogues” (Mt. 10: 17).

              although they may think that through this they do a service to

              the Gentiles. In Acts 10 and 11 Peter is criticized for having
              gone to Cornelius; also in Luke 15 the elder son, the Jewish
              people, is disturbed because the younger son, the Gentile people,
              is received by the father. “Woe to him who says to a father, ‘What
              are you begetting”’ (Is. 45:10). “Would that all the Lord’s people
              were prophets” (Num. 11-29).

              Ratio autem huius culpae est ex divina permissione, qua vult ut
              impleant peccata sua. Omnium enim quae fiunt, sive bona, sive

              omnium istorum mensura est in praescientia. Bonorum quidem, in

              vivunt, quamdiu perveniant ad hoc, quod Deus permittit. Matth.
              XXIII, 32: <i>implete mensuram patrum vestrorum</i>, et cetera. Et
              ideo dicit <i>ut impleant</i>, et cetera. Deus enim dedit Iudaeis
              post passionem Christi spatium poenitentiae per quadraginta annos,
              nec conversi sunt, sed addebant peccata peccatis. Et ideo Deus non
              plus permisit. Unde dicit hic <i>pervenit ira Dei</i>, et cetera.

              The reason for this sin is found in the divine permission, by
              which God wills that they fill up the measure of their sins.
              Indeed, for all things which come about, either good or bad, there
              is a certain measure, because nothing is infinite; and the measure
              of all these things is in [God’s] foreknowledge. The measure of
              good things is what it prepares, for “grace was given to each of
              us according to the measure of Christ’s gift” (Eph. 4:7); the
              measure of evil things, however, is what it permits, for if some
              are “evil, they are not as evil as they want, but as God permits.
              And, therefore, they live until they attain that which God
              permits: “Fill up, then, the measure of your fathers” (Matt.
              23:32). So Paul says:
              <i>so as always to</i>
              fill
              <i>up the measure of their sins.</i>
              For after the suffering of Christ, God gave the Jews forty years
              to repent, but they were not converted; rather they multiplied
              their sins. God did not permit this to go on, so Paul states:
              <i>but Gods wrath has come upon them until the end.</i>
              “For great is the wrath of the Lord that is kindled against us,
              because our fathers have not obeyed the words of this book, to do
              according to all that is written concerning us (2 Kg 22:13). “For
              great distress shall be upon the earth and wrath upon this people”
              (Lk. 21:23). And you should not think that this wrath shall last
              for one hundred years only, but
              <i>until the end</i>
              of the world, when all the Gentiles will have embraced [the
              Christian religion], and then all of Israel shall be saved, as it
              appears from Rom. 10, Lk. 19:44, 21:6, and Matt. 24:2: “There will
              not be left here one stone upon another, that will not be thrown
              down.”

              either on account of your tribulations, or because we were
              separated from you [
              <i>in conversation</i>
              ], that is, missing the opportunity for conversation, and
              <i>in person,</i>
              that is, not being able to enjoy your company. Both of these
              things require the presence of a friend because it is consoling.
              But
              <i>not in heart,</i>
              for we are present in heart, as is evident from 1 Cor. (5:3): “For
              though absent in body I am present in spirit.”

              have longed for many years to come to you” (Rom. 15:23). When Paul
              says
              <i>we,</i> he intends a plural meaning, because he writes in the
              name of three persons, that is, in his own name, and that of
              Silvanus, and of Timothy. Therefore Paul says:
              <i>we wanted to come to you,</i>
              all of us perhaps once, but I
              <i>Paul, again and again,</i>

              <i>but Satan hindered us</i>, that is, set up obstacles, perhaps
              through violent winds, as in: “Four angels standing at the four
              corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth”
              (Rev. 7:1).

              Then when Paul says:

              future; secondly, in regard to the present (2:20). Paul says: I

              our
              <i>hope;</i>

              from God, when He shall come to render to every one according to
              his deeds. For the greatest reward of the preacher comes from
              those whom he has converted.
              <i>Or joy,</i>
              because their joy is the Apostle’s joy, just as their goodness is
              the Apostle’s goodness; for the goodness of the effect is
              accounted for by the goodness of the cause.
              <i>Or crown of boasting,</i>
              because as a result of their struggles he who encouraged them to
              struggle shall be decorated; for the commander who led the
              soldiers to combat is decorated: “He who disciplines his son will
              profit by him, and will boast of him among acquaintances” (Sir.
              30:2). 1 ask what is this hope; is
              <i>it not you?</i>
              Yes, assuredly: in the future, that
              <i>is, before our Lord Jesus at his coming;</i>
              but also in the present,

              would rather die than have any one deprive me of my ground for
              boasting” (1 Cor. 9:15);
              <i>and joy,</i>
              for which reason Paul rejoices over their good fortune in the
              present.

                and our Lord Jesus, direct our way to you; 12 and may the Lord
                make you increase and abound in love to one another and to all
                men, as we do to you, 13 so that he may establish your hearts

              intended to supply for them. Here he recalls how he came to their
              assistance through the visit of Timothy. First, Paul deals with
              the task of his messenger; secondly, Paul talks about the contact
              established through Timothy (3:6); thirdly, Paul writes on the
              effect of this contact on the Apostle (3:7). Paul divides the

              sent him; secondly, he mentions the person whom he sent; thirdly,
              he speaks further about the reason for sending him.

              And so Paul sends Timothy to strengthen the Thessalonians and to
              report to Paul about them. When Paul says <i>to establish</i> you,
              he shows that Timothy is sent to strengthen them. So Paul first
              states this, and second the reason for the strengthening is stated
              (3:3). Paul says, <i>to establish and to exhort you,</i> for the
              soul of a man is strengthened through encouragement: “Your words
              have upheld him who was stumbling” (Job 4:4). When you have turned
              again, strengthen your brethren (Lk. 22:32). And you are in need
              of encouragement in
              <i>your faith, that no one be moved by these afflictions.</i>
              “If the anger of the ruler rises against you, do not leave your
              place” (Ec. 10:4). And there is a twofold consideration
              strengthening them. The first is related to a divine ordination:
              You
              <i>yourselves know that this is to be our lot,</i>
              almost as if implying that God ordained that you shall enter into
              heaven through tribulations: “Through many tribulations we must
              enter the kingdom of God” (Ac. 14:22). “All who desire to live a
              godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted” (2 Tirn. 3:12).
              Christ Himself traveled this path as is shown in Luke (24:46):
              “Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things
              and enter into his glory?”

              The other consideration strengthening them is a prediction
              concerning the future, for anticipated difficulties are less
              harmful. So Paul tells them:
              <i
                >for when we were with you, we told you beforehand that we were
                to suffer affliction,</i

              how firm you are in your faith: “Know well the condition of your
              flocks, and give attention to your herds” (Prov. 27:23);
              <i>for fear that somehow the tempter had tempted you,</i>
              that is, the devil: “And the tempter came” (Matt. 4:3). There is a
              commentary which says: “Whose business it is to tempt.”

              Gen. XXII, 1: <i>tentavit Deus Abraham</i>, et cetera. Respondeo.
              Tentare est experimentum de aliquo sumere. In hoc considerandum
              est ad quid velit sumere, et quomodo. Nam hoc est dupliciter: vel
              ut ipse cognoscat, vel ut alium cognoscere faciat. Primo modo Deus
              non tentat, ipse enim scit quid est in homine Io. II, 25. Secundo
              modo sic: Deus enim tentavit Abraham, scilicet ut alii scirent
              fidem eius. Sed primo modo tentare est dupliciter, scilicet ut
              promoveat ad bonum, sicut episcopus promovendos examinat; vel
              aliquis tentat ut decipiat, et hoc est Diaboli, quia scilicet
              inquirit conditionem hominum, ut secundum diversas conditiones ad
              diversa vitia ad quae proni sunt inducat. I Petr. V, 8:
              <i>adversarius vester Diabolus</i>, et cetera. Officium ergo eius
              est tentare ad decipiendum. Mundus autem et caro dicuntur tentare
              materialiter, quia per ea, ad quae ipsa inclinant, sumitur
              experimentum de homine, utrum firmus sit ad mandata Dei et
              dilectionem. Si enim vicerit concupiscentia, non perfecte diligit
              Deum. Et similiter quando res mundi vel terrent, vel afficiunt.

              But on the contrary, both the world and the flesh also tempt, as
              is seed in James (1: 14): “Each person is tempted when he is lured
              and enticed by his own desire.” Also in Genesis (22: 1): “God
              tested Abraham.” It is necessary to point out that “to tempt”
              means to make a test of something. And in this matter the purpose
              must be considered for which one wants to test something, and in
              what manner one wants to test something. For this occurs in two
              ways: either so that the person testing may know about it, or so
              that he may make it known to another. God does not need to tempt
              in the first way, for He knows what is in man as is stated in John
              2. Rather in the second way: for God tempted Abraham so that
              others might know of his faith. A temptation in the first manner
              may occur in two ways, that is, it leads towards some good, as
              when the bishop examines those to be promoted; or else, somebody
              tempts in order to deceive, and this is the work of the devil; for
              the devil tests the condition of men in order that he may lead
              them to the various sins to which they are prone in accordance
              with their various dispositions: “Your adversary the devil prowls
              around like a roaring lion, seeking some one to devour” (Pet.
              5:8). Therefore, it is the devil’s business to tempt in order to
              deceive. The world and the flesh are said to tempt in a material
              way, for through them and the things to which they lead a
              knowledge is achieved about man as to whether he is really
              steadfast in God’s commandments and in the love of God. Because if
              concupiscence triumphs, the person does not love God in a perfect
              manner, nor does he love in a perfect manner when the concerns of
              the world either frighten him or exert an undue influence upon
              him.

              and of the resultant frequent prayer, in the words:
              <i>praying night and day.</i>
              And so Paul tells them: because we have heard such things about
              you, we are encouraged, although the demands of temporal concerns
              are pressing, as well as bodily trials. “When the cares of my
              heart are many, thy consolations cheer my sour (Ps. 94:19).
              “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the
              Father of mercies and God of all comfort” (2 Cor. 1:3). And this
              occurred
              <i>through your faith,</i>
              that is, having heard about the reliable character of your faith.
              <i>For now we live,</i> if
              <i>you stand fast in the Lord,</i>
              as if saying: I value your condition so highly that I think it
              sustains me: “It is enough; Joseph my son is still alive” (Gen.
              45:28).

              the second effect of their existent relationship is treated,
              namely, the spirit of thanksgiving, as if implying: I am not
              worthy to supply fitting thanks to God for you: “With what shall I
              come before the Lord?” (Mic. 6:6). “What shall I render to the
              Lord for all his bounty to me? (Ps. 116:12). However, the prayers
              of thanksgiving are offered
              <i>for all the</i> joy; a joy which is not entirely visible, but
              <i>which we feel for your sake</i>
              in our conscience
              <i>before our God</i> who beholds this; or perhaps
              <i>before God</i> in that those close to God please God: “Love
              does not rejoice at wrong, but rejoices in the right” (1 Cor.
              13:6).

              Then when Paul says,

              the third effect of their relationship is explained. First, he
              points out the frequency of his prayer; secondly, he shows what he
              desires while praying (3: 11). So Paul insists: We give thanks for
              things past; nevertheless we do not fail to pray also for future
              concerns, indeed, [we do so]
              <i>night and day,</i>
              that is, in adversity and prosperity. “Evening and morning and at
              noon I utter my complaint and mom’ (Ps. 55:17). To
              <i>supply what is lacking in your faith:</i>
              not matters that pertain to the fundamentals of the faith, but
              some special teachings which the Apostle did not preach to them at
              their [spiritual] birth: “I, brethren, could not address you as
              spiritual men, but as men of the flesh” (1 Cor. 3:1). “I have yet
              many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now” (Jn.
              16:12).

              you, he makes known what he desires for them; in regard to this he
              first shows what he is asking for (3:13). And Paul is asking for
              two things: One on his own behalf—that he may go to see them—and
              so he says:
              <i

                way to you.</i

              “I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your
              God” (Jn. 20:17). “The plans of the mind belong to man, but the
              answer of the tongue is from the Lord” (Prov. 16:1). The other is
              for their welfare, so Paul asks:
              <i>and may the Lord make you increase,</i>
              that is, in faith: “May the Lord add to his people a hundred times
              as many as they are” (1 Chr. 21:3). And Paul prays also that their
              merits may increase; so he says,
              <i>and abound in love, which</i>
              can always increase in this life: “Above all these put on love,
              which binds everything together” (Col. 3:14). And, first, charity

              secondly, charity

              “Let us do good to all men, and especially to those who are of the
              household of faith” (Gal. 6: 10). And Paul gives an example of
              himself when he comments:
              <i>as we do to you,</i>
              as if to say: just as I also love you: “You are in our hearts, to
              die together and to live together” (2 Cor. 7:3).

                1 Finally, brethren, we beseech and exhort you in the Lord
                Jesus, that as you learned from us how you ought to live and to
                please God, just as you are doing, you do so more and more. 2
                For you know what instructions we gave you through the Lord
                Jesus. 3 For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that
                you abstain from immorality; 4 that each one of you know how to
                take a wife for himself in holiness and honor, 5 not in the
                passion of lust like heathen who do not know God; 6 that no man
                transgress, and wrong his brother in this matter, because the
                Lord is an avenger in all these things, as we solemnly
                forewarned you. 7 For God has not called us for uncleanness, but
                in holiness. 8 Therefore whoever disregards this, disregards not
                man but God, who gives his Holy Spirit to you. 9 But concerning
                love of the brethren you have no need to have any one write to
                you, for you yourselves have been taught by God to love one
                another; 10 and indeed you do love all the brethren throughout
                Macedonia. But we exhort you, brethren, to do so more and more,
                11 to aspire to live quietly, to mind your own affairs, and to
                work with your hands, as we charged you; 12 so that you may
                command the respect of outsiders, and be dependent on nobody.

              Earlier, the Apostle Paul commended the faithful for their loyalty
              in the face of trials and for other good practices; here Paul
              cautions them to act well in the future. First, Paul presents a
              general warning; secondly, Paul makes it more specific (4:3). In
              regard to the first point, Paul does two things. First he presents
              what he is intent upon; secondly, he indicates a reason for the
              warning (4:1b). So Paul says: I heard about your good practices of
              the past, but in the future we will continue to exhort you. So
              Paul prevails upon them, first, on his own behalf when he remarks,
              <i>we beseech you,</i> “Pray for the peace of Jerusalem” (Ps.
              122:6). In addition, Paul prevails upon them on behalf of Christ,
              and so he says, <i>and we exhort you in the Lord Jesus.</i> And he
              exhorts them, because they are holy: “Do not rebuke an older man
              but exhort him as you would a father” (1 Tim. 5: 1).

              <i
                >That as you learned from us how you ought to live and to please
                God, just as you are doing, you do so more and more.</i
              >
              The Apostle had taught them how they should conduct themselves in
              the practice of common justice, which is by keeping the precepts;
              that is why he says: you
              <i>learned from us how you ought to live.</i> “I will ran in the
              way of thy commandments” (Ps. 119:32). Paul had also taught them
              how they might be pleasing to God in the practice of the counsels:
              “There was one who pleased God and was loved by him” (Wis. 4: 10);
              or <i>how you ought to live,</i> that is, by virtuous actions.
              “Walk while you have the light” (Jn. 12:35);
              <i>and to please God</i> through the forming of good intentions.
              <i>just as you are doing,</i> that is, that they might remain
              steadfast in the original teaching, without falling away from it:
              “But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you a
              gospel contrary to that which we preached to you, let him be
              accursed” (Gal. 1:8).

              The reason for the warning is based on the benefit to be derived
              from heeding the warning; secondly, from the warning itself (4:2).
              Paul remarks: although you are good, nevertheless you shall grow
              markedly and improve through the repeated practice of the precepts
              and counsels. “God is able to provide you with every blessing in
              abundance” (2 Cor. 9:8). For charity is so encompassing that there
              will always be something left through which one might improve
              himself. Also, if difficulties are removed because of the warning,
              it is both proper and useful. “The law of the Lord is perfect,
              reviving the soul” (Ps. 19:7). “For the commandment is a lamp and
              the teaching a light, and the reproofs of discipline are the way
              of life” (Prov. 6:23). Paul then says:
              <i>what instructions,</i> that is, what kind of commandments, and
              he tells us that they are <i>through the Lord Jesus</i>, in that
              they are given through Him: “For I received from the Lord what I
              also delivered to you” (1 Cor. 11:23). “It was declared at first
              by the Lord, and it was attested to us by those who heard him”
              (Heb. 2:3). The precepts are as follows:
              <i>this is the will of God, your sanctification,</i>
              as if saying: All the commandments of God are for the purpose of
              making you holy; for sanctity means purity and constancy, and all
              of God’s precepts lead thereto, so that a person may be cleansed
              from evil and constant in good: “That you may prove what is the
              will of God” (Rom. 12:2) which is made known through the precepts.

              of them, curiosity, and an inordinate grief for the dead. For
              these reasons Paul speaks about these matters. About the second
              inordinate practice Paul remarks in (4:9); the third inordinate

              secondly, he forbids greed. He always associates these two, for

              culminates in spiritual delight.

              Paul first teaches them to beware of lust in regard to a woman who
              is not their wife; secondly, in regard to one’s own wife (4:4).
              Therefore Paul insists,
              <i>that you abstain from immorality,</i>
              for it is God’s will to abstain from immorality. Therefore, it is
              a mortal sin, for it is contrary to the commandment and the will
              of God. “Beware, my son, of all immorality” (Tob. 4:12). But also
              with regard to your wife, deny yourself honorably;
              <i>that each one of you know how to take</i>
              [ <i>his vessel</i> ], that is his wife,
              <i>in holiness,</i> denying yourself pleasure for a time,
              <i>and in honor, not in the passion of lust,</i>
              that is, do not let passion be the stimulus;
              <i>like heathen,</i> for it is characteristic of heathens to
              desire immediate pleasures instead of those of the future life.
              <i>In holiness and honor,</i> because this is the proper use of
              marriage, since it is for the good of the offspring or for
              fulfilling an obligation; and so marriage may be without sin. But
              sometimes a venial sin is involved, if concupiscence is not
              exercised beyond the limits of marriage, that is, when, although
              having concupiscence, a person does not indulge it except with his
              own wife. But when this takes place outside the bonds of marriage,
              the action becomes a mortal sin; and this happens when he would
              perform the action, even if she were not his wife, and more
              willingly with another woman. “Let marriage be held in honor among
              all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled; for God will judge the
              immoral and adulterous” (Heb. 13:4). “Likewise you husbands, live
              considerately with your wives, bestowing honor on the woman as the
              weaker sex, since you are joint heirs of the grace of life, in
              order that your prayers may not be hindered” (I Pet. 3:7).

              When Paul says:
              <i>because the Lord is an avenger in all these things,</i>
              the reason for the warning is mentioned. First, Paul attributes it
              to the divine vengeance; secondly, he shows that this vengeance is
              justifiable (4:7). Paul exhorts them to refrain from these things,
              for
              <i>the Lord is an avenger. I</i>
              warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things
              shall not inherit the kingdom of God” (Gal. 5:21). For God
              certainly takes vengeance justly. One reason for this is that God
              has called us, and a second reason is that such actions are
              contrary to God’s gifts to us. If the Lord calls you to one thing
              and you do something contrary, then punishment is due. So Paul
              points out that
              <i>God has not called us for uncleanness. “As</i>
              he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we
              should be holy and blameless before him” (Eph. 1:4). “Those whom
              he predestined he also called” (Rom. 8:30). And so Paul concludes:
              <i
                >therefore, whoever disregards this, disregards not man but
                God,</i
              >
              as if saying: This is the one special reason that I mentioned. The
              other reason is that these vices are opposed to the Spirit who was
              given to us. And he who does these things offends the Holy Spirit;
              so Paul says,
              <i>who gives his Holy Spirit to you.</i>
              “A man who has violated the law of Moses dies without mercy at the
              testimony of two or three witnesses. How much worse punishment do
              you think will be deserved by the man who has spurned the Son of
              God, and profaned the blood of the covenant by which he was
              sanctified, and outraged the Spirit of grace?” (Heb. 10:28).

              Then when Paul remarks:
              <i
                >But concerning love of the brethren you have no need to have
                any one write to you,</i
              >
              he discourages them from remaining idle. It should be realized, as
              Jerome says in the letter to the Galatians, that the Thessalonians
              were generous, and that it was the custom among the rich to give
              away a great deal; as a result the poor idly depended on their
              benefits without looking for work, but rather wasted time in their
              homes. And so Paul first commends the generosity of the donors,
              but he is then critical of the idleness of the recipients of the
              welfare (4: 11). And first then, Paul adds that they do not need
              to be reminded of the need for charity, but secondly he also
              advises that they make progress in it (4:10). Paul observes,
              <i>but concerning love of the brethren,</i>
              that is, in regard to your love for your brothers, you
              <i>have no need to have any one write to you.</i>
              “Love one another with brotherly affection” (Rom. 12: 10). “Let
              brotherly love continue” (Heb. 13: 1). And the reason for this is
              that, you
              <i>yourselves have been taught by God,</i>
              that is, through the precept in the Law: “You shall love your
              neighbor as yourself’ (Lev. 19:18). Also, it is clear from the
              gospel of St. John (13:34) “A new commandment I give to you, that
              you love one another; even as I have loved you.” Or, you
              <i>yourselves have been taught</i>
              this by an interior teaching, as is found in John (6:45): “Every
              one who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me.” And
              this lesson is gained through the help of the Holy Spirit.

              Paul next says:

              He is correcting the idle. First, he criticises their idleness;
              secondly, he indicates how they ought to curtail it; and finally,
              he provides a reason why they ought to curtail it. He says
              therefore,
              <i>aspire to live quietly.</i>
              “...loud and wayward, her feet do not stay at home” (Prov. 7: 11).

              bread without paying, but with toil and labor we worked night and
              day, that we might not burden any of you- (2 Thess. 3:7). Paul
              desires that they combat idleness by performing daily tasks; hence
              he remarks:
              <i>to mind your own affairs.</i>

              <i>To work with your hands.</i>
              “Idleness teaches much evil” (Sir. 33:27). “This was the guilt of
              your sister Sodom: she and her daughters had pride, surfeit of
              good, and prosperous ease, but did not aid the poor and needy”
              (Ez. 16:49). And this is a precept for all those who have no other
              means of getting the things which enable them to live properly;
              for it is a law of nature that man care for his body. “If any one
              will not work, let him not eat” (2 Thess. 3: 10). Now, there are
              two reasons for this. The first one comes from the duty to set an
              example for others; so Paul says: so
              <i>that you may command the respect of outsiders.</i>
              For the unbelievers see your idle life and they detest you. “He
              must be well thought of by outsiders, or he may fall into reproach
              and the snare of the devil” (1 Tim. 3:7). The second reason comes
              from the fact that you should not covet those things that belong
              to others, and so it is said,
              <i>and be dependent on nobody.</i>
              “The desire of the sluggard kills him” (Prov. 21:25). “Let the
              thief no longer steal but rather let him labor” (Eph. 4:28). And
              therefore, if this idleness is overcome, it will result both in
              good example and in the repression of desire.

              In what went before Paul aimed at bringing them to the practice of
              continence in place of their concupiscence, and at curtailing
              their idleness. Now he urges them to lessen their inordinate
              sorrow. First, he provides a warning; secondly, he assigns a
              reason for the warning (4:13b). Therefore, he forbids them to
              indulge in inordinate sorrow when he tells them, you
              <i>may not grieve.</i> It seems, though, that the Apostle views
              sorrow for the dead benignly. Nevertheless, he cautions them not
              to grieve overmuch, <i>as others.</i> Someone who grieves for the
              dead does possess compassion. A person grieves first because of
              the dissolution of the frail body; for we ought to take care of
              the body for the sake of the soul. “O death, how bitter is the
              reminder of you to one who lives at peace among his possessions”
              (Sir. 41:1). Secondly, a person grieves because of the separation
              and departure which is so painful to friends. “Surely the
              bitterness of death is past” (1 Sam. 15:32). Thirdly, we mourn
              because death reminds us of our own sin. “For the wages of sin is
              death” (Rom. 6:23). Fourthly, because death reminds us of our own
              death. “For this is the end of all men, and the living will lay it
              to heart (Ec. 7:2). So moderate sorrow is permitted. “Weep less
              bitterly for the dead, for he has attained rest” (Sir. 22:11).
              Therefore, he says, <i>as others do who have no hope,</i> that is,
              because these people believe that these negative aspects of death
              are eternal; but we do not believe so. “Our commonwealth is in
              heaven, and from it we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who
              will change our lowly body to be like his glorious body” (Phil.
              3:20). So he says clearly,
              <i>concerning those who are asleep.</i> “Our friend Lazarus has
              fallen asleep” (Jn. 11:11).

              A person who decides to go to sleep does three things. First, he
              lies down with the hope of eventually getting up: “Shall he that
              sleeps not rise again from where he lies” (Ps. 40:9). A person who
              passes away abiding in the faith feels the same way. Secondly, the
              soul in a sleeping person remains vigilant. I slept, but my heart
              was awake” (Cant. 5:2). Thirdly, after sleep a man gets up much
              more refreshed and restored. In this same manner the saints will
              rise incorruptibly, as we read in 1 Cor. 15.

              Then when Paul says,
              <i>for since we believe,</i> he provides a reason for the warning
              he had given. First, he establishes the resurrection; secondly, he
              rules out the faint suspicion of a delay (4:15); thirdly, be
              outlines the order of resurrection (4:16). It should be realized
              that the Apostle constructs the case for our resurrection on the
              basis of the resurrection of Christ (1 Cor. 15), for Christ’s
              resurrection is the cause of our resurrection. So Paul makes his
              point here by a causal analysis. Christ’s resurrection is not only
              the cause but also the pattern of our resurrection. The Word made
              flesh revives our bodies, while the Word as such revives our
              souls. Christ is the pattern of our resurrection in that Christ
              assumed flesh, and also rose embodied in flesh.

              Nor is Christ only the pattern; He is also the efficient cause of
              our resurrection, for the things done by Christ’s humanity were
              done not only by the power of His human nature, but also by virtue
              of His divinity united in Him. just as His touch cured the leper
              as an instrument of His divinity, so also Christ’s resurrection is
              the cause of our resurrection, not merely because it was a body
              that arose, but a body united to the Word of life. So the Apostle,
              firmly presupposing this, declares,
              <i
                >for since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so,

              death through baptism; or he says <i>through Jesus,</i> because
              God will bring them with Him, that is, with Christ Himself. “The
              Lord your God will come, and all the holy ones with him” (Zech.
              14:5). “The Lord enters into judgment with the elders and princes
              of his people” (Is. 3:14).

              reply to this by saying that it is the cause of our resurrection
              according to the activity of the divine power. God, however, acts
              according to the order of His wisdom. Therefore, our resurrection
              will occur when the order of divine wisdom shall determine it.

              In order to prove that Christ is the cause of the resurrection, he
              shows that all the dead shall rise in the presence of Christ.
              Three causes cooperate in the accomplishment of the general
              resurrection: the principal cause is the divine power; the second
              cause is instrumental, that is, the power of the humanity of
              Christ. The third cause might be termed a ministering cause in
              that the power of the angels will have some effect in the
              resurrection. For Augustine shows that the things that occur now
              by virtue of corporeal creatures actually occur through God, by
              their mediation. In the resurrection, some things shall be done
              through the angels, such as the collection of the dust. But the
              restoration of the bodies and the soul's reunion with the body
              will be accomplished immediately through Christ.

              “Jesus... will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven”

              In the first coming, he came as obedient. “He became obedient unto
              death” (Phil. 2:8). And that happened because it was the coming of
              humility; but this one will be the coming of glory. “Coming with

              that is, Christ’s, Who is Prince of the angels. “Wonderful
              Counselor” (Is. 9:6). And the resurrection shall be through
              Christ’s voice, corporeal or spiritual. “(They) shall hear the
              voice of the son of God” (Jn. 5:28); in other words, the dead

              archangel. It is called the trumpet of God since the resurrection
              does come about by divine power. It is called a trumpet because of
              its resonance, which is derived from God who raises the dead. In
              addition, the trumpet, which had many uses in the Old Testament,
              brings people together for war: “And creation will fight alongside
              him” (Wis. 5:20). The trumpet was also used for celebrations, as
              it will be employed in the heavenly Jerusalem. In addition, the
              trumpet was used for deploying the armies; in this way holy men
              assisted in the movement of troops. And so if it is a sound that
              you can hear, it is called a trumpet; but if it is not a sound,
              then it is the divine power of Christ present and manifest to the
              whole world.

              (4:17); finally, he refers to the happiness of the saints with

              It might seem that there would be no other reason for
              distinguishing the living from the dead. But on the contrary: [“We
              shall all indeed rise”] (1 Cor. 15:51). “For as in Adam all die,
              so also in Christ shall all be made alive” (1 Cor. 15:22). “So
              death spread to all men” (Rom. 5:12).

              And so I say that some shall be alive at the time when Christ
              shall come for judgment, but in that moment they shall die and
              immediately afterwards they will rise. Because of the minimal time
              involved they are regarded as living. But then another problem
              presents itself because it is said:
              <i>and the dead in Christ will rise first</i>
              and
              <i>then we who are alive.</i>
              So it seems that the dead will rise before the living will meet
              Christ, and that the living will die when they meet Him. So it
              appears that some will rise ahead of these others, and that there
              will not be a resurrection of everyone at the same time. This is
              contrary, however, to what is found in 1 Cor. (15:22): “In a
              moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet.”

              Respondeo. Dicendum est, quod duplex est hic opinio: quidam enim
              dicunt quod resurrectio non erit simul, sed primo mortui venient
              cum Christo. Et tunc, in adventu Christi, vivi rapientur in
              nubibus, et in illo raptu morientur et resurgent. Et ideo quod
              dicitur esse in momento, intelligitur, quia in modico tempore
              fiet. Et si dicatur, quod erit in instanti, tunc non est hoc
              referendum ad totam resurrectionem omnium, sed ad resurrectionem
              singularium, quia singulus resurget in instanti. Alii vero dicunt
              quod omnes simul et in instanti resurgent. Quod ergo dicit:
              <i>resurgent primi</i>, denotat ordinem dignitatis, non temporis.
              Sed videtur hoc difficile, quia de vivis multi erunt probati in
              persecutione Antichristi, qui dignitate praecellent multos prius
              defunctos.

            <td>
              I wish to point out that there are two opinions on this matter.
              For some say that the resurrection will not take place at the same
              time for everybody, but that first the dead will come with Christ,
              and during the time that Christ is coming the living will be taken
              up into the clouds and they will die and rise while they are being
              taken up. So that what is said to happen in a moment may be
              understood as occurring in a brief amount of time. And if you
              insist that it will happen in an instant, then it should not be
              applied to the total resurrection of all, but rather to the
              resurrection of individuals, for every individual will rise in an
              instant. But there are others, who maintain that everyone will
              rise at the same time and in an instant. They feel that where Paul
              says
              <i>will rise first,</i>
              he denotes the order of dignity, not the order of time. This does
              seem difficult to maintain for many still alive will suffer in the
              persecution of the Antichrist and be more distinguished than those
              who had died before.

              Et ideo videtur aliter esse dicendum, quod omnes morientur et

              prius resurgent, quam isti, sed quod illi prius resurgent, quam
              isti occurrant. Apostolus enim non ponit ordinem resurrectionis ad
              resurrectionem, sed ordinem ad raptum, vel ad occurrentiam. Nam
              primo veniente domino morientur qui invenientur vivi, et tunc

              And so it seems necessary to answer the question in a different
              way, saying that all will die and all will rise at the same time.
              For the Apostle does not say that the dead will rise first and
              then the living, but that the dead will rise before the living
              will meet Christ. Therefore be is not speaking about the
              resurrection in terms of the order in which they shall rise, but
              of the order in which they will be taken up to meet Christ. For
              when the Lord does come, first those who are found alive will die
              and then, immediately together with those who had died before,
              they will rise up and be taken up into the clouds to meet Christ,
              as Paul clearly says.

              together” (Matt. 24:28). In the time of the resurrection the
              saints will be conformed to Christ, not only with regard to the
              glory of the body (Phil. 3), but also with respect to place, for
              Christ will be in a cloud. “A cloud took him out of their sight”
              (Ac. 1:9), and “Jesus will come in the same way as you saw him go
              into heaven” (Ac. 1:11). And so the saints too will be taken up

              show the glory of the saints. Or, the resplendent bodies of the
              glorified will appear as clouds to the evil people who will remain
              on earth. “Behold, the bridegroom! Come out to meet him” (Matt.

              In what he had written before, Paul corrected them in matters
              which needed to be improved upon, and now he begins to instruct
              them concerning the future. He first gives them a warning and then
              provides a prayer with the words,
              <i>may the God of peace himself sanctify you wholly.</i>
              These two things are indeed necessary for us. For the good deeds
              that we do are the result of free will, and so a man could profit
              from a warning. And since these deeds are also the result of
              grace, man needs prayer as well.

              Concerning the first point he does two things: Paul first urges
              the Thessalonians to prepare themselves for the coming judgment;
              secondly, he shows them how they should prepare themselves (5:11).
              In addition, he divides the first part into two: he points out a
              feature of the coming judgment and then he shows in what manner
              they ought to prepare themselves for the judgment (5:6). There is
              also a subdivision of the first section into two further parts
              that include this feature of the coming judgment and then an
              explanation (5:3). In the first part Paul puts to rest their
              concern for knowledge about the future coming, and then treats
              what they did know about it (5:2).

              First then, Paul says it was necessary for me to write about the
              preceding matters because you needed to know about them.
              <i>But as to the times,</i> that is, of summer, winter, or rather
              of what the future times will be, it was not necessary to write.
              Because certain of these things are reserved for only the divine
              knowledge: “But of that day or hour no one knows, neither the
              angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father” (Mk. 13:32).
              “It is not for you to know times or seasons which the Father has
              fixed by his own authority” (Ac. 1:7). “The more words, the more
              vanity, and what is man the better? For who knows what is good for
              man while be lives the few days of his vain life, which he passes
              like a shadow? (Ec,. 6:11). And so it is not necessary to write

              <i>When people say ‘there is peace,’</i>

              living tranquilly: “But they live in great strife due to
              ignorance, and they call such great evils peace” (Wis. 14:22).

              security to be had. There are two explanations for this. The one
              offered by Augustine is that at that time some shall be good, but
              they will be afflicted, they will mourn and they will wait
              expectantly; and this is referred to in the quotation as
              “fainting” because of the absence of pleasures and the
              multiplicity of evils. But there will be peace and security among

              Then when he says,

              unexpected, where he says:
              <i>sudden,</i> “like a break in a high wall,... whose crash comes
              suddenly, in an instant” (Is. 30:13). Secondly, he describes the
              peril as bringing death when he says
              <i>destruction.</i>
              [Destruction will tread upon him as a King” (Job 18:14)] Thirdly,
              he refers to the peril as distressing, and he uses the word
              <i>travail:</i> “Anguish as of a woman in travail” (Ps. 48:6).
              Fourthly, he presents the peril as inevitable when he comments:
              <i>and there will be no escape.</i>
              Now is the time to escape from the wrath of God to the mercy of
              God, for the end of the world will not be a time of mercy but of
              justice.

              and he does this by making two points: first, he excludes the good
              people from the company of the evil people and secondly, he
              provides a reason for this (5:5). And so he remarks, you
              <i>are not in darkness,</i>
              for you have been enlightened by Christ concerning that day; this
              is not an unexpected event for you. “He who follows me will not
              walk in darkness, but will have the light of life” (Jn. 8:12). And
              the reason for this is given at the words:
              <i>for you are all sons of light.</i>
              He also makes the point that they are the sons of the light
              <i>and of the day.</i>
              According to the Scriptures, someone is said to be the son of
              something because he abounds in that thing. “My beloved had a
              vineyard on a [hill, the son of oil, i.e., a] very fertile hill”
              (Is. 5:1), that is, it was land which was very rich. Those who
              participate to a great extent in the day and in the light are
              called their sons. And this light is the faith of Christ. “I am
              the light of the world” (Jn. 8:12), and again: “Believe in the
              light, that you may become sons of light!’ (Jn. 12:36).

              which is the brilliance of good actions. “The night is far gone,

              like a thief: “If the householder had known at what hour the thief
              was coming, he would have been awake” (Lk. 12:39). And so you know
              you ought to be vigilant. He adds: so

              day your Lord is coming” (Matt. 24:42). And to this end it is
              necessary that we
              <i>be sober</i>
              in order that both the body and the mind be sober, that is, free

              yourselves lest your hearts be weighed down with dissipation and
              drunkenness” (Lk. 21:34). “Be sober, be watchful” (I Pet. 5:8).
              And the reason for this is the suitability of a certain time;
              those who sleep or get drunk do so at night. But the night is not

              active. “When the sun I rises, they get them away and lie down in
              their dens” (Ps. 104:32). And again “Man goes forth to his work

              (Job 24:15). So sleep and drunkenness are suitable to nighttime,

              and the darkness of sin without having any regard for the future
              because of the love they have for present concerns. “They have

              Then when Paul says:
              <i>Let us put on the breastplate of faith,</i>
              he shows how they should prepare themselves through good actions.
              First, he sets down a general admonition, and then he issues a
              special admonition (5:11). He divides the first point into two
              aspects; he first sets down the admonition itself and then he
              gives a reason for it (5:9). There are in man two important parts
              of the body which were protected in wars-the heart, which is the
              source of life, and the head, which governs the body’s movements
              and is the seat of the senses and the center of the nervous
              system. The heart is protected by a breastplate and the head by a
              helmet. The life of the spirit in us is Christ, through whom the
              soul lives and the Lord dwells in us: “That Christ may dwell in
              your hearts through faith, that you, being rooted and grounded in
              love...” (Eph. 3:17). “He who abides in love abides in God, and
              God abides in him” (1 Jn. 4:16). Love gives life to faith. So we
              must have faith and love, and so Paul calls for
              <i>the breastplate of faith and love,</i>
              because it protects the vital parts of the body,
              <i>and for a helmet the hope of salvation,</i>
              for salvation is a spiritual motive force because it is the goal
              which we hope to attain.

              to be out of divine preordination and then as derived from the
              grace of Christ. Finally, Paul treats the manner in which
              salvation is to be achieved. He begins with the words,
              <i>God has not destined us,</i>
              that is, God has not appointed us: “(I) appointed you that you
              should go and bear fruit” (Jn.
              <i>15:16); for wrath,</i>
              that is, that we should deserve His wrath: “God did not make
              death” (Wis. 1:13). “Have I any pleasure in the death of the
              wicked, says the Lord God, and not rather that he should turn from
              his way and live? (Ez. 18:23).
              <i>But to obtain salvation</i>, that is, that we might acquire
              salvation, “From the days of John the Baptist until now the
              kingdom of heaven has suffered violence, and men of violence take
              it by force” (Matt. 11: 12). “But you are a chosen race, a royal
              priesthood, a holy nation, God’s own people” (1 Pet. 2:9). And
              this is achieved through Christ’s grace; hence he says,
              <i>through our Lord Jesus Christ.</i>
              “For there is no other name under heaven given among men by which
              we must be saved” (Ac. 4:12).

              peace.
              <i>Respect those who labor among you,</i>
              that is, acknowledge their work: “Remember your leaders, those who
              spoke to you the word of God” (Heb. 13:7). And I say that you
              shall respect them first on their own behalf, because of the great
              labours they have borne for you. And so be makes mention of
              <i>those who labour among you</i>
              for your good. “Take your share of suffering as a good soldier of
              Christ Jesus” (2 Tim. 2:3). Secondly, you shall respect them on
              behalf of God, and because of this reverence is due to them as it
              is due to God. And so Paul remarks:
              <i>and are over you in the Lord,</i>
              that is, in the place of God. “If I have forgiven anything, it has
              been for your sake in the presence of Christ” (2 Cor. 2:10).
              Thirdly, you shall respect them on your own behalf, because they
              are useful to you; hence he says:
              <i>and they admonish you.</i>
              Furthermore, you owe them charity; hence,
              <i>esteem them very highly in love,</i>
              that is, before others.

              reproves in the gate, and they abhor him who speaks the truth”
              (Am. 5: 10). “One who rejoices in wickedness will be condemned”
              (Sir. 19:5). Nevertheless, you should be at peace with them
              because of their work of correction, for this work properly
              belongs to their office. I am for peace; but when I speak, they
              are for war” (Ps. 120:7).

              afraid of failing. “Say to those who are of a fearful heart, Be

              is, either the mere misfortune of someone may be desired, and this

              dicit <i>semper gaudete</i>, scilicet de Deo, quia quicquid malum
              proveniat est incomparabile bono, quod est Deus. Et ideo nullum
              malum illud interrumpat; unde dicit <i>semper gaudete</i>.

              Then when Paul says:

              he shows how they ought to behave towards God; and he mentions
              three things. First, to rejoice in Him; and so Paul says,
              <i>rejoice always,</i>
              that is, in God; for whatever evil might occur, it is incomparable
              to the goodness which is God. Hence, no evil ought to interrupt
              it, and so Paul insists:
              <i>rejoice always.</i>
              Secondly, to pray for the blessings they want to receive. Paul
              urges,
              <i>pray constantly.</i>
              “They ought always to pray and not lose heart” (Lk. 18: 1).

              Sed quomodo potest hoc esse? Respondeo. Dicendum est, quod hoc
              potest esse tripliciter. Primo quod ille semper orat, qui statutas
              horas non intermittit. Simile habetur II Reg. c. IX, 7:
              <i>tu comedes panem in mensa mea semper</i>. Secundo sic: semper,
              id est, continue orate, sed tunc oratio sumitur pro effectu
              orationis. Est enim oratio interpretatio seu explicatio desiderii,
              quia quando desidero aliquid, tunc illud orando peto. Unde et
              oratio est petitio decentium a Deo, et ideo desiderium habet vim
              orationis. Ps. IX, 38:
              <i>desiderium pauperum exaudivit dominus</i>. Omnia ergo quae
              facimus, ex desiderio proveniunt. Ergo oratio in bonis quae
              facimus, manet in virtute, quia bona quae facimus, ex desiderio
              bono proveniunt. Glossa:
              <i>non cessat orare, qui non cessat benefacere</i>. Tertio quo ad
              causam orationis, scilicet faciendo eleemosynam. In vitis patrum:
              <i
                >ille semper orat, qui eleemosynas dat, quia qui eleemosynam
                accepit, orat pro te, etiam te dormiente</i
              >.
            </td>
            <td>
              How is this possible? It may happen in three ways. First, that
              person who does not neglect the appointed hours for prayer, prays
              always. “You shall eat at my table always” (2 Sam. 9:7). Secondly,
              “Pray constantly” means to pray continuously. But then prayer is
              considered under the aspect of the effect of the prayer. For
              prayer is the unfolding or expression of desire; for when I desire
              something, then I ask for it by praying. So prayer is the petition
              of suitable things from God; and so desire has the power of
              prayer. “O Lord, thou wilt hear the desire of the meek” (Ps. 10:
              17). Therefore, whatever we do is the result of a desire; so
              prayer always remains in force in the good things we do; for the
              good things we do flow forth from the desire of the good. There is
              a commentary on this verse pointing out: “He does not cease
              praying, who does not cease doing good.” A third way by which it
              is possible to pray without ceasing is through the giving of alms
              which may be a sort of cause of continual prayer. In the lives of
              the Fathers we read: “He who gives alms is the one who always
              prays, for the person who receives alms prays for you even when
              you are asleep.”

              not have a disdain for the gifts of God (5:20). The Holy Spirit is
              a divine, incorruptible and eternal person; and so He cannot be
              extinguished in His own substance. Nevertheless someone is said to
              quench the Spirit, in one way, by extinguishing the ardor for the
              Spirit either in himself or in somebody else. “Be aglow with the
              Spirit” (Rom. 12:11). For when somebody wishes to do something
              generous as a result of the impulse of the Holy Spirit, or even
              when some generous inclination arises, and the person impedes it,
              he extinguishes the Holy Spirit. “You always resist the Holy
              Spirit” (Ac. 7:51).

              On account of these words, certain people maintained that the
              spirit in man is one element and the soul another, thus positing
              two souls in man, that is, one which animates the body and another
              which carries on the function of reasoning. These opinions are
              rejected in the Church’s teaching. For it should be realized that
              these two elements [which are really one] do not differ
              essentially, but only by reason of the powers present in them.
              There are certain powers in our soul which are linked to bodily
              organs, such as the powers of the sensitive part of the soul. And
              there are other powers which are not linked to bodily organs, but
              function apart from the body, insofar as they are the powers of
              the intellectual part of the soul. The latter powers are regarded
              as spiritual powers in that they are immaterial and separated in
              some manner from the body in that they are not functions of the
              body but are referred to as the mind. “Be renewed in the spirit of
              your minds” (Eph. 4:23). Yet it is called the soul insofar as it
              animates the body, for this is proper to it. Paul speaks here in a
              specific sense.

              Nam ad peccandum tria concurrunt: ratio, sensualitas et executio
              corporis. Optat ergo, quod in nullo horum sit peccatum. Non in
              ratione; unde dicit
              <i>ut spiritus</i>, id est, mens vestra, servetur <i>integer</i>.
              In omni enim peccato ratio corrumpitur, secundum quod omnis malus
              est ignorans. Item nec in sensualitate, unde dicit <i>anima</i>.
              Item nec in corpore; et ideo dicit <i>et corpus</i>. Hoc autem fit
              sic, quando servatur immune a peccato.

              Now there are three elements involved in sin: reason, the
              sensitive appetite, and the actual actions of the body. Paul is
              anxious that all three of these areas be free of sin. Since he
              wants reason to be free of sin, he says:
              <i>may your spirit,</i>
              that is, your mind,
              <i>be kept sound.</i>
              For in every sin, reason is corrupted in the sense that every bad
              person is in some way ignorant. There should be no sin in the
              sensitive appetite either, and Paul refers to this when he says:
              <i>and soul.</i>
              Nor should there be sin in the body, and so Paul adds:
              <i>and body.</i>
              This, however, is achieved when the body is preserved immune from
              sin.

              Et dicit
              <i>sine querela</i>, non sine peccato, quod est solius Christi;
              sed esse sine querela est etiam aliorum, qui etsi venialia, non
              tamen committunt gravia, et quibus proximus scandalizatur. Lc. I,
              6:

                >incedentes in omnibus mandatis et iustificationibus domini sine

              Paul also says:
              <i>and blameless,</i>
              instead of “not without sin” which may be attributed only to
              Christ; but to be “blameless” may also be said of those who,
              although they may commit venial sins, nevertheless have not
              committed grave sins by which their fellow men may be scandalized.
              “Walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord
              blameless” (Lk. 1:6). And Paul adds,
              <i>at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ,</i>
              that is, persevering until the end of life. Or, perhaps the word
              <i>spirit</i>
              may refer to the gift of the Holy Spirit, as if implying: may the
              gift of the Holy Spirit which you have be unimpaired.

              Then when Paul says:

              he expresses the hope that his prayer will be heard, as if saying:

              <i>you will do it,</i>
              that is, He will accomplish it. “The Lord is faithful in all his

              Finally, Paul adds certain familiar admonitions as when he urges
              prayer:

              and mutual peace:
              <i>greet all the brethren with a holy kiss,</i>
              not a treacherous kiss as that of Judas (Matt. 26), nor a
              passionate kiss like that of the lustful woman in Proverbs (7:13).

              Paul feared that those in charge of the assembly might suppress it
              because of some of the things contained in it. “The people curse
              him who holds back grain, but a blessing is on the head of him who
              sells it” (Prov. 11:26).
