          <td>Rerum opifex Deus solo suae bonitatis intuitu cuncta in esse producens, naturalem boni amorem omnibus indidit creaturis, ut dum unaquaeque res bonum sibi conveniens naturaliter amat et appetit, quadam conversione mirabili in suum recurrere demonstretur auctorem.
          <td>God, the maker of everything, by a simple glance of his goodness, brought everything into being, and endowed all creatures with a natural love of goodness. Thus, as each thing naturally loves and desires the good that befits it, it displays a wonderful turn about and pursuit of its author.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sed in hoc praefertur ceteris rationalis natura, quod ipsum universalem bonitatis fontem per sapientiam intueri potest, et per caritatis amorem suaviter degustare: unde fit ut sapientiae bonum, quo ad ipsum fontem bonitatis accedimus, omnibus humanis bonis secundum rectae rationis iudicium praeferatur. Haec est enim quae fastidium nescit: ita ut qui eam edit, adhuc esuriat, et qui eam bibit, sitire non cesset. Haec est quae intantum peccato repugnat, ut qui secundum ipsam operantur, non peccent. Haec est quae indeficientem fructum suis ministris largitur, ut qui eam elucidant, vitam possideant sempiternam. Praecellit itaque voluptates dulcedine, securitate sedes et regna, utilitateque divitias universas.
          <td>But in this rational creatures excell, because through wisdom they can discern the very universal source of goodness, and through love which is charity they can taste its sweetness. Therefore, the gift of wisdom, by with we have access to the very fount of goodness, is, in the judgment of right reason, the highest of all human goods. Wisdom never grows stale. He who eats it, hungers for more. He who drinks it, never loses his thirst. Wisdom diametrically opposes sin; so those who act with it do not sin. It gives its workers never-ending fruit. Thus those who elucidate it possess eternal life. And it is sweeter than any pleasure, more secure than any office or rule, and more useful than all riches.

Verum quia, eo summo pontifice ex hac vita subtracto, tria Evangelia, Marci, Lucae et Ioannis exponenda restabant, ne opus quod obedientia inceperat, negligentia imperfectum relinqueret, cum multo labore diligens adhibui studium, ut quatuor Evangeliorum expositionem complerem, eadem in omnibus forma servata in ponendis sanctorum auctoritatibus et eorum nominibus praescribendis.
          <td>It has been my pleasure to take on the task of commenting on the wisdom of the Gospel, hidden for ages but brought to light by the incarnate Wisdom of God. I did this by compiling the views of the sacred doctors. Pope Urban IV, of holy memory, first entrusted me with this task. Although that Supreme Pontif has been taken from this life, the three gospels of Mark, Luke and John remained without commentary. I did not wish negligence to leave unfinished a work that obedience began. Therefore, I worked very hard to complete the commentary on the four gospels, following the same pattern of quoting texts from the saints and indicating their names.

          <td><span style="color:blue">Gloss</span> : Isaiah foretold the calling of the gentiles and the cause of their salvation, saying: My God has been my strength etc.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Hieronymus super Isaiam</b> : In quibus verbis ostenditur Christum appellari servum, inquantum est formatus ex utero; nam ante verba ista praemittitur: haec dicit dominus, formans me ex utero servum sibi. Fuerat siquidem voluntas patris, ut pessimi vinitores missum susciperent filium; unde de ipsis Christus ad discipulos loquitur: in viam gentium ne abieritis; sed ite magis ad oves perditas domus Israel. Quia igitur Israel non est reductus ad Deum, propterea Dei filius loquitur Iudaeis non credentibus, dicens Deus meus factus est fortitudo mea: qui et consolatus est me super abiectione populi mei, et dixit: parum est si servias mihi ad suscitandas tribus Iacob, quae suo vitio corruerunt, et ad faeces, sive reliquias, Israel convertendas; pro illis enim dedi te in lucem gentium omnium, ut illumines universum mundum, et salutem meam, per quam homines salvi fiunt, usque ad extrema terrae facias pervenire.
          <td><span style="color:blue">Jerome on Isaiah</span> : These words show that Christ is called a servant, in that he was formed from a womb. For, before these words, it is said: Thus says the Lord, forming me from the womb as his servant. It was the will of the Father that the very wicked vine dressers should receive the son who was sent. So Christ is telling his disciples about them: Do not go the way of the gentiles; go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. Because Israel was not subject to God, therefore, the Son of God speaks to the unbelieving Jews, saying that My God has been my strength, and he consoled me over my people's rejecting me. He saidj: It is not so important for you to serve me in resuscitating the tribes of Jacob who crashed by their wickedness, and to convert the remnant of Israel. In their place, I set you as a light for all nations, to enlighten the whole world, and make my salvation, which is for humanity's salvation, reach the ends of the earth.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Glossa</b> : Ex praemissis igitur verbis duo possumus colligere: quorum primum est divina virtus, quae fuit in Christo, ex qua efficax fuit ad gentium illuminationem; quia dicitur Deus meus factus est fortitudo mea. Deus igitur erat in Christo mundum reconcilians sibi, ut apostolus, dicit; unde et Evangelium, per quod credentes salvantur, virtus Dei est in salutem omni credenti, ut idem apostolus dicit. Secundum autem est illuminatio gentium et salus mundi ex dispositione patris per Christum completa: quia dicitur dedi te in lucem gentium: unde post resurrectionem suam dominus ut dispositionem patris impleret, ad praedicandum discipulos misit, dicens: docete omnes gentes, quorum quidam ad praedicandum Iudaeis, quidam ad praedicandum gentibus ministerium acceperunt. Quia vero Evangelium oportuit non solum praedicari propter praesentes, sed etiam scribi propter futuros, eadem distinctio est in scriptoribus Evangelii observata; nam Matthaeus Iudaeis Evangelium Hebraico sermone scripsit; Marcus autem primus Evangelium scripsit in gentibus.
          <td><span style="color:blue">Gloss</span> : We can make two conclusions from the preceding words: The first is that the divine power, which was in Christ, was capable of enlightening the nations —where it is said: My God is my strength. For God, as the Apostle said, was in Christ reconciling the world to himself. Therefore, the Gospel, by which believers are saved, is the power of God for the salvation of every believer, as the same Apostle says. The second is the enlightenment of the nations and the salvation of the world effected, by the disposition of the Father, through Christ —where it is said: I placed you as a light for the nations. Thus after his resurrection, to fulfil the disposition of the Father, the Lord sent the disciples to preach, saying: Teach all nations. Some of them took the ministry of preaching to the Jews, others that of preaching to the gentiles. Because the Gospel had not only to be preached to those of that time, but also to be written for future generations, the same distinction is found in the writers of the Gospel. For Matthew wrote in Hebrew for the Jews, Mark was the first to write the Gospel for the gentiles.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Eusebius in Eccl. Hist</b> : Cum enim Romanae urbi clarum verbi Dei lumen fuisset exortum, sermo veritatis et lucis, qui per Petrum praedicabatur, universorum mentes placido illustravit auditu; ita ut quotidie audientibus eum nulla unquam satietas fieret: unde neque eis auditio sola sufficiebat; sed Marcum discipulum eius omnibus precibus exorant, ut ea quae ille verbo praedicabat, ad perpetuam eorum commonitionem habendam Scripturae traderet, quo domi forisque in huiusmodi verbi meditationibus permanerent; nec prius ab obsecrando desistunt quam quae oraverant, impetrarent: et haec fuit causa scribendi Evangelium secundum Marcum. Petrus vero ut per spiritum sanctum religioso se comperit furto spoliatum, delectatus est, fidem eorum per hoc devotionemque considerans; factumque confirmavit et in perpetuum legendam Scripturam Ecclesiis tradidit.
          <td><span style="color:blue">Eusebius, Ecclesiastical History</span> : Since the clear light of the word of God rose on the city of Rome, the story of truth and light, which was preached by Peter, instructed the minds of all by its pleasing sound. Thus every day those who heard it never heard enough. It was not enough just to hear it, but they begged the disciple Mark to put into writing what Peter preached orally, to have a perpetual record of it, which they could always meditate both at home and outside. They did not give up pressing him, until they got what they asked for. This was what led to the writing of the Gospel according to Mark. Peter, who by the Holy Spirit found himself subjected to a religious theft, was delighted, considering their faith and devotion. So he ratified what was done, and bequeathed this to the churches as Scripture to be read forever.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Hieronymus super Marcum</b> : Principium autem a perfectioris aetatis Christi praedicatione inchoat, nec laborat in nativitate infantuli qui loquitur de perfectione filii Dei.
          <td><span style="color:blue">Jerome on Mark</span> : The Gospel begins from the preaching of Christ as an adult. It does not concern itself with the birth of the little chile, since it speaks of the perfection of the Son of God.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b> : Compendiosam autem ac brevem narrationem facit, in quo magistrum imitatus est, scilicet Petrum, brevitati studentem.
          <td><span style="color:blue">Chrysostom</span> : His narration is a short summary, wherein he imitates his master, Peter, who always tried to be brief.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Cons. Evang</b> : Unde Matthaeus qui regiam Christi personam narrandam susceperat, habuit Marcum sibi tamquam comitem et abbreviatorem adiunctum, qui sua vestigia quodammodo sequeretur: regum enim est non esse sine comitum obsequio. Sacerdos autem quoniam in sancta sanctorum solus intrabat, propterea Lucas, cuius circa sacerdotium Christi erat intentio, non habuit tamquam socium obsequentem, qui suam narrationem quodammodo breviaret.
          <td><span style="color:blue">Augustine, Consistency of the Gospels</span> : Matthew, who described the royal person of Christ, had Mark as an associate and summarizer. In this respect he followed his example, for kings are never without assistants who wait on them. But since a priest enters the Holy of Holies alone, Luke, who was concerned with the priesthood of Christ, did not have an assistant to summarize his narration.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b> : Notandum est etiam, quod Evangelistae sancti diversum narrationis suae primordium, singuli diversum statuere terminum. Matthaeus namque a nativitate dominica exordium sumens, ad tempus usque dominicae resurrectionis seriem suae narrationis perduxit; Marcus ab initio evangelicae praedicationis incipiens, pervenit usque ad tempus ascensionis domini et praedicationis discipulorum eius cunctis gentibus per orbem; Lucas autem a nativitate praecursoris inchoans Evangelium, terminavit in ascensione dominica; Ioannes ab aeternitate verbi Dei principium sumens, usque ad tempus dominicae resurrectionis evangelizando pertingit.
          <td><span style="color:blue">Bede</span> : Note that the Holy Evangelists had different beginnings of their story, and different endings. Matthew started from the birth of the Lord and continued until the resurrection. Mark started with the beginning of the evangelical preaching and reached the ascension of the Lord and the preaching of the disciples to all nations of the world. Luke began from the birth of the Precursor, and ended with the Lord's ascension. John began with the eternity of the Word of God, and continued his preaching up to the time of the Lord's resurrection.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Ambrosius super Lucam</b> : Quia igitur Marcus a potentiae coeperat expressione divinae, recte sub leonis imagine figuratur.
          <td><span style="color:blue">Ambrose, on Luke</span> : Because Mark began with the manifestation of divine power, he is rightly depicted as a lion.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Remigius super Marcum</b> : Per leonem etiam signatur Marcus: quia sicut leo terribilem vocem in deserto emittit, sic Marcus a voce in deserto incepit, dicens: vox clamantis in deserto.
          <td><span style="color:blue">Remigius, on Mark</span> : The lion designates Mark, because, as the lion lets out a terrible cry in the desert, so Mark began with a voice in the desert, saying: The voice of one crying in the desert.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Cons. Evang</b> : Quamvis et de figura aliter dici possit. Marcus enim qui neque stirpem regiam ut Matthaeus, ob hoc per leonem significatus, neque sacerdotalem ut Lucas signatus per vitulum, vel cognationem vel consecrationem narrare voluit; et tamen in eis versatus ostenditur quae homo Christus operatus est, per hominis figuram in illis quatuor animalibus signatus videtur.
          <td><span style="color:blue">Augustine, on the Consistency of the Gospels</span> : Yet another explanation is possible. For Mark, unlike Matthew who gave a royal genealogy, is depicted as a lion. Nor did he describe his priesthood, as Luke did, who is depicted as a bull. Nor did he narrate his relatives or consecration, but was concerned with what Christ did as a man; therefore he seems to deserve the figure of a man, among those four animals.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus (in Evang. Marci)</b> : Vel Evangelium secundum Marcum aquila innuit: a prophetia enim Ioannis incepit. Prophetia vero acute quae a longe sunt, speculatur ut aquila. Catena in Mc., cap. 1 l. 1
          <td><span style="color:blue">Theophylactus, on Mark</span> : Or the eagle fits the Gospel according to Mark , because it begins with the prophecy of John. But prophecy sees sharply what is far away, like an eagle.

          <td><span style="color:blue">Pseudo-Jerome</span> : The Greek word 'Evangelium' means good tidings, in Latin it is explained, 'bona annunciatio,' or, the good news; these terms properly belong to the kingdom of God and to the remission of sins; for the Gospel is that by which comes the redemption of the faithful and the beatitude of the saints. But the four Gospels are one, and one Gospel in four. In Hebrew, His name is Jesus, in Greek, Soter, in Latin, Salvator; but men say Christus in Greek, Messias in Hebrew, Unctus in Latin, that is, King and Priest.

Conferendum autem est hoc Evangelii principium principio Matthaei quo ait: liber generationis Iesu Christi filii David, filii Abraham; hic autem dicitur filii Dei: ex utroque enim unus dominus Iesus Christus Dei et hominis filius est intelligendus. Et apte primus Evangelista filium hominis eum, secundus filium Dei nominat, ut a minoribus ad maiora paulatim sensus noster assurgeret, ac per fidem et sacramenta humanitatis assumptae, ad agnitionem divinae aeternitatis ascenderet. Apte etiam qui humanam erat generationem descripturus a filio hominis coepit, David scilicet, sive Abraham; apte etiam is qui librum suum ab initio evangelicae praedicationis inchoabat, filium Dei magis appellare voluit Iesum Christum, quia humanae erat naturae de progenie patriarcharum veritatem carnis suscipere, et divinae fuit potentiae Evangelium mundo praedicare.
          <td><span style="color:blue">Bede</span> , in Marc., i, 1: The beginning of this Gospel should be compared with that of Matthew, in which it is said, "The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the Son of Abraham." But here He is called "the Son of God." Now from both we must understand one Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, and of man. And fitly the first Evangelist names Him "Son of man," the second, "Son of [p. 6] God," that from less things our sense may by degrees mount up to greater, and by faith and the sacraments of the human nature assumed, rise to the acknowledgment of His divine eternity. Fitly also did He, who was about to describe His human generation, begin with a son of man, namely, David or Abraham. Fitly again, he who was beginning his book with the first preaching of the Gospel, chose rather to call Jesus Christ, "the Son of God;" for it belonged to the human nature to take upon Him the reality of our flesh, of the race of the patriarchs, and it was the work of Divine power to preach the Gospel to the world.

At once, by one and the same beginning of his Gospel, he prepared the Jews, who had received the Law and the Prophets, for receiving the grace of the Gospel, and those sacraments, which their own prophecies had foretold; and he also calls upon the Gentiles, who came to the Lord by publishing of the Gospel, to receive and venerate the authority of the Law and the Prophets; whence he says, "As it is written in the prophet Isaiah, Behold, &amp;c."

Otherwise it may be said that he has compressed [p. 7] into one, two prophecies delivered in different places by two prophets; for in the prophet Isaiah it is written after the story of Hezekiah, "The voice of one crying in the wilderness;" but in Malachi, "Behold, I send mine angel." The Evangelist therefore, taking parts of two prophecies, has put them down as spoken by Isaiah, and refers them here to one passage, without mentioning, however, by whom it is said, "Behold, I send mine angel."

In utraque autem sententia similiter paranda via domini praedicatur. Potuit autem fieri ut animo Marci Evangelium conscribentis pro Malachia Isaias occurrerit, ut fieri solet; quod tamen sine ulla dubitatione emendaret, saltem ab aliis admonitus, qui ipso adhuc in carne vivente legere potuerunt; nisi cogitaret, recordationi suae, quae sancto spiritu regebatur, non frustra occurrisse aliud pro alio nomen prophetae.

For that which Malachi has called, the angel to be sent before the face of the Lord, to prepare His way, is the same thing as Isaiah has said is to be heard, "the voice of one crying in the wilderness, saying, Prepare ye the way of the Lord." But in each sentence alike, the way of the Lord to be prepared is proclaimed. It may be, too, that Isaiah occurred to the mind of Mark, in writing his Gospel, instead of Malachi, as often happens; which he would, however, without doubt correct, at least when reminded by other persons, who might read his work whilst he was yet in the flesh; unless he though that, since his memory was then ruled by the Holy Spirit, it was not without a purpose that the name of one prophet had occurred to him instead of another. For thus whatsoever things the Holy Spirit spoke by the prophets are implied each to have belonged to all, and all to each.

(in Joan, ii, 25.) v Huet, Orig. II, qu. 5, No. 14, 24, 25], but by the dignity [p. 8] of his office; for angel in Greek is in Latin, nuntius (note: messenger), by which name that man is rightly called, who was sent by God, that he might bear witness of the light, and announce to the world the Lord, coming in the flesh; since it is evident that all who are priests may be their office of preaching the Gospel be called angels, as the prophet Malachi says, "The lips of the priest keep knowledge, and they seek the law at his mouth, because he is the Angel of the Lord of hosts."

Thus catechumens, (which word means persons instructed,) begin by the ministry of the priest, receive the chrism from the bishop [ed. note: "Chrismantur." Chrism in the Roman Church, was applied twice; at Baptism, and more solemnly to the forehead by the Bishop at Confirmation. In the Eastern Church, it was only given once, at Confirmation, and by the Bishop only.

For such is the nature of locusts, leaping on high and again falling. In the same way the people ate honey, which had come from bees, that is, from the prophets; it was not however domestic, but wild, for the Jews had the Scriptures, which are as honey, but did not rightly understand them.

For the Jews leaped up when they promised to fulfil the precepts of the Lord; but they fell to the ground when, by their evil works, they affirmed that they had not heard them.

[Gal 5:24] He used to eat locusts and wild honey, because his preaching had some sweetness for the multitude, whilst the people debated whether he was the Christ himself or not; but this soon came to an end, when his hearers understood that he was not the Christ, but the forerunner and prophet of Christ.

And indeed the Evangelists following the order of the narrative, and not able to err in any thing, say that John spoke each of these sayings in a different sense. But commentators on this passage have expounded each in a different way. For he means by the latchet, the tie of the shoe. He says this therefore to extol the excellence of the power of Christ, and the greatness of His divinity; as if he said, Not even in the station of his servant am I worthy to be reckoned. For it is a great thing to contemplate, as it were stooping down, those things which belong to the body of Christ, and to see from below the image of things above, and to untie each of those mysteries, about the Incarnation of Christ, which cannot be unravelled.

Rightly then does he proclaim himself unworthy to loose his shoe-latchet, as if he said openly, I cannot [p. 14] make bare the feet of the Redeemer, for I usurp not the name of the Bridegroom, a thing which is above my deserts.

Etsi enim Deus permittat tentationes fieri multis aliis modis, ob hoc etiam permittit, ut cognoscas quod homo tentatus in maiori honore constituitur: non enim accedit Diabolus nisi ubi aliquem in maiori honore viderit constitutum; et ideo dicitur et statim expulit eum spiritus in desertum. Propter hoc autem non ostendit eum simpliciter euntem in desertum, sed expulsum, ut hoc intelligas fieri iuxta divinae dispositionis verbum: per quod etiam innuit ne homo seipsum in tentationem ingerat, sed aliunde in tentationem quasi expulsos victores existere.
          <td><span style="color:blue">Chrys</span> ., Hom. in Matt., xiii: Because all that Christ did and suffered was for our teaching, He began after His baptism to dwell in the wilderness, and fought against the devil, that every baptized person might patiently sustain greater temptations after His baptism, nor be troubled, as if this which happened to Him was contrary to His expectation, but might bear up against all things, and come off conqueror. For although God allows that we should be tempted for many other reasons, yet for this cause also He allows it, that we may know, that man when tempted is placed in a station of greater honour. For the Devil approaches not save where he has [p. 18] beheld one set in a place of greater honour; and therefore it is said, "And immediately the Spirit drove Him into the wilderness." And the reason why He does not simply say that He went into the wilderness, but was driven, is that thou mayest understand that it was done according to the word of Divine Providence. By which also He shews that no man should thrust himself into temptation, but that those who from some other state are as it were driven into temptation, remain conquerors.

Whence it follows, "And He was in the wilderness forty days and forty nights, and was tempted of Satan." For "the forty days and forty nights" imply the whole time of this world, for the globe in which we are serving God is divided into four quarters.

We must therefore understand that the transaction which Luke intimates happened first, and afterwards that they, as their custom was, had returned to their fishing. So that what Mark here relates happened afterwards; for in this case they followed the Lord, without drawing their boats ashore, (which they would have done had they meant to return,) and followed Him, as one calling them, and ordering them to follow.

For Adam, our forefather according to the flesh, is clothed with the skins of dead beasts; but now, having put off the old man, with his deeds, following the new man we are clothed with those skins of Solomon, with which the bride rejoices that she has been made beautiful [Song of Songs, 1:4].

This man with an unclean spirit is the human race, in which uncleanness reigned from Adam to Moses; [Rom 5:14] for "they sinned without law," and "perished without law." [Rom 2:12] and he, knowing the Holy One of God, is ordered to hold his peace, for they "knowing God did not glorify him as God," [Rom 1:21] but "rather served the creature than the Creator." [Rom 1:25] The spirit tearing the man came out of him. When salvation is near, temptation is at hand also. Pharaoh, when about to let [ed. note: Al.

Neque vero in pristinis vitiis permanentes publicani veniunt ad Iesum, ut Pharisaei et Scribae; sed poenitentiam agentes, ut sequens Evangelistae sermo designat, dicens erant enim multi qui sequebantur eum.

They who had seen that the publican, converted from his sins to better things, had found a place of pardon, even for this reason themselves also do not despair of salvation. And they come to Jesus, not remaining in their former sins, as the Pharisees and Scribes complain, but in penitence, as the following words of the Evangelist shew, saying, "For there were many who followed Him." For the Lord went to the feasts of sinners, that He might have an opportunity of teaching them, and might set before His entertainers spiritual meats, which also is carried on in mystical figures. For he who receives Christ into his inward habitation [p. 46] is fed with the highest delights of overflowing pleasures. Therefore the Lord enters willingly, and takes up His abode in the affection of him who hath believed on Him; and this is the spiritual banquet of good works, which the rich cannot have, and on which the poor feast.

He calls Himself the physician, Who, by a strange mode of healing, was wounded on account of our iniquities, and by His wound we are healed. And He calls those whole and righteous, who, wishing to establish their own righteousness, are not subject to the righteousness of God. Moreover He calls those rich and sinners, who, overcome by the consciousness of their own frailty, and seeing that they cannot be justified by the Law, submit their necks to the grace of Christ by repentance. Wherefore it is added, "For I came not to call the righteous, but sinners, &amp;c."

But that He might destroy their elation of heart, and shew that He intended not His own disciples to be licentious, He adds, "But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken, &amp;c." as if He said, The time will come, when they will shew their firmness; for when the Bridegroom shall be taken from them, they will fast as longing for His coming, and in order to unite to Him their spirits, cleansed by bodily suffering. He shews also that there is no necessity for His disciples to fast, as having present with them the Bridegroom of human nature, Who every where executes the words of God, and Who gives the seed [p. 49] of life. The sons of the Bridegroom also cannot, because they are infants, be entirely conformed to their Father, the Bridegroom, Who, considering their infancy, deigns to allow them not to fast: but when the Bridegroom is gone, they will fast, through desire of Him; when they have been made perfect, they will be united to the Bridegroom in marriage, and will always feast at the king's banquet.

          <td><span style="color:blue">Bede</span> : And anticipating the calumny of the Jews, which they had prepared for Him, He accused them of violating the precepts of the law, by a wrong interpretation. Wherefore there follows: "And He saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath-day, or to do evil?" And this He asks, because they thought that on the sabbath they were to rest even from good works, whilst the law commands to abstain from bad, saying, "Ye shall do no servile work therein;" [Lev 23:7] that is, sin: for "Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin." [John 8:34] What He first says, "to do good on the sabbath-day or to do evil," is the same as what He afterwards adds, "to save a life or to lose it;" that is, to cure a man or not. Not that God, Who is in the highest degree good, can be the author of perdition to us, but that His not saving is in the language of Scripture to destroy. but if it be asked, wherefore the Lord, being about to cure the body, asked about the saving of the soul, let him understand either that in the common way of Scripture the soul is put for the man; as it is said, "All the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob;" [Ex 1:5] or because He did those miracles for the saving of a soul, or because the healing itself of the hand signified the saving of the soul.

Therefore we must understand that they first asked the Lord, if it was lawful to heal on the sabbath-day, then that understanding their thoughts, and that they were seeking an opportunity to accuse Him, He placed in the middle him whom He was about to cure, and put those questions, which Mark and Luke relate.

But not only devils, but persons healed by Christ, and even Apostles, are ordered to be silent concerning Him before the Passion, lest by the preaching of the majesty of His Divinity, the economy of His Passion should be retarded. But allegorically, in the Lord's coming out of the synagogue, and then retiring to the sea, He prefigured the salvation of the Gentiles, to whom He deigned to come through their faith, having quitted the Jews on account of their perfidy. For the nations, driven about in divers by-paths of error, are fitly compared to the unstable sea. [ed. note: see Cyprian, Ep. 63, also Augustine, City of God, Book 20, 16] Again, a great crowd from various provinces followed Him, because He has received with kindness many nations, who came to Him through the preaching of the Apostles. But the ship waiting upon the Lord in the sea is the Church, collected from amongst the nations; and He goes into it lest the crowd should throng Him, because flying from the troubled minds of carnal persons, He delights to come to those who despise the glory of this world, and to dwell within them. Further, there is a difference between thronging the Lord, and touching Him; for they throng Him, when by carnal thoughts and deeds they trouble peace, in which truth dwells; but he touches Him, who by faith and love has received Him into his heart; wherefore those who touched Him are said to have been saved.

No man can enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his house. 28.

Quasi diceret: regnum contra se intestino bello divisum necesse est desolari: quod et in domo et in civitate videtur. Quocirca etsi Satanae regnum in seipsum divisum est, ita quod Satanas ab hominibus repellat Satanam, desolatio regni Daemonum appropinquavit; regnum autem eorum est in hoc quod homines subditos teneant. Si igitur ab hominibus pelluntur, hoc non est aliud quam regnum eorum dissolvi.

Wherefore it says, "And having called them together unto Him, He said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?" As if He had said, A kingdom divided against itself by civil war must be desolated, which is exemplified both in a house and in a city. Wherefore also if Satan's kingdom by divided against itself, so that Satan expels Satan from men, the desolation of the kingdom of the devils is at hand. But their kingdom consists in keeping men under their dominion. If therefore they are driven away from men, it amounts to nothing less [p. 66] than the dissolution of their kingdom. But if they still hold their power over men, it is manifest that the kingdom of evil is still standing, and Satan is not divided against himself.

          <td><span style="color:blue">Bede</span> , in Marc., 1, 17: The Lord has also bound the strong man, that is, the devil: which means, He has restrained him from seducing the elect, and entering into his house, the world; He has spoiled his house, and his goods, that is men, because He has snatched them from the snares of the devil, and has united them to His Church. Or, He has spoiled his house, because the four parts of the world, over which the old enemy had sway, He has distributed to the Apostles and their successors, that they may convert the people to the way of life. But the Lord shews that they committed a great sin in crying out that which they knew to be of God, was of the devil, when He subjoins, "Verily, I say unto you, All sins are forgiven, &amp;c." All sins and blasphemies are not indeed remitted to all men, but to those who have gone through a repentance in this life sufficient for their sins; thus neither is Novatus right [ed. note: Novatus was a Carthaginian presbyter, who, after having abetted Felicissimus in his schism against St. Cyprian, came to Rome and joined Novatian against Pope Cornelius, A.D. 251. His error, which is here opposed to Origen's, consisted in denying that Christ had left with His Church the power of absolving from certain sins, especially from apostasy.], who denied that any pardon should be granted to penitents, who had lapsed in time of martyrdom; nor Origen, who asserts that after the general judgment, after the revolution of ages, all sinners will receive pardon for their sins, which error the following words of the Lord condemn, when He adds, "But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost, &amp;c." [p. 67]

Blasphemia autem in spiritum sanctum contra Deum fit. Est enim spiritus sancti operatio regnum Dei, et propter hoc irremissibilem dicit esse spiritus sancti blasphemiam. Pro eo autem quod hic subditur sed erit reus aeterni delicti, alius Evangelista dicit: neque in hoc saeculo, neque in futuro: per quod intelligitur iudicium quod est secundum legem et futurum. Cum enim lex maledicentem Deum occidi iubeat, in hoc legis secundae excusationem non habet: omnis autem qui baptizatur, extra hoc saeculum fit. Latebat autem Iudaeos remissio quae fit per Baptismum. Qui ergo miracula et Daemonum eiectionem, quae solum sunt propria spiritus sancti, Daemoni appropriat, nulla excusatio sibi de blasphemia relinquetur.

          <td><span style="color:blue">Pseudo-Chrys</span> ., Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: He says indeed, that blasphemy concerning Himself was pardonable, because He then seemed to be a man despised and of the most lowly birth, but, that contumely against God has no remission. Now blasphemy against the Holy Ghost is against God, for the operation of the Holy Ghost is the kingdom of God; and for this reason, He says, that blasphemy against the Holy Ghost cannot be remitted. Instead, however, of what is here added, "But will be in danger of eternal damnation," another Evangelist says, "Neither in this world, nor in the world to come." By which is understood, the judgment which is according to the law, and that which is to come. For the law orders one who blasphemes God to be slain, and in the judgment of the second law he has no remission. However, he who is baptized is taken out of this world; but the Jews were ignorant of the remission which takes place in baptism. [ed. note: A few words are left out in the Catena, which occur in Victor, and which do away with the obscurity of the passage. The missing of the whole is, that though there is no remission either in this world or in the next, yet that baptism is, as it were, a space between the two worlds, where remission can be obtained. The reason, therefore, why this blasphemy could not be remitted, was, because the Jews would not come to Christ's baptism.] He therefore who refers to the devil miracles, and the casting out of devils which belong to the Holy Ghost alone, has no room left him for remission of his blasphemy. Neither does it appear that such a blasphemy as this is remitted, since it is against the Holy Ghost. Wherefore he adds, explaining it, "Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit."

Nam alio loco dixerunt Iudaei de domino, quod Daemonium haberet; nec tamen ibi aliquid dixit de blasphemia spiritus sancti: quoniam non ita obiecerunt spiritum immundum ut in se divisus ex ore eorum posset ostendi, sicut Beelzebub, a quo Daemones eici posse dixerunt.
          <td><span style="color:blue">Augustine</span> , Serm., 71, 12, 22: Or else impenitence itself is the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost which hath no remission. For either in his thought [p. 68] or by his tongue, he speaks a word against the Holy Ghost, the forgiver of sins, who treasures up for himself an impenitent heart. But he subjoins, "Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit," that he might shew that His reason for saying it, was their declaring that He cast out a devil by Beelzebub, not because there is a blasphemy, which cannot be remitted, since even this might be remitted through a right repentance; but the cause why this sentence was put forth by the Lord, after mentioning the unclean spirit, (who as our Lord shews was divided against himself,) was, that the Holy Ghost even makes those whom He brings together undivided, by His remitting those sins, which divided them from Himself, which gift of remission is resisted by no one, but him who has the hardness of an impenitent heart. For in another place, the Jews said of the Lord, that He had a devil [John 7:20], without however His saying any thing there about the blasphemy against the Spirit; and the reason is, that they did not there cast in His teeth the unclean spirit, in such a way, that spirit could by their own words be shewn to be divided against Himself, as Beelzebub was here shewn to be, by their saying, that it might be he who cast out devils. [ed. note: St. Augustine explains his meaning by going on to say, that as the Devil was proved by the words of the Jews to be the author of division, so the Holy Ghost was the author of unity, so that one form of blasphemy of the Holy Ghost was rending the unity of the Church, without which there is no remission. St. Ambrose, something in the same way, applies the text to the Arians, as dividing the Holy Trinity, de Fide, i, 1.]

But the stony places, which have no strength for fixing the root firmly, are those breasts which are delighted only with the sweetness of the word which they hear, and for a time with the heavenly promises, but in a season of temptation fall away, for there is too little of healthful desire in them to conceive the seed of life.

But in spiritual things it is not so; for there it is possible that stony ground may become fertile; and that the road should not be trodden down, and that the thorns may be destroyed, for if this could not take place, he would not have sown there.

For there are some to whom no faith, no intellect, nay no opportunity of trying its usefulness, can give a perception of the word which they hear; of whom He says, "And these are by the wayside." For unclean spirits take away at once the word committed to their hearts, as birds carry away the seed of the trodden way. There are some who both experience its usefulness and feel a desire for it, but some of them the calamities of this world frighten, and others its prosperity allures, so that they do not attain to that which they approve. Of the first of whom He says, "And these are they who fell on stony ground;" of the latter, "And these are they which are sown among thorns." But riches are called thorns, because they tear the soul with the piercing of its own thoughts, and after bringing it to sin, they, as one may say, make it bleed by inflicting a wound. Again He says, "And the toil of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches;" for the man who is deceived by an empty desire of riches must soon be afflicted by the toils of continual cares. He adds, "And the lusts of other things;" because, whosoever despises the commandments of God, and wanders away lustfully seeking other things, is unable to attain to the joy of beatitude. And concupiscences of this sort choke the word, because they do not allow a good desire to enter into the heart, and, as it were, stifle the [p. 78] entrance of vital breath. There are, however, excepted from these different classes of men, the Gentiles who do not even have grace to hear the words of life.

Per hoc ergo datur intelligi quod sicut rex aliquis potest comminatione violentos comprimere, et suis edictis murmur subiecti populi mitigare, ita Christus rex universae creaturae existens, sua comminatione ventorum cohibuit violentiam, et mari taciturnitatem indixit: et statim est effectus secutus; sequitur enim et cessavit ventus, cui scilicet fuerat comminatus, et facta est tranquillitas magna; scilicet in mari, cui taciturnitatem indixerat.
          <td><span style="color:blue">Gloss</span> .: For from the troubling of the sea there arises a certain sound, which appears to be its voice threatening danger, and therefore, by a sort of metaphor, He fitly commands tranquility by a word signifying silence: just as in the restraining of the winds, which trouble the sea with their violence, He uses a rebuke. For men who are in power are accustomed to curb those, who rudely disturb the peace of mankind, by threatening to punish them; by this, therefore, we are given to understand, that, as a king can repress violent [p. 87] men by threats, and by his edicts sooth the murmurs of his people, so Christ, the King of all creatures, by His threats restrained the violence of the winds, and compelled the sea to be silent. And immediately the effect followed, for it continues, "And the wind ceased," when He had threatened, "and there arose a great calm," that is, in the sea, to which He had commanded silence.

          <td>There follows, "And they feared with a great fear, and said one to another, &amp;c." For they were in doubt about Him, for since He stilled the sea, not with a rod like Moses, nor with prayers as Elisha at the Jordan, nor with the ark as Joshua, the son of Nun, on this account they thought Him truly God, but since He was asleep, they thought Him a man.

The pillow is the body of the Lord, on which His Divinity, which is as His head, has come down. But the wind and the sea are devils and persecutors, to whom He says Peace, when He restrains the edicts of impious kings, as He will. The great calm is the peace of the Church after oppression, or a contemplative after an active life.

The other ships which are said to have been with the Lord signify those who are imbued with faith in the cross of Christ, and are not beaten about by the whirlwind of tribulation; or who, after the storms of temptation, are enjoying the serenity of peace. And whilst His disciples are sailing on, Christ is asleep, because the time of our Lord's Passion came on His faithful ones when they were meditating on the rest of His future reign. Wherefore it is related, that it took place late, that not only the sleep of our Lord, but the hour itself of departing [p. 88] light might signify the setting of the true Sun. Again, when He ascended the cross, of which the stern of the ship was a type, His blaspheming persecutors rose like the waves against Him, driven on by the storms of the devils, by which, however, His own patience is not disturbed, but His foolish disciples are stuck with amazement. The disciples awake the Lord, because they sought, with most earnest wishes, the resurrection of Him whom they had seen die. Rising up, He threatened the wind, because when He had triumphed in His resurrection, He prostrated the pride of the devil. He ordered the sea to be still, that is, in rising again, He cast down the rage of the Jews. The disciples are blamed, because after His resurrection, He chided them for their unbelief. And we also when being marked with the sign of the Lord's cross, we determine to quit the world, embark in the ship with Christ; we attempt to cross the sea; but, He goes to sleep, as we are sailing amidst the roaring of the waters, when amidst the strivings of our virtues, or amidst the attacks of evil spirits, of wicked men, or of our own thoughts, the flame of our love grows cold. Amongst storms of this sort, let us diligently strive to awake Him; He will soon restrain the tempest, pour down peace upon us, give us the harbour of salvation.

The virtues indeed of the Saviour do not go out of Him locally or corporally, nor in any respect pass away from Him. For being incorporeal, they go forth to others and are given to others; they are not however separated from Him, from whom they are said to go forth, in the same way as sciences are given by the teacher to his pupils. Therefore it says, "Jesus, knowing in Himself the virtue which had gone out of Him," to shew that with His knowledge, and not without His being aware of it, the woman was healed. But He asked, "Who touched me?" although He knew her who touched Him, that He might bring to light the woman, by her coming forward, and proclaim her faith, and lest the virtue of His miraculous work should be consigned to oblivion.

Tenens autem puellae manum dominus eam suscitavit: quia nisi prius mundate fuerint manus Iudaeorum, quae sanguine plenae sunt, synagoga mortua non resurget. In sanatione autem haemorrhoissae mulieris, et suscitatione puellae, salus ostenditur generis humani, quae a domino ita dispensata est, ut primo aliqui ex Israel ad fidem venirent, deinde plenitudo gentium intraret, ac sic omnis Israel salvus fieret. Annorum autem duodecim erat puella, et annis duodecim mulier erat passa: quia peccata non credentium apparuerunt in initio fidei credentium: unde dicitur: credidit Abraham Deo, et reputatum est ei ad iustitiam.
          <td><span style="color:blue">Bede</span> : Mystically; the woman was cured of a bloody flux, and immediately after the daughter of the ruler of the synagogue is reported to be dead, because as soon as the Church of the Gentiles is washed from the stain of vice, and called daughter by the merits of her faith, at once the synagogue is broken up on account of its zealous treachery and envy; treachery, because it did not choose to believe in Christ; envy, because it was vexed at the faith of the Church. What the messengers told the ruler of the synagogue, "Why troublest thou the Master any more," is said by those in this day who, seeing the state of the synagogue, deserted by God, believe that it cannot be restored, and therefore think that we are not to pray that it should be restored. But if the ruler of the synagogue, that is, the assembly of the teachers of the Law, determine to believe, the synagogue also, which is subjected to them, will be saved. Further, because the synagogue lost the joy of having Christ to dwell in it, as its faithlessness deserved, it lies dead as it were, amongst persons weeping and wailing. Again, our Lord raised the damsel by taking hold of her hand, because the hands of the Jews, which are full of blood, must first be cleansed, else the synagogue, which is dead, cannot rise again. But in the woman with the bloody flux, and the raising of the damsel, is shewn the salvation of the human race, which was so ordered by the Lord, that first some from Judaea, then the fulness of the Gentiles, might come in, and so all Israel might be saved. Again, the damsel was twelve years old, and the woman had suffered for twelve years, because the sinning of unbelievers was contemporary with the beginning of the faith of believers. Wherefore it is said, "Abraham believed on God, and it was counted to him for righteousness." [Gen 15:6] [ed. note: Bede's own words are rather more clear than those in the Catena: "That is, the woman began to be afflicted at the same time as the damsel was born; for nearly at the same period of the world the synagogue began to arise amongst the patriarchs, and the race of Gentiles throughout the world to be polluted with idolatry."] [p. 104]

          <td><b>Beda</b> : Et notandum, quod leviores et quotidiani erratus, levioris poenitentiae possunt remedio curari: unde iacentem in conclavi dominus facillima voce puellam resuscitat dicens puella, surge; ut vero quatriduanus mortuus sepulcri claustra evadere posset, fremuit spiritu, turbavit seipsum, lacrymas fudit. Quanto igitur gravior animae mors, tanto acrior necesse est ut poenitentis fervor insistat. Sed et hoc notandum, quia publica noxa publico eget remedio: unde Lazarus de monumento vocatus populis innotuit; levia autem peccata, secreta queunt poenitentia deleri: unde puella in domo iacens paucis arbitris exsurgit, eisdemque ut nemini manifestent praecipitur. Turba etiam foris eicitur, ut puella suscitetur: quia si non prius a secretioribus cordis expellitur saecularium multitudo curarum, anima quae intrinsecus iacet mortua, non resurgit. Bene autem surrexit et ambulat: quia anima a peccatis resuscitata, non solum a sordibus scelerum exurgere, sed et in bonis proficere debet operibus, et mox necesse est ut caelesti pane satietur, divini scilicet verbi et altaris particeps effecta.
          <td><span style="color:blue">Bede</span> : And we may remark, that lighter and daily errors may be cured by the remedy of a lighter penance. Wherefore the Lord raises the damsel, lying in the inner chamber with a very easy cry, saying, "Damsel, arise;" but that he who had been four days dead might quit the prison of the tomb, He groaned in spirit, He was troubled, He shed tears. In proportion, then, as the death of the soul presses the more heavily, so much the more ardently must the fervour of the penitent press forward. But this too must be observed, that a public crime requires a public reparation; wherefore Lazarus, when called from the sepulchre, was placed before the eyes of the people: but slight sins require to be washed out by a secret penance, wherefore the damsel lying in the house is raised up before few witnesses, and those are desired to tell no man. The crowd also is cast out before the damsel is raised; for if a crowd of worldly thoughts be not first cast out from the hidden parts of the heart, the soul, which lies dead within, cannot rise. Well too did she arise and walk, for the soul, raised from sin, ought not only to rise from the filth of its crimes, but also to make advances in good works, and soon it is necessary that it should be filled with heavenly bread, that is, made partaker of the Divine Word, and of the Altar.

Solet item quaeri quomodo Matthaeus et Lucas commemoraverint dixisse dominum discipulis, ut nec virgam ferrent, cum dicat Marcus et praecepit eis ne quid tollerent in via nisi virgam tantum. Quod ita solvitur, ut intelligamus sub alia significatione dictam virgam, quae secundum Marcum ferenda est, et sub alia illam quae secundum Matthaeum et Lucam non est ferenda. Potuit enim sic breviter dici: nihil necessariorum vobiscum feratis nisi virgam tantum, ut illud quod dictum est: nec virgam, intelligatur nec minimas quidem res; quod vero adiunctum est nisi virgam tantum, intellegatur quia per potestatem a domino receptam, quae virgae nomine significata est, etiam quae non portantur, non deerunt. Utrumque ergo dominus dixit; sed quia non utrumque unus Evangelista commemoravit, putatur ille qui virgam sub alia significatione positam tollendam dixit, ei qui virgam rursus aliud significantem non tollendam, dixit, esse contrarius; sed iam ratione reddita non putetur. Sic et calceamenta cum dicit Matthaeus in via non esse portanda, curam prohibet: quia ideo cogitantur portanda ne desint. Hoc et de duabus tunicis intelligendum est, ne quisquam eorum praeter eam qua esset indutus, aliam portandam curaret, sollicitus ne opus esset, cum ex illa potestate posset accipere. Proinde Marcus dicendo, calceari eos sandaliis vel soleis, aliquid hoc calceamentum mysticae significationis habere admonet, ut pes neque tectus sit desuper, nec nudus ad terram; idest nec occultetur Evangelium, nec terrenis commodis innitatur. Et quod non haberi, vel portari duas tunicas, sed expressius indui prohibet, quid eos monet nisi non dupliciter, sed simpliciter ambulare? Quisquis autem putat non potuisse dominum in uno sermone quaedam figurate, quaedam proprie ponere eloquia, cetera eius inspiciat, et videbit, quod hoc temere ac inerudite arbitretur.
          <td><span style="color:blue">Augustine</span> , de Con. Evan., 2, 30: Or else; according to Matthew, the Lord immediately subjoined, "The workman is worthy of his meat," [Matt 10:19] which sufficiently proves why He forbade their carrying or possessing such things; not because they were not necessary, but because He sent them in such a way as to shew, that they were due to them from the faithful, to whom they preached the Gospel. From this it is evident that the Lord did not mean by this precept that the Evangelists ought to live only on the gifts of those to whom they preach the Gospel, else the Apostle transgressed this precept when he procured his livelihood by the labour of his own hands, but He meant that He had given them a power, in virtue of which, they might be assured these things were due to them. It is also often asked, how it comes that Matthew and Luke have related that the Lord commanded His disciples not to carry even a staff, whilst Mark says, "And He commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, save a staff only." Which question is solved, by supposing that the word 'staff' has a meaning in [p. 110] Mark, who says that it ought to be carried, different from that which it bears in Matthew and Luke, who affirm the contrary. For in a concise way one might say, Take none of the necessaries of life with you, nay, not a staff, save a staff only; so that the saying, nay not a staff, may mean, nay not the smallest thing; but that which is added, "save a staff only," may mean that, through the power received by them from the Lord, of which a rod is the ensign, nothing, even of those things which they do not carry, will be wanting to them. The Lord, therefore, said both, but because one Evangelist has not given both, men suppose, that he who has said that the staff, in one sense, should be taken, is contrary to him who again has declared, that, in another sense, it should be left behind: now however that a reason has been given, let no one think so. So also when Matthew declares that shoes are not to be worn on the journey, he forbids anxiety about them, for the reason why men are anxious about carrying them, is that they may not be without them. This is also to be understood of the two coats, that no man should be troubled about having only that with which he is clad from anxiety lest he should need another, when he could always obtain one from the power given by the Lord. In like manner Mark, by saying that they are to be shod with sandals or soles, warns us that this mode of protecting the feet has a mystical signification, that the foot should neither be covered above nor be naked on the ground, that is, that the Gospel should neither be hid, nor rest upon earthly comforts; and in that He forbids their possessing or taking with them, or more expressly their wearing, two coats, He bids them walk simply, not with duplicity. But whosoever thinks that the Lord could not in the same discourse say some things figuratively, others in a literal sense, let him look into His other discourses, and he shall see, how rash and ignorant is his judgment.

Are we to suppose that there was something evil in his life, to be wiped away by so ignominious a death? When, however, could he commit a sin even in his eating, whose food was only locusts, and wild honey? How could he offend in his conversation, who never quitted the wilderness? How is it that Almighty God so despises in this life those whom He has so sublimely chosen before all ages, if it be not for the reason, which is plain to the piety of the faithful, that He thus sinks them into the lowest place, because He sees how He is rewarding them in the highest, and outwardly He throws them down amongst things despised, because inwardly He draws them up even to incomprehensible things. Let each then infer from this what they shall suffer, whom He rejects, if He so grieves those whom He loves.

The disciples did not enter into the ship alone, but taking up the Lord with them, they went to a desert place, as Matthew shews. [Matt 14] Here He tries the faith of the multitude, and by seeking a desert place He would see whether they care to follow Him. And they follow Him, and not on horseback, nor in carriages, but laboriously coming on foot, they shew how great is their anxiety for their salvation.

In saying that they outwent them on foot, it is proved that the disciples with the Lord did not reach the other bank of the sea, or of the Jordan, but they went to the nearest places of the same country, where the people of those parts could come to them on foot.

          <td>There follows: "And Jesus when He came out saw many people, and was moved with compassion towards them, because they were as sheep having no shepherd." The Pharisees being ravening wolves did not feed the sheep, but devoured them; for which reason they gather themselves to Christ, the true Shepherd, who gave them spiritual food, that is, the word of God.

He looks up to heaven, that He may teach us that there we must look for grace. He breaks and distributes to the disciples that they may place the bread before the multitudes, because He has opened the mysteries of prophecy to holy doctors, who are to preach them to the whole world. What is left by the crowd is taken up by the disciples, because the more sacred mysteries, which cannot be received by the foolish, are not to be passed by with negligence, but to be inquired into by the perfect. For by the twelve baskets, the Apostles and the following Doctors are typified, externally indeed despised by men, but inwardly full of healthful food.

Theodoras was Bishop of Pharan, in Arabia, and was condemned as the author of the Monothelite heresy in the Lateran Council under Pope Martin I, AD 649. The passage from Dionysius is quoted in Actio 3 of the Council, and occurs de Div. Nom, c. 1] But Theodorus, who was Bishop of Phanara, wrote that the Lord had no bodily weight in His flesh, and walked on the sea without weight; but the Catholic faith declares that He had weight according to the flesh.

And well is it said that the ship was in the midst of the sea, and He alone on land, for sometimes the Church is afflicted by a pressure from the [p. 128] Gentiles so overwhelming, that her Redeemer seems to have entirely deserted her. But the Lord sees His own, toiling on the sea, for, lest they faint in tribulations, He strengthens them by the look of His love, and sometimes frees them by a visible assistance. Further, in the fourth watch He came to them as daylight approached, for when man lifts up his mind to the light of guidance from on high, the Lord will be with him, and the dangers of temptations will be laid asleep.

[Isa 52.11] It is therefore a superstitious human tradition, that men who are clean already, should wash oftener because they eat bread, and that they should not eat on leaving the market, without washing. But it is necessary for those who desire to partake of the bread which comes down from heaven, often to cleanse their evil deeds by alms, by tears, and the other fruits of righteousness. It is also necessary for a man to wash thoroughly away the pollutions which he has contracted from the cares of temporal business, by being afterwards intent on good thoughts and works. In vain, however, do the Jews wash their hands, and cleanse themselves after the market, so long as they refuse to be washed in the font of the Saviour; in vain do they observe the washing of their vessels, who neglect to wash away the filthy sins of their bodies and of their hearts.

[ed. note: the words in the parenthesis are not in Theophylact] Thus they deceived the sons into neglecting their parents, whilst they themselves devoured the offerings; with this therefore the Lord reproaches them, as transgressing the law of God for the sake of gain.

          <td><span style="color:blue">Bede</span> : The passage may in a few words have this sense, Every gift which I have to make, will go to do you good; for ye compel children, it is meant, to say to their parents, that gift which I was going to offer to God, I expend on feeding you, and does you good, oh father and mother, speaking this ironically. Thus they would be afraid to accept what had been given into the hands of God, and might prefer a life of poverty to living on consecrated property.

          <td><span style="color:blue">Pseudo-Jerome</span> : Mystically, again, the disciples eating with unwashed hands signifies the future fellowship of the Gentiles with the Apostles.

Meats therefore, since they do not reach the soul, cannot in their own nature defile a man; but an inordinate use of meats, which proceeds from a want of order in the mind, makes men unclean. But that meats cannot reach the mind, He shews by that which He adds, saying, "But into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats." This however He says, without referring to what remains from the food in the body, for that which is necessary for the nourishment and growth of the body remains. But that which is superfluous goes out, and thus as it were purges the nourishment, which remains.

But we should observe that this happened amongst the Gentiles, to whom it was not time to preach; nevertheless not to receive them, when they came to the faith of their own accord, would have been to grudge them the faith. So then it came to pass that the Lord was not made known by His disciples; others, however, who had seen Him entering the house, recognized Him, and it began to be known that He was there. His will therefore was that He should not be proclaimed by His own disciples, but that others should come to seek Him, and so it took place.

How then do we infer that she was in the house, except by gathering it from Mark, who says that she came in to Jesus, after having before said that He was in the house? But Matthew in that he says, "He answered her not a word," gave us to understand that He went out, during that silence, from the house; thus too the other events are connected together, so that they now in no way disagree.

"And looking up to heaven, he groaned," that is, He taught us to groan, and to raise up the treasures of our hearts to the heavens; because by the groaning of hearty compunction, the silly joy of the flesh is purged away. But the ears are opened to hymns, and songs, and psalms; and He looses the tongue, that it may pour forth the good word, which neither threats nor stripes can restrain.

For if the leaven mentioned above means perverse traditions, of course the food, with which the people of God was nourished, means the true doctrine.

It is therefore right to be always prepared for death; for if in the battles of this world, he who is prepared for death fights better than others, though none can restore him to life after death, much more is this the case in spiritual battle, when so great a hope of resurrection is set before him, since he who gives up his soul unto death saves it.

As if He said, Think not that he has saved his soul, who has shunned the perils [p. 162] of the cross; for when a man, at the cost of his soul, that is, his life, gains the whole world, what has he besides, now that his soul is perishing? Has he another soul to give for his soul? For a man can give the price of his house in exchange for the house; but in losing his soul, he has not another soul to give. And it is with a purpose that He says, "Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?" for God, in exchange for our salvation, has given the precious blood of Jesus Christ.

In the time of peace therefore there is another way, by which we may be known to ourselves.

Seeing however the thoughts of the disciples, the Lord takes care to heal the desire of glory by humility; for He first, by simply commanding humility, admonishes them that a high station was not to be aimed at.

He adds also, "In My name," that they might, with the fixed purpose of reason, follow for His name's sake that mould of virtue to which the child keeps, with nature for his guide. And because He taught that He Himself was received in children, lest it should be thought that there was nothing in Him but what was seen, He added, "And whosoever shall receive Me, receiveth not Me, but Him that sent Me.;" thus wishing that we should believe Him to be of the same nature and of equal greatness with His Father.

[Luke 11:23] Or will any one say that the difference lies in that here He says to His disciples, "For he that is not against you is on your part," but in the other He speaks of Himself, "He who is not with Me is against Me?" As if indeed it were possible [ed. note: St. Augustine has here quasi vero, instead of quasi non, which hardly makes sense; the latter reading has also been found in an old edition of the Catena Aurea, A.D. 1417.] that he who is joined to Christ's disciples, who are as His members, should not be with Him. How if it were so, could it be true that "he that receiveth you receiveth Me?" [Matt. 10:40] Or how is he not against Him who is against His disciples? Where then will be that saying, "He who despiseth you, despiseth Me? [Luke 10:16] But surely what is implied is that a man is not with Him in as far as he is against Him, and is not against Him in as far as he is with Him. For instance, he who worked miracles in the name of Christ, and yet did not join himself to the body of His disciples, in as far as he worked the miracles in His name, was with them, and was not against them; again, in that he did not join their society, he was not with them, and was against them. Be because they forbade his doing that in which he was with them, the Lord said unto them, "Forbid him not:" for they ought to have forbidden his being without their society, and thus to have persuaded him of the unity of the Church, but they should not have forbidden that in which he was with them, that is, his commendation of the name of their Lord and Master by the expulsion of devils. Thus the Church Catholic does not disapprove in heretics the sacraments, which are common, but she blames their division, or some opinion of theirs adverse to peace and to truth; for in this they are against us.

[Prov 25:20 Vulgate] All those who hesitate not to affirm that there will be pain both of body and soul in that punishment affirm that the body is burnt by the fire. But although this is more credible, because it is absurd that there either the pains of body or of soul should be wanting, still I think that it is easier to say that both belong to the body than that neither: and therefore it seems to me that Holy Scripture in this place is silent about the pains of the soul, because it follows that the soul also is tortured in the pains of the body. Let each man therefore choose which he will, either to refer the fire to the body, the worm to the soul, the one properly, the other in a figure, or else both properly to the body; for living things may exist even in fire, in burnings without being wasted, in pain without death, by the wondrous power of the Almighty Creator.

But the separation of those who separate themselves from them consists in the very circumstance of their not yielding to them, when they would persuade them to evil, that is, offend them. If indeed their wickedness becomes known to all the good men with whom they are connected, they are altogether cut off from all fellowship, and even from partaking in the heavenly Sacraments. If however they are thus known only to the smaller number, whilst their wickedness is unknown to the generality, they are to be tolerated in such a way that we should not consent to join in their iniquity, and that the communion of the good should not be deserted on their account.

And if, indeed, that which is salted with salt, keeps off the putrefying worm, that which is salted with fire, that is, seasoned again with flames, on which salt is sprinkled, not only casts off worms, but also consumes the flesh itself. Flesh and blood therefore breed worms, that is, carnal pleasure, if unopposed by the seasoning of continence, produces everlasting punishment for the luxurious; the stink of [p. 190] which if any man would avoid, let him take care to chasten his body with the salt of continence, and his mind with the seasoning of wisdom, from the stain of error and vice. For salt means the sweetness of wisdom; and fire, the grace of the Holy Spirit. He says, therefore, "Every one shall be salted with fire," because all the elect ought to be purged by spiritual wisdom, from the corruption of carnal concupiscence.

The [p. 195] law therefore wished to send him, whom it ordered to give a bill of divorcement, before he dismissed his wife, to them, who ought to be wise interpreters of the law, and just opponents of quarrel. For a bill could only be written for him by men, who by their good advice might overrule him, since his circumstances and necessity had put him into their hands, and so by treating between him and his wife they might persuade them to love and concord. But if a hatred so great had arisen that it could not be extinguished and corrected, then indeed a bill was to be written, that he might not lightly put away her who was the object of his hate, in such a way as to prevent his being recalled to the love, which he owed her by marriage, through the persuasion of the wise. For this reason it is added, "For the hardness of your heart, he wrote this precept"; for great was the hardness of heart which could not be melted or bent to the taking back and recalling the love of marriage, even by the interposition of a bill in a way which gave room for the just and wise to dissuade them.

It also appears in the Pelagian controversy, for Pelagius argued that the Catholic doctrine of original sin implied that it was a substance; St. Augustine answers that though not a substance, it was a privation or disorganization of parts, just as darkness is a privation of light, and sickness a disordered state of body; which illustrates what Theophylact means by saying, that sin, though so great an evil, has no being or substance. see Aug. Conf. 7, 12, de Nat. et Grac. 21]. Or else: sin does not come under the notion of strength, but of weakness, therefore sin, like [p. 205] weakness, is impossible with God. But can God cause that not to have been done which has been done? To which we answer, that God is Truth, but to cause that what has been done should not have been done, is falsehood. How then can truth do what is false? He must first therefore quit His own nature, so that they who speak thus really say, Can God cease to be God? which is absurd.

Et maius est, quia cum persecutionibus haec omnia possidebunt sancti, si persecutionem sint passi et angustiati; propter quod sequitur multi autem erunt primi novissimi, et novissimi primi: Pharisaei enim primi existentes, facti sunt novissimi; qui vero omnia reliquerunt, et Christum secuti sunt, fuerunt novissimi in saeculo isto per angustias et persecutiones; sed erunt primi per spem quae est in Deum.
          <td><span style="color:blue">Theophylact</span> : For a wife is busied in a house about her husband's food and raiment. See also how this is [p. 207] the case with the Apostles; for many women busied themselves about their food and their clothing, and ministered unto them. In like manner the Apostles had many fathers and mothers, that is, persons who loved them; as Peter, for instance, leaving one house, had afterwards the houses of all the disciples. And what is more wonderful, they are to be persecuted and oppressed, for it is "with persecutions" that the Saints are to possess all things, for which reason there follows, "But many that are first shall be last, and the last first." For the Pharisees who were first became the last; but those who left all and followed Christ were last in this world through tribulation and persecutions, but shall be first by the hope which is in God.

Centenarius quippe numerus de laeva translatus in dexteram, licet eamdem in flexu digitorum videatur habere figuram, quam habuerat denarius in laeva, tamen quantitatis magnitudine sursum crescit: quia videlicet omnes qui propter regnum Dei temporalia spreverunt, et in hac vita persecutionibus plenissima, eiusdem regni gaudium fide certa degustant, atque in expectatione patriae caelestis, quae significatur in dextera, omnium electorum delectatione fruuntur. Verum quia multi virtutum studia non eadem qua incipiunt intentione pietatis, consummant, mox subinfertur multi autem erunt, et cetera. Quotidie enim videmus multos in laico habitu constitutos, magnis vitae meritis excellere; et alios a prima aetate spirituali studio ferventes, ad extremum otio torpente lassescere, atque inerti stultitia quod spiritu coepere, carne consummare.

[see note, p. 78] For the number a hundred which is reckoned by changing from the left to the right hand, although it has the same appearance in the bending of the fingers as the ten had on the left, nevertheless is increased to a much greater quantity. This means, that all who have despised temporal things for the sake of the kingdom of heaven through undoubting faith, taste the joy of the same kingdom in this life which is full of persecutions, and in the expectation of the heavenly country, which is signified by the right hand, have a share in the happiness of all the elect. But because all do not accomplish a virtuous course of life with the same ardour as they began it, it is presently added, "But many that are first shall be last, and the last first"; for we daily see many persons who, remaining in a lay habit, are eminent for their meritorious life; but others, who from their youth have been ardent in a spiritual profession, at last wither away in the sloth of ease, and with a lazy folly finish in the flesh, what they had begun in the Spirit.

          <td>Chrys.: Where two questions are raised, one is, whether a seat on His right hand is prepared for any one; the other, whether the Lord of all has it not in His power to give it to those for whom it is prepared. To the first then we say, that no one sits on His right hand or on His left, for that throne is inaccessible to a creature. How then did He say, "To sit on My right hand or on My left is not mine to give you," as though it belonged to some who were to sit there? He however answers the thoughts of those who asked Him, condescending to their meaning; for they did not know that lofty throne and seat, which is on the right hand of the Father, but sought one thing alone, that is, to possess the chief place, and to be set over others. And since they had heard it said of the Apostles, that they were to sit on twelve [p. 212] thrones, they begged for a place higher than all the rest, not knowing what was said. To the second question we must say, that such a gift does not transcend the power of the Son of God, but what is said by Matthew, "it is prepared by My Father," [Matt. 20:23] is the same as if it were said, "by Me," wherefore also Mark did not say here, by My Father. What therefore Christ says here is this, Ye shall die, He says, for Me, but this is not enough to enable you to obtain the highest place, for if another person comes possessing besides martyrdom all other virtues, he will possess much more than you; for the chief place is prepared for those, who by works are enabled to become the first. Thus then the Lord instructed them not to trouble themselves vainly and absurdly for high places; at the same time He would not have them made sad.

For being influenced by human feelings, they were moved with envy; and their first [p. 213] displeasure arose from their seeing that they were not taken up by the Lord; before that time they were not displeased, because they saw that they themselves were honoured before other men. At this time the Apostles were thus imperfect, but afterwards they yielded the chief place one to another. Christ however cures them; first indeed by drawing them to Himself in order to comfort them; and this is meant, when it is said, "But Jesus called them to Him"; then by shewing them that to usurp honour, and to desire the chief place, belongs to Gentiles. Wherefore there follows: "And saith unto them, Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship; and their great ones exercise authority over them." The great ones of the Gentiles thrust themselves into the chief place tyrannically and as lords.

[p. 217] Mark indeed, in writing that one received his sight, refers to the saving of the Gentiles, that the figure might agree with the salvation of those, whom he instructed in the faith; but Matthew, who wrote his Gospel to the faithful among the Jews, because it was also to reach the knowledge of the Gentiles, fitly says that two received their sight, that He might teach us that the grace of faith belonged to each people. Therefore, as the Lord was departing with His disciples and a great multitude from Jericho, the blind man was sitting, begging by the way-side; that is, when the Lord ascended into heaven, and many of the faithful followed Him, yea when all the elect from the beginning of the world entered together with Him the gate of heaven [ed. note: This refers to the opinion that by the descent of our Lord into hell, the Patriarchs were freed from the limbus Patrum, where they had been confined, and were carried by Him into a place of happiness; see authorities quoted in Pearson on the Creed, Art. 5], presently the Gentile people began to have hope of its own illumination; for it now sits begging by the wayside, because it has not entered upon and reached the path of truth.

The fury of those who attacked Him, however, could not deprive of salvation those who were fore-ordained to life. And He heard the blind man's cry as He was passing, but stood when He restored his sight, because by His Humanity He pitied him, who by the power of His Divinity has driven away the darkness from our mind; for in that Jesus was born and suffered for our sakes, He as it were passed by, because this action is temporal; but when God is said to stand, it means, that, [p. 218] Himself without change, He sets in order all changeable things. But the Lord calls the blind man, who cries to Him, when He sends the word of faith to the people of the Gentiles by preachers; and they call on the blind man to be of good cheer and to rise, and bid him come to the Lord, when by preaching to the simple, they bid them have hope of salvation, and rise from the sloth of vice, and gird themselves for a life of virtue.

          <td><span style="color:blue">Bede</span> : As the time of His Passion approached, the Lord wished to approach to the place of His Passion, in order to intimate that He underwent death of His own accord: wherefore it is said, "And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple." And by His going to the temple on first entering the city, He shews us beforehand a form of religion, which we are to follow, that if by chance we enter a place, where there is a house of prayer, we should first turn aside to it. We should also understand from this, that such was the poverty of the Lord, and so far was He from flattering man, that in so large a city, He found no one to be His host, no abiding place, but lived in a small country place with Lazarus and his sisters; for Bethany is a hamlet of the Jews. Wherefore there follows: "And when He had looked round about upon all things, (that is, to see whether any one would take Him in,) and now the eventide was come, He went out into Bethany with the twelve." Nor did He do this once only, but during all the five days, from the time that He came to Jerusalem, to the day of His Passion, He used always to do the same thing; during the day He taught in the temple, but at night, He went out and dwelt in the mount of Olives.

Et respondens dixit ei: iam non amplius in aeternum quisquam ex te fructum manducet. Maledicit ergo ficulneam propter discipulos, ut confidant. Quia enim ubique beneficia tribuebat, nullumque puniebat, oportebat autem eius punitivae virtutis demonstrationem praebere, ut discerent quia posset etiam Iudaeos persequentes siccare; noluit hoc demonstrare in hominibus: unde in planta suae punitivae virtutis praebuit signum: unde ostenditur quod principaliter propter hoc ad ficulneam venit, non propter esuriem. Quis enim tam inscius est ut putet quod matutino tempore tali stimularetur esurie? Aut quid est quod impediret eum comedere antequam domum exiret? Neque potest dici quod visio fructus excitavit in esurie appetitum: non enim erat ficorum tempus. Sed si esuriebat, cur de alio comedere non quaerebat, sed de ficu fructus ante tempus tribuere non valente? Qua etiam poena erat dignam ficum fructum non habere ante tempus?

          <td>There follows, [p. 226] "And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, He came, if haply He might find any thing theron." Now it is evident that this expresses a conjecture of the disciples, who thought that it was for this reason that Christ came to the fig tree, and that it was cursed, because He found no fruit upon it. For it goes on: "And when He came to it, He found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet. And Jesus answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever." He therefore curses the fig tree for His disciples' sake, that they might have faith in Him. For He everywhere distributed blessings, and punished no one, yet at the same time, it was right to give them a proof of His chastising power, that they might learn that He could even cause the persecuting Jews to wither away; He was however unwilling to give this proof on men, wherefore He shewed them on a plant a sign of His power of punishing. This proves that He came to the fig tree principally for this reason, and not on account of His hunger, for who is so silly as to suppose that in the morning He felt so greatly the pains of hunger, or what prevented the Lord from eating before He left Bethany? Nor can it be said that the sight of the figs excited His appetite to hunger, for it was not the season of figs; and if He were hungry, why did He not seek food elsewhere, rather than from a fig-tree which could not yield fruit before its time? What punishment also did a fig tree deserve for not having fruit before its time? From all this then we may infer, that He wished to shew His power, that their minds might not be broken by His Passion.

Hungering therefore, that is, desiring the salvation of mankind, He saw the fig tree, which is, the Jewish people, having leaves, or, the words of the Law and the Prophets, and He sought upon it the fruit of good works, by teaching them, by rebuking them, by working miracles, and He found it not, and therefore condemned it. Do thou too, unless thou wouldest be condemned by Christ in the judgment, beware of being a barren tree, but rather offer to Christ the fruit of piety which He requires.

          <td><span style="color:blue">Chrys.</span> : We may also say, in another sense, that the Lord sought for fruit on the fig tree before its time, and not finding it, cursed it, because all who fulfil the commandments of the Law, are said to bear fruit in their own time, as, for instance, that commandment, "Thou shalt not commit adultery;" but he who not only abstains from adultery but remains a virgin, which is a greater thing, excels them in virtue. But the Lord exacts from the perfect not only the observance of virtue, but also that they bear fruit over and above the commandments.

For this reason the Lord says, "Ye shall receive whatsoever ye ask in faith;" for he who believes that he is altogether in the hands of God, and interceding with tears, feels that he as it were has hold of the feet of the Lord in prayer, he shall receive what he has rightly asked for. Again, would you in another way receive what you ask for? Forgive your brother, if he has in any way sinned against you; this is also what is added: "And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses."

Sin autem hoc facere contemnunt, non solum orando virtutes facere, sed nec suorum possunt veniam consequi peccatorum; et hoc est quod subditur quod si vos non dimiseritis, nec pater vester qui in caelis est dimittet vobis peccata vestra.

But let those who are unable to mount up to such a height of perfection pray that their sins should be forgiven them, and they shall obtain what they pray for, provided that they themselves first forgive those who have sinned against them. If however they disdain to do this, not only shall they be unable to perform miracles by their prayers, but they shall not even be able to obtain pardon for their sins, which is implied in what follows; "But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses."

Again, in a moral sense, each of the faithful, when the Sacrament of Baptism is intrusted to him, receives on hire a vineyard, which he is to cultivate. But the servant sent to him is evil intreated, beaten, and cast out, when the word is heard by him and despised, or, what is worse, even blasphemed; further, he kills, as far as in him lies, the heir, who has trampled under foot the Son of God. The evil husbandman is destroyed; and the vineyard given to another, when the humble shall be enriched with that gift of grace, which the proud man has scorned. And it happens daily in the Church, that the Chief Priests wishing to lay hands on Jesus, are held back by the multitude, when some on, who is a brother only in name, either blushes or fears to attack the unity of the faith of the Church, and of its peace, though he loves it not, on account of the number of good brethren who dwell together within it.

And therefore there is added, "And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; the Lord thy God is one God."

We are in two way ordered to beware of those who are desirous of vain [p. 251] glory; first, we should not be seduced by their hypocrisy into thinking that what they do is good; nor secondly, should we be excited to imitate them, through a vain rejoicing in being praised for those virtues which they affect.

          <td><span style="color:blue">Bede</span> : The Lord, who had warned them to avoid the desire of high place and vain glory, now distinguishes by a sure test those who brought in gifts. Wherefore it is said, "And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury." In the Greek language, "phylassein", means to keep, and "gaza" is a Persian word for treasure; wherefore the word "gazophylacium" which is here used means a place where riches are kept, which name also was applied to the chest in which the offerings of the people were collected, for the necessary uses of the temple, and to the porch in which they were kept. You have a notice of the porch in the Gospel, "These words spake Jesus in the treasury as He taught in the temple:" [John 8:20] and of the chest in the book of Kings, "But Jehoiada the priest took a chest."

Nam non quantum vos audistis, sed ex quanto considerat Deus. Unusquisque autem quadrantem potest offerre, quae est voluntas prompta; quae dicitur quadrans, quia cum tribus consistit, scilicet cogitatu, verbo et facto.

For God does not consider how much ye bear, but what is the store from which it comes; but each at all events can bring his farthing, that is, a ready will, which is called a farthing, because it is accompanied by three things, that is, thought, word and deed. And in that it is said that "she cast in all her living," it is implied that all that the body wants is that by which it lives. Wherefore it is said, "All the labour of man is for his mouth."

Haec in gazophylacium duo minuta mittit: quia dilectionem Dei et proximi, seu fidei et orationis munera defert, quae considerantur proprie fragilitatis minuta, sed merito piae intentionis accepta cunctis superbientibus Iudaeorum operibus praestant. Ex abundanti sibi Iudaeus mittit in munera Dei qui de iustitia sua praesumit.

          <td><span style="color:blue">Bede</span> : Again, in an allegorical way, the rich men, who cast gifts into the treasury, point out the Jews puffed up with the righteousness of the law; the poor widow is the simplicity of the Church: poor indeed, because she has cast away the spirit of pride and of the desires of worldly things; and a widow, because Jesus her husband has suffered death for her. She casts two mites into the treasury, because she brings the love of God and of her neighbour, or the gifts of faith and prayer; which are looked upon as mites in their own insignificance, but measured by the merit of a devout intention are superior to all the proud works of the Jews. The Jew sends of his abundance into the treasury, because he presumes on his own righteousness; but the Church sends her whole living into God's treasury, because she understands that even her very living is not of her own desert, but of Divine grace.

Wherefore it goes on: "And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down." Now some may endeavour to prove that Christ's words were false, by saying that many ruins were left, but this is not at all the point; for though some ruins had been left, still at the consummation of all things one stone shall not be left upon another.

A tempore autem dominicae passionis in populo Iudaeorum, qui latronem seditiosum elegerunt, et Christum salvatorem abiecerunt, nec hostium, nec seditiones civium cessaverunt; unde sequitur cum audieritis autem bella et opiniones bellorum, ne timueritis. Sed his adventantibus, apostoli ne terreantur, ne Ierusalem Iudaeamque deserant admonentur: quia videlicet non statim finis; quin potius in quadragesimum differendum sit annum; et hoc est quod subditur oportet enim haec fieri; sed nondum finis, idest desolatio provinciae, ultimumque urbis ac templi excidium.
          <td><span style="color:blue">Bede</span> : For many came forward, when destruction was hanging over Jerusalem, saying that they were Christs, and that the time of freedom was now approaching. Many teachers of heresy also arose in the Church even in the time of the Apostles; and many Antichrists came in the name of Christ, the first of whom was Simon Magus, to whom the Samaritans, as we read in the Acts of the Apostles, listened, saying, "This man is the great power of God." [Acts 8:10] Wherefore also it is added here, "And shall deceive many." Now from the time of the Passion of our Lord there ceased not amongst the [p. 257] Jewish people, who chose the seditious robber and rejected Christ the Saviour, either external wars or civil discord. Wherefore it goes on: "And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not troubled." And when these come, the Apostles are warned not to be afraid, or to leave Jerusalem and Judaea, because the end was not to come at once, nay was to be put off for forty years. And this is what is added: "for such things must needs be; but the end shall not be yet," that is, the desolation of the province, and the last destruction of the city and temple.

Haec autem tribulatio quanto ceteris, quae praecessere, pressurarum pondere gravior fuit, tanto est temporis brevitate moderatior futura.

But in proportion as this tribulation shall be greater than those which preceded, by so much shall it be shorter. For it is believed, that during three years and a half, as far as may be conjectured from the prophecy of Daniel and the Revelations of John, the Church is to be attacked. In a spiritual sense, however, when we see the abomination of desolation standing where it ought not, that is, heresies and crimes reigning amongst them, who appear to be consecrated by the heavenly mysteries, then whosoever of us remain in Judaea, that is, in the confession of the true faith, ought to mount the higher in virtue, the more men we see following the broad paths of vice.

Ipse quippe finis erit, non tunc proximus erit. Sed Matthaeus aperuit nullis exceptis esse accipiendum, dicens: cum videritis haec omnia, scitote quia prope est in ianuis.

The end therefore shall not be then, but then it shall be near at hand. Or are we to say, that not all those things which are mentioned above are to be taken in, but only some of them, that is, leaving out these words, "Then shall ye see the Son of Man coming;" for that shall be the end itself, and not its approach only. But Matthew has declared that it is to be received without exception, saying, "When ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors." That which is said above must therefore be taken thus; "And He shall send His angels, and gather together the elect from the four winds;" that is, He shall collect His elect from the four winds of heaven, which He does in the whole of the last hour, coming in His members as in clouds.

Sed primum sensu communis iudicii sentiendum est an credibile esse possit ut aliquid ex omnibus nesciat qui omnibus ad id quod sunt atque erunt, auctor est. Quomodo enim extra eius naturae scientiam est per quam et in qua id quod efficiendum sit continetur? Hanc autem ille diem ignorat, quae adventus sui dies est? Humanae naturae quod agere definiunt, quantum in se est, praesciunt, et sequitur gerendi cognitio voluntatem agendi. Quomodo ergo dominus gloriae adventus sui ignorata die, naturae esse imperfectae creditur, quae et necessitatem habeat adveniendi, et scientiam adventus sui non adepta sit? Iam vero quanta impietatis geminatur occasio, si Deo patri deputabitur indignitatis affectus, si ei ademerit beatitudinis cognitionem, cui mortis induxerit praescientiam? Quod si in eo omnes scientiae thesauri sunt, diem hunc non ignorat. Sed meminisse nos convenit occultos in eo scientiae thesauros esse. Ignoratio igitur eius est secundum quod thesauri scientiae in eo latent. In omnibus enim quae Deus ignorare se loquitur, ignoratione non detinetur; sed aut tempus est non loquendi, aut dispensatio non agendi. Si autem tunc cognovisse Deus dicitur quod Abraham eum amaverit, cum hoc non celavit Abrahae; necesse est ut et pater ob id diem scire dicatur, quia non celaverit filio. Si itaque diem filius nescit, sacramentum est ut taceat; e contrario pater solus ostenditur scire, quia non tacet. Absit autem corporalium mutationum novitates in patre et filio existimari. Denique, ne per infirmitatem ignorare dicatur, continuo subiecit videte, vigilate et orate: nescitis enim quando tempus sit.
          <td><span style="color:blue">Hilary</span> , de Trin., ix: This ignorance of the day and hour is urged against the Only-Begotten God, as if, God born of God had not the same perfection of nature as God. But first, let common sense decide whether it is credible that He, who [p. 270] is the cause that all things are, and are to be, should be ignorant of any out of all these things. For how can it be beyond the knowledge of that nature, by which and in which that which is to be done is contained? And can He be ignorant of that day, which is the day of His own Advent? Human substances foreknow as far as they can what they intend to do, and the knowledge of what is to be done, follows upon the will to act. How then can the Lord of glory, from ignorance of the day of His coming, be believed to be of that imperfect nature, which has on it a necessity of coming, and has not attained to the knowledge of its own advent? But again, how much more room for blasphemy will there be, if a feeling of envy is ascribed to God the Father, in that He has withheld the knowledge of His beatitude from Him to whom He gave a foreknowledge of His death. But if there are in Him all the treasures of knowledge, He is not ignorant of this day; rather we ought to remember that the treasures of wisdom in Him are hidden; His ignorance therefore must be connected with the hiding of the treasures of wisdom, which are in Him. For in all cases, in which God declares Himself ignorant, He is not under the power of ignorance, but either it is not a fit time for speaking, or it is an economy of not acting. But if God is said then to have known that Abraham loved Him, when He did not hide that His knowledge from Abraham, it follows, that the Father is said to know the day, because He did not hide it from the Son. If therefore the Son knew not the day, it is a Sacrament of His being silent, as on the contrary the Father alone is said to know, because He is not silent. But God forbid that any new and bodily changes should be ascribed to the Father or the Son. Lastly, lest He should be said to be ignorant from weakness, He has immediately added, "Take ye heed, watch and pray, for ye know not when the time is."

Not only, however, those of us who rule over Churches, but all are required to watch the doors of their hearts, lest the evil suggestions of the devil enter into them, and lest our Lord find us sleeping.

We should keep on our wickedness even unto the end. Let us therefore attend to His words; for the end comes at even, when a man dies in old age; a midnight, when he dies in the midst of his youth; and at cockcrow, when our reason is perfect within us; for when a child begins to live according to his reason, then the cock cries loud within him, rousing him from the sleep of sense; but the age of childhood is the morning.

For the Evangelist, being about to speak of the slaying of Christ, premises, "After two days was the feast of the Passover, and of unleavened bread."

          <td><b>Beda</b> : Pascha, quod Hebraice dicitur phase, non a passione, ut plerique arbitrantur, sed a transitu nominatur: eo quod exterminator videns sanguinem in foribus Israelitarum, pertransierit, nec percusserit eos; vel ipse dominus praebens auxilium populo suo, desuper ambulavit.
          <td><span style="color:blue">Bede</span> , Marc., iv, 43: Pascha, which in Hebrew is, phase, is not called from Passion, as many think, but from passing over, because the destroyer, seeing the blood on the doors of the Israelites, passed by them, and did not smite them; or the Lord Himself, bringing aid unto His people, walked above them.

In immolatione agni et transitu populi per mare vel Aegyptum, praefiguratur passio Christi, et redemptio populi de Inferno, quando nos post biduum visitat, idest plenissima luna, aetate Christi perfecta: ut nec cum aliqua parte tenebrosa carnes agni immaculati, qui tollit peccata mundi, in una domo, quae est Ecclesia Catholica, calceati caritate et armati virtute comedamus.
          <td><span style="color:blue">Pseudo-Jerome</span> : Or else, phrase, is interpreted as a passing over, but Pascha means sacrifice. In the sacrifice of the lamb, and the passing of the people through the sea, or through Egypt, the Passion of Christ is prefigured, and the redemption of the people from hell, when He visits us after two days, that is, when the moon is most full, and the age of Christ is perfect, that when no part at all of it is dark, we may eat the flesh of the Lamb without spot, Who [p. 274] taketh away the sins of the world, in one house, that is, in the Catholic Church, shod with charity, and armed with virtue.

Verum Evangelistae indifferenter et diem azymorum pro Pascha, et pro diebus azymorum Pascha ponere solent; unde et Marcus hic dicit erat autem Pascha, et azyma post biduum: quia et Paschae dies in azymis panibus est celebrari praeceptus; et nos quasi Pascha perpetuum facientes, semper ex hoc mundo transire praecipimur.
          <td><span style="color:blue">Bede</span> : The difference according to the Old Testament between the Passover and the feast of unleavened bread was, that the day alone on which the lamb was slain in the evening, that is, the fourteenth moon of the first month, was called Passover. But on the fifteenth moon, when they came out of Egypt, the feast of unleavened bread came on, which solemn time was appointed for seven days, that is, up to the twenty-first day of the same month in the evening. But the Evangelists indifferently use the day of unleavened bread for the Passover, and the Passover for the days of unleavened bread. Wherefore Mark also here says, "After two days was the feast of the Passover, and of unleavened bread," because the day of the Passover was also ordered to be celebrated on the days of unleavened bread, and we also, as it were, keeping a continual passover, ought always to be passing out of this world.

Now when the head is slain, the whole body is rendered powerless, wherefore these wretched men slay the Head. But they avoid the feast day, which indeed befits them, for what feasting can there be for them, who have lost life and mercy? Wherefore it goes on: "But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar of the people."

Nay, if you examine, you will find three; [p. 276] for one is described by John, another by Luke, a third by the other two. For that one described by Luke is said to be a sinner and to have come to Jesus during the time of His preaching; but this other described by Matthew and Mark is said to have come at the time of the Passion, nor did she confess that she had been a sinner.

Quod autem in Bethania rursus fecit, aliud est quod ad Lucae narrationem non pertinet; sed pariter narratur a reliquis tribus. Quod ergo Matthaeus et Marcus caput domini unguento illo perfusum dicunt, Ioannes autem pedes, accipiamus non solum caput, sed etiam pedes domini perfudisse mulierem; nisi forte quoniam Marcus fracto alabastro perfusum caput commemorat, tam quisquam calumniosus est ut in vase fracto neget aliquid remanere potuisse, unde etiam pedes domini perfunderet. Sed religiosius contendet aliquis non ita fractum esse ut totum effunderet; vel prius accipiat perfusos pedes, antequam illud fractum esset, ut in integro remaneret unde etiam caput perfunderetur.
          <td><span style="color:blue">Augustine</span> , de Con. Evan., ii, 79: I however think that nothing else can be meant, but that the sinner who then came to the feet of Jesus was none other than the same Mary who did this twice; once, as Luke relates it, when coming for the first time with humility and tears she merited the remission of her sins. For John also relates this, when he began to speak of the raising of Lazarus before He came to Bethany, saying, "It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped His feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick." [John 11:2] But what she again did at Bethany is another act, unrecorded by Luke, but mentioned in the same way by the other three Evangelists. In that therefore Matthew and Mark say that the head of the Lord was anointed by the woman, whilst John says the feet, we must understand that both the head and the feet were anointed by the woman. Unless because Mark has said that she broke the box in order to anoint His head, any one is so fond of cavilling as to deny that, because the box was broken, any could remain to anoint the feet of the Lord. But a man of a more pious spirit will contend that it was not broken so as to pour out the whole, or else that the feet were anointed before it was broken, so that there remained in the unbroken box enough to anoint the head.

Quamvis autem pinguis sit, tamen redolet ut cupressus, aspero sapore, folio parvo densoque, cuius cacumina in aristas se spargunt; ideoque gemina dote pigmentarii nardi spicas ac folia celebrant. Et hoc est quod ait Marcus unguenti nardi pistici pretiosi: quia videlicet unguentum illud quod attulit Maria domino, non solum de radice confectum est nardi, verum etiam, quo pretiosius esset, spicarum quoque et foliorum eius, adiectione odoris ac virtutis illius erat accumulata gratia.

Nard is an aromatic shrub of a large and thick root, but short, black and brittle; though unctuous, it smells like cypress, and has a sharp taste, and small and dense leaves. Its tops spread themselves out like ears of corn, therefore, its gift being double, perfumers make much of the spikes and the leaves of the nard. And this is what is meant by Mark, when he says "spikenard very precious", that is, the ointment which Mary brought for the Lord was not made of the root of nard, but even, what made it more precious, by the addition of the spikes and the leaves, the gratefulness of its smell and virtue was augmented.

[John 12:1] But those persons who are troubled by this, are not aware that Matthew and Mark do not place that anointing in Bethany immediately after that two days of which he foretold, but by way of recapitulation at the time when there were yet six days to the Passover.

It is called pistic nard, that is, faithful and precious. The house filled with the smell of it is heaven and earth; the broken alabaster box is carnal desire, which is broken at the Head, from which the whole body is framed together, whilst He was reclining, that is, humbling Himself, that the faith of the sinner might be able to reach Him, for she went up from the feet to the head, and down from the head to the feet by faith, that is, to Christ and to His members. It goes on: "And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this loss of the ointment?" By the figure synecdoche, one is put for many, and many for one; for it is the lost Judas who finds loss in salvation; thus in the fruitful vine rises the snare of death. Under the cover of his avarice, however, the mystery of faith speaks; for our faith is bought for three hundred pence, in our ten senses (denarii, i.e. ten senses), that is, our inward and outward senses which are again trebled by our body, soul and spirit.

Judas, however, was indignant, but not with the same feeling, but on account of his love of money, and filthy gain; [p. 278] wherefore John also records him alone, as accusing the woman with a fraudulent intent. But he says, "They murmured against her," meaning that they troubled her with reproaches, and hard words. Then Our Lord reproves His disciples, for throwing obstacles against the wish of the woman. Wherefore it goes on: "And Jesus said, Let her alone, why trouble ye her?" For after she had brought her gift, they wished to prevent her purpose by their reproaches.

But he says not Judas the traitor, that he may teach us to be guiltless of detraction, and to avoid accusing others. In that however he says, "one of the twelve", he enhanced the detestable guilt of the traitor; for there were seventy other disciples, these however were not so intimate with Him, nor admitted to such familiar intercourse.

All the disciples then are touched by the Lord; so that there is amongst them the harmony of the harp, all the well attuned strings answer with accordant tone; for it goes on: "And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto Him one by one, Is it I?" One of them however, unstrung, and steeped in the love of money, said, "Is it I, Lord?", as Matthew testifies.

But Judas does not withdraw his foot from his traitorous design though once and again pointed at, wherefore his punishment is foretold, that the death denounced upon him might correct him, whom shame could not overcome; wherefore it goes on: "The Son of Man indeed goeth, as it is written of Him."

But the bread is not a mere figure of the Body of Christ, but is changed into the very Body of Christ. For the Lord said, "The bread which I give you is My Flesh." But the Flesh of Christ is veiled from our eyes on account of our weakness, for bread and wine are things to which we are accustomed, if however we saw flesh and blood we could not bear to take them. For this reason the Lord bending Himself to our weakness keeps the forms of bread and wine, but changes the bread and wine into the reality of His Body and Blood.

Hoc verbo quod dicit hoc est corpus meum, proposita consecrantur; et sicut illa vox quae dicit: crescite et multiplicamini, et replete terram, semel quidem dicta est, sed omni tempore sentit effectum ad generationem operante natura, ita et vox ista semel quidem dicta est, sed per omnes mensas Ecclesiae usque in hodiernum diem et usque ad eius adventum praestat sacrificio firmitatem.

For it is not man who makes the offerings to be the Body and Blood of Christ, but Christ Who was crucified for us. The words are spoken by the mouth of the Priest, and are consecrated by the power and the grace of God. By this word which He spoke, "This is My Body", the offerings are consecrated; and as that word which says, "Increase and multiply, and fill the earth," [Gen 1:28] was sent forth but once, yet has its effect throughout all time, when nature does the work of generation; so also that voice was spoken once, yet gives confirmation to the Sacrifice through all the tables of The Church even to this day, even to His advent.

Sanguine namque agni servantur domus a percussione Angeli, et aqua maris rubri extinguuntur inimici; quae sunt mysteria Ecclesiae Christi; unde sequitur et accepto calice, gratias agens dedit eis; gratia enim et non meritis salvati sumus a Deo.

I'seudo-Hier]. For by the blood of the lamb our houses are preserved from the smiting of the Angel, and our enemies perish in the waters of the Red Sea, which are the Sacraments of the Church of Christ. Wherefore it goes on: "And He took the cup, and when He had given thanks, He gave it to them." For we are saved by the grace of the Lord, not by our own [p. 287] deserts.

He therefore gave thanks, Who took upon Him the stripes of other men's wickedness; He Who did nothing worthy of smiting, humbly gives a blessing in His Passion, to shew us, what each should do when beaten for his own sins, since He Himself bore calmly the stripes due to the sin of others; furthermore to shew us, what we who are the subjects of the Father should do under correction, when He Who is His equal gave thanks under the lash.

For on the testimony of John, the waters are the people, [Rev 17:15] and it is not lawful for any one to offer either wine alone, or water alone, lest such an oblation should mean that the head may be severed from the members, and either that Christ could suffer without love for our redemption, and that we can be saved or be offered to the Father without His Passion.

But He drank it "new", that is, in a new and strange manner, for He had not a body subject to suffering, and requiring food, but immortal and incorruptible. We may also understand it in this way. The vine is the Lord Himself. By the offspring (genimen) of the vine is meant mysteries, and the secret understanding, which He Himself begets (gererat), Who teaches man knowledge. But in the kingdom of God, that is, in the world to come, He will drink with His disciples mysteries and knowledge, teaching us new things, and revealing what He now hides.

[Isa 5:7] The Lord therefore when about to go to His Passion, says, "I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine," as if He had said openly, I will no longer delight in the carnal rites of the synagogue, in which also these rites of the Paschal Lamb have held the chief place. For the time of My Resurrection shall come, that day shall come, when in the kingdom of Heaven, that is, raised on high with the glory of immortal life, I will be filled with a new joy, together with you, for the salvation of the same people born again of the fountain of spiritual grace.

Again, if he had finished the entire threefold denial before the cock began to crow, Mark would in the person of the Lord seem to have said needlessly, "Before the cock crow twice, thou shall deny Me thrice." But because that threefold denial began before the first cock-crowing, the other three did not notice when Peter was to finish it, but how great it was to be, that is, threefold, and when it was to begin, that is, before the cock crew, although the whole was conceived in his mind, even before the first cock crew; but Mark has related more plainly the interval between his words themselves.

By which He sufficiently shows that the words, "if it be possible," must be understood not of any impossibility, but of the Will of His Father. As to what Mark relates that He said not only Father, but "Abba, Father", Abba is the Hebrew for Father. And perhaps the Lord said both words, on account of some Sacrament contained in them; wishing to shew that He had taken upon Himself that sorrow in the person of His body, The Church, to which He was made the chief cornerstone, and which came to Him, partly from the Hebrews, who are represented by the word, "Abba", partly from the Gentiles, to whom "Father" belongs.

But remembering why He was sent, He accomplishes the dispensation for which He was sent, and cries out, "But not what I Will, but what Thou Wilt." As if He had said, If death can die, without My dying according to the flesh, let this cup pass away; but since this cannot be otherwise, "not what I Will, but what [p. 295] Thou Wilt." Many still are sad at the prospect of death, but let them keep their heart right, and avoid death as much as they can; but if they cannot, then let them say what the Lord said of us.

But in proportion as we are confident from the ardour of our mind, so let us fear from the weakness of our flesh. For this place makes against those, who say that there was but one operation in the Lord and one Will. For He shews two wills, one human, which from the weakness of the flesh shrinks from suffering; one divine, which is most ready.

By this learn the weakness of men, and [p. 296] let us not, whom even sleep can overcome, promise things which are impossible to us. Therefore He goes away the third time to pray the prayer mentioned above. Wherefore it goes on: "And He cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest." He is not vehement against them, though after His rebuke they had done worse, but He tells them ironically, "Sleep on now, and take your rest," because He knew that the betrayer was now close at hand. And that He spoke ironically is evident, by what is added; "It is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners." He speaks this, as deriding their sleep, as if He had said; Now indeed is a time for sleep, when the traitor is approaching. Then He says; "Arise, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth Me is at hand."

Perhaps he escaped from the hands of those who held him for the time, and afterwards got back his garment and returned, mingling under cover of the darkness with those who were leading Jesus, as though he was one of them, until he arrived at the door of the High Priest, to whom he was known, as he himself testifies in the Gospel. But as Peter, who washed away the sin of his denial with the tears of penitence, shews the recovery of those who fall away in time of martyrdom, so the other disciples who prevented their actual seizure, teach the prudence of flight to those who feel themselves unequal to undergo tortures.

There is also a fire of covetousness, of which it is said, "They are all adulterers as an oven:" [Hosea (Osee) 7:4] this fire, raised up in the hall of Caiaphas by the suggestion of an evil spirit, was arming the tongues of the traitors to deny and blaspheme the Lord. For the fire lit up in the hall amidst the cold of the night was a figure of what the wicked assembly was doing within; for because of the abounding of iniquity the love of many waxes cold. [Matt 24:12] Peter, who for a time was benumbed by this cold, wished as it were to be warmed by the coals of the servants of Caiaphas, because He sought in the society of traitors the consolation of worldly comfort.

He therefore calls chief priests those who had finished the time alloted to them, and had been stripped of their priesthood. But their actions are a sign of their judgment, which they carried on as they had prejudged, for they sought for a witness, that they might seem to condemn and destroy Jesus with justice.

There follows: "And there arose certain, and bare false witness against Him, saying, We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands." It is usual with heretics out of the truth to extract the shadow; He did not say what they said, but something like it, of the temple of His body, which He raised again after two days.

Wherefore it is said, "And the High Priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?"

The High Priest indeed puts this question, not that he might learn of Him and believe, but in order to seek occasion against Him.

Sequitur at ille iterum negavit. Iam Petrus redierat ut, quemadmodum dicit Ioannes, ad focum stans iterum negaret: unde ancilla dicebat quod dictum est, non illi, scilicet Petro, sed his qui illo exeunte ibi remanserant; sic tamen ut ille audiret; unde rediens et rursus ad ignem stans resistebat negando verbis eorum. Liquido enim colligitur collatis de hac re omnibus Evangelistarum testimoniis, non ante ianuam secundo Petrum negasse, sed intus in atrio ad ignem; Matthaeum autem et Marcum, qui commemoraverunt exisse eum foras, regressum eius brevitatis causa tacuisse.

Williams on the Passion, p.101]: This maid is not the same, but another, as Matthew says. Indeed, we must also understand, that in this second denial he was addressed by two persons, that is, by the maid whom Matthew and Mark mention, and by another person, of whom Luke takes notice. It goes on: "And he denied it again." Peter had now returned, for John says that he denied Him again standing at the fire; wherefore the maid said what has been mentioned above, not to him, that is, Peter, but to those who, when he went out, had remained, in such a way however that he heard it; wherefore coming back and standing again at the fire, he contradicted them, and denied their words. For it is evident, if we compare the accounts of all the Evangelists on [p. 307] this matter, that Peter did not the second time deny Him before the porch, but within the palace at the fire, whilst Matthew and Mark who mention his having gone out are silent, for the sake of brevity, as to his return.

Negavit ergo Christum cum se negavit eius discipulum. Sequitur et post pusillum rursus qui adstabant dicebant Petro: vero ex illis es: nam et Galilaeus es. Non quod alia lingua Galilaei quam Hierosolymitae loquerentur, qui utique fuerunt Hebraei; sed quod unaquaeque provincia et regio suas habeat proprietates, ac vernaculum loquendi sonum vitare non possint.
          <td><span style="color:blue">Bede</span> : By this denial of Peter we learn, that not only he denied Christ, who says that He is not the Christ, but he also, who although he is a Christian, denies himself to be such. For the Lord did not say to Peter, Thou shalt deny thyself to be my disciple, but, "Thou shalt deny me;" he therefore denied Christ, when he said that he was not His disciple. There follows: "And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them, for thou art a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth thereto." Not that the Galilaeans spoke a different tongue from the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for they were both Hebrews, but that each province and region has its own peculiarities, and cannot avoid a vernacular pronunciation.

          <td><span style="color:blue">Theophylact</span> : Therefore Peter was seized with fear, and forgetting the word of the Lord, which said, "Whosoever shall confess Me before men, him will I confess before My Father," [Matt 30:32] he denied our Lord. Wherefore there follows: "But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak."

          <td><span style="color:blue">Bede</span> : How hurtful it is to speak with the wicked. He denies before infidels that he knows the Man, whom amongst the disciples, he had confessed to be God. But the Scripture is wont to point out a Sacrament of the causes of things, by the state of the time; thus Peter, who denied at midnight, repented at cock crew. Wherefore it is added: "And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word which Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crew twice, thou shalt deny me thrice."
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">

Confundantur itaque Novatiani, qui dicunt, quod qui post susceptionem Baptismatis peccaverit, non suscipitur ut sibi delictum remittatur. Ecce enim Petrus, qui et Christi corpus sumpsit et sanguinem, per poenitentiam est susceptus. Etenim sanctorum defectus propter hoc scripti sunt, ut et nos si per incautelam deciderimus, recursum habeamus per eorum exemplum, et speremus per poenitentiam sublevari.

Confounded then be the Novatians, who say that he who sins after receiving baptism is not received to the remission of his sin. For behold Peter, who had also received the Body and Blood of the Lord, is received by penitence; for the failings of saints are written, that if we fall by want of caution, we also may be able to run back through their example, and hope to be relieved by penitence.

          <td><span style="color:blue">Pseudo-Jerome</span> : But in a mystical sense, the first maid means the wavering, the second, the assent, the third man is the act. This [p. 308] is the threefold denial which the remembrance of the word of the Lord washes away through tears. The cock then crows for us when some preacher stirs up our hearts by repentance to compunction. We then begin to weep, when we are set on fire within by the spark of knowledge, and we go forth, when we cast out what we were within.

          <td><b>Augustinus de Cons. Evang</b> : Nulla quaestio est quod Matthaeus tacet ipsos petiisse ut aliquis eis dimitteretur, quod Marcus hic dicit. Nihil enim interest si alius aliud tacet, quod alius commemorat. Sequitur Pilatus ergo respondit, et dixit: vultis dimittam vobis regem Iudaeorum? Sciebat enim quod per invidiam tradidissent eum summi sacerdotes. Quaeri potest quae verba Pilatus dixerit, utrum quae a Matthaeo, an quae a Marco referuntur? Aliud enim videtur esse: quem vultis dimittam vobis: Barabbam, an Iesum qui dicitur Christus? Ut Matthaeus refert; aliud: vultis vobis dimittam regem Iudaeorum? Ut hic dicitur. Sed quia christos reges dicebant, et qui dixit: illum an illum, manifestum est eum quaesisse an vellent dimitti regem Iudaeorum, idest Christum. Nihil autem interest sententiae quod hic tacuit Marcus de Barabba, hoc solum volens dicere quod ad dominum pertinebat; quandoquidem in eorum responsione satis et ipse ostendit quem sibi dimitti voluerint; nam sequitur pontifices autem concitaverunt turbam, ut magis Barabbam dimitteret eis.
          <td><span style="color:blue">Augustine</span> : No one can feel it a difficulty that Matthew is silent as to their asking some one to be released unto them, which Mark here mentions; for it is a thing of no consequence that one should mention a [p. 312] thing which another leaves out. There follows: "But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews? For he knew that the Chief Priests had delivered Him for envy." Some one may ask, which were the words of which Pilate made use, those which are related by Matthew, or those which Mark relates; for there seems to be a difference between, "Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?" as Matthew has it; and, "Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?" as is here said. But since they gave to kings the name of Christs, he who said this man or that must have asked whether they wished the King of the Jews to be released unto them, that is, Christ. It makes no difference to the sense that Mark has said nothing of Barabbas, wishing only to mention what belonged to the Lord, since by their answer he sufficiently shewed whom they wished to have released to them. For there follows: "But the Chief Priests moved the people that he should rather release unto them Barabbas."
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b> : Haeret Iudaeis usque hodie sua petitio, quam tanto labore impetrarunt: quia enim data sibi optione, pro Iesu latronem, pro salvatore interfectorem elegerunt, merito salutem perdiderunt et vitam, et latrociniis ac seditionibus se intantum subdiderunt ut patriam regnumque suum, quod plus Christo amaverunt, perdiderint; et libertatem, corpus et animam numquam receperint. Deinde aliam occasionem dat Pilatus liberandi salvatorem, cum sequitur Pilatus autem respondens ait illis: quid ergo vultis faciam regi Iudaeorum?
          <td><span style="color:blue">Bede</span> : This demand which the Jews made with such toil to themselves still sticks to them. Because, when the choice was given to them, they chose a robber instead of Christ, a murderer instead of the Saviour, they deservedly lost their salvation and their life, and they subjected themselves to such a degree to robbery and sedition, that they lost their country and their kingdom which they preferred to Christ, and never regained their liberty, body or soul. Then Pilate gives another opportunity of releasing the Saviour, when there follows, "And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I should do unto the King of the Jews?"

          <td><b>Augustinus de Cons.

          <td><span style="color:blue">Augustine</span> : It now is clear enough that Mark means by "King of the Jews" what Matthew means by the word, "Christ"; for no kings but those of the Jews were called Christs. For in this place according to Matthew it is said, "What then shall I do with Jesus which is called Christ?" [Matt 27:22] There follows: "And they cried out again, "Crucify him!"

          <td><span style="color:blue">Theophylact</span> : Now see the wickedness of the Jews, and the moderation of Pilate, though he too was worthy of condemnation for not resisting the people. For they cried out, "Crucify"; he faintly tries to save Jesus from their determined sentence, and again puts a question to them. Wherefore there follows: "Then Pilate said unto them, "Why, [p. 313] what evil hath he done?" For he wished in this way to find an opportunity for releasing Christ, who was innocent.

Wherefore it goes on, "And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him!," that those words of the Prophet Jeremiah might be fulfilled, "Mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest, it crieth out against me." [Jer 12:8] There follows: "And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged Him, to be crucified."

The Lord's portion is always slain; the devil's part, (for he is the master of those men, which is the meaning of Barabbas,) when freed, is cast headlong into hell.

          <td><span style="color:blue">Bede</span> : We must understand that Jesus was scourged by no other than Pilate himself. For John writes: "Pilate took Jesus, and scourged Him," [John 19:1] which we must suppose that he did, that the Jews might be satisfied with Him pains and insults, and cease from thirsting for His blood.

There are some also in this day, who adore Him, with a sure faith, as very God, but by their perverse actions, despise His words as though they were fabulous, and think the promises of that word inferior to worldly allurements.

Whence also Simon is fitly interpreted 'obedient', and Cyrene 'an heir'. But he is said to come from a country place, for a country place is called 'pagos' in Greek, wherefore those whom we see to be aliens from the city of God, we call pagans. Simon then coming out from the country carries the cross after Jesus, when the Gentile nations leaving pagan rights embrace obediently the footsteps of our Lord's Passion. There follows: "And they bring Him unto the place Golgotha, which is being interpreted, the place of Calvary." There are places without the city and the gate, in which the heads of condemned persons are cut off, and which receive the name of Calvary, that is, of the beheaded. But the Lord was crucified there, that where once was the field of the condemned, there the standards of martyrdom might be lifted up.

In this place salvation is figured by the wood; the first wood was that of the tree of knowledge of good and evil; the second wood is one of unmixed good for us, and is the wood of life. The first hand stretched out to the wood caught hold of death; the second found again the life which had been lost. By this wood we are carried through a stormy sea to the land of the living, for by His cross Christ has taken away our torment, and by His death has killed our death. With the form of a serpent [ed. note: This clause is not in Pseudo-Jerome; its obscurity may be cleared up by comparing it with a passage in St. Augustine's sixth sermon, where it is said that the serpent signifies death, and that Moses' rod was changed into a serpent because our Lord took upon Himself death for us. In St. Gregory Naziyasen, the serpent is said to signify sin, de vita Mosis, p.193, v. also St. Ambrose, de Spiritu Sancto 3, 50.] He kills the serpent, for the serpent made out of the rod swallowed up the other serpents. But what means the shape itself of the cross, save the four quarters of the world; the East shines from the top, the North is on the right, the South on the left, the West is firmly fixed under the feet. Wherefore the Apostle says: "That we may know what is the height, and breadth, and length, and depth." [Eph 3:18] Birds, when they fly in the air, take the shape of a cross; a man swimming in the waters is borne up by the form of a cross. A ship is blown along by its yards, which are in the shape of the cross. The letter Tan is written as the sign of salvation and of the cross.

Hora erat quasi sexta cum traditus est crucifigendus a Pilato sedente pro tribunali, ut dictum est: non enim iam plena sexta erat, sed quasi sexta, idest peracta quinta, et aliquid etiam de sexta esse coeperat, ut peracta quinta et inchoata sexta, gererentur haec quae narrata sunt in crucifixione domini nostri, donec completa sexta, illo pendente fierent hae quae dicuntur tenebrae.

          <td><span style="color:blue">Augustine</span> , de. Con. Evan., iii, 13: If Jesus was given up to the Jews to be crucified, when Pilate sat down at his tribunal about the sixth hour, as John relates, how could He be crucified at the third hour, as many persons have thought from not understanding the words of Mark. First then let us see at what hour He might have been crucified, then we shall see why Mark said that He was crucified at the third hour. It was about the sixth hour when He was given up to be crucified by Pilate sitting on his judgment seat, as has been said, for it was not yet fully the sixth hour, but about the sixth, that is, the [p. 320] fifth was over, and some of the sixth had begun, so that those things which are related to the crucifixion of our Lord took place after the finishing of the fifth, and at the commencement of the sixth, until, when the sixth was completed and He was hanging on the cross, the darkness which is spoken of took place. Let us now consider, why Mark has said, "It was the third hour." He had already said positively, "And when they had crucified Him, they parted His garments;" as also the others declare, that when He was crucified His garments were divided. Now if Mark had wished to fix the time of what was done, it would have been enough to say, "And it was the third hour," why did He add, "and they crucified Him," unless it was that he wished to point to something which had gone before, and which if enquired into would be explained, since that same Scripture was to be read at a time, when it was known to the whole Church at what hour our Lord was crucified, by which means any error might be taken away, and any falsehood be refuted. But because he knew that the Lord was fixed to the cross not by the Jews but by the soldiers, as John very plainly shews, he wished to intimate that the Jews had crucified Him, since they cried out, "Crucify Him," rather than those who executed the orders of their chief according to their duty. It is therefore implied, that it took place at the third hour when the Jews cried out, "Crucify Him," and it is most truly shewn that they crucified Him, when they so cried out. But in the attempt of Pilate to save the Lord, and the tumultuous opposition of the Jews, we understand that a space of two hours was consumed, and that the sixth hour had begun, before the end of which, those things occurred which are related to have taken place from the time when Pilate gave up the Lord, and the darkness overspread the earth. Now he who will apply himself to these things, without the hard-heartedness of impiety, will see that Mark has fitly placed it at the third hour, in the same place as the deed of the soldiers who were the executors of it is related. Therefore lest any one should transfer in his thoughts so great a crime from the Jews to the soldiers, he says "it was the third hour, and they crucified Him," that the fault might rather by a careful enquirer be charged to them, who, as he would find, had at the third hour cried out for His crucifixion, [p. 321] whilst at the same time it would be seen that what was done by the soldiers was done at the sixth hour.

          <td><span style="color:blue">Augustine</span> : Still there are not wanting persons who assert that the preparation, mentioned by John, "Now it was the preparation about the sixth hour," was really the third hour of the day. For they say that on that day before the sabbath day, there was a preparation of the passover of the Jews, because on that sabbath, they began the unleavened bread; but however that the true passover, which is now celebrated on the day of our Lord's Passion, that is, the Christian not the Jewish passover, began to be prepared, or to have its "parasceue", from that sixth hour of the night, when His death began to be prepared by the Jews; for "parasceue" means preparation. Between that hour therefore of the night and His crucifixion occurs the sixth hour of preparation, according to John, and the third hour of the day, according to Mark. What Christian would not give in to this solution of the question, provided that we could find some circumstance, from which we might gather that this preparation of our Passover, that is, of the death of Christ, began at the ninth hour of the night? For if we say that it began when our Lord was taken by the Jews, it was still early in the night, but if when our Lord was carried away to the house of the father in law of Caiaphas, where also He was heard by the chief priests, the cock had not crowed; but if when He was given up to Pilate, it is very plain that it was morning. It remains therefore that we must understand the preparation of our Lord's death to have commenced when all the Chief Priests pronounced, "He is guilty of death." For there is nothing absurd in supposing that was the ninth hour of the night, so that we may understand that Peter's denial is put out of its order after it really happened.

Sed ipse Dei verus existens filius non descendit: si enim descendere debuisset, non illuc a principio ascendisset; sed quia videbat quod per hunc modum salutem fieri oportebat, sustinuit crucifigi et multa alia pati, et perficere opus suum.

But the devil moved them to bid Him come down from the Cross; for he knew that salvation was being won by the Cross, therefore he again proceeded to tempt Christ, so that if He came down from the Cross, he might be certain that He is not truly the Son of God, and so the salvation, which is by the Cross, might be done away. But He being truly the Son of God, did not come down; for if He ought to have come down, He would not have ascended there at all; but since He saw that in this way salvation must be effected, He underwent the crucifixion, and many other sufferings, unto the finishing of His work. It goes on: "Likewise also the Chief Priests mocking said among themselves with the Scribes, He saved others, himself he cannot save." They said this, to do away with His miracles, as though those which He had done were but the semblance of them, for by working miracles He saved many.

Et notandum, quod recedente a centro mundi sole, crucifixus est dominus; oriente autem sole, resurrectionis suae mysteria celebravit: quia mortuus est propter peccata nostra, et resurrexit propter iustificationem nostram. Nec mireris verborum humilitatem, querimonias derelicti, cum formam servi scias, scandalum crucis videas. Sicut enim esurire et sitire et fatigari, non erant propria deitatis, sed corporales passiones; ita quod dicitur, ut quid dereliquisti me? Corporalis vocis erat proprium: quia solet secundum naturam corpus nullatenus velle a sibi coniuncta vita fraudari. Licet enim ipse salvator dicebat hoc; sed proprie ostendebat corporis fragilitatem: ut homo ergo loquitur in eos circumferens motus, quod in periculis positi a domino deseri nos putemus.
          <td><span style="color:blue">Bede</span> : For when Adam sinned, it is also written that he heard the voice of the Lord, walking in paradise, in the cool after mid-day [Gen 3:8]; and in that hour when the first Adam by sinning brought death into the world, in that same hour the second Adam by dying destroyed death. And we must observe, that our Lord was crucified, when the sun was going away from the center of the world; but at sunrise He celebrated the Mysteries of His Resurrection; because He died for our sins, but rose again for our justification. Nor need you wonder at the lowliness of His words, at the complaints as of one forsaken, when you look on the offense of the cross, knowing the form of a servant. For as hunger, and thirst, and fatigue were not things proper to the Divinity, but bodily afflictions; so His saying, "Why hast Thou forsaken me?" was proper to a bodily voice, for the body is never naturally wont to wish to be separated from the life which is joined to it. For although our Saviour Himself said this, He really shewed the weakness of His body; He spoke therefore as man, bearing about with Him my feelings, for when placed in danger we fancy that we are deserted by God.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b> : Vel hoc loquitur homo crucifixus Deo pro me: nos enim homines sumus derelicti, ipse numquam a patre derelictus fuit: audi enim quid dicit Ioannes: non sum solus, sed pater mecum est. Etsi etiam hoc pro Iudaeis dixerit quasi et ipse secundum carnem Iudaeus existens; ac si diceret: ut quid Hebraicum populum dereliquisti, ut tuum crucifigerent filium? Sicut enim aliquando consuevimus dicere: Deus induit me, idest meam naturam, scilicet humanam; sic et hic, dereliquisti me, oportet intelligere humanam naturam, vel Iudaicum populum.

For hear what He says; "I am not along, because the Father is with me." [John 16:32] Though He may also have said this as being a Jew, according to the flesh, as though He had said, Why hast thou forsaken the Jewish people, so that they have crucified Thy Son? For as we sometimes say, God has put on me, that is, my human nature, so here also we must understand "Thou hast forsaken me," to mean my nature, or the Jewish people.

It goes on: "And one ran and filled a sponge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave Him to drink, saying, Let along; let us see whether Elias will come to take Him down." John shews more fully the reason why the vinegar was given to the Lord to drink, saying, that Jesus said, "I thirst," [John 19:28] that the Scriptures might be fulfilled.

For at first the souls of all were held in hell, till He came, who preached the opening of the prison to the captives.

Hoc etiam et templum animatum, scilicet corpus Christi, ostendit, in cuius passione vestimentum eius laceratum est, scilicet caro. Et aliud etiam significat: caro namque velum est nostri templi, scilicet mentis nostrae; virtus autem carnis scissa est in Christi passionibus a summo usque deorsum, scilicet ab Adam usque ad ultimos homines: nam et Adam effectus est sanus per passionem Christi, et eius caro non manet sub maledicto, neque digna est corruptione: sed omnes incorruptione honorati sumus.

This also is a figure of the living temple, that is, the body of Christ, in whose Passion His garment is torn, that is, His flesh. Again, it means another thing; for the flesh is the veil of our temple, that is, of our mind. But the power of the flesh is torn in the Passion of Christ, from the top to the bottom, that is, from Adam even down to the latest man; for also Adam was made whole by the Passion of Christ, and his flesh does not remain under the curse, nor does it deserve corruption, but we all are gifted with incorruption. "And when the centurion who stood over against Him saw." He who commands a hundred soldiers is called a centurion. But seeing that He died with such power as the Lord, he wondered and confessed.

[John 19:25] And he seems to call her Mary of Cleophas, from her father or some relation. But he was called James the Less, to distinguish him from James the Great, that is, the son of Zebedee, who was called amongst the first of the Apostles by our Lord. Further, it was a Jewish custom, nor was it thought blamable after the manners of an ancient people, that women should furnish to teachers food and clothing out of their substance. Wherefore there follows: "Who also when He was in Galilee followed Him, and ministered unto Him." They ministered unto the Lord of their substance, that He might reap their carnal things whose spiritual things they reaped, and that He might shew forth a type for all masters, who ought to be content with food and clothing from their disciples. But let us see what companions He had with Him, for it goes on: "And many other women which came up with Him into Jerusalem."

Sabbato autem in sepulcro quiescens, resurrectionis, quae octava die ventura erat, expectabat eventum. Sic et nos in hac quidem saeculi aetate mundo necesse est crucifigi; in septima vero die, idest cum mortis quis debitum solvit, corpora quidem in tumulis, animas autem secreta in pace cum domino post bona opera oportet quiescere, donec octava aetate etiam corpora ipsa resurrectione glorificata cum animabus incorruptionem accipiant.

          <td><span style="color:blue">Bede</span> : What is called "parasceue" in Greek, is in Latin "praeparatio"; by which name those Jews, who lived amongst Greeks, used to call the sixth day of the week, because on that day they used to prepare what was necessary for the rest of the sabbath day. Because then man was made on the sixth day, but on the seventh the Creator rested from all His work, fitly was our Saviour crucified on the sixth day, and thus fulfilled the mystery of man's restoration. But on the sabbath, resting in the tomb, He was waiting for the event of the Resurrection, which was to come on the eighth day. So we must also in this age of time be crucified to the world; but in the seventh day, that is, when a man has paid the debt to death, our bodies indeed must rest in the grave, but our souls after good works in hidden peace with God; till in the eighth period, even our [p. 330] bodies themselves, glorified in the resurrection, receive incorruption together with our souls. But the man who buried the body of the Lord must needs by his righteous merits have been worthy, and by the nobility of worldly power able to perform this service. Therefore it is said, "An honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God." He is called in Latin, "decurio", because he is of the order of the "curia", and served the office of a provincial magistracy; this officer was also called "curialis", from his care of civic duties. Arimathaea is the same as Ramathain, the city of Elkanah and Samuel.

Hence it became a custom in the Church that the sacrifice of the altar should not be celebrated in silk, or in a dyed cloth, but in linen produced from the earth, just as the body of the Lord was wrapped in clean linen; as, we read in the Pontifical acts, it was ordered by the blessed [p. 331] Sylvester [ed. note: St. Sylvester was Pope from 314 to 335. On his decree respecting the Corporal used in the celebration of the Holy Eucharist, see Bona de Rebns Lit., i.e. 25. 11]. Though it has also another meaning, that he who receives Jesus in a pure mind wraps Him in a clean linen. There follows: "And laid Him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre." It is said that the sepulchre of the Lord is a round cell, hewn out of the rock which was around it, so high, that a man standing upright could scarcely touch the roof with his outstretched hand; and it has an entrance to the east, to which the great stone was rolled, and placed upon it. In the northern part of it is the tomb itself, that is, the place where our Lord's body lay, made of the same rock, seven feet in length, raised three palms higher than the floor. It is not open from above, but on the south side, the whole of which is open, and through which the body was brought in.

But on the day of the "parasceue", that is, of the preparation, the holy women, that [p. 332] is, humble souls, do the same, when they burn with love for the Saviour, and diligently follow the steps of His Passion in this life, where their future rest is to be prepared; and they weigh with a pious minuteness the order in which His Passion was accomplished, if perchance they be able to imitate it.

'One who works with a hammer,' that is, he who subdues the iron nations, that he may rule them with a rod of iron. It seeks for the Sacrifice, that is, the Viaticum, which is given to penitents at their last end, and wraps it up in a heart clean and dead to sin; it makes it firm in the safeguard of faith, and shuts it up with the covering of hope, through works of charity; (for the end of the commandment is charity; [1 Tim 1:5]) whilst the elect, who are the stars of the sea, are looking on from afar, for, if it be possible, the very elect shall be offended.

For when the day is dawning, the remains of darkness lessen in proportion as the light grows brighter; and we must not take the words "very early in the morning, at the rising of the sun," to mean that the sun himself was seen upon the earth, but as expressing the near approach of the sun into those parts, that is, when his rising begins to light up the sky.

For that which He has related, "Early the first day of the week He appeared to Mary Magdalene," and "after that to two of them as they walked and went into the country," we know took place in Jerusalem, on the very day of the resurrection; then he comes to His last manifestation, which we know was on the Mount of Olives, not far from Jerusalem. Mark therefore never relates the fulfilment of that which was foretold by the Angel; but Matthew does not mention any place at all, where the disciples saw the Lord after He arose, except Galilee, according to the Angel's prophecy. But since it is not set down when this happened, whether first, before He was seen any where else, and since the very place where Matthew says that He went into Galilee to the mountain, does not explain the day, or the order of the narration, Matthew does not oppose the account of the others, but assists in explaining and receiving them.

But by this name are understood not only villages, but also boroughs and country towns, because they are without the city, which is the head and mother of all the rest. That which Mark expresses by the Lord's appearance "in another form," is what Luke means by saying that "their eye were holden that they could not know Him."

There follows: "And they went and told it unto the residue, neither believed they them." How are we to understand the words of Mark compared with the account of Luke, that they then said, "The Lord hath risen indeed, and hath appeared unto Simon," [Luke 24:34] if we do not suppose that there were some there who would not believe?

And when it was told, the disciples did not believe, because they saw, like Moses, that which was not enough for them, for he said, "Shew me Thyself;" [Ex 33:18] forgetting his flesh, he prays in this life for that which we hope for in the life to come.

Numquid nam tunc exprobraturus erat, quod non credidissent eis qui eum viderant resurrexisse, quando iam et ipsi post resurrectionem toties eum viderant? Restat igitur ut intelligamus, nunc Marcum breviter commemorare voluisse, et iam dixisse novissime, quia ipso die hoc novissimum fuit iam incipiente nocturno tempore, posteaquam discipuli de castello redierunt in Ierusalem, et invenerunt, sicut dicit Lucas, undecim, et qui cum illis erant colloquentes de resurrectione domini. Sed erant ibi utique non credentes. His ergo, sicut Marcus dicit, discumbentibus, et adhuc inde, sicut dicit Lucas, loquentibus, stetit in medio eorum dominus, et ait illis: pax vobis, sicut Lucas et Ioannes dicunt. Verbis itaque domini, quae tunc eum locutum esse discipulis, Lucas Ioannesque dixerunt, interponitur et illa exprobratio de qua Marcus hic dicit. Sed hoc rursus movet: quomodo discumbentibus undecim, dicit apparuisse Marcus, si illud tempus est diei dominici iam noctis initio; cum aperte Ioannes dicat non cum eis fuisse Thomam, quem credimus exiisse inde antequam dominus ad eos intraret, posteaquam illi duo redeuntes de castello cum ipsis undecim collocuti sunt, sicut apud Lucam invenitur. Sed Lucas in sua narratione dat locum quo possit intelligi, dum haec loquerentur, prius inde exiisse Thomam, et postea dominum intrasse. Marcus autem qui dicit novissime discumbentibus illis undecim apparuit, etiam Thomam illic fuisse cogit fateri: nisi forte quamvis uno absente, undecim tamen voluit appellare, quia eadem tunc apostolica societas hoc numero nuncupabatur, antequam Mathias in locum Iudae subrogaretur. Aut si hoc durum est accipere, illud accipiamus, post multas demonstrationes eius, eum novissime recumbentibus undecim apparuisse, idest ipsa quadragesima die. Et quoniam iam erat ab eis ascensurus in caelum, hoc eis illo die magis exprobrare voluisse, quia his qui audierant eum resurrexisse, non crediderant, antequam ipsi eum viderent; cum utique post ascensionem suam praedicantibus Evangelium etiam gentes quae non viderunt fuerant crediturae: post illam quippe exprobrationem ait idem Marcus: et dixit eis: euntes in mundum universum; et infra: qui vero non crediderit, condemnabitur. Hoc ergo praedicaturi, nonne ipsi primitus fuerant obiurgandi, qui antequam dominum vidissent, non crediderunt eis quibus prius apparuisset?
          <td><span style="color:blue">Augustine</span> : But how was this done "the last time?" The last occasion on which the Apostles saw the Lord upon earth happened forty days after the Resurrection; but would He then have upbraided them for not believing those who had seen Him risen, when they themselves had so often seen Him after His Resurrection? It remains therefore that we should understand that Mark wished to say it in few words, and said "for the last time," because it was the last time that He shewed Himself that day, as night was coming on, when the [p. 344] disciples returned from the country into Jerusalem, and found, as Luke says, [Luke 24:33] the eleven and those who were with them, speaking together concerning the Resurrection of our Lord. But there were some there who did not believe; when these then were sitting at meat, (as Mark says,) and were still speaking, (as Luke relates,) "The Lord stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you;" [Luke 24:36] as Luke and John [John 20:19] say. The rebuke therefore which Mark here mentions must have been amongst those words, which Luke and John say, that the Lord at that time spoke to the disciples. But another question is raised, how Mark says that He appeared when the eleven sat at meat, if the time was the first part of the night on the Lord's day, when John plainly says that Thomas was not with them, who, we believe, had gone out, before the Lord came in to them, after those two had returned from the village, and spoken with the eleven, as we find in Luke's Gospel. But Luke in his relation leaves room for supposing that Thomas went out first, while they spoke these things, and that the Lord entered afterwards; Mark however from his saying, "for the last time He appeared to the eleven as they sat at meat," forces us to believe that he was there, unless indeed, though one of them was absent, he chose to call them, the eleven, because the company of the Apostles was then called by this number, before Matthias was chosen into the place of Judas. Or if this be a harsh way of understanding it, let us understand that it means that after many appearances, He shewed Himself for the last time, that is, on the fortieth day, to the Apostles, as they sat at meat, and that since He was about to ascend from them, He rather wished on that day to reprove them for not having believed those who had seen Him risen before seeing Him themselves, because after His ascension even the Gentiles on their preaching were to believe a Gospel, which they had not seen. And so the same Mark immediately after that rebuke says, "And He said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature." And lower down, "He that believeth not shall be condemned." Since then they were to preach this, were not they themselves to be first rebuked, because before they saw the Lord they had not believed those to whom He had first appeared? [p. 345]

For it goes on: "Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature." Every man must be understood by "every creature;" for man partakes something of every creatures; he has existence as have stones, life as trees, feeling as animals, understanding as have Angels. For the Gospel is preached to every creature, because He is taught by it, for whose sake all are created, whom all things are in some way like, and from whom therefore they are not alien. By the name of every creature also every nation of the Gentiles may be meant. For it had been said before, "Go not into the way of the Gentiles." [Matt 10:5] But now it is said, "Preach the Gospel to every creature," so that the preaching of the Apostles which was thrust aside by Judaea, might be an assistance to us, since Judaea had haughtily rejected it, thus witnessing to her own damnation.

In the Church then of our Saviour, children believe by others, as also they drew from others the sins which are remitted to them in baptism.

Multa talia facta in historiis legimus: multos namque venena bibita Christi munita signaculo laedere non valebant. Sequitur super aegros manus imponent, et bene habebunt.
          <td>Theophlyact: That is, they shall scatter before them serpents, whether intellectual or sensible, as it is said, Ye shall tread upon serpents and scorpions, [Luke 10:19] which is understood spiritually. But it may also mean sensible serpents, as when Paul received no hurt from the viper. There follows: "And if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them." We read of many such cases in history, for many persons have drank poison unhurt, by guarding themselves with the sign of Christ. It goes on: "They shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover."

          <td><b>Gregorius in Evang</b> : Numquid autem quia ista signa non facimus, minime credimus? Sed haec necessaria in exordio Ecclesiae fuerunt; ut enim fides cresceret credentium, miraculis fuit nutrienda: quia et nos cum arbusta plantamus, tamdiu eis aquam fundimus, quousque ea in terra convaluisse videamus; at si semel radicem fixerint, a rigando cessamus. Habemus de his signis atque virtutibus quae adhuc subtilius considerare debeamus. Sancta quippe Ecclesia quotidie spiritualiter facit quod tunc per apostolos corporaliter faciebat: nam sacerdotes eius cum per exorcismi gratiam manum credentibus imponunt et habitare malignos spiritus in eorum mentibus contradicunt, quid aliud faciunt, nisi Daemonia eiciunt? Et fideles quique, qui iam saecularia verba derelinquunt, sancta autem mysteria insonant, linguis loquuntur novis: qui dum bonis suis exhortationibus malitiam de alienis cordibus auferunt, serpentes tollunt; et dum pestiferas suasiones audiunt, sed tamen ad operationem pravam minime pertrahuntur, mortiferum est quod bibunt; sed non eis nocebit qui, quoties proximos suos in bono opere infirmari conspiciunt, dum exemplo suae operationis illorum vitam roborant, super aegros manus imponunt ut bene habeant. Quae nimirum miracula tanto maiora sunt quanto spiritualia, et quanto per haec non corpora, sed animae suscitantur.
          <td><span style="color:blue">Greg</span> .: Are we then without faith because we cannot do these signs? Nay, but these things were necessary in the beginning of the Church, for the faith of believers was to be nourished by miracles, that it might increase. Thus we also, when we plant groves, strong in the earth; but when once they have firmly fixed their roots, we leave off irrigating them. These signs and miracles have other things which we ought to consider more minutely. For Holy Church does every day in spirit what then the Apostles did in body; for when her Priests by the grace of exorcism lay their hands on believers, and forbid the evil spirits to dwell in their minds, what do they, but cast out devils? And the faithful who have left earthly words, and whose tongues sound forth the Holy Mysteries, speak a new language; they who by their good warnings take away evil from the hearts of others, take up serpents; and when they are hearing words of pestilent persuasion, without being at all drawn aside to evil doing, they drink a deadly thing, but it will never hurt them; whenever they see their neighbours growing weak in good works, and by their good example strengthen their life, they lay their hands on the sick, that they may recover. And all these miracles are greater in proportion as they are spiritual, and by them souls and not bodies are raised.

Sed quia ea quae supra diximus, magis suadent novissimum diem fuisse, ideo post praemissam locutionem quam Marcus commemoravit, adiunctis etiam illis verbis quae commemorantur in actibus apostolorum, credendum est assumptum esse dominum in caelum.
          <td><span style="color:blue">Augustine</span> : By which words He seems to shew clearly enough that the foregoing discourse was the last that He spake to them upon earth, though it does not appear to bind us down altogether to this opinion. For He does not say, After He had thus spoken unto them, wherefore it admits of being understood not as if that was the last discourse, but that the words which are here used, "After the Lord had spoken unto them, He was received into heaven," might belong to all His other discourses. But since the arguments which we have used above make us rather suppose that this was the last time, therefore we ought to believe that after these words, together with those which are recorded in the Acts of the Apostles, our Lord ascended into heaven.

          <td><b>Gregorius in Evang</b> : In veteri testamento cognovimus quod Elias sit raptus in caelum. Sed aliud est caelum aethereum, aliud caelum aereum. Caelum quippe aereum terrae est proximum. In caelum itaque aereum Elias sublevatus est, ut in secretam quamdam regionem terrae repente duceretur, ubi in magna iam carnis et spiritus quiete viveret, quoadusque ad finem mundi redeat, et mortis debitum solvat. Notandum quoque est, quod Elias in curru legitur ascendisse, ut videlicet aperte illis demonstraretur, quia homo purus adiutorio indigebat alieno. Redemptor autem noster non curru, non Angelis sublevatus legitur: quia qui fecerat omnia, super omnia sua virtute ferebatur. Considerandum vero nobis est, quod Marcus subdit et sedet a dextris Dei; cum Stephanus dicat: video caelos apertos et filium hominis stantem a dextris Dei. Sed sedere iudicantis est, stare vero pugnantis vel adiuvantis. Stephanus ergo in laboris certamine positus stantem vidit, quem adiutorem habuit; sed hunc post assumptionem Marcus sedere describit, quia post assumptionis suae gloriam iudex in fine videbitur.
          <td><span style="color:blue">Greg</span> .: We have seen in the Old Testament that Elias was taken up into heaven. But the ethereal heaven is one thing, the aerial is another. The aerial heaven is nearer the earth, Elias then was raised into the aerial heaven, that he might be carried off suddenly into some secret region of the earth, there to live in great calmness of body and spirit, until he returns at the end of the world, to pay the debt of death. We may also observe that Elias mounted up in a chariot, that by this they might understand that a mere man requires help from without. But our Redeemer, as we read, was not carried up by a chariot, not by angels, because He who had made all things was borne over all by His own power. We must also consider what Mark subjoins, "And sat at the right hand of God," since Stephen says, "I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God." Now sitting is the attitude of a judge, standing of one fighting or helping. Therefore Stephen, when toiling in the contest, saw Him standing, whom he had for his helper; but Mark describes [p. 348] Him as sitting after His assumption into heaven, because after the glory of His assumption, He will in the end be seen as a judge.

Sedere enim habitare intelligitur; quomodo dicimus de quocumque homine: in illa patria sedit per tres annos, sic ergo credite habitare Christum in dextera Dei patris. Beatus enim est, et habitat in beatitudine, quae dextera patris vocatur: ibi enim omnis dextera est, quia nulla est ibi miseria. Sequitur illi autem profecti praedicaverunt ubique, domino cooperante, et sermonem confirmante sequentibus signis.
          <td><span style="color:blue">Augustine</span> , de Symbolic, 7: Let us not therefore understand this sitting as though He were placed there in human limbs, as if the Father sat on the left, the Son on the right, but by the right hand itself we understand the power which He as man received from God, that He should come to judge, who first had come to be judged. For by sitting we express habitation, as we say of a person, he sat himself down in that country for many years; in this way then believe that Christ dwells at the right hand of God the Father. For He is blessed and dwells in blessedness, which is called the right hand of the Father; for all is right hand there, since there is no misery.

          <td><span style="color:blue">Bede</span> : Observe that in proportion as Mark began his history later, so he makes it reach in writing to more distant times, for he began from the commencement of the preaching of the Gospel by John, and he reaches in his narrative those times in which the Apostles sowed the same word of the Gospel throughout the world.

Truly then this precept was not so laid upon the Apostles by our Lord, as though they alone to whom He then spoke were to fulfil so great a charge; in the same way as He says, "Behold, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world," apparently to them alone; but who does not understand that the promise is made to the Catholic Church, which though some are dying, others are born, shall be here unto the end of the world?
