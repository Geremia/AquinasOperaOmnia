First, they are encouraged in many ways by what he says; secondly, what he has said is explained (ch 16). Concerning the first, we should note that there were two things which could trouble the disciples. One was near, that Christ would soon be leaving them; the second was in the future, and was the hardships they would undergo. First, Christ consoles them over his leaving; secondly, over their future hardships (ch 15).

He does three things about the first: first, he says that he is going to the Father; secondly, he promises them the gift of the Holy Spirit (v 15); thirdly, he promises that he will also be with them (v 18). He does two things about the first: first, he mentions that he is going to the Father; secondly, he brings in the way he would go (v 4).

          <td>1849 In regard to the first, note that the disciples could have been disturbed by what our Lord said about the betrayal of Judas, Peter's denial, and his own going away. Indeed, each of these did trouble them and make them sad: "Thou hast made the land to quake," that is, the hearts of the disciples, "thou hast rent it open" (Ps 60:2). Therefore our Lord, wishing to soothe their sorrow, said: <b>Let not your hearts be troubled</b> .

          <td>Sed contra; Act. I, 1: <i>coepit Iesus facere et docere</i> . Sed supra XIII, 21, dicitur: <i>turbatus est Iesus spiritu</i> et cetera. Quomodo ergo docet non turbari qui primo turbatus est? Responsio. Dicendum quod non docuit contrarium eius quod fecit. De eo autem dicitur quod turbatus est spiritu, non quod spiritus eius sit turbatus. Hic autem non prohibet quin turbentur spiritu, sed prohibet quod eorum cor, idest spiritus, non turbetur. Est enim quaedam turbatio ex spiritu, ex ratione procedens, quae laudabilis est, nec prohibetur. II Cor. VII, 10: <i>quae enim secundum Deum tristitia est, poenitentiam in salutem stabilem operatur</i> . Alia est tristitia seu turbatio ipsius rationis; quae non est laudabilis, quia abducit a propria rectitudine; et prohibetur Ps. XXXVI, v. 24: <i>iustus non conturbabitur, quia dominus supponit manum suam</i> . Non enim turbari potest qui Deum semper habet. Et ideo dominus suae divinitatis potestatem subiungit, dicens <i>creditis in Deum, et in me credite</i> : ubi unum supponit, et aliud praecipit.
          <td>1850 In Acts (1:1) we read: "Jesus began to do and teach." Yet above (13:21) it says that Jesus "was troubled in spirit." How can he tell his disciples not to be troubled when he himself was troubled? I answer that he did not teach the opposite of what he did. It was stated above that he was troubled <i>in</i> spirit, not that his spirit was troubled. Here he is not forbidding them to be troubled in spirit, but he is forbidding that their hearts, that is, their spirits, be troubled. For there is a troubled state which arises from reason; this is to be praised and is not forbidden: "For godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation" (2 Cor 7:10). Yet there is a different grief or troubled state of the reason itself; this is not laudable because it draws the reason from its proper course; this is forbidden: "The just person will not be troubled for the Lord puts his hand under him" [Ps 37:24]. For one who always possesses God cannot be disturbed.

          <td>Supponit quidem eorum fidem in Deum, dicens <i>creditis in Deum</i> : in hoc enim iam instructi erant ab ipso; Hebr. XI, 6: <i>accedentem ad Deum oportet credere</i> . Praecipit autem ut credant in ipsum, dicens <i>et in me credite</i> . Si enim in Deum creditis, ego autem sum Deus: consequens est quod in me credatis. Et tenet haec consequentia, sive ly <i>Deus</i> teneatur essentialiter, cum ipse filius sit Deus, sive ly <i>Deus</i> supponat pro persona patris. Nullus enim potest in patrem credere nisi credat in filium; supra V, 23: <i>qui non honorificat filium, non honorificat patrem</i> .
          <td>1851 Accordingly, our Lord refers to the power of his divinity, saying, <b>you believe in God, believe also in me</b> . Here he presupposes one thing and commands another. He presupposes their faith in God, saying, <b>you believe in God</b> : he had already taught them about this: "For whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists" (Heb 11:6). What he commands is that they believe in him, saying, <b>believe also in me</b> . For if you believe in God, and since I am God, then you should believe in me. And this follows whether the word God stands for the divine essence, since the Son is God, or whether it stands for the person of the Father. For no one can believe in the Father unless he believes in the Son: "He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father" (5:23).
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>In hoc autem quod dicit <i>et in me credite</i> , contestatur se verum esse Deum; nam etsi homini vel creaturae credere liceat, in nullum tamen nisi in Deum credere debemus. Est ergo in Christum credendum sicut in Deum. I Io. ult., 20: <i>ut sitis in vero filio eius Christo. Hic est verus Deus et vita aeterna</i> ; supra VI, 29: <i>hoc est opus Dei, ut credatis in eum quem misit ille</i> .
          <td>The fact that he says, <b>believe also in me</b> , indicates that he is truly God; for although we are allowed to believe a human being <i>(homini)</i> or a creature, we ought to believe <i>in</i> God alone <i>(in Deum).</i> Therefore, we must believe in Christ as we believe in God. "We are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life" (1 Jn 5:20); "This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent" (6:29).

          <td>Consequenter cum dicit <i>in domo patris mei mansiones multae sunt</i> , subiungit promissionem quae est ut per Christum accedant, et introducantur ad patrem. Promissio autem de accessu aliorum ad aliquem locum duo includit: unum est praecedens, scilicet loci praeparatio; aliud sequens, scilicet in locum introductio. Et ideo dominus duas hic promissiones facit: unam quae pertinet ad loci praeparationem, aliam ad loci introductionem. Prima autem non est necessaria, cum iam locus sit praeparatus; sed secunda: et ideo circa hoc duo facit. Primo excludit necessitatem primae promissionis; secundo ponit secundam promissionem, ibi <i>et si abiero, et praeparavero vobis locum, iterum veniam, et accipiam vos ad meipsum</i> . Circa primum duo facit. Primo excludit necessitatem praeparationis; secundo ostendit facultatem suam ad praeparandum, si necesse esset, ibi <i>si quo minus, dixissem vobis, quia vado parare vobis locum</i> .
          <td>1852 Then when he says, <b>in my Father's house are many rooms</b> , he adds the promise that it is through Christ that they will approach and be brought to the Father. Now a promise to others that they will gain entrance to some place involves two things: first, the place must be prepared; next, they have to be brought there. Our Lord makes these two promises here: one concerns the preparation of the place, and the other is about their being brought there. Yet the first is not necessary, for the place has already been prepared; but the second is necessary. Thus he does two things: he says the first promise is not necessary; and then he makes his second promise (v 3). In regard to the first he does two things: first, he indicates that it is not necessary to prepare the place; secondly he shows that he could prepare it if it were necessary (v 2b).

          <td>Dicit ergo <i>in domo patris mei mansiones multae sunt</i> . Ubi sciendum est, quod cum uniuscuiusque domus sit in qua habitat, illa dicitur domus Dei in qua habitat Deus; Deus autem habitat in sanctis; Ier. XIV, 9: <i>tu in nobis es, domine</i> et cetera. Sed in quibusdam quidem per fidem; II Cor. VI, 16: <i>inhabitabo in illis, et inambulabo inter eos</i> . In quibusdam vero per fruitionem perfectam, I Cor. XV, 28: <i>ut sit Deus omnia in omnibus</i> . Duplex est ergo domus Dei. Una est militans Ecclesia, scilicet congregatio fidelium; I Tim. III, 15: <i>ut scias quomodo oporteat te in domo Dei conversari, inhabitat Deus per fidem</i> ; Apoc. XXI, 3: quae est Ecclesia Dei vivi. Et hanc <i>ecce tabernaculum Dei cum hominibus, et habitabo in illis</i> . Alia est triumphans, scilicet sanctorum collectio in gloria patris; Ps. c. LXIV, 5: <i>replebimur in bonis domus tuae. Sanctum est templum tuum, mirabile in aequitate</i> .
          <td>1853 He says, <b>in my Father's house are many rooms</b> . The house of any one is where he dwells, and so the house of God is where God dwells. Now God dwells in his saints: "Yet thou, O Lord, art in the midst of us" (Jer 14:9). In some of them he dwells by faith: "I will live in them and move among them" (2 Cor 6:16); while in others he dwells by perfect happiness: "that God may be everything to every one" (1 Cor 15:28). Accordingly, God has two houses. One is the Church militant, that is, the society of those who believe: "that you may know how one ought to behave in the household of God, which is the church of the living God" (1 Tim 3:15). God dwells in this house by faith. "The dwelling of God is with men. He will dwell with them" (Rev 21:3). The other is the Church triumphant, that is, the society of the saints in the glory of the Father: "We shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, thy holy temple" (Ps 65:4).

XVII, 12: <i>solium altitudinis gloriae tuae a principio, locus sanctificationis nostrae</i> . Manet autem homo in hoc loco, scilicet Deo, quantum ad voluntatem et affectum per fruitionem caritatis I Io.

          <td>Yet the house of the Father is not only where he dwells, but he himself is the house, for he exists in himself. It is into this house that he gathers us. We see from 2 Corinthians (5:1) that God himself is the house: "We have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens." This house is the house of glory, which is God himself: "A glorious throne set on high from the beginning is the place of our sanctification" [Jer 17:12]. We remain in this place, in God, with our will and affections by the joys of love: "He who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him" (1 Jn 4:16). And we remain here with our minds by our knowledge of the truth: "Sanctify them in the truth" (17:17).

          <td>In this house, then, that is, in glory, which is God, are many rooms, that is, various participations in happiness. This is because one who knows more will have a greater place. Therefore, the different rooms are the various participations in the knowledge and enjoyment of God.

          <td>Sed hic est quaestio utrum unus possit esse beatior alio. Videtur quod non. Beatitudo enim est finis; et perfectum non recipit maius et minus: ergo non potest magis et minus haberi.
          <td>1854 The question arises here whether one person can be happier than another. It seems not. For happiness is the end; and what is perfect, complete, does not have degrees; therefore, there cannot be different degrees of happiness.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Responsio. Dicendum quod aliquid dicitur perfectum dupliciter: absolute, et secundum quid. Perfectio quidem beatitudinis absoluta est solius Dei: quia solus ipse tantum cognoscit se et amat quantum cognoscibilis est et amabilis (infinite enim cognoscit, et amat infinitam veritatem et bonitatem suam). Et quantum ad hoc, ipsum summum bonum, quod est beatitudinis obiectum, et causa, non potest esse maius et minus: non enim est nisi unum summum bonum, quod est Deus.
          <td>I answer that a thing can be perfect in two ways: absolutely and in a qualified sense. The absolute perfection of happiness is found only in God, for only he knows and loves himself to the extent that he is knowable and lovable (since he knows and loves infinitely his own infinite truth and goodness). From this point of view, the supreme good itself, which is the object and cause of happiness, can not be greater or less. This is because there is only one supreme good, which is God.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secundum quid autem, idest secundum aliquas conditiones temporis, naturae et gratiae; et sic unus potest esse beatior alio secundum adeptionem huius boni, et capacitatem uniuscuiusque hominis. Quia quanto homo magis est eius capax, tanto magis participat ipsam, inquantum scilicet est melius dispositus et ordinatus ad eius fruitionem: ad quod disponitur dupliciter. Consistit enim beatitudo in duobus: scilicet in divina visione, et ad hanc disponitur per munditiam: et ideo quanto quis habet cor magis elevatum a terrenis, tanto magis et perfectius Deum videbit. Item in fruitionis delectatione, et ad hanc disponitur per amorem: et ideo qui habet cor magis fervens amore Dei, magis delectabitur in divina fruitione. De prima dicitur Matth. V, 8: <i>beati mundo corde, quoniam ipsi Deum videbunt</i> .
          <td>
            But in a qualified sense, that is, considering certain conditions of time, of nature and of grace, one person can be happier than another depending on the possession of this good and the capacity of each. The greater the capacity a person has for this good, the more he shares in it, I mean he participates in it more the better disposed and prepared he is to enjoy it. Now one is disposed for this good in two ways. Happiness consists in two things. The first is the vision of God; and one is disposed for this by purity. And so the more one has a heart which is raised above earthly matters, the more he will see God, and the more perfectly. Secondly, happiness consists in the delight of enjoying [God], and one is disposed for this by love. Thus, one who has a more burning love for God will find more delight in the enjoyment of God. We read about the first in Matthew (5:8): "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see." <a href="John14.htm#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a>

          <td>Item quaeritur de hoc quod dicitur Matth. XX, quod unus denarius datur omnibus laborantibus. Hic autem denarius nihil aliud est quam mansio in domo patris. Non ergo sunt multae mansiones. Responsio. Dicendum quod merces vitae aeternae et una est, et multae. Multae quidem secundum diversam capacitatem participantium, secundum quam sunt diversae mansiones in domo patris;
          <td>1855 Another question arises from what Matthew (20:10) says, that every laborer received one denarius. This denarius is nothing but a room in the house of the Father. Therefore, there are not many rooms. I answer that the reward of eternal life is both one and many. It is many based on the various capacities of those who share in it, and from this point of view there are different rooms in the Father's house.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>una vero tripliciter. Primo quidem propter unitatem obiecti: idem enim est quod omnes beati vident, et quo omnes fruuntur; et ideo unus denarius, sed diversimode videbitur et amabitur; Iob c. XXII, 26: <i>tunc super omnipotentem deliciis afflues</i> ; Is. XXVIII, 5: <i>in illo die erit dominus exercituum sceptrum exultationis residuo populi sui, et corona gloriae</i> . Et simile est ac si aliquis praeberet alicui fontem, ut ad libitum omnes biberent; de quo qui maius vas haberet, plus acciperet, et qui minus, minus. Unus ergo fons ex parte sua est, sed non eadem mensura recipientium. Et haec est sententia beati Gregorii, XXII Moral. Secundo propter eamdem aeternitatis mensuram, secundum Augustinum: quia omnes habebunt aeternam beatitudinem, quia ibunt iusti in vitam aeternam, sed diversae sunt propter capacitatem. Tertio propter caritatem, quae omnia unit, gaudia singulorum faciens omnium, et e converso; Rom. XII, 15: <i>gaudere cum gaudentibus</i> et cetera.
          <td>
            Yet this reward is one, and this for three reasons. First, because there is one object; for it is the same object which all the blessed see and enjoy. Thus, there is one denarius. But it is seen and loved in various degrees: "Then you will delight yourself in the Almighty" (Job 22:26); "In that day the Lord of hosts will be a crown of glory, and a diadem of beauty, to the remnant of his people" (Is 28:5). It is like a spring of water, available to all to take as much as they wish. Then, one who has a larger cup will receive more, and one who has a smaller cup will receive less. Therefore, there is one fountain, considering it in itself, but every one does not receive the same portion. This is the opinion of Gregory, in his <i>Morals</i> XXII. <a href="John14.htm#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" id="_ftnref3">[3]</a> Secondly, this reward is one, according to Augustine, because it is an eternal portion: each one will have an eternal happiness, for the just will go into eternal life; but there are differences in capacity. <a href="John14.htm#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" id="_ftnref4">[4]</a> Thirdly, this reward is one because of charity, which unites everything, and makes the joy of each the joy of the rest, and conversely: "Rejoice with those who rejoice" (Rom 12:15).

          <td>Sed notandum, quod ex hoc verbo Pelagiani acceperunt occasionem errandi. Dicunt enim, quod pueri non baptizati decedentes, erunt in domo Dei salvati, sed non in regno; quia supra III, 5, dicitur: <i>nisi quis renatus fuerit ex aqua et spiritu sancto, non intrabit in regnum Dei</i> . Sed contra hoc dicit Augustinus quod dominus dicit quod mansiones huiusmodi sunt in domo Dei. Nihil autem magis est in regno quam domus: nam regnum constituitur ex civitatibus, civitates autem ex vicis, vici autem ex domibus. Si ergo mansiones sunt in domo, manifestum est quod sunt in regno.
          <td>
            1856 The Pelagians erred by misunderstanding this passage. They said that children who die without baptism will be saved in the house of God, but not in the kingdom of God, for we read "Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God" (3:5). Augustine answers this by saying that our Lord said that these rooms are in God's house. <a href="John14.htm#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" id="_ftnref5">[5]</a> Now in a kingdom there are nothing but houses: for a kingdom is made up of cities, and cities of neighborhoods, and neighborhoods of houses. Thus, if rooms are in a house, it is evident that they are in the kingdom.

Our Lord excludes this by saying, <b>if it were not so</b> , that is, if the rooms were not prepared, <b>I would have told you that I am going to prepare a place for you</b> .

LXX, 3, petebat: <i>esto mihi in Deum protectorem, et in locum munitum</i> ; quasi diceret: semper sit mihi facultas intrandi. Et secundum hoc potest dupliciter intelligi. Si enim locus iste esset tale aliquid quod defectum haberet, aut quodcumque creatum, subiaceret meae potestati ut perficerem illum: nam omnis creatura potestati verbi subiecta est; supra, I, 3: <i>omnia per ipsum facta sunt</i> . Si ergo ita esset, quod haberet defectum, <i>dixissem vobis, quia vado parare vobis locum</i> . Sed locus in se paratus est. Locus enim iste est ipse Deus, ut dictum est, in quo est omnium perfectionum excellentia.

          <td>Here we should consider what is meant by the phrase, <b>to prepare a place for you</b> . A place is prepared in two ways. In one way, when something is done to the place itself, as when it is cleaned or enlarged: "Enlarge the place of your tent" (Is 54:2). In another way, when someone is given the means to enter it; and so the Psalmist prays: "Be thou to me a rock of refuge, a strong fortress to save me" (Ps 71:3), which is like saying: May I always have the means to enter here. With this in mind, the text can be understood in two ways. If this place had some defect or was something created, it would be subject to my power to perfect it, for every creature is subject to the power of the Word: "All things were made through him" (1:3). So, if it had some defect, <b>I would have told you that I am going to prepare a place for you</b> . But this place, in itself, is prepared; for this place is God himself, as was said, in whom is the abundance of all perfections.

For he, with the Father and the Holy Spirit has predestined them to eternal life: "He chose us in him" (Eph 1:4).

          <td>1859 Our Lord prepared a place for us by his departure in five ways. First he made room for faith: for since faith concerns things not seen, when the disciples saw Christ in person, they did not need faith for this. Thus he left them, so that the one they had possessed by his bodily presence and saw with their bodily eyes, they could still possess in his spiritual presence and see with the eyes of their mind. This is to possess him by faith. Secondly, his leaving prepared a place by showing them the way to go to that place: "He who opens the breach will go before them" (Mic 2:13). Thirdly, by his prayers for them: "He is able for all time to save those who draw near to God through him" (Heb 7:25); "He rides through the heavens to your help" (Deut 33:26). Fourthly, by attracting them to what is above: "Draw me after you" (Song 1:4); "If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above" (Col 3:1). Fifthly, by sending them the Holy Spirit: "As yet the Spirit had not been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified" (7:39).

            1861 Will Christ wait until the end of the world before he takes the spirits of the apostles? It is the opinion of the Greeks that the saints will not go to paradise until the day of judgment. But if this were true, the desire of the Apostle (Phil 1:23) to be with Christ would be futile. Therefore, one should say that immediately after the house where we dwell here is overthrown, our souls are with Christ. And so the statement, <b>I will come again and will take you to myself</b> , can be understood as that spiritual coming with which Christ always visits the Church of the faithful and vivifies each of the faithful at death. Then the meaning is: <b>I will come again</b> , to the Church, spiritually and continuously, <b>and will take you to myself</b> , that is, I will strengthen you in faith and love for me: "My beloved has gone down to his garden, to the beds of spices," that is, to the community of the saints, "to feed in the garden," that is, to delight in their virtues, "and to gather lilies," to draw pure souls to himself when he gives life to the saints at death [Song 6:1]. <a href="John14.htm#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" id="_ftnref7">[7]</a>

The disciples could have asked him where he was going, just like Peter did before: "Lord, where are you going?" (13:36). Our Lord knew this and so said to them, <b>Where I am going you know, and the way you know</b> . For I am going to the Father, whom you know, since I have manifested him to you: "I have manifested thy name to the men whom thou gave me" (17:9). And I myself am the way through which I go, and you know me: "We have beheld his glory" (1:14).

          <td>1866 The occasion for this explanation was the hesitation expressed in the question of Thomas. <b>Lord, we do not know where you are going; how can we know the way?</b> Here Thomas denies the two things that our Lord affirmed. For our Lord said that they knew both the way and its destination; but Thomas denied that he knew the way and its destination. Yet both statements are true: for it is true that they knew, yet they did not know that they knew. For they knew many things about the Father and the Son which they had learned from Christ; yet they did not know that it was the Father to whom Christ was going, and that the Son was the way by which he was going. For it is difficult to go to the Father. It is not surprising that they did not know this because although they clearly knew that Christ was a human being, they only imperfectly recognized his divinity: "That path no bird of prey knows" (Job 28:7).

And so because we do not know the destination ‑ "He dwells in unapproachable light, whom no man has ever seen or can see" (1 Tim 6:16) ‑ we can not discover the way: "How inscrutable his ways!"

          <td>Sed quia ista via non est distans a termino, sed coniuncta, addit <i>veritas et vita</i> ; et sic ipse simul est via, et terminus. Via quidem secundum humanitatem, terminus secundum divinitatem. Sic ergo secundum quod homo, dicit <i>ego sum via</i> ; secundum quod Deus, addit <i>veritas et vita</i> . Per quae duo terminus huius viae convenienter designatur. Nam terminus huius viae finis est desiderii humani, homo autem duo praecipue desiderat: primo quidem veritatis cognitionem, quae est sibi propria; secundo sui esse continuationem, quod est commune omnibus rebus. Christus autem est via perveniendi ad veritatis cognitionem, cum tamen ipse sit veritas; Ps. LXXXV, 11: <i>deduc me, domine, in veritate, et ingrediar in via tua</i> . Christus etiam est via perveniendi ad vitam cum tamen ipse sit vita; Ps. XV, 11: <i>notas fecisti vias vitae</i> . Et ideo huius viae terminum per veritatem et vitam designavit: quae duo supra I de Christo dicta sunt. Primo quidem quod ipse sit vita: unde <i>in ipso vita erat</i> , deinde quod sit veritas, quia <i>erat lux hominum</i> ; lux autem veritas est.
          <td>Because this way is not separated from its destination but united to it, he adds, <b>and the truth, and the life</b> . So Christ is at once both the way and the destination. He is the way by reason of his human nature, and the destination because of his divinity. Therefore, as human, he says, <b>I am the way</b> ; as God, he adds, <b>and the truth, and the life</b> . These last two appropriately indicate the destination of the way. For the destination of this way is the end of human desire. Now human beings especially desire two things: first, a knowledge of the truth, and this is characteristic of them; secondly, that they continue to exist, and this is common to all things. In fact, Christ is the way to arrive at the knowledge of the truth, while still being the truth itself: "Teach me thy way O Lord, that I may walk in thy truth" (Ps 85:11). Christ is also the way to arrive at life, while still being life itself: "Thou couldst show me the path of life" (Ps 16:11). And so he indicated the destination or end of this way as truth and life. These two were already applied to Christ: first, he is life: "In him was life" (1:4); then, he is truth, because "the life is the light of men" (1:45), and light is truth.

Veritas ergo intellectus nostri pertinet ad verbum nostrum, quod est conceptio eius. Sed tamen licet verbum nostrum sit verum, non tamen est ipsa veritas, cum non sit a seipso, sed ex hoc quod rei conceptae adaequatur. Veritas ergo intellectus divini pertinet ad verbum Dei. Sed quia verbum Dei est verum a seipso, cum non mensuretur a rebus, sed res intantum sint verae inquantum ad similitudinem eius accedunt: inde est quod verbum Dei est ipsa veritas. Et quia nullus potest veritatem cognoscere nisi adhaereat veritati, oportet omnem qui veritatem cognoscere desiderat, huic verbo adhaerere.
          <td>1869 Note that both truth and life belong properly and essentially <i>(per se)</i> to Christ. Truth belongs essentially to him because he is the Word. Now truth is the conformity of a thing to the intellect, and this results when the intellect conceives the thing as it is. Therefore, the truth of our intellect belongs to our word, which is its conception. Yet although our word is true, it is not truth itself, since it is not true of itself but because it is conformed to the thing conceived. And so the truth of the divine intellect belongs to the Word of God. But because the Word of God is true of itself (since it is not measured by things, but things are true in the measure that they are similar to the Word) the Word of God is truth itself. And because no one can know the truth unless he adheres to the truth, it is necessary that anyone who desires to know the truth adhere to this Word.

            Life also belongs properly to Christ: for everything which has some activity from itself is said to be living, while non‑living things do not have motion from themselves. Among the activities of life the chief are the intellectual activities. Thus, the intellect itself is said to be living, and its activities are a certain kind of life. Now in God the activity of understanding and the intellect itself are the same.

          <td>1871 Here is another interpretation. In human beings, holiness involves three things: action, contemplation, and one's intention. These are brought to perfection by Christ. Christ is the way for those in the active life; he is the truth for those who stand firm in the contemplative life. And he directs the intention of both those in the active and contemplative life to life, eternal life. For he teaches us to go and preach for the sake of the age to come. So, the Lord is our way by which we go to him, and through him to the Father.

            1872 But when he, who is the way, goes to the Father, is he the way for himself?

He, as having human nature, is the way. Thus, he came through his flesh, yet remained where he was; and he went through his flesh, without leaving where he had come from.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>per carnem etiam ad se redit veritatem et vitam: nam Deus venerat per carnem ad homines, veritas ad mendaces, vita ad mortales. <i>Est enim Deus verax, omnis autem homo mendax</i> : Rom. III, 4. Cum autem se ab hominibus abstulit, atque illuc ubi nemo mentitur, carnem suam levavit, idem ipse qui verbum caro factum est, per carnem suam ad veritatem, quae est ipse, remeavit. Et simile est si dicerem: et mens mea, dum loquor aliquibus, ad eos exit, nec tamen me relinquit: cum autem tacuero, quodammodo ad me redeo, et cum illis quibus loquor, maneo. Sic ergo Christus, qui nobis est via, etiam sibi ipsi, idest carni, factus est via, ut ad veritatem et vitam iret.
          <td>Also, through the flesh he returned to himself, the truth and the life. For God had come, through his flesh, to us, the truth to liars, the life to mortals: "God is truthful, and every human is a liar" [Rom 3:4]. And when he left us, and took his flesh up to that place where there are no liars, this very Word who was made flesh returned, through his flesh, to the truth, which is himself. For example: when I speak to others, my mind goes out to them, yet it does not leave me; and when I am silent, in a certain sense I return to myself, yet still remain with those to whom I spoke [if they remember what I said]. And so Christ, who is our way, became the way even for himself, this is, for his flesh, to go to the truth and the life.

Quia ergo et <i>quae Dei sunt nemo novit nisi spiritus Dei</i> , nullus potest venire ad notitiam patris nisi per verbum suum, quod est filius eius; Matth. XI, 27: <i>neque patrem quis novit nisi filius</i> . Et sicut homo volens revelare se verbo cordis, quod profert ore, induit quodammodo ipsum verbum litteris vel voce, ita Deus, volens se manifestare hominibus, verbum suum conceptum ab aeterno, carne induit in tempore.

          <td>1874 Note that the Apostle says: "For what person knows a man's thoughts except the spirit of the man which is in him?" (1 Cor 2:11), that is, provided one does not choose to reveal his own thoughts. A person reveals what is hidden within by his words, and it is only by the words of a person that we can know what is hidden within. Now "no one comprehends the thoughts of God except the spirit of God" (1 Cor 2:11), therefore, no one can acquire a knowledge of the Father except by his Word, which is his Son: "No one knows the Father except the Son" (Mt 11:27). And just like one of us who wants to be known by others by revealing to them the words in his heart, clothes these words with letters or sounds, so God, wanting to be known by us, takes his Word, conceived from eternity, and clothes it with flesh in time. And so no one can arrive at a knowledge of the Father except through the Son. Thus he says: "I am the door; if any one enters by me, he will be saved" (10:9).

          <td>We should answer that in the first instance he was speaking to the Jews, whom he was reprimanding. And so he added "perhaps" not because he had any doubts, but as a rebuke to them. But here he is speaking to his disciples, whom he is teaching. Thus, he simply states the truth to them: <b>If you had known me, you would without doubt have known my Father also</b> . This is like saying: If you knew my grace and dignity, you would without doubt also know that of the Father. For there is no better way to know something than through its word or image, and the Son is the Word of the Father: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God" (1:1); "And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth; we have beheld his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father" (1:14). The Son is also the image of the Father: "He is the image of the invisible God" (Col 1:15); "He reflects the glory of God and bears the very stamp of his nature" (Heb 1:3). Therefore, the Father is known in the Son as in his Word and proper image.

Now since every created word is some likeness of that Word, and some likeness, though imperfect, of the divinity is found in every thing, either as an image or a trace, it follows that what God is cannot be known perfectly through any creature or by any thought or concept of a created intellect. It is the Word alone, the only‑begotten Word, which is a perfect word and the perfect image of the Father, that knows and comprehends the Father.

If you ask Arius how one goes to the Father through the Son, he answers that it is by recalling what the Son taught, because the Son taught us about the Father: "Father ... I have manifested thy name to the men whom thou gavest me" (17:6). But our Lord rejected this by saying: <b>If you had known me, you would without doubt have known my Father also</b> . This is like saying: Arius, or anyone else can indeed speak about the Father, but no human being is such that by knowing him the Father is known. This is true of the Son alone, who has the same nature as the Father.

Et ideo hic dominus ostendit quod aliquo modo cognoscunt patrem, ut ostendat verbum suum verum esse, et aliquo modo non cognoscunt, ut verbum Thomae sit verum.

Yet Thomas denied this: "we do not know where you are going." Thus our Lord shows here that in a certain way they did know the Father, so that his statement was true; and in another sense they did not know the Father, so that what Thomas said was true. To do this, he mentions a twofold knowledge of the Father: one which will be in the future, and the other which was in the past.

One is perfect, and is by an immediate vision of him, and this will be in our homeland: "When he appears we shall be like him" (1 Jn 3:2). The other is imperfect, and is by reflections and is obscure; and we have this by faith: "For now we see in a mirror dimly" (1 Cor 3:2). Thus, this phrase can be understood of each kind of knowledge. <b>Henceforth you shall know him</b> , with perfect knowledge in your homeland: "I shall tell you plainly of the Father" (16:25). This is like saying: It is true that you do not know him with perfect knowledge, but from <b>henceforth you shall know him</b> , after the mystery of my passion has been accomplished. Or, in the other way, <b>henceforth</b> , after my resurrection and ascension and after I have sent the Holy Spirit, <b>you shall know him</b> , with the perfect knowledge of faith, for when the Spirit, the Paraclete, comes, "he will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you" (14:26).

This is clear from the fact that he adds, <b>Philip, he who has seen me has seen the Father also</b> .

Thus, when seeing the Son, the Father is better seen than when seeing some mere human another mere human is seen, no matter how much alike they are. <a href="John14.htm#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" id="_ftnref20">[20]</a>

For it is impossible to see the uncreated substance by seeing some created substance, just as by knowing a substance of one genus, one cannot know a substance of another genus. It is evident, therefore, that the Son is not a created substance, but is consubstantial with the Father. Otherwise, one who sees the Son would not see the Father.

I will put my hand over my mouth" [39:34]. He disapproves of the root of the request when he says, <b>Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father in me?</b> This is like saying: You want to possess the Father, believing that you will have sufficiency in him.

          <td>1893 The belief that Christ was God could be known from two things: from his teaching and from his miracles. Our Lord mentions these. "If I had not done among them the works which no one else did, they would not have sin" (15:24). Referring to his teaching he says, "If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have sin" (15:22). We also read: "No man ever spoke like this man!" (7:46). The blind man, referring to his works, said: Never since the world began has it been heard that any one opened the eyes of a man born blind" (9:32). Our Lord shows his divinity by these two things. Referring to his teaching, he says, <b>The words that I say to you</b> , by the instrument of my human nature, <b>I do not speak of myself, but from him who is in me</b> , that is, the Father: "I declare to the world what I have heard from him," the Father (8:26). The Father, therefore, who speaks in me, is in me. Now whatever a human being says must come from the first Word. And this first Word, the Word of God, is from the Father. Therefore, all the words we speak must be from God. So when anyone speaks words he has from the Father, the Father is in him. Referring to his works, he says, <b>the Father who dwells in me does the works</b> , because no one could do the works that I do: "The Son can do nothing of himself" [5:19].

Chrysostom says that Christ was referring to his teaching the first time, and then referring to his miracles. <a href="John14.htm#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" id="_ftnref24">[24]</a> For Augustine, our Lord is referring to his words as his works: "This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent" (6:29). <a href="John14.htm#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" id="_ftnref25">[25]</a> So when the Lord says, <b>the Father does the works</b> , we should understand that these works are words.

In Greek, the text reads: <b>Believe</b> , that is, believe me, <b>that I am in the Father and the Father in me</b> . Or, it is surprising that you do not believe <b>that I am in the Father and the Father in me</b> . Note that before our Lord was speaking only to Philip (v 8‑10a), but from the point where he says, <b>the words that I say to you</b> [v 10b], he is speaking to all the apostles together. But if what I say to you is not enough to show my consubstantiality, then at least believe me for the sake of the works themselves: "The works which the Father has granted me to accomplish, these very works which I am doing, bear me witness" (5:36); "Even though you do not believe me, believe the works" (10:38).

For the strongest sign of great power is when a person does extraordinary things not only by himself but also through others. So he says, <b>he who believes in me will also do the works that I do</b> . These words not only show the power of the divinity in Christ, but also the power of faith, and the union of Christ with those who believe. For just as the Son acts because the Father dwells in him by a unity of nature, so also those who believe act because Christ dwells in them by faith: "that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith" (Eph 3:17). Now the works which Christ accomplished and the disciples do by the power of Christ are the miracles: "And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up serpents" (Mk 16:17).

Loquitur enim hic dominus de operibus quae facta erant per verba, ut Augustinus dicit, quae opera tunc dicebat ubi verba quae loquebatur, et eorumdem verborum fructus erat fides illorum. Legitur enim de Christo Matth. XIX, 22, quod adolescens non fuit inductus ad vendendum quae habebat, et eum sequendum. Nam cum diceret adolescenti: <i>vade, et vende omnia quae habes, et da pauperibus</i> , subditur: <i>abiit tristis</i> . Sed de Petro et aliis apostolis legitur Act. IV, quod eis praedicantibus vendebant possessiones et omnia quae habebant, et afferebant pretium earum ad pedes apostolorum.

            1899 What is remarkable is that he adds, <b>and greater works than these will he do</b> . We could say that in a certain sense our Lord does more things and greater things through his apostles than by himself. Among the miracles of Christ the greatest was when a sick person was healed by touching the fringe of his garment (Mt 9:20). But the sick were healed by the shadow of Peter, as we read in Acts (5:15). And it is greater to heal by one's shadow than by the fringe of one's garment. In another way, we could say that Christ did more by the words of his disciples than by his own. As Augustine says, our Lord is speaking here of works accomplished by words, when the fruit of these words was faith. <a href="John14.htm#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" id="_ftnref26">[26]</a> We see in Matthew that a young man was not persuaded by Christ to sell his possessions and follow him, for when Christ said to the youth, "Go, sell what you possess and give to the poor," we read that "he went away sorrowful" (Mt 19:21). Yet we read that at the preaching of Peter and the other apostles, people sold their possessions and all that they owned and brought the money and laid it at the feet of the apostles (Acts 4:34).

          <td>1900 Someone might find fault with this because our Lord did not say that the apostles would do greater things, but <b>he who believes in me</b> .

          <td>Ideo dicendum est aliter, quod Christus duplex opus facit. Unum sine nobis, videlicet creare caelum et terram, suscitare mortuos, et huiusmodi; aliud operatur in nobis, sed non sine nobis: quod est opus fidei, per quod vivificatur impius. De istis ergo loquitur hic dominus, quae sunt communia credenti. Et hoc est opus quod facit Christus in nobis, sed non sine nobis; quia eadem facit quicumque credit: quia quod fit in me per Deum, fit in me etiam per meipsum, scilicet per liberum arbitrium. Unde dicit apostolus: <i>non autem ego</i> , supple, solus, <i>sed gratia Dei mecum</i> . Et de istis dicit <i>opera quae ego facio, et ipse faciet, et maiora horum faciet</i> : quia maius est iustificare impium quam creare caelum et terram. Nam iustificatio impii, quantum est de se, perseverat in aeternum; Sap. I, 15: <i>iustitia perpetua est et immortalis</i> . Caelum autem et terra transibunt, ut dicitur Lc. XXI, 33. Item, quia opus corporale ordinatur ad spirituale: caelum autem et terra opus corporale est, iustificatio vero impii opus spirituale.
          <td>We should say, rather, that Christ works in two ways. In one way, he works without us, as in creating the heavens and the earth, raising the dead to life, and things like that. In the other way, he works in us but not without us: the result of this is faith, by which the impious are brought to life. Our Lord is speaking here of what is found in all believers: this is the result which Christ produces in us, but not without us. The reason for this is that whoever believes is producing the same result since what is produced in me by God is also produced in me by myself, that is, by my free choice. Thus the Apostle says: "it was not I," that is, I alone, "but the grace of God which is with me" (1 Cor 15:10). Christ is speaking of this result or work when he says that believers <b>will also do the works that I do; and greater works than these will he do</b> , for it is a greater thing to justify the impious than to create the heavens and the earth. For the justification of the impious, considered in itself, continues forever: "Righteousness is immortal" (Wis 1:15). But the heavens and the earth will pass away, as Luke (21:33) says. Further, effects which are physical are directed to what is spiritual. Now the heavens and the earth are physical effects, but the justification of the impious is a spiritual effect.

          <td>Sed hic incidit dubium. Nam in creatione caeli et terrae includitur creatio etiam sanctorum Angelorum. Numquid ergo maiora facit qui cooperatur Christo ad suam iustificationem quam creare Angelum? Quod Augustinus non determinat sed dicit: iudicet qui potest utrum maius sit iustos creare Angelos quam impios homines iustificare: certe si aequalis est utrumque potentiae, haec maioris est misericordiae. Si autem diligenter attendamus de quibus operibus dominus hic loquatur non praeferimus creationem Angelorum iustificationi impii. Non enim per hoc quod dicit <i>et maiora horum faciet</i> , oportet nos intelligere omnia opera Christi; sed illa tantum fortassis quae tunc faciebat. Tunc autem verbo fidei faciebat: et utique minus est verba iustitiae praedicare, quod fecit praeter nos, quam impios iustificare, quod ita facit in nobis ut faciamus et nos.
          <td>
            1901 This gives rise to a question. The creation of the holy angels is included in the creation of the heavens and the earth. Is it then a greater work to cooperate with Christ in one's own justification than to create an angel? Augustine does not settle this, but he does say: "Let him who can judge whether it is greater to create the just angels than to justify impious men. Certainly, if each shows an equal power, the second shows greater mercy." <a href="John14.htm#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" id="_ftnref27">[27]</a> But if we carefully consider what works our Lord is talking about here, we are not setting the creation of the angels above the justification of the impious. When our Lord said, <b>and greater works than these will he do</b> , we need not understand this to mean all the works of Christ, but perhaps only those which he was then doing. But then he was working by the word of faith, and it is not as great to preach words of righteousness [or of faith] which he did without us, as to justify sinners, which he does in us in such a way that we also do it.

Alio modo, ut sit sensus; Iudaei credunt quod me occiso fides mea extinguatur; et hoc non est verum, immo magis approbabitur, et vos maiora facietis <i>quia vado ad patrem</i> ; idest, non pereo, sed in propria maneo dignitate, et in caelis ero; supra XIII, 31: <i>nunc clarificatus est filius hominis, et Deus clarificatus est in eo</i> . Tertio modo: maiora facietis, et hoc, <i>quia vado ad patrem</i> ; quasi diceret: dum ero magis glorificatus, decet me maiora facere, et etiam dare vobis virtutes maiora faciendi. Unde, antequam Iesus esset glorificatus, spiritus non fuit datus discipulis in ea plenitudine in qua datus est postmodum; supra VII, v. 39: <i>nondum erat spiritus datus, quia Iesus nondum erat glorificatus</i> .
          <td>
            1902 Now he gives the reason why he said they will do greater things, which is <b>because I go to the Father</b> . This can be understood in three ways. First, according to Chrysostom: I will work as long as I am in the world, but when I leave, you will take my place. <a href="John14.htm#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" id="_ftnref28">[28]</a> And so, the things that I am doing you will do, and even greater things, <b>because I go to the Father</b> , and after that I will do nothing by myself, that is, by preaching. The second interpretation is this: The Jews think that if I am killed faith in me will be eradicated. This is not true. Indeed, it will be approved even more, and you will do greater things <b>because I go to the Father</b> , that is, I will not perish, but continue in my own dignity in heaven: "Now is the Son of man glorified, and in him God is glorified" (13:31). A third interpretation: You will do greater things <b>because I go to the Father</b> . He is saying in effect: Since I will be glorified more, it is appropriate that I do greater things, and also give you the power to do greater things. Thus, before Jesus was glorified, the Spirit was not given to the disciples in that fullness with which it was given after: "As yet the Spirit had not been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified" (7:39).

          <td>1904 As to the first, since our Lord said, "and greater works than these will he do," in order that the greatness of the worker might be known from the greatness of the works, some might suppose that one who believes in the Son of God would be greater than the Son. Our Lord excludes this by the way the works are done. For the Son does these works by his own authority, while one who believes in him does it by asking. So he says, <b>Whatever you ask the Father in my name, I will do it</b> .

IV, 12: <i>non est aliud nomen datum sub caelo hominibus, in quo oporteat nos salvos fieri</i> . Hoc enim nomen est super omne nomen; Ps. CXIII, 9: <i>non nobis, domine, non nobis: sed nomini tuo da gloriam</i> tertio quia ipse filius in eis et per eos omnia opera facit: unde dicit <i>hoc faciam</i> .

          <td>This eliminates the equality between believers and Christ in three ways. First, because as was said, believers do these works by asking: so he says, <b>Whatever you ask</b> . "Every one who asks receives" (Mt 7:8). Secondly, because believers work by reason of the Son; so he says, <b>in my name</b> , that is, by reason of my name: "There is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved" (Acts 4:12). For this name is above every name: "Not to us, O Lord, not to us, but to thy name give glory" (Ps 115:1). Thirdly, because the Son himself does all these works in them and through them: thus he says, <b>I will do it</b> . Note that the Father is asked and the Son does the work, the reason being that the works of the Father and the Son are inseparable: "Whatever he [the Father] does, that the Son does likewise" (5:19). For the Father does all things through the Son: "All things were made through him" (1:3).

Sed, secundum Augustinum, considerandum est hic primo, quod dicit <i>in nomine meo</i> , deinde quod subdit <i>hoc faciam</i> . Nomen enim Christi est nomen salutis; Matth. I, 21: <i>vocabis nomen eius Iesum: ipse enim salvum faciet populum suum a peccatis eorum</i> . Qui ergo petit aliquid pertinens ad salutem, petit in nomine Christi. Contingit autem quod aliquis petit non pertinens ad salutem ex duobus. Scilicet ex prava affectione; puta cum petit aliquid ad quod afficitur, quod tamen si haberet, salutem suam impediret. Et ideo qui sic petit, non exauditur, quia male petit; Iac. IV, 3: <i>petitis et non accipitis, eo quod male petatis</i> . Cum enim quis ex pravo affectu male usurus est eo quod vult accipere, domino potius miserante non accipit, quia non exaudivit ad votum, sed ad utilitatem magis.

          <td>
            1905 How could he say, <b>Whatever you ask I will do it</b> , since we see that his faithful ask and do not receive? According to Augustine, we should consider here that he first says, <b>in my name</b> , and then adds, <b>I will do it</b> . <a href="John14.htm#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" id="_ftnref29">[29]</a> The name of Christ is the name of salvation: "You shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins" (Mt 1:21). Therefore, one who asks for something pertaining to salvation asks in the name of Christ. It does happen that someone asks for something which does not pertain to salvation. This happens for two reasons. First, because one has a corrupt affection: as when one asks for something to which he is attracted, but which if he did have, would be an obstacle to his salvation. One who asks this way is not heard because he asks wrongly: "You ask and do not receive, because you ask wrongly" (Jas 4:3). For when someone, because of his corrupt affection, would badly use what he wants to receive, he does not receive it because of our Lord's compassion. The reason being that our Lord does not just look at one's desire, but rather the helpfulness of what is desired. For the good Lord often denies what we ask in order to give us what we should prefer.

          <td>Secundo ex ignorantia, dum quis aliquando petit quod credit sibi expedire, et tamen non expedit. Sed istis potius consulendo. Deus quae petunt non facit. Nam Paulus qui plus omnibus laboravit, ter dominum rogavit ut discederet ab eo stimulus carnis, nec tamen quod rogavit obtinuit, quia non erat sibi expediens. II Cor. XII, 8, et Rom. VIII, 26: <i>nam quid oremus sicut oportet, nescimus, sed ipse spiritus postulat pro nobis gemitibus inenarrabilibus</i> ; Matth. XX, 22: <i>nescitis quid petatis</i> . Patet ergo quod cum petimus in nomine eius, scilicet in nomine Iesu Christi, ipse hoc faciet.
          <td>The second reason we may ask for something which does not pertain to our salvation is our ignorance. We sometimes ask for what we think is helpful, but really is not. But God takes care of us, and does not do what we ask. Thus Paul, who labored more than all others, asked our Lord three times to take away a thorn in his flesh, but he did not receive what he asked because it was not useful for him (2 Cor 12:8). "We do not know how to pray as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with sighs too deep for words" (Rom 8:26). "You do not know what you are asking" (Mt 20:22). Thus it is clear that when we truly ask in his name, in the name of Jesus Christ, he will do it.

XXVI, 3: <i>dabo vobis pluviam temporibus suis</i> ; Is. XLIX, 8: <i>in die salutis exaudivi te</i> . Contingit etiam aliquando quod petimus pro aliquo, pro quo fortassis non exaudimur, tunc scilicet quando eius merita obstant; Ier. VII, 16: <i>tu ergo noli orare pro populo isto, quia non exaudiam te</i> ; et XV, 1: <i>si steterint Moyses et Samuel coram me, non est anima mea ad populum istum</i> .
          <td>He says, <b>I will do it</b> , using the future tense, not the present tense, because he sometimes postpones doing what we ask so that our desire for it will increase and so that he can grant it at the right time: "Rain will fall on you when it should fall" [Lev 26:4]; "In a day of salvation I have helped you" (Is 49:8). Again, it sometimes happens that we pray for people and are perhaps not heard, and this is because they put obstacles in the way. "Do not pray for this people ... for I do not hear you" (Jer 7:16); "Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, yet my heart would not turn toward this people" (Jer 15:1).

          <td>1906 Then when he says, <b>that the Father may be glorified in the Son</b> , he gives the reason. Augustine punctuates this passage in the following way. "Whatever you ask the Father in my name, I will do it." Then a new sentence begins: "That the Father may be glorified in the Son, if you ask me anything in my name, I will do it." This is like saying: I will do what you ask in my name so <b>that the Father may be glorified in the Son</b> , and everything that the Son does is directed to the glory of the Father: "I do not seek my own glory" (8:50). We also should direct all our works to the glory of God: "Do all to the glory of God" (1 Cor 10:31).

But because it might seem that this was in the distant future, and in the meantime they would still be in sorrow without their Teacher, he here soothes their sorrow by promising them the Holy Spirit. First, we see the preparation needed to receive the Holy Spirit; secondly, the Holy Spirit is promised, <b>he will give you another Paraclete</b> . Thirdly, this promise is clarified, <b>to be with you forever</b> . Preparation for receiving the Holy Spirit was necessary both for the disciples and for Christ.

Aliud vero imperat futurum: et quantum ad hoc dicit <i>mandata mea servate</i> , quasi dicat: non ostendatis amorem quem habetis ad me in fletu, sed in obedientia mandatorum meorum: hoc enim est manifestum dilectionis signum; infra XIV, 23: <i>si quis diligit me, sermonem meum servabit</i> .Haec ergo duo praeparant ad receptionem spiritus sancti. Cum enim spiritus sanctus sit amor, non datur nisi amantibus; Prov. VIII, v. 17: <i>ego diligentes me diligo</i> . Item datur obedientibus; Actor. III, 15: <i>nos huius rei testes sumus</i> et cetera. Is. LXVI, 2: <i>super quem requiescit spiritus meus</i> et cetera.

And it is clear that you do because you are sad over my leaving: "You also are witnesses, because you have been with me from the beginning" (15:27). The other he commands for the future, <b>keep my commandments</b> . This is like saying: You don't express your love for me by tears but by obedience to my commands, for this is a clear sign of love: "If a man love me, he will keep my word" (14:23). Thus, two things prepare one to receive the Holy Spirit. Since the Holy Spirit is love, he is given only to those who love: "I love those who love me" (Prv 8:17). Likewise, he is given to the obedient: "To this we are witnesses" (Acts 3:15); "I have put my Spirit upon him" (Is 42:1).

          <td>1909 Yet is it true that it is the obedience of the disciples and their love for Christ that prepare them for the Holy Spirit? It seems not, because the love by which we love God is from the Holy Spirit: "God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit which has been given to us" (Rom 5:5). Further, our obedience is from the Holy Spirit: "For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God" (Rom 8:14); "I have run in the way of your commandments when you enlarged my heart" [Ps 119:32]. One might answer that it is by loving the Son that we deserve to receive the Holy Spirit, and having him, we love the Father.

XXV, 24 ss., servo pigro ablatum est talentum quod acceperat a domino suo, quia non bene usus eo fuit, et datum est ei qui acceperat quinque, cum quibus lucratus fuerat alia quinque.

          <td>Accordingly, we should say that it is characteristic of the gifts of God that if one makes good use of a gift granted to him, he deserves to receive a greater gift and grace. And one who badly uses a gift, has it taken from him. For we read in Matthew (25:24) that the talent which the lazy servant received from his master was taken from him because he did not use it well, and it was given to the one who had received five talents. It is like this with the gift of the Holy Spirit. No one can love God unless he has the Holy Spirit: because we do not act before we receive God's grace, rather, the grace comes first: "He loved us first" [1 Jn 4:10]. We should say, therefore, that the apostles first received the Holy Spirit so that they could love God and obey his commands. But it was necessary that they make good use, by their love and obedience, of this first gift of the Holy Spirit in order to receive the Spirit more fully. And so the meaning is, <b>If you love me</b> , by means of the Holy Spirit, whom you have, and obey my commandments, you will receive the Holy Spirit with greater fullness.

Unde inquantum est homo, accedens ad Deum, impetrat nobis dona caelestia, et veniens ad nos elevat nos, et reducit ad Deum. Quia ergo iam ad nos venerat, et dando nobis mandata Dei reduxit credentes ad ipsum, restabat ut rediret ad patrem, et impetraret dona spiritualia; Hebr.

Note that our Lord Jesus Christ, as a human being, is the mediator between God and humankind, as we see from 1 Timothy (2:5). And so as a human being he approaches God and asks heavenly gifts for us, and coming to us he lifts us up and leads us to God. And so, because he had already come to us, and by giving us the commandments of God had led believers to God, he still had to return to the Father and ask for spiritual gifts: "Approaching God by himself he is able to save forever" [Heb 7:25]. He does this by asking the Father; and he says this, <b>I will pray the Father</b> : "When he ascended on high he led a host of captives and he gave gifts to men" (Eph 4:8).

He says, <b>he will give you another Paraclete</b> , that is, the Father, although not without the Son, will give the Holy Spirit, who is the Consoler, since he is the spirit of love. It is love that causes spiritual consolation and joy: "The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy" (Gal 5:22). The Holy Spirit is our advocate: "We do not know how to pray as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with sighs too deep for words" (Rom 8:26).

          <td>1912 An objection. The word "Paraclete" suggests an action of the Holy Spirit.

          <td>
            I reply that the Holy Spirit is a consoler and advocate, and so is the Son. John says that the Son is an advocate: "We have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteousness" (1 Jn 2:1). In Isaiah we are told he is a consoler: "The Spirit of the Lord has sent me to comfort those who mourn" [Is 61:1]. Yet the Son and the Holy Spirit are not consolers and advocates in the same way, if we consider the appropriation of persons [how and why we attribute certain attributes to the different Persons of the Trinity]. Christ is called an advocate because as a human being he intercedes for us to the Father; the Holy Spirit is an advocate because he makes us ask. Again, the Holy Spirit is called a consoler because he is formally love. But the Son is a consoler because he is the Word. The Son is a consoler in two ways: because of his teaching and because the Son gives the Holy Spirit and incites love in our hearts. Thus the word, <b>another</b> , does not indicate a different nature in the Son and in the Holy Spirit. Rather, it indicates the different way each is an advocate and a consoler. <a href="John14.htm#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" id="_ftnref31">[31]</a>

When something is given to a person only for a time, this is not a true giving; but there is a true giving when something is given to be kept forever. And so the Holy Spirit is truly given because he is to remain with them forever. He is with us for ever: in this life he enlightens and teaches us, bringing things to our mind; and in the next life he brings us to see the very reality: "And the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon David from that day forward" (1 Sam 16:13).

          <td>According to Chrysostom, the solution is that the Holy Spirit is said to remain in us by his gifts. Certain gifts of the Holy Spirit are necessary for salvation; these are found in all the saints and always remain in us, as charity, which never leaves (1 Cor 13:8), since it will continue into the future. Other gifts are not necessary for salvation, but are given to the faithful so they can manifest the Spirit: "To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good" (1 Cor 12:7). With this in mind, the Holy Spirit is with the disciples and the saints forever by the first type of gift. But it is peculiar to Christ that the Spirit is always with him by the second type of gift, for Christ always has a plenitude of power to work miracles and to prophesy, and so on. This is not true of others, because, as Gregory says, the spirits of the prophets are not under the control of the prophets.

He is called the Spirit to show the subtlety or fineness of his nature, for the word "spirit" is used to indicate something which is undiscoverable and invisible. And so what is invisible is usually referred to as a spirit. The Holy Spirit also is undiscoverable and invisible: "The Spirit blows where it wills, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes" [3:8]. He is also called the Spirit to indicate his power, because he moves us to act and work well. For the word "spirit" indicates a certain impulse, and that is why the word <i>spiritus</i> can also mean the wind: "For all who are impelled by the Spirit of God are sons of God" [Rom 8:14]; "Let thy good spirit lead me on a level path" (Ps 143:10).

            But the Holy Spirit leads to the knowledge of the truth, because he proceeds from the Truth, who says, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life" (14:6). In us, love of the truth arises when we have conceived and considered truth. So also in God, Love proceeds from conceived Truth, which is the Son. And just as Love proceeds from the Truth, so Love leads to knowledge of the truth: "He [The Holy Spirit] will glorify me because he will receive from me and declare it to you" [16: 14]. And therefore Ambrose says that any truth, no matter who speaks it, is from the Holy Spirit. <a href="John14.htm#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" id="_ftnref33">[33]</a> "No one can say 'Jesus is Lord' except by the Holy Spirit" (1 Cor 12:3); "When the Paraclete comes, whom I shall send to you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth ..."

It is a characteristic of the Holy Spirit to reveal the truth because it is love which impels one to reveal his secrets: "I have called you friends, for all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you" (15:15); "He showed it," the truth, "to his friend" [Job 36:33].

And no one can love, as his destination, both God and the world: "If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in him" (1 Jn 2:15). As Gregory says: "The Holy Spirit inflames everything he fills with a desire for invisible things. And because worldly hearts love only visible things, the world does not receive him, because it does not rise to the love of what is invisible.

            1919 In regard to the second, why he is not given to the world, he says, <b>because it neither sees him nor knows him</b> . For spiritual gifts are not received unless they are desired: "She," divine Wisdom, "hastens to make herself known to those who desire her." And they are not desired unless they are somehow known. Now there are two reasons why they are not known. First, because one does not want to know them; and secondly, because one is not capable of such knowledge. These two reasons apply to the worldly. In the first place, they do not desire this, and as to this he says, <b>the world neither sees him</b> , that is, does not want to know him: "They have fixed their eyes on the ground" [Ps 16:11]. Further, they are not capable of knowing him, and as to this he says, <b>nor knows him</b> . As Augustine says: "Worldly love does not have invisible eyes which alone can see the invisible Holy Spirit." <a href="John14.htm#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" id="_ftnref35">[35]</a> "The sensual person does not perceive those things pertaining to the Spirit of God" [1 Cor 2:14].

But because the apostles had not risen very high in their knowledge of the Holy Spirit, and their attention was absorbed by the presence of Christ, this consolation seemed small to them. Thus, in this part, our Lord promises, first, that he will return; secondly, his own gifts (v 25). Concerning the first, he promises then that he will return; and then he gives the reason (v 21); thirdly, he answers a question for one of the disciples (v 22). Concerning the first, he first shows that he will return; secondly, the way he will return (v 19); and thirdly, he foretells the fruit of his return (v 20).

Another father would be one whose evil example we follow: "You are of your father the devil" (8:44). A third father would be one who gratuitously adopts us: "You have received the spirit of adoption of sons" [Rom 8:15]. Now God does not adopt as his children those who imitate their father, the devil, for "What fellowship has light with darkness?" (2 Cor 6:14). And he does not adopt those who are too attached, in a worldly way, to their parents: "He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me" (Mt 10:37). But God does adopt as his children those who have become orphans by being stripped of their affection for sin and by abandoning a worldly love for their parents. "For my father and my mother have forsaken me, but the Lord will take me up" (Ps 27:10); but much more one who has left them: "Forget your people and your father's house; and the king will desire your beauty" (Ps 45:10).

One is after the resurrection and before his ascension, when he leaves them by death and comes to them after the resurrection and stands among his disciples, as is stated below (c 20).

This is because after the resurrection he did not show himself to all, but only to witnesses pre‑ordained by God, that is, to his disciples (Acts 1:3).

Here is another interpretation: I live, by my resurrection, <b>and you will live</b> , that is, you will rejoice over this, since "The disciples were glad when they saw the Lord" (20:20) Here, to live means to rejoice, and it is used in this sense in Genesis [45:26]: "When Jacob heard that Joseph was ruling in Egypt his spirit began to live again," with joy.

I, 7: <i>videbit eum omnis oculus</i> .

Et dicitur istud tempus modicum usque ad iudicium, in respectu ad aeternitatem. <i>Nam mille anni ante oculos tuos quasi dies hesterna quae praeteriit</i> : Ps. LXXXIX, 4. Et hoc modo apostolus Hebr. XII, 26 s. vocat istud tempus modicum, exponens illud Aggaei II, v. 7: <i>adhuc modicum, et ego movebo caelum et terram</i> et cetera. <i>Et mundus me iam non videt</i> ; quia ulterius post iudicium homines mundi amatores et pravi eum non videbunt, euntes in ignem aeternum. Unde Is. c. XXVI, 10, secundum aliam litteram, dicitur: <i>tollatur impius, ne videat gloriam Dei.

Yet they will see him at the judgment, according to: "Every eye will see him" (Rev 1:7). For this reason Augustine explains this <b>little while</b> as including the second coming, when Christ comes to judge. This time is described as little in comparison to eternity: "For a thousand years in your sight are but as yesterday when it is past" (Ps 90:4). The Apostle, in Hebrews (12:26), also refers to this time as a little while when he is explaining the statement in Haggai: "In a little while, I will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry land" (2:7). <b>And the world will see me no more</b> , because after the judgment those who love the world and the wicked will not see him, since they are going into eternal fire. As we read in another version of Isaiah [26:10]: "Remove the wicked so they do not see the glory of God." <b>But you</b> , who have followed me and stayed with me in my trials, <b>will see me</b> , in an everlasting eternity: "Your eyes will see the king in his beauty" (Is 33:17); "We shall always be with the Lord" (1 Thess 4:17). You will see me <b>because I live and you will live also</b> . This is like saying: Just as I have a glorified life in my soul and in my body, so will you "Christ will change our lowly body to be like his glorious body" (Phil 3:21). He says this because our glorified life is produced by the glorified life of Christ: "For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive" (1 Cor 15:22). Christ speaks of himself in the present tense, <b>I live</b> , because his resurrection would be immediately after his death, and there would be no delay; according to: "I will rise at dawn" [Ps 108:2], because "You will not let your holy one undergo corruption" [Ps 16:10]. When referring to the disciples he uses the future, <b>you will live</b> , because the resurrection of their bodies was to be postponed till the end of the world: "Your dead shall live, their bodies shall rise" (Is 26:19).

Philip did not know the Father, and so he asked: "Lord, show us the Father, and we shall be satisfied" (14:8). All these arose from ignorance of one thing: they did not know how the Father is in the Son and the Son is in the Father. Thus Christ said to Philip: "Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father in me?" (14:10). And so our Lord promises them that they will know this, saying, <b>In that day you will know that I am in my Father</b> , and so forth.

          <td>1932 As to the first he says, <b>he who has my commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me</b> . Note that true love is love which appears and proves itself by actions: for love is revealed by its actions. Since to love someone is to will that person something good and to desire what this person wants, one does not seem to truly love a person if he does not accomplish the will of the beloved or do what he knows this person wants. And so one who does not do the will of God does not seem to truly love him. Thus he says, <b>he who has my commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me</b> , that is, with a true love for me.

          <td>Sed nota, quod aliquis habet mandata Dei primo quidem in corde per memoriam et iugem meditationem; Ps. CXVIII, v. 11: <i>in corde meo abscondi eloquia tua, ut non peccem tibi</i> . Sed hoc non sufficit, nisi servet in opere; Ps. CX, 10: <i>intellectus bonus omnibus facientibus eum</i> . Quidam vero habent in ore, dicendo et exhortando; Ps. CXVIII, v. 103: <i>quam dulcia faucibus meis eloquia tua</i> . Et hi etiam debent ea servare in opere: quia <i>qui fecerit et docuerit, hic magnus vocabitur in regno caelorum</i> : Matth. V, 19. Unde vituperantur a Deo illi qui dicunt et non faciunt, Matth. XXIII. Quidam autem habent in aure, ea libenter et diligenter audiendo; supra VIII, 47: <i>qui est ex Deo, verba Dei audit</i> . Nec hoc sufficit, nisi servent: quia <i>non auditores legis, sed factores iustificabuntur</i> : Rom. II, 13; supra VI, 27: <i>operamini non cibum qui perit; sed qui permanet in vitam aeternam</i> . Ergo qui sic habet mandata Dei, aliqualiter servat ea, sed adhuc imponitur ei ut servet perseverando. Unde dicit Augustinus: qui habet in memoria et servat in vita, qui habet in sermonibus et servat in moribus, qui habet audiendo et servat faciendo, qui habet faciendo et servat perseverando, ipse est qui diligit me.
          <td>
            1933 Some have these commandments of God in their heart, by remembering them and continually meditating on them: "I have laid up your word in my heart, that I might not sin against you" (Ps 119:11). But this is not enough unless they are kept in one's actions: "A good understanding have all those who practice it" (Ps 111:10). Others have these commandments on their lips, by preaching and exhorting: "How sweet are your words to my taste" (Ps 119:103). They also should follow them in their actions, because "He who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven" (Mt 5:19). Thus in Matthew (c 23), God reprimands those who speak but do not act. Others have them by hearing them, gladly and earnestly listening to them: "He who is of God hears the words of God" (8:47). Yet this is not enough unless they keep them in their actions, "for it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law who will be justified" (Rom 2:13); "Do not labor for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures to eternal life" (6:27). Therefore, those who have the commandments [in the above ways] do keep them to a certain extent; but they still have to persist in keeping them. For this reason Augustine says: "The person who keeps the commandments in his memory and keeps them in his life, who has them in his speech and keeps them in his conduct, who has them by hearing them and keeps them by doing them, who has them by doing and persisting in doing them, this is one who loves me." <a href="John14.htm#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" id="_ftnref40">[40]</a>

          <td>Quantum ad secundum dicit <i>qui autem diligit me, diligetur a patre meo</i> . Sed hoc in primo aspectu videtur absurdum. Numquid enim Deus diligit nos, quia diligimus eum? Absit. Dicitur enim I Io. IV, v. 10: <i>non quasi dilexerimus Deum sed quoniam ipse prior dilexit nos</i> .
          <td>1934 As for the second reason why he will be seen by the faithful, he says, <b>he who loves me will be loved by my Father</b> . At first glance this does not seem to make sense. Does God love us because we love him? Assuredly not; for we read: "not that we loved God, but because he has first loved us" [1 Jn 4:10].
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Et ideo dicendum quod intellectum huius habemus ex his quae dicta sunt supra, scilicet, <i>qui habet mandata mea, et servat ea, ille est qui diliget me</i> . Non enim ibi dicitur quod ideo diligit quia servat mandata; sed quia diligit, ideo mandata implet. Et hoc modo dicendum est hic, quod ideo quis diligit Christum quia diligitur a patre, et non ideo diligitur quia diligit. Diligimus ergo filium, quia pater diligit nos. Habet enim hoc verus amor ut amatos ad amantis dilectionem trahat; Ier. c. XXXI, 3: <i>in caritate perpetua dilexi te, ideo, attraxi te, miserans</i> .
          <td>Therefore, we should understand this statement in the light of what was said before, "He who has my commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me." This does not mean that one keeps the commandments and as a result of this loves. But rather, one loves, and as a result of this, keeps the commandments. In the same way, we should say here that one is loved by the Father, and as a result he loves Christ, and not that one is loved because he loves. Therefore, we love the Son because the Father loves us. For it is a characteristic of true love that it draws the one loved to love the one who loves him: "I have loved you with an everlasting love, and therefore I have drawn you having compassion on you" [Jer 31:3].

          <td>Sed quia amor patris non est sine amore filii, cum idem sit amor utriusque, <i>quaecumque enim pater facit, haec et filius similiter facit</i> : supra V, 19, ideo subdit <i>et ego diligam eum</i> . Sed cum pater et filius omnia diligant ab aeterno; quare dicit <i>diligam</i> , in futuro? Dicendum est ergo, quod dilectio considerata prout est in divina voluntate, sic est aeterna; sed considerata secundum quod manifestatur in executione operis et effectus, est temporalis. Et ideo est sensus <i>et ego diligam eum</i> , idest effectum dilectionis ostendam, quia scilicet <i>manifestabo ei meipsum</i> : quia ad hoc diligam ut manifestem.
          <td>1935 Because the Father's love is not without the Son's love, since it is the same love in each, "Whatever the Father does, that the Son does likewise" [5:19], he adds, <b>and I will love him</b> . Why does he say, <b>I will love</b> , using the future, since the Father and the Son love all things from eternity? We should answer that love, considered as being in the divine will, is eternal; but considered as manifested in the accomplishment of some work and effect, is temporal. So the meaning is: <b>and I will love him</b> , that is, I will show the effect of my love, because <b>I will manifest myself to him</b> : for I love in order to manifest myself.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sciendum est autem, quod dilectio alicuius ad aliquem aliquando est secundum quid, aliquando simpliciter. Secundum quid quidem, quando vult ei aliquod bonum particulare; simpliciter autem, quando vult ei omne bonum. Deus autem omnia causata diligit secundum quid, quia omni creaturae vult aliquod bonum, etiam ipsis Daemonibus, ut scilicet vivant et intelligant et sint; quae sunt quaedam bona. Simpliciter autem diligit illos quibus vult omne bonum, scilicet ut habeant ipsum Deum, quem habere est habere veritatem, quia Deus veritas est. Sed veritas tunc habetur quando cognoscitur. Illos ergo vere et simpliciter diligit quibus manifestat seipsum, qui est veritas. Et hoc est quod dicit <i>manifestabo ei meipsum</i> , scilicet in futuro per gloriam, quod est ultimus futurae beatitudinis effectus; Iob XXXVI, v. 33: <i>annuntiat de ea amico suo, quod possessio eius sit</i> . Sap. VI, 14: <i>praeoccupat eos qui se concupiscunt</i> .
          <td>1936 Note that one's love for another is sometimes qualified and sometimes absolute. It is qualified when one wills the other some particular good; but it is absolute when one wills the other all good. Now God loves every created thing in a qualified sense, because he wills some good to every creature, even to the demons, for example, that they live and understand and exist. There are particular goods. But God loves absolutely those to whom he wills all good, that is, that they have God himself. And to have God is to have truth, for God is Truth. But truth is had or possessed when it is known. So God, who is Truth, truly and absolutely loves those to whom he manifests himself. This is what he says, <b>and I will manifest myself to him</b> , that is, in the future, by glory, which is the ultimate effect of future beatitude: "He showed it to his friend" [Job 36:33]; "She hastens to make herself known to those who desire her" (Wis 6:13).
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sed posset quis dicere: numquid pater non manifestabit se? Immo et pater et filius: nam filius et patrem simul et se manifestat, cum sit verbum eius; Matth. XI, v. 27: <i>neque patrem quis novit nisi filius</i> et cetera. Et tamen si interim filius manifestat se alicui aliquo modo, hoc est signum divinae dilectionis. Unde et haec potest esse ratio quare mundus eum non videbit, quia scilicet non manifestabit ei seipsum; et hoc quia non diligit eum.
          <td>1937 Someone might ask: The Father will manifest himself, will he not? Yes, both the Father and the Son. For the Son manifests himself and the Father at the same time, because the Son is the Word of the Father: "No one knows the Father except the Son" (Mt 11:27). If in the meantime the Son manifests himself to anyone in some way, this is a sign of God's love. And this can be a reason why the world will not see him, because he will not manifest himself to it because it does not love him.

Now the disciples had just heard our Lord say, "Yet a little while, and the world will see me no more, but you will see me," and so on. So it seemed that he was preferring the apostles to the entire world. Thus Judas, the brother of James, whose letter is part of Holy Scripture, was bewildered and astonished, and said, <b>Lord, how is it that you will manifest yourself to us, and not to the world?</b> It is like saying: Why will you do this? Are we superior to the whole world? David said something like this: "Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my house, that you have brought me thus far?" (2 Sam 7:18). And the righteous also say: "Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you?" (Mt 25:37).

As to the first, we see the fitness of the disciples to have Christ manifest himself to them; secondly, we see the manner and order of this manifestation, at <b>and my Father will love him</b> (v 23). In regard to the first, he mentions two things which make a person fit to receive God's manifestation. The first, is charity, the second is obedience.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Quantum ad primum dicit <i>si quis diligit me</i> . Tria enim necessaria sunt homini volenti Deum videre. Primo ut Deo appropinquet; Deut. XXXIII, 3: <i>qui appropinquant pedibus eius, accipient de doctrina illius</i> . Secundo ut ad eum videndum oculos elevet; Is. XL, 26: <i>levate in excelsum oculos vestros, et videte quis creavit haec</i> . Tertio ut visioni vacet: nam spiritualia videri non possunt, nisi quis vacet a terrenis; Ps. XXXIII, 9: <i>vacate, et videte, quoniam suavis est dominus</i> . Et haec tria facit caritas. Nam ipsa animam hominis Deo coniungit; I Io. IV: <i>qui manet in caritate, in Deo manet, et Deus in eo</i> . Ipsa ipsum intuitum ad Deum erigit; Matth. VI, 21: <i>ubi est thesaurus tuus, ibi est cor tuum</i> . Unde dicitur: <i>ubi est amor tuus, ibi oculus</i> . Ipsa enim a mundanis vacare facit; I Io. II, 15: <i>qui diligit saeculum, non est perfecta caritas Dei in illo</i> . Ergo, e contrario, qui perfecte Deum diligit, non est in illo amor saeculi.
          <td>1941 As to charity, he says, <b>If a man loves me</b> . Three things are necessary for a person who wants to see God. First, one must draw near to God: "Those who approach his feet will receive his teaching" [Deut 33:3]. Secondly, one must lift up his eyes in order to see God: "Lift up your eyes on high and see who created these things" [Is 40:26]. And thirdly, one must take time to look, for spiritual things cannot be seen if one is absorbed by earthly things: "Take time and see that the Lord is sweet" [Ps 34:8]. Now it is charity which accomplishes these three things. Charity joins our soul to God: "He who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him" (1 Jn 4:16). It also makes us look at God: "For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also" (Mt 6:21). As the saying goes: "Where your love is, there your eyes are." Charity also frees us from worldly matters: "If any one loves the world, perfect love for God is not in him" [1 Jn 2:15]. Thus, to turn it about, one who perfectly loves God, does not love the world.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Ex caritate autem sequitur obedientia; unde dicit <i>sermonem meum servabit</i> . Ut dicit Gregorius: <i>probatio dilectionis, exhibitio est operis. Numquam est Dei amor otiosus; operatur enim magna si est, si autem operari renuit, amor non est</i> . Voluntas enim, et maxime quae est de fine, movet alias potentias ad actus suos: non enim quiescit homo nisi faciat ea per quae ad finem intentum perveniat, praecipue si est intensa ad ipsum. Quando ergo voluntas hominis intensa est ad Deum, qui est finis eius, movet omnes vires ad faciendum ea quae ad ipsum ducunt. Intenditur autem in Deum per caritatem; et ideo caritas est quae nos servare mandata facit; II Cor. V, 14: <i>caritas Christi urget nos</i> ; Cant. VIII, 7: <i>lampades eius, lampades ignis</i> . Et per obedientiam homo efficitur idoneus ad videndum Deum; Ps. CXVIII, 104: <i>a mandatis tuis</i> , scilicet a me servatis, <i>intellexi</i> . Et iterum: <i>super senes intellexi</i> .
          <td>
            1942 Obedience follows from charity; and so he says, <b>he will keep my word</b> . Gregory says: "The proof of love is one's actions. Love for God is never lazy: if it is present it accomplishes great things; if it refuses to work, it is not love." <a href="John14.htm#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" id="_ftnref42">[42]</a> For the will, especially when it is concerned with an end, moves the other powers to their actions: for a person does not rest until he does those things which will bring him to his intended end, especially if it is intensely desired. And so, when a person's will is intent on God, who is its end, it moves all powers to do those things which obtain him. Now it is charity which makes one intent on God, and thus it is charity which causes us to keep the commandments: "The love of Christ controls us" (2 Cor 5:14); "Its flashes are flashes of fire" (Song 8:6). And through obedience a person is rendered fit to see God: "Through your precepts," that is, as kept by me, "I get understanding" (Ps 119:104). Again, "I understood more than the aged" (Ps 119:100).

          <td>Consequenter cum dicit <i>et pater meus diliget eum</i> , ponitur processus et ordo manifestationis. Tria autem sunt per quae fit homini divina manifestatio. Primum est divina dilectio; et quantum ad hoc dicit <i>pater meus diliget eum</i> . Supra est dictum quare dicit <i>diliget</i> in futuro, quantum videlicet ad effectum dilectionis, qui tamen ab aeterno dilexit quantum ad voluntatem benefaciendi; Mal. I, 2: <i>Iacob dilexi, Esau autem odio habui</i> . Non autem dicit, ego diligam eum, quia hoc iam eis patuit supra. Prov. VIII, 17: <i>ego diligentes me diligo</i> . Restabat ergo ut insinuaret eis quia pater diligeret eos; Deut. IV, 37: <i>dilexit populos: omnes sancti in manu eius sunt</i> .
          <td>1943 Then when he says, <b>and my Father will love him</b> , we see the manner and order of this manifestation. Three things are needed so a divine manifestation can be made to us. The first is divine love; and he refers to this when he says, <b>and my Father will love him</b> . We explained above why the future tense is used, <b>will love</b> , which is that he is referring to the effect of love, although from the point of view of his willing to do good, God loves us from eternity: "Yet I have loved Jacob but I have hated Esau" (Mal 1:2). Jesus does not say here, "I will love him," because he had already made that clear to them before: "I love those who love me" (Prv 8:17). It remained for him to say that the Father would love them: "He loved the people: all the saints are in his hand" [Deut 4:37].
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secundum est divina visitatio; et quantum ad hoc dicit <i>et ad eum veniemus</i> . Sed contra. Venire mutationem localem significat; sed Deus non mutatur; ergo et cetera. Responsio. Deus dicitur venire ad nos non quod ipse moveatur ad nos, sed quia nos movemur ad ipsum. Dicitur enim aliquid venire in locum in quem prius non fuit: hoc autem Deo non convenit, cum sit ubique; Ier. XXIII, 24: <i>caelum et terram ego impleo</i> . Dicitur etiam venire in aliquem, inquantum est ibi novo modo, secundum quem prius non fuerat ibi, scilicet per effectum gratiae: et per hunc effectum gratiae facit nos ad se accedere.
          <td>1944 The second thing needed is that the divine come to us; referring to this, he says, <b>and we will come to him</b> . An objection to this is that for a thing to come, it has to change its place. But God does not change. Therefore, I answer that God is said to come to us not because he moves to us, but because we move to him. Something comes into a place in which it previously was not: but this does not apply to God since he is everywhere: "Do I not fill heaven and earth?" (Jer 23:24). Rather, God is said to come to someone because he is there in a new way, in a way he had not been there before, that is, by the effect of his grace. It is by this effect of grace that he makes us approach him.

          <td>Sed attendendum, secundum Augustinum, quod tribus modis Deus venit ad nos, et iisdem nos imus ad eum. Primo quidem venit ad nos implendo suis effectibus, et nos imus ad eum capiendo ipsos; Eccli. c. XXIV, 26: <i>transite ad me omnes qui concupiscitis me, et a generationibus meis implemini</i> . Secundo illuminando, et nos imus ad eum considerando; Ps. XXXIII, 6: <i>accedite ad eum, et illuminamini</i> .

          <td>
            1945 According to Augustine, God comes to us in three ways and we go to him in the same three ways. <a href="John14.htm#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title="" id="_ftnref43">[43]</a> First, he comes to us by filling us with his effects; and we go to him by receiving them: "Come to me, you who desire me, and eat your fill of my produce" (Sir 24:19). Secondly, God comes to us by enlightening us; and we go to him by thinking of him: "Come to him and be enlightened" [Ps 33:6]. Thirdly, he comes to us by helping us; and we go to him by obeying, because we cannot obey unless helped by Christ: "Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord" (Is 2:3).
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sed quare non fecit mentionem de spiritu sancto? Augustinus dicit, quod non dicitur hoc, quod ipse sit excludendus adveniente patre et filio, quia supra dicitur: <i>ut maneat vobiscum in aeternum</i> . Sed cum in Trinitate sint duo: scilicet personarum distinctio, et essentiae unitas: aliquando quidem fit mentio de tribus personis, ad insinuandum distinctionem personarum: aliquando vero facit mentionem de duabus sine tertia, ad insinuandum essentiae unitatem. Vel dicendum, quod cum spiritus sanctus nihil sit aliud quam amor patris et filii, posito patre et filio intelligitur spiritus sanctus.
          <td>1946 Why does he not mention the Holy Spirit? Augustine says that we do not read here that the Spirit will be excluded when the Father and Son come, because we read above that the Spirit was "to be with you for ever" (v 16). Since in the Trinity there is a distinction of Persons and a unity of essence, sometimes the three persons are mentioned to indicate the distinction of the persons. And sometimes only two of the three persons are mentioned to indicate the unity of essence. Or again, one could say that since the Holy Spirit is nothing other than the love of the Father and the Son, when the Father and Son are mentioned, the Spirit is implied.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Tertio ad Dei manifestationem necessaria est perseverantia utriusque, scilicet in dilectione Dei, et in eius visitatione; et quantum ad hoc dicit <i>et mansionem apud eum faciemus</i> . In quo duo tangit. Primo quidem firmitatem adhaesionis ad Deum cum dicit <i>mansionem</i> . Nam Deus venit ad quosdam per fidem, sed, non manet, <i>quia ad tempus credunt, et in tempore tentationis recedunt</i> : Matth. VIII, 13. Ad quosdam venit per peccati compunctionem, non tamen manet cum eis, quia revertuntur ad peccata; Prov. c. XXVI, 11: <i>sicut canis qui revertitur ad vomitum suum, sic imprudens qui iterat stultitiam suam</i> . Sed in suis praedestinatis permanet semper; Matth. ult., 20: <i>ecce ego vobiscum sum omnibus diebus usque ad consummationem saeculi</i> .Secundo ostendit familiaritatem Christi ad homines: quia <i>apud eum</i> , scilicet diligentem ad obediendum, inquantum scilicet delectatur nobiscum, et facit nos delectari in ipso.

          <td>1947 The third thing required for the manifestation of God is the continuation of each of the above, that is, of the love of God and of his coming to us. In regard to these he says, <b>and make our home with him</b> . Two things are indicated here. First, when he says, <b>home</b> , he indicates the stability with which we cling to God. God comes to some by faith, but does not remain because "they believe for a while and in time of temptation fall away" (Lk 8:13). He comes to others through their sorrow for sin; yet he does not stay with them because they return to their sins: "Like a dog that returns to his vomit is a fool that repeats his folly" (Prv 26:11). But he remains forever in his predestined: "I am with you always, to the close of the age" (Mt 28:20). Secondly, these words indicate the intimacy of Christ with us: <b>with him</b> , that is, with the one who loves and obeys him, since he takes pleasure in us, and has us take pleasure in him, "delighting in the sons of men" (Prv 8:31).

          <td>Chrysostomus autem referens hoc ad aliam intentionem, dicit, quod Iudas audiens <i>non relinquam vos orphanos</i> etc., <i>vos autem videbitis me</i> etc., existimavit, quod Christus post mortem venturus esset ad eos, sicut mortui veniunt ad nos in somno; unde quaerit: <i>quid est factum quia nobis manifestaturus es teipsum, et non mundo?</i> Quasi diceret: vae nobis, quoniam morieris et ut mortuus debes nobis assistere. Ut ergo hoc excludat, dicit: ego et pater <i>ad eum veniemus</i> , idest, sicut pater manifestat seipsum, ita et ego, <i>et mansionem apud eum faciemus</i> : quod somniorum non est, in quibus nulla mora contrahitur.

            1948 Chrysostom gives this a different meaning. <a href="John14.htm#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" id="_ftnref44">[44]</a> He says that when Judas heard <b>I will not leave you orphans ... but you will see me</b> , he thought that after his death Christ would come to them like the dead appear to us in a dream. So he asks, <b>how is it that you will manifest yourself to us, and not to the world?</b> This was like saying: How unfortunate for us! You will die and can only help us as the dead do. To exclude this Christ says, I and the Father <b>will come to him</b> (v 23), that is, as the Father manifests himself, so I do also, <b>and make our home with him</b> , which is not done in dreams.

          <td>1949 Now he gives the reason why he will not manifest himself to the world: this reason is the lack of those things on account of which he says that he will manifest himself. For when the cause is absent, the effect is absent. Now the causes for a divine manifestation to be made to the worldly are not found in them. And so God will not manifest himself to the world and the worldly.

Patet ergo causa quare suis manifestaturus est se, et non alienis; quia hi quidem diligunt: dilectio namque sanctos discernit a mundo; Iob XXXVI, 32: <i>immanibus</i> , scilicet superbis, <i>abscondit lucem; et ita annuntiat de ea amico suo, quod possessio eius sit</i> ; ibid. c.

            It is clear that they do not have the cause, because the world does not love him. Referring to this he says, <b>he who does not love me</b> . Further, they do not obey him; and so he says, <b>does not keep my words</b> . As Gregory says: "To love God it is necessary to use our words, our minds and our lives." <a href="John14.htm#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" id="_ftnref45">[45]</a> The reason is obvious why God will manifest himself to his own, and not to the world. It is because his own really have love, and it is love which distinguishes the saints from the world: "He hides the light from the proud. He shows his friend that he owns it" [Job 36:32]; "The deep says 'It is not in me' and the sea," that is, one who is disordered, "says, 'It is not with me.'" (Job 28:14).

Et ideo hoc excludit dicens <i>et sermonem quem audistis, non est meus</i> ; idest non est mihi a meipso, sed est mihi ab alio, scilicet a patre, qui me misit.

          <td>1950 Then when he says, <b>and the word which you hear is not mine but the Father's</b> , he clears up what he had just said, "If a man loves me, he will keep my word, and my <i>Father</i> will love him, and <i>we</i> will come to him." For someone could say that there was no reason for this statement (v 23), and it would be more reasonable to have said: "I will love him, and I will come to him." To exclude this idea he says, <b>and the word which you hear is not mine</b> , that is, it is not mine as coming from myself, but it is mine as coming from another, from the Father, who sent me. It is like saying: One who does not hear this word does not love only me, he also does not love the Father. And therefore, one who loves both Christ and the Father deserves a manifestation of each. So he says: <b>and the word which you hear</b> , spoken by me, as a human being, is indeed mine insofar as I speak it, and yet it <b>is not mine</b> , insofar as it is mine from another: "My teaching is not mine" (7:16); "The words that I say to you I do not speak of my self" [14:10].

            1951 Augustine remarks that when our Lord refers to his own words he uses the plural, "my words" (v 24), but when he speaks of the utterance of the Father, he uses the singular form, "the word which you hear is not mine," because he wants us to understand that the word of the Father is he himself, the unique Word of the Father. <a href="John14.htm#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title="" id="_ftnref46">[46]</a> Thus he says he is from the Father, and not from himself, because he is neither his own image nor his own Son, but the Son and image of the Father.

          <td>1955 He describes the Holy Spirit in several ways: as the Paraclete, as Spirit, and as Holy. He is the Paraclete because he consoles us. He consoles us in our sorrows which arise from the troubles of this world: "fighting without and fear within" (2 Cor 7:5); "who comforts us in all our affliction" (2 Cor 1:4). He does this because he is love, and causes us to love God and give him great honor. For this reason we endure insults with joy: "Then they left the presence of the council rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the name" (Acts 5:41); "Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven" (Mt 5:12). He also consoles us in our sadness over past sins; Matthew refers to this in "Blessed are those who mourn for they shall be comforted" (5:4). He does this because he gives us the hope of forgiveness: "Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven" (20:22).

He is Holy because he consecrates us to God, and all consecrated things are called holy: "Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you" (1 Cor 6:19); "There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God" (Ps 46:4).

We should not think the Spirit comes by a local motion, but rather by being in them in a new way in which he was not before: "When you send forth your Spirit, they are created," that is, with a spiritual existence (Ps 104:30). Notice that the Holy Spirit is sent by the Father and the Son. To show this Christ sometimes says that the Father sends him, as he does here; and he sometimes says that he himself sends him, "I will send him to you" (16:7). Yet Christ never says that the Spirit is sent by the Father without mentioning himself. So he says here, <b>whom the Father will send in my name</b> . Nor does Christ say that the Spirit is sent by himself, the Son, without mentioning the Father: "the Paraclete, whom I shall send to you from the Father" (15:26).

Filius autem in nomine patris venit, non quod esset pater, sed quod esset filius patris: similiter spiritus sanctus venit in nomine filii, non quod diceretur filius, sed quod esset spiritus filii; Rom. VIII, 9: <i>si quis spiritum Christi non habet, hic non est eius</i> ; Gal.

          <td>1957 Why does he say, <b>in my name</b> ? Will the Holy Spirit be called the Son? One could answer that this was said for the reason that the Holy Spirit was given to the faithful when they invoked the name of Christ. But it is better to say that just as the Son comes in the name of the Father ‑ "I have come in my Father's name" ‑ so the Holy Spirit comes in the name of the Son. Now the Son comes in the name of the Father not because he is the Father, but because he is the Son of the Father. In a similar way, the Holy Spirit comes in the name of the Son not because he was to be called the Son, but because he is the Spirit of the Son: "Any one who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him" (Rom 8:9); "God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts" (Gal 4:6), because he is the Spirit of his Son, and not because he was to be called the Son: "he predestined [them] to be conformed to the image of his Son" (Rom 8:29). The basis for this is the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father and of the Holy Spirit with the Son.

          <td>
            Further, just as the Son, coming in the name of the Father, subjects his faithful to the Father ‑ "and has made them a kingdom and priests to our God" (Rev 5:10) ‑ so the Holy Spirit conforms us to the Son because he adopts us as children of God: You have received the spirit of adoption, by which we cry out 'Abba!'

Et ideo effectus missionis huiusmodi est ut faciat homines participes divinae sapientiae, et cognitores veritatis.

          <td>1958 Next he mentions the effect of the Holy Spirit, saying, <b>he will teach you all things</b> . Just as the effect of the mission of the Son was to lead us to the Father, so the effect of the mission of the Holy Spirit is to lead the faithful to the Son. Now the Son, once he is begotten Wisdom, is Truth itself: "I am the way, and the truth, and the life" (14:6). And so the effect of this kind of mission [of the Spirit] is to make us sharers in the divine wisdom and knowers of the truth. The Son, since he is the Word, gives teaching to us; but the Holy Spirit enables us to grasp it.

          <td>He says, <b>he will teach you all things</b> , because no matter what a person may teach by his exterior actions, he will have no effect unless the Holy Spirit gives an understanding from within. For unless the Spirit is present to the heart of the listener, the words of the teacher will be useless: "The breath of the Almighty makes him understand" (Job 32:8). This is true even to the extent that the Son himself, speaking by means of his human nature, is not successful unless he works from within by the Holy Spirit.

          <td>1959 We read before that "Every one who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me" (6:45). Here he is expanding on this, because one does not learn without the Holy Spirit teaching. He is saying in effect: one who receives the Holy Spirit from the Father and the Son knows the Father and the Son and comes to them. The Spirit makes us know all things by inspiring us from within, by directing us and lifting us up to spiritual things. Just as one whose sense of taste is tainted does not have a true knowledge of flavors, so one who is tainted by love of the world cannot taste divine things: "The sensual man does not perceive those things of the Spirit of God" [1 Cor 2:14].

Quia vero spiritus sanctus a filio procedit, ideo quod spiritus sanctus appropriate facit, attribuitur filio. Et secundum hunc modum Christus attribuit sibi pacem, dicens <i>pacem relinquo vobis</i> : ubi primo promittit donum pacis, quam relinquit; secundo distinguit pacem istam a pace mundi, ibi <i>non quomodo mundus dat, ego do vobis</i> .
          <td>Note that if we consider the characteristic feature of the persons of the Son and the Holy Spirit, our Lord seems to interchange their gifts. Since the Son is the Word, it seems that the gifts of wisdom and knowledge are appropriate to him. But peace is appropriate, appropriated, to the Holy Spirit, since he is love, which the cause of peace. Nevertheless, because the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of the Son, and what the Holy Spirit gives he has from the Son, our Lord here attributes this gift of knowledge to the Holy Spirit, saying, <b>he will teach you all things</b> . Yet, this gift is still appropriate to the Son. And because the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son, actions which are appropriate to the Holy Spirit are attributed to the Son. This is the reason why Christ attributes peace to himself, saying, <b>Peace I leave with you</b> . First, he promises his gift of peace, which he is leaving; secondly, he distinguishes this peace from the peace of the world.

          <td>1962 He says, <b>Peace I leave with you</b> . Peace is nothing else than the tranquillity arising from order, for things are said to have peace when their order remains undisturbed. In a human being there is a threefold order: that of a person to himself; of a person to God; and of a person to his neighbor. Thus, the human person can enjoy a threefold peace. One peace is interior, when he is at peace with himself, and his faculties are not unsettled: Great peace have those who love your law" (Ps 119:165). Another peace is peace with God, when one is entirely conformed to his direction: "Since we are justified by faith, let us have peace with God" (Rom 5:1). The third peace is with our neighbor: "Strive for peace with all men" (Heb 12:14).

Et ideo Augustinus in Lib. de verbis domini, pacem sanctorum definiens dicit: pax est serenitas mentis, tranquillitas animae, simplicitas cordis, amoris vinculum, consortium caritatis: ut serenitas mentis referatur ad rationem, quae debet esse libera, non ligata, nec absorpta aliqua inordinata affectione; tranquillitas animi referatur ad sensitivam, quae debet a molestatione passionum quiescere; simplicitas cordis referatur ad voluntatem, quae debet in Deum obiectum suum totaliter ferri; amoris vinculum referatur ad proximum; consortium caritatis ad Deum. Hanc autem pacem hic sancti habent et habebunt in futuro; sed hic quidem imperfecte, quia nec ad nos nec ad Deum nec ad proximum pacem sine perturbatione aliqua possumus habere; sed in futuro habebimus eam perfecte, quando sine hoste regnabimus: ubi numquam poterimus dissentire.
          <td>
            There are three things which have to be put in order within us: the intellect, the will and sense appetency. The will should be directed by the mind or reason, and sense appetency should be directed by the intellect and will. Accordingly, Augustine, in his <i>The Words of our Lord,</i> describes the peace of the saints by saying: "Peace is a calmness of mind, a tranquillity of soul, a simplicity of heart, a bond of love and a fellowship of charity." <a href="John14.htm#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" id="_ftnref49">[49]</a> Calmness of mind refers to our reason, which should be free, not tied down, nor absorbed by disordered affections; tranquillity of soul refers to our sense appetency, which should not be harassed by our emotional states; simplicity of heart refers to our will, which should be entirely set toward God, its object; the bond of love refers to our neighbor; and the fellowship of charity to God. The saints have this peace now, and will have it in the future. But here it is imperfect because we cannot have an undisturbed peace either with ourselves, or with God, or with our neighbor. We will enjoy it perfectly in the future, when we reign without an enemy and there can never be conflicts.

XLV, 30: <i>statuit illi testamentum pacis, et principem fecit eum</i> . Sicut Augustinus dicit, non poterit ad haereditatem domini pervenire, qui testamentum eius noluerit observare: nec potest concordiam habere cum Christo qui discors esse voluerit cum Christiano.

            Our Lord here promises us each kind of peace. The first kind when he says, <b>Peace I leave with you</b> , that is, in this world, so that you can conquer the enemy and love each other. This is a kind of covenant established by Christ which we should keep: "A covenant of peace was established with him" (Si 45:24). As Augustine says, one can not gain the inheritance of the Lord who is unwilling to observe his covenant, nor can he have a union with Christ if he lives in strife with a Christian. <a href="John14.htm#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50" id="_ftnref50">[50]</a> He promises the second kind of peace when he says, <b>my peace I give to you</b> , that is, in the future: "I will bring her," the heavenly Jerusalem, "a river of peace" [Is 66:12].

          <td>Sed cum sive in mundo, sive in patria, tota pax sanctorum perveniat eis per Christum; infra XVI, 33: <i>in me pacem habebitis</i> , quare dominus loquens de pace sanctorum in via, non dicit, <i>pacem meam do vobis</i> : sed tantum cum loquitur de pace sanctorum in patria? Ad quod dicendum, quod utraque pax, scilicet praesens et futura, est Christi; sed praesens ut auctoris tantum; futura autem est eius ut auctoris et possessoris: nam ipsam semper habuit, quia semper fuit absque contradictione. Pax autem praesens, ut dictum est, est cum contradictione aliqua: et ideo licet eam faciat, non tamen eam possidet. Et, secundum praedicta, expositio procedit de pace temporis et pace aeternitatis. Sed, secundum Augustinum, potest utrumque exponi de pace temporis: et dicit <i>pacem relinquo vobis</i> , exemplo, sed <i>do pacem meam</i> , potestate et virtute.
          <td>1963 Since whether in this world or in our native land, all the peace possessed by the saints comes to them through Christ - "in me you shall have peace" [16:33] ‑ why does our Lord, when speaking of the peace of the saints in this life not say, "my peace I give to you," instead of reserving this for the peace of our native land? We should say that each peace, of the present and of the future, is a peace of Christ. But our present peace is the peace of Christ because he is only its author. The future peace is the peace of Christ both because he is its author and because it is a peace such as he possesses it. He always had this second kind of peace, because he was always without [interior] conflict. Our present peace, as was said, is not without conflict, and although Christ is its author, he does not possess it this way. This explanation makes use of the distinction between the peace of this time and the peace of eternity. According to Augustine, both statements can refer to the peace of this time. Then Christ is saying, <b>Peace I leave with you</b> , by my example, but <b>my peace I give to you</b> , by my power and strength.

          <td>Consequenter cum dicit <i>non quomodo mundus dat, ego do vobis</i> , ipsam pacem a pace mundi distinguit. Distinguitur autem pax sanctorum a pace mundi quantum ad tria. Primo quantum ad intentionem: nam pax mundi ordinatur ad quietam et pacificam fruitionem temporalium, quo fit ut quandoque cooperetur hominibus ad peccandum; Sap. XIV, 22: <i>in magno viventes inscientiae bello tot et tam magna mala pacem appellant</i> . Sed pax sanctorum ordinatur ad bona aeterna. Est ergo sensus: <i>non quomodo mundus dat, ego do</i> ; idest non ad eumdem finem: quia mundus dat quantum ad exteriora quiete possidenda, ego vero do quantum ad aeterna adipiscenda.
          <td>1964 Then when he says, <b>not as the world gives do I give to you</b> , he distinguishes this peace from the peace of the world. The peace of the saints is different from the peace of the world in three ways. First, the purpose of each is different. Temporal peace is directed to the quiet and calm enjoyment of temporal things, with the result that it sometimes helps a person to sin: "They live in strife due to ignorance, and they call such great evils peace" (Wis 14:22). But the peace of the saints is directed to eternal goods. The meaning, therefore is: <b>not as the world gives do I give to you</b> , that is, not for the same end. The world gives peace so exterior goods can be possessed undisturbed; but I give peace so that you can obtain eternal things.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secundo vero quantum ad simulationem et veritatem: quia pax mundi est simulata, quia tantum exterius: Ps. XXVII, 3: <i>loquuntur pacem cum proximo suo, mala autem in cordibus eorum</i> ; pax vero Christi est vera, quia est interius et exterius. Et sic est sensus: <i>non quomodo mundus dat</i> , idest non simulatam pacem do; sicut mundus, sed veram.Tertio quantum ad perfectionem: quia pax mundi est imperfecta, cum sit tantum quantum ad quietem exterioris hominis et non interioris; Is. LVII, 21: <i>non est pax impiis, dicit dominus</i> : sed pax Christi quietat interius et exterius; Ps. CXVIII, 165: <i>pax multa diligentibus legem tuam</i> . Et est sensus: <i>non quomodo mundus dat</i> idest, non ita imperfectam.
          <td>They also differ as the pretended or deceitful from the true, because the peace of the world is a pretended peace since it is only on the outside: "The wicked ... who speak peace with their neighbors, while mischief is in their hearts" (Ps 27:3). But the peace of Christ is true, because it is both on the outside and the inside. So the meaning is, <b>not as the world gives do I give to you</b> , that is, I do not give a pretended peace, as the world does, but true peace. Thirdly, they differ in perfection, because the peace of the world is imperfect since it is not concerned with the interior tranquillity of a person but only with externals. "There is no peace, says my God, for the wicked" (Is 57:21). But the peace of Christ brings tranquillity both within and without. "Great peace have those who love your law" (Ps 119:165). So the meaning is: <b>not as the world gives</b> , that is, not such an imperfect peace.

First, he casts a certain uneasiness from their hearts; secondly, he recalls something which somewhat consoled them, yet partly troubled them; thirdly, he gives a reason which will completely console them; fourthly, he answers an unspoken question.

          <td>1970 This passage led Arius to the disparaging statement that the Father is greater than the Son. Yet our Lord's own words repel this error. One should understand <b>the Father is greater than I</b> , based on the meaning of <b>I go to the Father</b> . Now the Son does not go to the Father insofar as he is the Son of God, for as the Son of God he was with the Father from eternity: "In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God" (1:1). Rather, he is said to go to the Father because of his human nature. Thus when he says, <b>the Father is greater than I</b> , he does not mean I, as Son of God, but as Son of man, for in this way he is not only inferior to the Father and the Holy Spirit, but even to the angels: "We see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels" [Heb 2:9]. Again, in some things he was subject to human beings, as his parents (Lk 2:51). Consequently, he is inferior to the Father because of his human nature, but equal because of his divine nature: "He did not think it robbery to be equal to God, but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant" [Phil 2:6].

Nam pater nihil ab alio accipit, filius autem naturam, ut ita dicam, a patre accipit per aeternam generationem. Est ergo pater maior, quia dat; sed filius non est minor, sed aequalis, quia totum quod pater habet, accipit; Phil. II, 9: <i>dedit ei nomen quod est super omne nomen</i> .

For the Father receives nothing from another, but the Son, if I can put it this way, receives his nature from the Father by an eternal generation. So, the Father is greater because he gives; but the Son is not inferior, but equal, because he receives all that the Father has: "God has bestowed on him the name which is above every name" (Phil 2:9). For the one to whom a single act of existence <i>(esse) is</i> given, is not inferior to the giver.

IV, 15: <i>nemo vestrum patiatur ut fur aut homicida (...). Si autem ut Christianus, non erubescat</i> . Circa hoc ergo primo ostendit dominus quod peccatum non fuit causa suae mortis; secundo quod eius causa fuit virtus obedientiae et caritatis, ibi <i>sed ut cognoscat mundus quia diligo patrem</i> .
          <td>1974 Then when he says, <b>I will no longer talk much with you</b> , he mentions another source of their consolation, based on the reason for his death. Sometimes the reason for a person's death is a cause for sorrow, as when one is killed because he is guilty; other reasons are consoling, as when someone dies for that good we call virtue: "Let none of you suffer as a murderer or a thief ... yet if one suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed" (1 Pet 4:15). With respect to this, our Lord first shows that a sin was not the reason for his death; secondly, that it was caused by the virtues of obedience and love, <b>so that the world may know that I love the Father</b> .

          <td>Dicit ergo <i>iam non multa loquar vobiscum</i> , propter temporis brevitatem; supra XIII, 33: <i>filioli, adhuc modicum vobiscum, sum</i> . Vel quia nondum capaces estis; infra XVI, 12: <i>adhuc multa habeo vobis loqui, sed non potestis portare modo</i> . Vel ideo <i>non multa loquar vobiscum</i> , quia in uno brevi sermone explicabo vobis quod non moriar ex culpa mea. Et hoc facit consequenter cum dicit <i>venit enim princeps mundi huius, et in me non habet quidquam</i> , scilicet Diabolus, qui dicitur princeps, non ratione creationis, neque per naturalem potestatem, ut Manichaei blasphemant, sed ratione culpae huius, idest amatorum mundi: unde dicitur princeps mundi et peccati. Eph. ult., v. 12: <i>non est nobis colluctatio adversus carnem et sanguinem; sed adversus rectores et principes tenebrarum harum</i> . Non ergo est princeps creaturarum, sed peccatorum et tenebrarum; Iob XLI, 25: <i>ille est rex super omnes filios superbiae</i> .
          <td>1975 He says, <b>I will no longer talk much with you</b> , because the time is short: "Little children, yet a little while I am with you" (13:33). Or, because you are not yet ready for it: "I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now" (16:12). Or, <b>I will no longer talk much with you</b> , because I will briefly explain to you that I will not die because of my own guilt. And he does this when he says, <b>for the ruler of this world is coming. He has no power over me</b> . This ruler is the devil, and he is called a ruler of this world not because he is its creator, or because of his natural power, as the Manicheans blasphemed, but because of guilt, that is, because of the lovers of this world. For this reason he is called the ruler of the world and of sin: "For we are not contending against flesh and blood, but against ... the world rulers this present darkness" (Eph 6:12). Therefore, he is not the ruler of creatures, but of sinners and of darkness: "He is king over all the children of pride" (Job 41:34).

          <td>Hic ergo princeps venit ad persequendum: intravit enim in cor Iudae ut proderet, Iudaeorum vero ut occiderent; sed <i>in me non habet quidquam</i> : nam in nobis non habet potestatem nisi propter peccatum; supra VIII, v. 34: <i>qui facit peccatum, servus est peccati</i> . In Christo autem nullum peccatum erat, neque secundum animam: I Petr. II, 22: <i>qui peccatum non fecit</i> etc. neque secundum carnem, quia ex virgine absque originali peccato de spiritu sancto conceptus; Lc. I, 35: <i>quod enim ex te nascetur sanctum, vocabitur filius Dei</i> . Quia ergo Diabolus Christum, in quo nullum ius habuit, etiam invasit, perdere meruit quod iuste possidebat; Mc. V, 7: <i>quid nobis et tibi, Iesu fili Dei altissimi?</i> Sic ergo patet quod causa mortis suae non fuit culpa; sed nec erat cur moreretur, si non habet peccatum.
          <td>So this ruler comes to afflict: he entered into the heart of Judas to incite his betrayal, and into the hearts of the Jews to incite them to kill. But <b>he has no power over me</b> , for he has no power over us except because of sin: "Every one who commits sin is a slave to sin" (8:34). Now in Christ there was no sin: not in his soul, "He committed no sin" (1 Pet 2:22), nor in his flesh, because he was conceived of the Virgin without original sin through the Holy Spirit: "the child to be born of you will be called holy, the Son of God" (Lk 1:35). Because the devil even attacked Christ, over whom he had no right, he deserved to lose what he justly held: "What have I do to with you, Jesus, Son of the Most High God?" [Mk 5:7]. So it is clear that the cause of Christ's death wasArial'&gt; not his own guilt; and there was no reason for him to die if he had no sin.

            1976 Then he mentions the true reason for his death, which is that good which is virtue. He says, <b>so that the world may know that I love the Father</b> . Augustine relates this sentence to what follows, <b>Rise, let us go hence</b> . <a href="John14.htm#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55" id="_ftnref55">[55]</a>

Et hoc probat per indicium, quia mandata sua implet; supra: <i>si diligitis me, mandata mea servate</i> . Et quantum ad hoc dicit <i>sed ut cognoscat mundus quia diligo patrem</i> etc.; et hoc efficaciter, quia scilicet morior; unde subdit <i>et sicut mandatum dedit mihi pater, sic facio</i> : quod est secundum quod pater movit eum ad mortem suscipiendam, scilicet obedientia, quae ex amore causatur. Mandatum autem hoc dedit pater non filio Dei, qui cum sit verbum, est etiam mandatum patris; sed dedit filio hominis, inquantum animae eius inspiravit necessarium esse saluti humanae ut Christus in humana natura moreretur. Ut ergo hoc mundus cognoscat, <i>surgite</i> , de loco ubi coenaverant, <i>et eamus</i> , ad locum ubi ego sum tradendus, ut videatis quod non ex necessitate, sed ex caritate et obedientia morior; Iob XXXIX, 21: <i>audacter in occursum pergit armatis</i> .
          <td>Two things led Christ to undergo death: love for God and love for neighbor; "Walk in love" (Eph 5:2). He shows this love by the sign that he accomplishes what God commands: "If you love me keep my commandments" [14:15]. Referring to this he says, <b>that the world may know that I love the Father</b> , with an active love, because I go to die. Thus he adds, <b>I do as the Father has commanded me</b> . This is obedience, which is produced by love; and it is the second thing by which the Father moved him to undergo death. The Father did not give this commandment to the Son of God, who since he is the Word, is also the command of the Father. He gave this commandment to the Son of man, insofar as he infused into his soul that it was necessary for the salvation of humankind that the Christ die in his human nature. And so, that the world may know these things, <b>Rise</b> , from the place where they had eaten, <b>let us go hence</b> , to the place where I am to be betrayed, so that you can see that I am not dying by necessity, but from love and obedience: "He goes out to meet the weapons" (Job 39:21).
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secundum Chrysostomum autem aliter legitur: ut in hoc scilicet quod dicit <i>sic facio</i> , sit finis sententiae; et in hoc quod resumit: <i>surgite, eamus hinc</i> , sit principium alterius: ut sit sensus: non morior, quasi princeps mundi huius habeat in me quidquam, sed <i>quia diligo patrem</i> , ideo hoc facio. Vos autem <i>surgite et eamus hinc</i> . Videbat enim eos formidare et propter tempus, quia nox profunda erat, et propter locum, quia in villa manifeste sistebant, ita ut semper circumvolverent ad ostium oculos, quasi expectando hostes eos invadentes, et propter hoc non attendentes his quae dicebantur. Et ideo ut melius verba quae dicturus erat intelligerent, ducit eos in locum alium secretum, ut aestimantes se securos esse, attentius audiant quae diceret eis; Oseae II, 14: <i>ducam eam in solitudinem, et loquar ad cor eius</i> .
          <td>
            1977 Chrysostom understands this differently, since he does not relate <b>Rise, let us go hence</b> , to what came before it in the same way. <a href="John14.htm#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56" id="_ftnref56">[56]</a> The meaning now is: I am not dying because the ruler of this world has power over me; I am doing this because I love the Father. But as for you, <b>Rise, let us go hence</b> . He said this because he saw they were afraid, both because of the time, as it was deep into the night, and due to the place, for they were obviously at some house and constantly watching the entrance as if expecting to be set upon by their enemies. Consequently they were not paying attention to what he was saying. So Christ led them to another hidden place, so that feeling more secure they could listen with more attention to what he would say to them and understand it better: "I will bring her into the wilderness, and speak tenderly to her" (Hos 2:14).
