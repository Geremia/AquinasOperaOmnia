              1 There was a certain Pharisee named Nicodemus, a member of the

            424 he describes his person in three ways. First, as to his
            religion, because he was a Pharisee, hence he says,
            <b>There was a certain Pharisee.</b> For there were two sects among
            the Jews: the Pharisees and the Sadducees. The Pharisees were closer
            to us in their beliefs, for they believed in the resurrection, and
            admitted the existence of spiritual creatures. The Sadducees, on the
            other hand, disagree more with us, for they believed neither in the
            resurrection to come nor in the existence of spirits. The former
            were called Pharisees, as being separated from the others. And
            because their opinion was the more credible and nearer to the truth,
            it was easier for Nicodemus to be converted to Christ. “I lived as a
            Pharisee, according to the strictest sect of our religion” (Acts
            26:5).

            426 Thirdly, as to his rank he says, a
            <b>member of the Sanhedrin.</b> For although our Lord did not choose
            the wise or powerful or those of high birth at the beginning, lest
            the power of the faith be attributed to human widsom and power—“Not
            many of you are learned in the worldly sense, not many powerful, not
            many of high birth. But God chose the simple ones of the world” (1
            Cor 1:26)—still he willed to convert some of the wise and powerful
            to himself at the very beginning. And he did this so that his
            doctrine would not be held in contempt, as being accepted
            exclusively by the lowly and uneducated, and so that the number of
            believers would not be attributed to the rusticity and ignorance of
            the converts rather than to the power of the faith. However, he did
            not will that a large number of those converted to him be powerful
            and of high birth, lest, as has been said, it should be ascribed to
            human power and wisdom. And so it says, “many of those in authority
            believed in him” (below 12:42), among whom was this Nicodemus. “The
            rulers of the people have come together” (Ps 46:10).

            their knowledge or the condition of their actions. Here an obscure
            time is mentioned, <b>at night.</b> For the night is obscure and
            suited to the state of mind of Nicodemus, who did not come to Jesus
            free of care and anxiety, but in fear; for he was one of those of
            whom it is said that they “believed in him; but they did not admit
            it because of the Pharisees, so that they would not be expelled from
            the synagogue” (below 12:42). For their love was not perfect, so it
            continues, “For they loved the glory of men more than the glory of’
            God.”

            <b>Rabbi,</b> i.e., Teacher, because, “You call me Teacher and Lord;
            and you do well, for so I am,” as we read below (13:13). For
            Nicodemus had read what was written in Joel (2:23): “Children of
            Sion, rejoice, and be joyful in the Lord your God, because he has
            given you a teacher of justice.” But he says too little, because he
            says that Jesus came as a teacher from God, but is silent on whether
            he is God. For to come as a teacher from God is common to all good
            prelates: “I will give you shepherds after my own heart, and they
            will feed you with knowledge and doctrine,” as it says in Jeremiah
            (3:15). Therefore, this is not unique to Christ even though Christ
            taught in a manner unlike other men. For some teachers teach only
            from without, but Christ also instructs within, because “He was the
            true light, which enlightens every man” (above 1:9); thus he alone
            gives wisdom: “I will give you an eloquence and a wisdom” (Lk
            21:15), and this is something that no mere man can say.

            <b>for no one could perform the signs you perform.</b>
            And he is speaking the truth, because the signs which Christ did
            cannot be worked except by God, and because God was with him: “He
            who sent me is with me” (below 8:29). But he says too little,
            because he believed that Christ did not perform these signs through
            his own power, but as relying on the power of another; as though God
            were not with him by a unity of essence but merely by an infusion of
            grace. But this is false, because Christ performed these signs not
            by an exterior power but by his own; for the power of God and of
            Christ is one and the same. It is similar to what the woman says to
            Elijah: “Because of this I know that you are a man of God” (1 Kgs
            17:24).

            430 Then when he says that Jesus answered,
            <b>Amen, amen, I say to you</b>, he sets down the necessity for
            spiritual regeneration, because of the ignorance of Nicodemus. And
            so he says, <b>Amen, amen</b>. Here we should note that this word,
            <b>amen</b>, is a Hebrew word frequently employed by Christ; hence
            out of reverence for him no Greek or Latin translator wanted to
            translate it. Sometimes it means the same as “true” or “truly”; and
            sometimes the same as “so be it.” Thus is the Psalms 71 (v 19), 88
            (v 53), and 106, where we have, “So be it, so be it,” the Hebrew has
            “Amen, amen.” But John is the only Evangelist who duplicates or
            makes a twin use of this word. The reason for this is that the other
            Evangelists are concerned mainly with matters pertaining to the
            humanity of Christ, which, since they are easier to believe, need
            less reinforcement; but John deals chiefly with things pertaining to
            the divinity of Christ, and these, since they are hidden and remote
            from men’s knowledge and experience, require greater formal
            declaration.

            having an imperfect opinion about Christ, affirmed that he was a
            teacher and performed these signs as a mere man. And so the Lord
            wishes to show Nicodemus how he might arrive at a deeper
            understanding of him. And as a matter of fact, the Lord might have
            done so with an argument, but because this might have resulted in a
            quarrel—the opposite of which was prophesied about him: “He will not
            quarrel” (Is 42:2)—he wished to lead him to a true understanding
            with gentleness. As if to say: It is not strange that you regard me
            as a mere man, because one cannot know these secrets of the divinity
            unless he has achieved a spiritual regeneration. And this is what he

            Ubi sciendum, quod cum visio sit actus vitae, secundum diversas

            cognitionem. Est et vita spiritualis, qua homo conformatur Deo et
            spiritibus sanctis, et haec habet spiritualem visionem. Secundum
            carnalem quidem spiritualia videri non possunt; I Cor. c. II, 14:
            <i>animalis homo non percipit ea quae sunt spiritus Dei</i>, sed
            percipiuntur visione spirituali; unde ibidem subditur
            <i>quae Dei sunt, nemo novit nisi spiritus Dei</i>. Spiritus autem

            432 Here we should point out that since vision is an act of life,
            then according to the diverse kinds of life there will be diversity
            of vision. For there is a sentient life which some living things
            share in common, and this life has a sentient vision or knowledge.
            And there is also a spiritual life, by which man is made like God
            and other holy spirits; and this life enjoys a spiritual vision. Now
            spiritual things cannot be seen by the sentient: “The sensual man
            does not perceive those things that pertain to the Spirit of God” (1
            Cor 2:14), but they are perceived by the spiritual vision: “No one
            knows the things of God but the Spirit of God” (1 Cor 2:11). So the
            apostle says: “You did not receive the spirit of slavery, putting
            you in fear again, but the spirit of adoption” (Rom 8:15). And we
            receive this spirit through a spiritual regeneration: “He saved us
            by the cleansing of regeneration in the Holy Spirit” (Ti 3:3).
            Therefore, if spiritual vision comes only through the Holy Spirit,
            and if the Holy Spirit is given through a cleansing of spiritual
            regeneration, then it is only by a cleansing of regeneration that we
            can see the kingdom of God. Thus he says,
            <b
              >unless one is born again of water and the Holy Spirit, he cannot
              enter the kingdom of God.</b
            >
            As if to say: It is not surprising if you do not see the kingdom of
            God, because no one can see it unless he receives the Holy Spirit,
            through whom one is reborn a son of God.

            Now in the Old Law there was a spiritual regeneration; but it was
            imperfect and symbolic: “All were baptized into Moses, in the cloud
            and in the sea” (1 Cor 10:2), i.e., they received baptism in symbol.
            Accordingly, they did see the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but
            only symbolically: “seeing from afar” (Heb 11:13). But in the New
            Law there is an evident spiritual regeneration, although imperfect,
            because we are renewed only inwardly by grace, but not outwardly by
            incorruption: “Although our outward nature is wasting away, yet our
            inward nature is being renewed day by day” (2 Cor 4:16). And so we
            do see the kingdom of God and the mysteries of eternal salvation,
            but imperfectly, for as it says, “Now we see in a mirror, in an
            obscure manner” (1 Cor 13:12). But there is perfect regeneration in
            heaven, because we will be renewed both inwardly and outwardly. And
            therefore we shall see the kingdom of God in a most perfect way:
            “But then we will see face to face,” as is said in 1 Corinthians
            (13:12); and “When he appears we will be like him, because we will

            because he was begotten from eternity: “Before the daystar I begot
            you” (Ps 109:3), and as to the principle of his generation, because
            he proceeds from the heavenly Father: “I came down from heaven not
            to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me” (below 6:38).
            Therefore, because our regeneration is in the likeness of the Son of
            God, inasmuch as “Those whom he foreknew he predestined to become
            conformed to the image of his Son” (Rom 8:29), and because that
            generation is from above, our generation also is from above: both as
            to the time, because of our eternal predestination, “He chose us in
            him before the foundation of the world” (Eph 1:4), and as to its
            being a gift of God, as we read below (6:44), “No one can come to me
            unless the Father, who sent me, draws him”; and “You have been saved
            by the grace of God” (Eph 2:5).

            things that were said to him. Consequently, what the Lord said,to
            him about spiritual regeneration, he understood of carnal
            generation. And this is what he says:

            438 Nicodemus objected to the Lord’s statement that a man must be
            born again according to the two ways in which this seemed
            impossible. In one way, on account of the irreversibility of human
            life; for a man cannot return to infancy from old age. Hence we
            read, “I am walking on a path,” namely, this present life, “by which
            I will not return” (Jb 16:23). And it is from this point of view
            that he says,
            <b>How can a man be born again when he is already an old man?</b>
            As if to say: Shall he become a child once more so that he can be
            reborn? “He will not return again to his home, and his place will
            not know him any more” (Jb 7:10). In the second way, regeneration
            seemed impossible because of the mode of carnal generation. Forin
            the beginning, when a man is generated, he is small in size, so that
            his mother’s womb can contain him; but later, after he is born, he
            continues to grow and reaches such a size that he cannot be
            contained within his mother’s womb. And so Nicodemus says,
            <b
              >Is it possible for him to return to his mother’s womb and be born
              all over again?</b
            >
            As if to say: He cannot, because the womb cannot contain him.

            439 But this does not apply to spiritual generation. For no matter
            how spiritually old a man might become through sin, according to the
            Psalm (31:3): “Because I kept silent, all my bones grew old,” he
            can, with the help of divine grace, become new, according to the
            Psalm (102:5): “Your youth will be renewed like the eagle’s.” And no
            matter how enormous he is, he can enter the spiritual womb of the
            Church by the sacrament of baptism. And it is clear what that
            spiritual womb is; otherwise it would never have been said: “From
            the womb, before the daystar, I begot you” (Ps 109:3). Yet there is
            a sense in which his objection applies. For just as a man, once he
            is born according to nature, cannot be reborn, so once he is born in
            a spiritual way through baptism, he cannot be reborn, because he
            cannot be baptized again: “One Lord, one faith, one baptism,” as we
            read in Ephesians (4:5).

            442 Now there is a reason why spiritual generation comes from the
            Spirit. It is necessary that the one generated be generated in the
            likeness of the one generating; but we are regenerated as sons of
            God, in the likeness of his true Son. Therefore, it is necessary
            that our spiritual regeneration come about through that by which we
            are made like the true Son. and this conies about by Our having his
            Spirit: “If any one does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not
            his” (Rom 8:9); “By this we know that we abide in him, and he in us:
            because he has given us of his Spirit” (1 Jn 4:13). Thus spiritual
            regeneration must come from the Holy Spirit. “You did not receive
            the spirit of slavery, putting you in fear again, but the spirit of
            adoption” (Rom 8:15); “It is the Spirit that gives life” (below

            solum quod spirituale est hominis, ostenderetur regenerari. Ut ergo

            443 Water, too, is necessary for this regeneration, and for three
            reasons. First, because of the condition of human nature. For man
            consists of soul and body, and if the Spirit alone were involved in
            his regeneration, this would indicate that only the spiritual part
            of man is regenerated. Hence in order that the flesh also be
            regenerated, it is necessary that, in addition to the Spirit through
            whom the soul is regenerated, something bodily be involved, through
            which the body is regenerated; and this,is water.

        <tr style="text-align: justify" valign="top">
          <td>
            Secundo propter humanam cognitionem: nam, sicut Dionysius dicit,
            divina sapientia ita omnia ordinat ut unicuique provideat secundum
            modum suae conditionis. Homo autem est naturaliter cognoscitivus;
            oportet ergo eo modo dona spiritualia hominibus conferri, ut ea
            cognoscant; I Cor. II, 12:
            <i>ut sciamus quae a Deo donata sunt nobis</i>. Naturalis autem
            modus huius cognitionis est ut spiritualia per sensibilia cognoscat,
            cum omnis nostra cognitio a sensu incipiat. Oportuit ergo ad hoc
            quod intelligamus id quod spirituale est in hac regeneratione, quod
            esset in ea aliquid sensibile et materiale, scilicet aqua: per quod
            intelligamus quod sicut aqua lavat et purgat corporaliter exterius,
            ita et per Baptismum homo lavatur et purgatur interius
            spiritualiter.
          </td>
          <td>
            Secondly, water is necessary for the sake of human knowledge. For,
            as Dionysius says, divine wisdom so disposes all things that it
            provides for each thing according to its nature. Now it is natural
            for man to know; and so it is fitting that spiritual things be
            conferred on men in such a way that he may know them: “so that we
            may know what God has given us” (1 Cor 2:12). But the natural manner
            of this knowledge is that man know spiritual things by means of
            sensible things, since all our knowledge begins in sense knowledge.
            Therefore, in order that we might understand what is spiritual in
            our regeneration, it was fitting that there be in it something
            sensible and material, that is, water, through which we understand
            that just as water washes and cleanses the exterior in a bodily way,
            so through baptism a man is washed and cleansed inwardly in a
            spiritual way.

            Tertio propter causae congruitatem: nam causa nostrae regenerationis
            est verbum incarnatum. Supra I, 12:
            <i>dedit eis potestatem filios Dei fieri</i>. Congruit ergo quod in
            sacramentis, quae efficaciam habent ex virtute verbi incarnati, sit
            aliquid correspondens verbo, et aliquid correspondens carni, seu
            corpori. Et hoc est spiritualiter aqua in sacramento Baptismi, ut
            scilicet per eam configuremur morti Christi, dum submergimur in ea,
            quando baptizamur, sicut Christus tribus diebus fuit in ventre
            terrae; Rom. VI, 4:
            <i>consepulti enim sumus cum illo per Baptismum</i>.
          </td>
          <td>
            Thirdly, water was necessary so that there might be a correspondence
            of causes. For the cause of our regeneration is the incarnate Word:
            “He gave them power to become the sons of God,” as we saw above
            (1:12). Therefore it was fitting that in the sacraments, which have
            their efficacy from the power of the incarnate Word, there be
            something corresponding to the Word, and something corresponding to
            the flesh, or body. And spiritually speaking, this is water when the
            sacrament is baptism, so that through it we may be conformed to the
            death of Christ, since we are submerged in it during baptism as
            Christ was in the womb of the earth for three days: “We are buried
            with him by baptism” (Rom 6:4).

            Hoc etiam mysterium in prima rerum productione signatum est, Gen. I,

            Further, this mystery was suggested in the first production of
            things, when the Spirit of God hovered over the waters (Gn 1:2). But
            a greater power was conferred on water by contact with the most pure
            flesh of Christ; because in the beginning water brought forth
            crawling creatures with living souls, but since Christ was baptized
            in the Jordan, water has yielded spiritual souls.

            444 It is clear that the Holy Spirit is God, since he says,
            <b>unless one is born again of water and the Holy Spirit</b>
            (<i>ex aqua et Spiritu Sancto</i>). For above (1:13) he says: “who
            are born not from blood, nor from the desires of the flesh, nor from
            man’s willing it, but from God (<i>ex Deo</i>).” From this we can
            form the following argument: He from whom men are spiritually reborn
            is God; but men are spiritually reborn through the Holy Spirit, as
            it is stated here; therefore, the Holy Spirit is God.

            445 Two questions arise here. First, if no one enters the kingdom of
            God unless he is born again of water, and if the fathers of old were
            not born again of water (for they were not baptized), then they have
            not entered the kingdom of God. Secondly, since baptism is of three
            kinds, that is, of water, of desire, and of blood, and many have
            been baptized in the latter two ways (who we say have entered the
            kingdom of God immediately, even though they were not born again of
            water), it does not seem to be true to say that
            <b

              enter the kingdom of God.</b

            Responsio. Dicendum est quantum ad primum, quia regeneratio ex aqua
            et spiritu sancto fit dupliciter, scilicet in veritate et figura.
            Antiqui autem patres, licet non fuerint regenerati regeneratione
            vera, fuerunt tamen regenerati regeneratione figurali, quia semper
            habuerunt aliquod signum sensibile, in quo vera regeneratio
            praefigurabatur; et secundum hoc renati intraverunt regnum Dei,
            soluto pretio.
          </td>
          <td>
            The answer to the first is that rebirth or regeneration from water
            and the Holy Spirit takes place in two ways: in truth and in symbol.
            Now the fathers of old, although they were not reborn with a true
            rebirth, were nevertheless reborn with a symbolic rebirth, because
            they always had a sense perceptible sign in which true rebirth was
            prefigured. So according to this, thus reborn, they did enter the
            kingdom of God, after the ransom was paid.

            Quantum ad secundum dicendum, quod illi qui renascuntur Baptismo
            sanguinis et flaminis, licet non habeant regenerationem in actu,
            habent tamen in voto: alias enim neque Baptismus sanguinis aliquid
            valeret; nec esse posset Baptismus spiritus. Sic ergo ad hoc quod
            homo intret regnum Dei, oportet quod adsit Baptismus aquae in re,
            sicut est in omnibus baptizatis; vel in voto, sicut est in
            martyribus et catechumenis, qui morte praeveniuntur antequam votum
            impleant; vel in figura, sicut in antiquis patribus.
          </td>
          <td>
            The answer to the second is that those who are reborn by a baptism
            of blood and fire, although they do not have regeneration in deed,
            they do have it in desire. Otherwise neither would the baptism of
            blood mean anything nor could there be a baptism of the Spirit.
            Consequently, in order that man may enter the kingdom of heaven, it
            is necessary that there be a baptism of water in deed, as in the
            case of all baptized persons, or in desire, as in the case of the
            martyrs and catechumens, who are prevented by death from fulfilling
            their desire, or in symbol, as in the case of the fathers of old.

            446 It might be remarked that it was from this statement,
            <b>unless one is born again of water and the Holy Spirit,</b>
            that the Pelagians derived their error that children are baptized
            not in order to be cleansed from sin, since they have none, but in
            order to be able to enter the kingdom of God. But this is false,
            because as Augustine says in his book,
            <i>The Baptism of Children,</i>
            it is not fitting for an image of God, namely, man, to be excluded
            from the kingdom of God except for some obstacle, which can be
            nothing but sin. Therefore, there must be some sin, namely, original
            sin, in children who are excluded from the kingdom.

            carne, est effectiva generationis; materialiter vero, quia aliquod
            carnale in animalibus est materia generati. Sed ex spiritu non
            dicitur aliquid nasci materialiter, cum spiritus immutabilis sit,

            448 Note, however, that this preposition
            <i>ex</i>
            (from, of, by) sometines designates a material cause, as when I say:
            “A knife is made of (<i>ex</i>) iron”; sometimes it designates an
            efficient cause, as when I say: “The house was built by (<i>ex</i>)
            a carpenter.” Accordingly, the phrase,
            <b>what is born of</b>
            (<i>ex</i>) flesh is itself flesh, can be understood according to
            either efficient or material causality. As efficient cause, indeed,
            because a power existing in flesh is productive of generation; and
            as material cause, because some camal element in animals makes up
            the animal generated. But nothing is said to be made out of spirit
            (<i>ex spiritu</i>) in a material sense, since spirit is
            unchangeable, whereas matter is the subject of change; but it is
            said in the sense of efficient causality.

            scilicet quae est ex carne materialiter solum, et ex spiritu sancto
            effective. Et haec est singularis et propria Christi: quia
            materialiter est habens carnem ex carne matris natus, et effective
            est ex spiritu sancto; Matth. I, 20:
            <i>quod enim in ea natum est, de spiritu sancto est</i>. Et ideo
            natus est sanctus; Lc. I, 35:
            <i
              >spiritus sanctus superveniet in te, et virtus altissimi
              obumbrabit tibi: ideoque quod nascetur ex te sanctum, vocabitur

          <td>
            According to this, we can discern a threefold generation. One is
            materially and effectively from (<i>ex</i>) the flesh, and is common
            to all who exist according to the flesh. Another is according to the
            Spirit effectively, and according to it we are reborn as sons of God
            through the grace of the Holy Spirit, and are made spiritual. The
            third is midway, that is, only materially from the flesh but
            effectively from the Holy Spirit. And this is true in the singular
            case of Christ: because he was born deriving his flesh materially
            from the flesh of his mother, but effectively from the Holy Spirit:
            “What she has conceived is of the Holy Spirit” (Mt 1:20). Therefore,
            he was born holy: “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power
            of the Most High will overshadow you. And so the Holy One who will
            be born from you, will be called the Son of God” (Lk 1:35).

            Ubi sciendum est, quod duplex est admiratio. Una devotionis,
            secundum quod aliquis magnalia Dei considerans, cognoscit ea sibi
            incomprehensibilia esse: unde relinquitur admirationi locus,
            secundum illud Ps. XCII, 4: <i>mirabilis in altis dominus</i>; et
            alibi CXVIII, v. 129: <i>mirabilia testimonia tua</i>. Et ad hanc
            homines sunt inducendi, non prohibendi. Alia est infidelitatis, dum
            quis ea quae dicuntur non credens, miratur. Unde dicitur Matth. c.
            XIII, 57 quod <i>mirabantur in doctrina Christi</i>: et sequitur,
            quod <i>scandalizabantur in eo</i>. Et ab hac admiratione dominus
            Nicodemum removet, inducens exemplum, cum dicit
            <i>spiritus ubi vult spirat</i>. Quod quidem, eadem servata
            sententia, dupliciter quantum ad litteram exponi potest.

            Here we should note that there are two kinds of surprise or
            astonishment. One is the astonishment of devotion in the sense that
            someone, considering the great things of God, sees that they are
            incomprehensible to him; and so he is full of astonishment: “The
            Lord on high is wonderful” (Ps 92:4), “Your testimonies are
            wonderful” (Ps 118:129). Men are to be encouraged, not discouraged,
            to this kind of astonishment The other is the astonishment of
            disbelief, when someone does not believe what is said. So Matthew
            (13:54) says: “They were astonished,” and further on adds that “They
            did not accept him.” It is from this kind of astonishment that the
            Lord diverts Nicodemus where he proposes an example and says:
            <b>The wind</b> (<i>spiritus</i>, wind, spirit)
            <b>blows where it wills.</b> In the literal sense, the same words
            can he explained in two ways.

            450 In the first way, according to Chrysostom, spiritus is taken for
            the wind, as in Psalm 148 (v 8): “The winds of the storm that
            fulfill his word.” According to this interpretation, he says four
            things about the wind. First, the power of the wind, when he says,
            <b>the wind blows where it wills.</b> And if you say that the wind
            has no will, one may answer that “will” is taken for a natural
            appetite, which is nothing more than a natural inclination, about
            which it is said: “He created the weight of the wind” (Jb 28:25).
            Secondly, he tells the evidence for the wind, when he says,
            <b>and you hear its sound,</b> where “sound” (<i>vox</i>, voice,
            sound) refers to the sound the wind makes when it strikes a body. Of
            this we read: “The sound (<i>vox</i>) of your thunder was in the
            whirlwind” (Ps 76:19).

            One may answer that there are two ways in which the source of the

            possible to know where it comes from, i.e., from which direction of
            the world, for example, that Auster comes from the south, and where
            it goes, that is, to the north. In another way, in particular: and
            in this sense it is not known where the wind comes from, i.e., at
            which precise place it originated, or where it goes, i.e., exactly
            where it stops. And almost all the Greek doctors agree with this

            452 In another way,
            <i>spiritus</i> is taken for the Holy Spirit. And according to this,
            he mentions four things about the Holy Spirit. First, his power,
            saying,
            <b>The Spirit blows where it wills,</b>
            because it is by the free use of his power that he breathes where he
            wills and when he wills, by instructing hearts: “One and the same
            Spirit does all these things, distributing to each as he wills” (1
            Cor 12:11). This refutes the error of Macedonius who thought that
            the Holy Spirit was the minister of the Father and the Son. But then
            he would not be breathing where he willed, but where he was
            commanded.

            an unbeliever, and thus not fit to hear the voice of the Holy
            Spirit. We may answer to this, with Augustine, that there is a
            twofold voice of the Holy Spirit. One is that by which he speaks
            inwardly in man’s heart; and only believers and the saints hear this
            voice, about which the Psalm (84:9) says: “I will hear what the Lord
            God says within me.” The other voice is that by which the Holy
            Spirit speaks in the Scriptures or through those who preach,
            according to Matthew (10:20): “For it is not you who speak, but the
            Holy Spirit who is speaking through you.” And this voice is heard by
            unbelievers and sinners.

            Thirdly, he has an origin and an end that are hidden, because no one
            can judge one who is spiritual: “The spiritual man judges all
            things, and he himself is judged by no one” (1 Cor 2:15). Or, we do
            not know where such a person comes from, i.e., the source of his
            spiritual birth, which is baptismal grace; or where he goes, i.e.,
            of what he is made worthy, that is, of eternal life, which remains
            concealed from us.

            There are two reasons why one may question about something. Some
            question because of disbelief, as did Zechariah, saying: “How will I
            know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in age” (Lk
            1:18); “He confounds those who search into mysteries” (Is 40:23).
            Others, on the other hand, question because of a desire to know, as
            the Blessed Virgin did when she said to the angel: “How shall this
            be, since I do not know man?” (Lk 1:34). It is the latter who are
            instructed. And so, because Nicodemus asked from a desire to learn,
            he deserved to be instructed.

            460 He chides him for his slowness, basing himself on three things.
            First, the condition of the person to whom he is speaking, when he
            says,
            <b>You are a teacher in Israel.</b>
            And here the Lord did not chide him to insult him. Rather, because
            Nicodemus, presuming on his own knowledge, was still relying on his
            status as a teacher, the Lord wished to make him a temple of the
            Holy Spirit by humbling him: “For whom will I have regard? For he
            who is humble and of contrite spirit” (Is 66:2). And he says,
            <b>You are a teacher,</b>
            because it is tolerable if a simple person cannot grasp profound
            truths, but in a teacher, it deserves rebuke. And so he says, You
            are a teacher, i.e., of the letter that kills (2 Cor 3:6),
            <b>and you do not know these things?</b>
            i.e., spiritual things. “For although you ought to be teachers by
            now, you yourselves need to be taught again” (Heb 5:12).

            Corinthians (10:2): “All were baptized into Moses, in the cloud and
            in the sea.” And the prophets also said this: “I will pour clean

            462 Secondly, he rebukes him for his slowness on account of the

            is reprehensible to reject the statements of a man who is wise and
            who possesses great authority. And so he says, Amen, amen I say to

            “What we have seen and heard” (1 Jn 1:3). And so the Lord mentions
            both:
            <b>we know of what we speak, and we bear witness of what</b>
            we see. Indeed, the Lord as man knows all things: “Lord, you know
            all things” (below 21:17); “The Lord, whose knowledge is holy, knows
            clearly” (2 Mc 6:30). Further, he sees all things by his divine
            knowledge: “I speak of what I have seen with my Father,” as we read

            Quaestio ergo Nicodemi

            venire aut ad occultum caelorum ire? Unde antequam quaestioni

            466 Here we should consider, first of all, how this answer of Christ
            is an adequate reply to the question of Nicodemus. For above, when
            the Lord was speaking of the Spirit, he said:
            <b>you do not know where it comes from or where it</b>
            goes. We understand by this that spiritual regeneration has a hidden
            source and a hidden end. Now the things in heaven are hidden from
            us: “Who will search out the things in heaven?” (Wis 9:16).
            Therefore, the sense of Nicodemus’ question,
            <b>How can all this happen?</b>
            is this: How can something come from the secret things of heaven or
            go to the secret things of heaven? So before answering, the Lord
            expressed this interpretation of the question, saying,
            <b>how will you believe if I tell you of heavenly things?</b>

            ascended.” This is verified even in natural things, namely, that
            each body tends to a place according to its origin or nature. And so
            in this way it can come about that someone, through the Spirit, may
            go to a place which carnal persons do not know, i.e., by ascending
            into heaven, if this is done through the power of one who descended
            from heaven: because he descended in order that, in ascending, he
            might open a way for us: “He ascends, opening the way before them”

            anything from her, as water passes through a pipe; so that his body
            was neither of an earthly substance nor taken from the Virgin. But
            this is contrary to the statement of the Apostle, writing to the

            468 Therefore, we should not understand that the Son of Man
            descended from heaven according to his human nature, but only
            according to his divine nature. For since in Christ there is one
            <i>suppositum</i>, or hypostasis, or person of the two natures, the
            divine and human natures, then no matter from which of these two
            natures this
            <i>suppositum</i>
            is named, divine and human things can be attributed to him. For we
            can say that the Son of Man created the stars and that the Son of
            God was crucified. But the Son of God was crucified, not according
            to his divine nature, but according to his human nature; and the Son
            of Man created the stars according to his divine nature. And so in
            things that are said of Christ, the distinction is not to be taken
            with respect to that about which they are said, because divine and
            human things are said of God and man indifferently; but a
            distinction must be made with respect to that according to which
            they are said, because divine things are said of Christ according to
            his divine nature, but human things according to his human nature.
            Thus, to descend from heaven is said of the Son of Man, not
            according to his human nature, but according to his divine nature,
            according to which it was appropriate to him to have been from
            heaven before the incarnation, as is said, “Heaven belongs to the
            Lord” (Ps 113:16).

            up from the earth, will draw all to myself” (below 12:32). And
            fourthly, because in the death of the cross he was lifted up in the
            sense that there he triumphed over his enemies; so it is not called
            a death, but a lifting up: “He will drink from the stream on the
            way, therefore he will lift up his head” (Ps 109:7). Fifthly, he
            willed to die lifted up because the cross was the reason for his
            being lifted up, i.e., exalted: “He became obedient to the Father
            even to death, the death of the cross; on account of which God has
            exalted him” (Phil 2:8).

            477 Here we should note that the cause of all our good is the Lord
            and divine love. For to love is, properly speaking, to will good to
            someone. Therefore, since the will of God is the cause of things,
            good comes to us because God loves us. And God’s love is the cause
            of the good of nature: “You love everything which exists” (Wis 11:2
            5). It is also the cause of the good which is grace: “I have loved
            you with an. everlasting love, and so I have drawn you” i.e.,
            through grace (Jer 3 1:3). But it is because of his great love that
            he gives us the good of glory. So he shows us here, from four
            standpoints, that this love of God is the greatest.

            says: “The proof of love is given by action.” But God has given us
            the greatest of gifts, his Only Begotten Son, and so he says,

            <i>suppositum</i> of the two natures, as was explained above. And so

            forth that gift as a sign of the divine love, through which the
            fruit of eternal life comes to us. And so, he should have been
            called by that name which indicates the power that produces eternal
            life; and this power is not in Christ as Son of Man but as Son of
            God: “This is the true God and eternal life,” as we read in 1 John

            can lay a foundation other that the one that has been laid, that is,
            Jesus Christ” (1 Cor 3:11); and further on: “If a man’s building

            488 Concerning the first we should note, according to Augustine,
            that Christ does not say, “whoever does not believe is judged,” but
            rather
            <b>is not judged.</b>
            This can be explained in three ways. For, according to Augustine,
            whoever does not believe is not judged, because he is already
            judged, not in fact, but in God’s foreknowledge, that is, it is
            already known to God that he will be condemned: “The Lord knows who
            are his” (2 Tim 2:19). In another way: according to Chrysostom,
            <b>whoever does not believe is already judged,</b>
            that is, the very fact that he does not believe is for him a
            condemnation: for not to believe is not to adhere to the light—which
            is to live in darkness, and this is a momentous condemnation: “All
            were bound with one chain of darkness” (Wis 17:17). “What kind ofjoy
            can I have, I who sit in darkness and do not see the light of
            heaven?” (Tb 5:12). In a third way: also according to Chrysostom,
            <b>whoever does not believe is not judged,</b>
            that is, being already condemned, he displays the obvious reason for
            his condemnation. This is like saying that a person who is proven
            guilty of death is already dead, even before the sentence of death
            has been passed on him, because he is as good as dead.

            “There is no other name under heaven given to men, by which we are

              habebit lumen vitae</i

            <b>whoever does not believe is already judged,</b>
            because
            <b>the light came into the world.</b>
            For men were in the darkness of ignorance, and God destroyed this
            darkness by sending a light into the world so that men might know
            the truth: “I am the light of the world. He who follows me does not
            walk in darkness, but will have the light of life” (below 8:12); “To
            enlighten those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death” (Lk
            1:78). Now the light came into the world because men could not come
            to it: for “He dwells in inaccessible light, whom no man has seen or
            is able to see” (1 Tim 6:16).

            many Gentiles have acted with virtue; for example, Cato, and many
            others. I answer, with Chrysostom, that is it one thing to work by
            reason of virtue, and another by reason of a natural aptitude or
            disposition. For some act well because of their natural disposition,
            because their temperament is not inclined in a contrary way. And
            even unbelievers can act well in this way. For example, one may live
            chastely because he is not assailed by concupiscence; and the same
            for the other virtues. But those who act well by reason of virtue do
            not depart from virute, in spite of inclinations to the contrary
            vice, because of the rightness of their reason and the goodness of
            their will; and this is proper to believers.

            494 So he says: The reason why they did not love the light is that
            their works were evil. And this is plain because
            <b>Everyone who practices evil hates the light.</b>
            He does not say, “practiced,” but rather practices: because if
            someone has acted in an evil way, but has repented and is sorry,
            seeing that he has done wrong, such a person does not hate the light
            but comes to the light. But Everyone who practices evil, i.e.,
            persists in evil, is not sorry, nor does he come to the light, but
            he hates it; not because it reveals truth, but because it reveals a
            person’s sins. For an evil person still wants to know the light and
            the truth; but he hates to be unmasked by it. “If the dawn suddenly
            appears, they regard it as the shadow of death” Qb 24:17). And so he
            <b>does not approach the light;</b>
            and this
            <b>for fear that his deeds might be exposed.</b>
            For no one who is unwilling to desert evil wants to be rebuked; this
            is fled from and hated. “They hate the one who rebukes at the city
            gate” (Am 5:10); “A corrupt man does not love the one who rebukes
            him” (Prv 15:12).

            496 But this conflicts with the teaching that no one should make
            public the good he has done; and this was a reason why the Lord
            rebuked the Pharisees. I answer that it is lawful to want one’s
            works to be seen by God so that they may be approved: “It is not the
            one who commends himself who is approved, but the one whom God
            commends” (2 Cor 10:18); “My witness is in heaven,” as is said in
            Job (16:20). It is also lawful to want them to be seen by one’s own
            conscience, so that one may rejoice: “Our glory is this: the
            testimony of our conscience” (2 Cor 1:12). But it is reprehensible
            to want them to be seen by men in order to be praised or for one’s
            own glory. Yet, holy persons desire that their good works be known
            to men for the sake of God’s glory and for the good of the faith:
            “Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good
            works, and glorify your Father in heaven” (Mt 5:16). Such a person
            <b
              >comes to the light to make clear that his deeds are done in
              God,</b
            >
            that is, according to God’s commandment or through the grace of God.
            For whatever good we do, whether it be avoiding sin, repenting of
            what has been done, or doing good works, it is all from God: “You
            have accomplished all our works” (Is 26:12).

            spiritual regeneration,
            <b>Jesus and his disciples came to Judean territory.</b>
            There is a question here about the literal meaning. For above, the
            Evangelist had said that the Lord had come from Galilee to
            Jerusalem, which is in Judean territory, where he taught Nicodemus.
            So how, after teaching Nicodemus, can he come into Judea, since he
            was already there?

            Ad quod est duplex responsio: nam secundum Bedam, Christus post
            verba Nicodemi, ivit in Galilaeam, et ibi aliquandiu moratus rediit
            in Iudaeam: et ideo cum dicitur
            <i>post haec venit Iesus</i>, non est intelligendum quod immediate
            venerit in Iudaeam post verba Nicodemi. Alio modo, secundum
            Chrysostomum, intelligendum est quod post haec immediate venerit in
            terram Iudaeam. Christus enim volebat praedicare ubi multitudo
            conveniebat, ut multi converterentur; Ps. XXXIX, 10:
            <i>annuntiavi iustitiam tuam in Ecclesia magna</i>. Et infra c.
            XVIII, 20: <i>ego palam locutus sum</i> et cetera. Duo autem loca
            erant in Iudaea, ad quae confluebat multitudo Iudaeorum, scilicet
            Ierusalem, ad quam ibant ad festa, et Iordanis, ad quem concurrebant
            propter praedicationem et Baptismum Ioannis. Et ideo dominus ista
            duo loca frequentans, statim completis diebus festis in Ierusalem,
            quae est in una parte Iudaeae, venit in aliam partem Iudaeae, ubi
            Ioannes baptizabat, scilicet in Iordanem.

            Two answers are given to this. According to Bede, after his
            discussion with Nicodemus, Christ went to Galilee, and after
            remaining there for a time, returned to Judea. And so
            <b>After this Jesus and his disciples came to Judean territory,</b>
            should not be understood to mean that he came into Judea immediately
            after his talk with Nicodemus. Another explanation, given by
            Chrysostom, is that he did come into the territory of Judea
            immediately after this discussion: for Christ wanted to preach where
            the people gathered, so that many might be converted: “I have
            declared your justice in the great assembly” (Ps 3 9:10); “1 have
            spoken openly to the world” (below 18:20). Now there were two places
            in Judea where the Jewish people gathered: Jerusalem, where they
            went for their feasts, and the Jordan, where they gathered on
            account of John’s preaching and his baptism. And so the Lord used to
            visit both places; and after the feast days were over in Jerusalem,
            which is in one part of Judea, he went to another part, to the
            Jordan, where John was baptizing.

            499 As for the moral sense, Judea means “confession,” to which Jesus
            came, for Christ visits those who confess their sins or speak in
            praise of God: “Judea became his sanctuary” (Ps 113:2). He stayed
            there, because he did not make a merely temporary visit: “We will
            come to him, and make our abode with him,” as it says below (14:23).
            <b>And was baptizing,</b> i.e., cleansing from sin; because unless
            one confesses his sins he does not obtain forgiveness: “He who hides
            his sins will not prosper” (Prv 28:13).

            Persona baptizans est Ioannes; et ideo dicit
            <i>erat autem Ioannes baptizans</i>. Sed hic est quaestio: quia cum

            veniente Baptismate Christi, Ioannes cessare debuerit a baptizando,
            sicut veniente veritate, cessat figura. Ad hoc est triplex
            responsio. Una, quantum ad personam Christi: nam Ioannes baptizavit
            ut Christus baptizaretur ab eo. Nec oportebat quod solus Christus ab
            eo baptizaretur, ne Baptismus Ioannis ex huius singularitate, melior
            Christi Baptismate videretur: et ideo expediens fuit ut alii ante
            Christum baptizarentur a Ioanne, quia antequam Christi doctrina
            publicata est, necessarium erat homines praeparari ad Christum
            Baptismo Ioannis. Unde secundum hoc, ita se habet Baptismus Ioannis

            instruuntur de fide et praeparantur ad Baptismum, se habet ad verum
            Baptisma. Necessarium etiam fuit ut postquam Christus baptizatus
            fuerat a Ioanne, alii baptizarentur ab eo, ne Ioannis Baptisma
            reprobandum videretur; sicut etiam non statim veniente veritate
            cessavit usus legalium, sed, secundum Augustinum, licuit Iudaeis
            determinato tempore legalia servare.

          <td>
            501 John is the person who is baptizing, so he says,
            <b>John also was baptizing.</b> There is a question about this:
            Since John’s baptism was ordained to the baptism of Christ, it seems
            that John should have stopped baptizing when Christ started to
            baptize, just as the symbol does not continue when the truth comes.
            Three reasons are given for this. The first is in relation to
            Christ, for John baptized in order that Christ might be baptized by
            him. But it was not fitting that John baptize just Christ;
            otherwise, on this point alone, it might seem that John’s baptism
            was superior to Christ’s. Accordingly, it was expedient that John
            baptize others before Christ, because before Christ’s teaching was
            to be made public it was necessary that men be prepared for Christ
            by John’s baptism. In this way, the baptism of John is related to
            the baptism of Christ as the catechesis or religious instruction
            given to prospects to teach and prepare them for baptism is related
            to the true baptism. It was likewise important that John baptize
            others after he had baptized Christ, so that John’s baptism would
            not seem to be worthless. For the same reason, the practice of the
            ceremonies of the old law was not abolished as soon as the truth
            came, but as Augustine says, the Jews could lawfully observe them
            for a time.

            Alio modo quantum ad personam Ioannis: nam si Ioannes statim cum
            Christus baptizare coepit, destitisset a Baptismo, potuisset credi,
            quod hoc fecisset ex invidia, vel ira. Et quia, ut dicitur Rom. XII,
            17:
            <i
              >providere debemus bona non solum coram Deo, sed etiam coram

            >: ideo Ioannes non statim cessavit.
          </td>
          <td>
            The second reason relates to John. For if John had stopped baptizing
            at once after Christ began baptizing, it might have been thought
            that he stopped out of envy or anger. And because, as the Apostle
            says, “We ought to look after what is good, not only before God, but
            also before all men” (Rom 12:17), this is the reason why John did
            not stop at once.

            baptizabant. Unde si statim Ioannes totaliter baptizare cessasset,
            dimisisset discipulos suos in maiori zelo et controversia contra
            Christum et discipulos eius. Iam enim etiam Ioanne baptizante, ipsi
            aegre ferebant Baptismum Christi: quod patet ex sequentibus. Et ideo
            non statim cessavit; I Cor. VIII, 9:
            <i
              >videte ne forte haec licentia vestra offendiculum fiat
              infirmis</i
            >.
          </td>
          <td>
            The third reason relates to John’s disciples, who were already
            beginning to act like zealots toward Christ and his disciples,
            because they were baptizing. So if John had entirely stopped from
            baptizing, it would have provoked his disciples to an even greater
            zeal and opposition to Christ and his disciples. For even while John
            continued baptizing, they were hostile to Christ’s baptism, as later
            events showed. And so John did not stop at once: “Take care that
            your freedom does not become a hindrance to those who are weak,” as
            is said in 1 Corinthians (8:9).

            (4:12) says: “When Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he
            withdrew into Galilee.” And so, because they had passed over the
            things that Christ did before John’s imprisonment, John, who was the
            last to write a Gospel, supplied these omissions. He suggests this
            when he says:

            dispute,

            who were the first to raise the issue,

            miracles. The issue was
            <b>concerning purification,</b>
            i.e., baptizing. The cause of their envy and the reason why they
            started the controversy was the fact that John sent those he
            baptized to Christ, but Christ did not send those he baptized to
            John. It seemed from this, and perhaps the Jews even said so, that
            Christ was greater than John. Thus, the disciples of John, having
            not yet become spiritual, quarreled with the Jews over the baptisms.

            <b>They went to John.</b>
            If we examine this closely, we see that they were trying to incite
            John against Christ. Indeed, they are like the gossip and the
            double-tongued: “Those who gossip and are double-tongued are
            accursed, for they disturb many who are at peace” (Sir 28:15).

            First, they recall the previous unimportant status of Christ.
            Secondly, the good John did for him. Thirdly, the role which Christ
            took on. Fourthly, the loss to John because of Christ’s new role.

            <b>the man who was with you,</b>
            as one of your disciples; and not the one you were with as your
            teacher. For there is no good reason for envy if honor is shown to
            one who is greater; rather, envy is aroused when honor is given to
            an inferior: “I have seen slaves on horses, and princes walking like
            slaves” (Ecc 10:7); “I called my servant, and he did not answer me”
            (Jb 19:16). For a master is more disturbed at the rebellion of a
            servant and a subject than of anyone else.

            510 Secondly, they remind John of the good he did Christ. Thus they
            do not say, “the one whom you baptized,” because they would then be
            admitting the greatness of Christ which was shown during his baptism
            when the Holy Spirit came upon him in the form of a dove and in the
            voice of the Father speaking to him. So they say,
            <b>the one of whom you have given testimony,</b>
            i.e., we are very angry that the one you made famous and admired
            dares to repay you in this way: “The one who ate my bread has lifted
            his heel against me” (Ps 40:10). They said this because those who
            seek their own glory and personal profit from their office become
            dejected if their office is taken over by someone else

            511 And so thirdly, they even add that Christ took over John’s
            office for himself, when they say,
            <b>he is here baptizing,</b>
            i.e., he is exercising your office; and this also distrubed them
            very much. For we generally see that men of the same craft are
            envious and underhanded with respect to one another; a potter envies
            another potter, but does not envy a carpenter. So, even teachers,
            who are seeking their own honor, become sad if another teaches the
            truth. In opposition to them, Gregory says: “The mind of a holy
            pastor wishes that others teach the truth which he cannot teach all
            by himself.” So also Moses: “Would that all the people might
            prophesy,” as we read in Numbers (11:29).

            dicebant, infra XII, 19:
            <i>ecce totus mundus post eum vadit</i>. Sed ex his Ioannes non fuit
            motus contra Christum: non enim erat arundo vento agitata, ut
            dicitur Matt. XI, 7. Et hoc patet ex responsione Ioannis, quae

            512 Yet they were not satisfied with merely disturbing John, rather
            they report something that should really excite him, that is, the
            loss that John seemed to be having because of the office Christ took
            over. They give this when they say:
            <b>and all the people are flocking to him,</b>
            i.e., the ones who used to come to you. In other words, they have
            rejected and disowned you, and now are all going to his baptism. It
            is clear from Matthew (11:7) that they used to go to John: “What did
            you go into the desert to see?” The same envy affected the Pharisees
            against Christ; so they said: “Look, the whole world has gone after
            him” (below 12:19). However, all this did not set John againt
            Christ, for he was not a reed swaying in the wind, and this is clear
            from John’s answer to their question.

            reputation among the people, and so they said,

            Christ’s increasing reputation (v 30). As to the first he does two

            Ioanni quaestionem proponant, et ex hoc sint reprehensione digni,
            Ioannes tamen non eos vehementer increpat; et hoc propter
            imperfectionem: timebat enim ne commoti ex reprehensione, recederent
            ab eo, et iungentes se Pharisaeis, Christo publice insidiarentur;
            implens in hoc quod de domino dicitur, Is. XLII, 3:
            <i>calamum quassatum non confringet</i> et cetera. Similiter
            advertendum, quod a principio suae responsionis non ardua et

            invidiam. Cum enim excellentia sit alterius invidiae provocativa, si

            514 As to the first, note that although John’s disciples broach
            their question maliciously, and so deserve to be rebuked, John
            nevertheless does not sharply reprove them; and this because of
            their imperfection. For he feared that they might be provoked by a
            rebuke, leave him, and, joining forces with the Pharisees, publicly
            harass Christ. In acting this way he was putting into practice what
            is said of the Lord: “The burised reed he will not break” (Is 42:3).
            Again, we should also note that he begins his answer not by telling
            them what is great and wonderful about Christ, but what is common
            and obvious; and he did this on account oftheir envy. For since the
            excellence of a person provokes others to envy, if John had stressed
            Christ’s excellence at once, he would have fed the fire of their
            envy.

            516 Then follows the difference of their offices, when he says, You
            yourselves are witnesses. As if to say: From the testimony which I
            bore to him, you can know the office committed to me by Christ: for
            You yourselves are witnesses, i.e., you can testify,
            <b>to the fact that I said: I am not the Christ</b>
            —“He declared openly and did not deny” (above 1:20)—
            <b>but the one sent before him,</b> as a herald before a judge. And
            so from my own testimony you can know my office, which is to go
            before Christ and prepare the way for him: “There was a man sent by
            God, whose name was John” (above 1:6). But the office of Christ is
            to judge and to preside. If we look at this closely we can see that
            John, like a skilful disputant, answers them with their own
            arguments: “I judge you out of your own mouth,” as said in Luke
            (19:22).

            518 As to the first, [he does two things: First he makes a
            comparison regarding what pertains to Christ, secondly regarding
            himself. As to the first,] we should note that on the human level it
            is the groom who regulates, governs and has the bride. Hence he
            says,
            <b>It is the groom who has the bride.</b>
            Now the groom is Christ: “Like a bridegroom coming out of his bridal
            chamber” (Ps 18:6). His bride is the Church, which is joined to him
            by faith: “I will espouse you to myself in faith” Mos 2:20). In
            keeping with this figure, Zipporah said to Moses: “You are a spouse
            of blood to me” (Ex 4:25). We read of the marriage: “The marriage of
            the Lamb has come” (Rv 19:7). So, because Christ is the groom, he
            has the bride, that is, the Church; but my part is only to rejoice
            in the fact that he has the bride.

              >The groom’s friend waits there and listens to him, rejoicing at
              hearing his voice.</b
            >
            Although John had said earlier that he was not worthy to unfasten
            the strap of Jesus’ sandal, he here calls himself the friend of
            Jesus in order to bring out the faithfulness of his love for Christ.
            For a servant does not act in the spirit of love in regard to the
            things that pertain to his master, but in a spirit of servitude;
            while a friend, on the other hand, seeks his friend’s interests out
            of love and faithfulness. Hence a faithful servant is like a friend
            to his master: “If you have a faithful servant, treat him like
            yourself” (Sir 33:31). Indeed, it is proof of a servant’s
            faithfulness when he rejoices in the prosperity of his master, and
            when he obtains various goods, not for himself, but for his master.
            And so because John did not keep the bride entrusted to his care for
            himself, but for the groom, we can see that he was a faithful
            servant and a friend of the groom. It is to suggest this that he
            calls himself
            <b>the groom’s friend.</b>

            Those who are friends of the truth should act in the same way, not
            turning the bride entrusted to their care to their own advantage and
            glory, but treating her honorably for the honor and glory of the
            groom; otherwise they would not be friends of the groom but
            adulterers. This is why Gregory says that a servant who is sent by
            the groom with gifts for the bride is guilty of adulterous thoughts
            if he himself desires to please the bride. This is not what the
            Apostle did: “I espoused you to one husband in order to present you
            to Christ as a chaste virgin” (2 Cor 11:2). And John did the same,
            because he did not keep the bride, i.e., the faithful, for himself,
            but brought them to the groom, that is, to Christ.

            524 In the moral sense, this should take place in each one of us.
            Christ must increase in you, i.e., you should grow in the knowledge
            and love of Christ, because the more you are able to grasp him by
            knowledge and love, the more Christ increases in you; just as the
            more one improves in seeing one and the same light, the more that
            light seems to increase. Consequently, as men advance in this way,
            their self-esteem decreases; because the more one knows of the
            divine greatness, the less he thinks of his human smallness. As we
            read in Proverbs (30:1): “The revelation spoken by the man close to
            God”; and then there follows: “I am the most foolish of men, and the
            wisdom of men is not in me.” “I have heard you, but now I see you,
            and so I reprove myself, and do penance in dust and ashes,” as we
            read in Job (42:5).

            526 Regarding the first, we should note that in order for a thing to
            be perfect, it must reach the goal fixed for it by its origin; for
            example, if one is born from a king, he should continue to progress
            until he becomes a king. Now Christ has an origin that is most
            excellent and eternal; therefore he must increase by the
            manifestation of his power, in relation to others, until it is
            recognized that he is above all things. Thus he says,
            <b>The One who came from above,</b>
            that is, Christ, according to his divinity. “No one has gone up to
            heaven except the One who came down from heaven” (above 3:13); “You
            are from below, I am from above” (below 8:23).

            nature, by assuming it according to what was predominant in it in

            First, is the state of human nature before sin; and from this state
            he took his purity by assuming a flesh unmarked by the stain of
            original sin: “A lamb without blemish” (Ex 12:5). The second state
            is after sin; and from this he took his capability to suffer and die
            by assuming the likeness of sinful flesh as regards its punishment,
            but not in its guilt: “God sent his own Son in the likeness of
            sinful flesh” (Rom 8:3). The third state is that of resurrection and
            glory; and from this he took his impossibility of sinning and his
            joy of soul.

            531 As to the first we should note that a man is known mainly by
            what he says: “Your accent gives you away” (Mt 26:73); “Out of the
            abundance of the heart the mouth speaks” (Mt 12:34). This is why the

            a created power: “They dwell in houses of clay, and have a
            foundation of earth” (Jb 4:19). Secondly, we should consider the

            earthly. Thirdly, the quality of his teaching is described: he

            Or we could say according to Augustine, and this is a better
            explanation, that we can consider what any person has of himself and
            what he has received from another. Now John and every mere human of
            himself is of the earth. Therefore, from this standpoint, he has
            nothing to speak of except earthly things. And it’ he does speak of
            divine things, it is due to a divine enlightenment: “Your heart has
            visions, but unless they come from the Almighty, ignore them” (Sir
            34:6). So the Apostle says, “It is not 1, but the grace of God which
            is with me” (1 Cor 15:10); “For it is not you who speak, but the
            Holy Spirit who is speaking through you” (Mt 10:20). Accordingly, as
            regards John, he
            <b>is earthly and speaks of earthly things.</b>
            And if there was anything divine in him, it did not come from him,

            says,
            <b>The One who comes from heaven is above all things.</b>
            For although the body of Christ was of the earth as regards the
            matter of which it was made, yet it came from heaven as to its
            efficient cause, inasmuch as his body was formed by divine power. It
            also came from heaven because the eternal and uncreated person of
            the Son came from heaven by assuming a body. “No one has gone up to
            heaven except the One who came down from heaven, the Son of Man, who
            lives in heaven” (above 3:13).

            est Deus, est ipsa veritas; sed inquantum homo, est testis

            certain, because
            <b>he testifies to what he sees and to what he hears.</b>
            For Christ, as God, is truth itself; but as man, he is its witness:
            “For this was I born, and for this I came into the world: to testify
            to the truth” (below 18:37). Therefore, he gives testimony to
            himself: “You testify to yourself” (below 8:13). And he testifies to
            what is certain, because his testimony is about what he has heard
            with the Father: “I speak to the world what I have heard from my
            Father” (below 8:26); “What we have seen and heard” (1 Jn 1:3).

            534 Note that knowledge of a thing is acquired in through sight and
            in one way another way through hearing. For by sight, a knowledge of
            a thing in acquired by means of the very thing seen; but by hearing,
            a thing is not made known by the very voice that is heard, but by
            means of the understanding of the one speaking. And so, because the
            Lord has knowledge which he has received from the Father, he says,
            <b>to what he sees,</b>
            insofar as he proceeds from the essence of the Father;
            <b>and to what he hears, insofar</b>
            as he proceeds as the Word of the Father’s intellect. Now because
            among intellectual beings, their act of being is other than their
            act of understanding, their knowledge through sight is other than
            their knowledge through hearing. But in God the Father, the act of
            being (<i>esse</i>) and the act of understanding
            (<i>intelligere</i>) are the same. Thus in the Son, to see and hear
            are the same thing. Moreover, since even in one who sees there is
            not the essence of the thing seen in itself but only its similitude,
            as also in the hearer there is not the actual thought of the speaker
            but only an indication of it, so the one who sees is not the essence
            of the thing in itself, nor is the listener the very thought
            expressed. In the Son, however, the very essence of the Father is
            received by generation, and he himself is the Word; and so in him to
            see and to hear are the same.

            testimony.” The Evangelist used this way of speaking before when he
            said: “He came unto his own, and his own did not receive him” (above

            Vel aliter. Consuetum est in Scriptura divina populo loqui de
            duobus. Quia quamdiu sumus in hoc mundo, mali sunt permixti bonis;
            et ideo Scriptura aliquando loquitur de populo, referendo
            intentionem suam ad malos, aliquando ad bonos. Et hic modus loquendi
            habetur Ier. XXVI: nam primo dicit: omnis populus et sacerdotes
            quaerebant occidere Ieremiam: referens intentionem suam ad malos: et
            postea statim dicit, quod omnis populus quaerebat eum liberare,

            This can be explained in another way by realizing that Scripture
            refers to people in two ways. As long as we are in this world the
            wicked are mingled with the good; and so Scripture sometimes speaks
            of “the people,” or “they,” meaning those who are good; while at
            other times, the same words can refer to the wicked. We can see this
            in Jeremiah (26): for first it says that all the people and the
            priests sought to kill Jeremiah, and this referred to those who were
            evil; then at once it says that all the people sought to free him,
            and this referred to those who were good. In the same way, John the
            Baptist says, looking to the left, i.e., toward those who are evil,
            <b>And his testimony no one accepts;</b> and later, referring to
            those on the right, i.e., to the good, he says,
            <b>But whoever accepts his testimony.</b>

            You might say that although God sent Christ, yet not all that Christ
            says is from God, but only some of the things; for even the prophets
            spoke at times from their own spirit, and at other times from the
            Spirit of God. For example, we read that the prophet Nathan (2 Sm
            7:3), speaking out of his own spirit, advised David to build a
            temple, but that later, under the influence of the Spirit of God, he
            retracted this. However, the Baptist shows that such is not the case
            with Christ. For the prophets receive the Spirit of God only
            fractionally, i.e., in reference to some things, but not as to all
            things. Consequently, not all they say are the words of God. But
            Christ, who received the Spirit fully and in regards to all things,
            speaks the words of God as to all things.

            543 We should note that we can understand in two ways what is said

            given to someone in order that he may have it: and it is appropriate
            to Christ to have the Spirit, both as God and as man. And so he has
            the Holy Spirit with respect to both. As man, Christ has the Holy
            Spirit as Sanctifier: “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because
            the Lord has anointed me” (Is 6 1:1), namely, as man. But as God, he
            has the Holy Spirit only as manifesting himself, inasmuch as the
            Spirit proceeds from him: “He will give glory to me,” that is, make
            known, “because he will have received from me,” as is said below

            Therefore, both as God and as man, Christ has the Holy Spirit beyond
            measure. For God the Father is said to give the Holy Spirit without
            measure to Christ as God, because he gives to Christ the power and
            might to bring forth (<i>spirandi</i>) the Holy Spirit, who, since
            he is infinite, was infinitely given to him by the Father: for the
            Father gives it just as he himself has it, so that the Holy Spirit
            proceeds from him as much as from the Son. And he gave him this by
            an everlasting generation. Similarly, Christ as man has the Holy
            Spirit without measure, for the Holy Spirit is given to different
            men in differing degrees, because grace is given to each “by
            measure” [cf., e.g., Mk 4:24; Mt 7:2]. But Christ as man did not
            receive a certain amount of grace; and so he did not receive the
            Holy Spirit in any limited degree.

            without any preceding merits. Now the divine nature is infinite;

            First, becatise of the one who is receiving the grace. For it is
            plain that each thing’s nature has a finite capacity, because even
            though one might receive an infinite good by knowing, loving and
            enjoying it, nevertheless one receives it by enjoying it in a finite
            way. Further, each creature has, according to its species and
            nature, a finite amount of capacity. But this does not make it
            impossible for the divine power to make another creature possessing
            a greater capacity; but then such a creature would not be of a
            nature which is specifically the same, just as when one is added to
            three, there is another species of number. Therefore, when some
            nature is not given as much of the divine goodness as its natural
            capacity is able to contain, then it is seen to be given to it by
            measure; but when its total natural capacity is filled, it is not
            given to it by measure, because even though there is a measure on
            the part of the one receiving, there is none on the part of the one
            giving, who is prepared to give all. Thus, if someone takes a pail
            to a river, he sees water present without measure, although he takes
            the water by measure on account of the limited dimensions of the
            pail. Thus, the habitual grace of Christ is indeed finite according
            to its essence, but it is said to be given in an infinite way and
            not by measure or partially, because as much was given to him as
            created nature was able to hold.

            Secundo vero ex parte doni recepti. Nam omnis forma, seu actus

            Secondly, Christ did not receive habitual grace in a limited way by
            considering the gift which is received. For every form or act,
            considered in its very nature, is not finite in the way in which it
            is made finite by the subject in which it is received. Nevertheless,
            there is nothing to prevent it from being finite in its essence,
            insofar as its existence (<i>esse</i>) is received in some subject.
            For that is infinite according to its essence which has the entire
            fulness of being (<i>essendi</i>): and this is true of God alone,
            who is the supreme
            <i>esse.</i>
            But if we consider some “spiritual” form as not existing in a
            subject, for example, whiteness or color, it would not be infinite
            in essence, because its essence would be confined to some genus or
            species; nevertheless it would still possess the entire fulness of
            that species. Thus, considering the nature of the species, it would
            be without limit or measure, since it would have everything that can
            pertain to that species. But if whiteness or color should be
            received into some subject, it does not always have everything that
            pertains necessarily and always to the nature of this form, but only
            when the subject has it as perfectly as it is capable of being
            possessed, i.e., when the way the subject possesses it is equivalent
            to the power of the thing possessed. Thus, Christ’s habitual grace
            was finite according to its essence; yet it is said to have been in
            him without a limit or measure because he received everything that
            could pertain to the nature of grace. Others, however, do not
            receive all this, but one receives in one way, and another in
            another way: “There are different graces”

            not received in a limited way is based on its cause. For an effect
            is in some way present in its cause. Therefore, if someone has an
            infinite power to produce something, he is said to have what can be
            produced without measure and, in a way, infinitely. For example, if
            someone has a fountain which could produce an infinite amount of
            water, he would be said to have water in an infinite way and without
            measure. Thus, the soul of Christ has infinite grace and grace
            without measure from the fact that he has united to himself the
            Word, which is the infinite and unfailing source of the entire
            emanation of all created things.

            pater omnia filio dat, quia diligit eum, propter duo. Primo,
            diligere est actus voluntatis; dare autem naturam filio, est
            generare ipsum. Si ergo pater daret voluntate naturam filio,
            voluntas patris esset principium generationis filii; et sic
            sequeretur quod pater generaret filium voluntate, et non natura:
            quod est haeresis Ariana.

            545 Christ also had the ability appropriate for declaring divine
            truth, because all things are in his power; hence he says,
            <b
              >The Father loves the Son, and has put everything into his
              hands.</b
            >
            This can refer to Christ both as man and as God, but in different
            ways. If it refers to Christ according to his divine nature, then
            <b>loves</b>
            does not indicate a principle but a sign: for we cannot say that the
            Father gives all things to the Son because he loves him. There are
            two reasons for this. First, because to love is an act of the will;
            but to give a nature to the Son is to generate him. Therefore, if
            the Father gave a nature to the Son by his will, the will of the
            Father would be the principle of the generation of the Son; and then
            it would follow that the Father generated the Son by will, and not
            by nature; and this is the Arian heresy.

            Secondly, because the love of the Father for the Son is the Holy
            Spirit. So, if the love of the Father for the Son were the reason
            why the Father put everything into his hands, it would follow that
            the Holy Spirit would be the principle of the generation of the Son;
            and this is not acceptable. Therefore, we should say that
            <b>loves</b>
            implies only a sign. As if to say: The perfect love with which
            <b>the Father loves the Son,</b>
            is a sign that the Father
            <b>has put everything into his hands,</b>
            i.e., everything which the Father has: “All things have been given
            to me by my Father (Mt 11:27); “Jesus, knowing that the Father had
            given all things into his hands” (below 13:3).

            But if loves refers to Christ as man, then it implies the notion of
            a principle, so that the Father is said to have put everything into
            the hands of the Son, everything, that is, that is in heaven and on
            earth: “All authority has been given to me, in heaven and on earth,”
            as he says in Matthew (28:18); “He has appointed him [the Son] the
            heir of all things” (Heb 1:2). And the reason why the Father gives
            to the Son is because he loves the Son; hence he says,
            <b>The Father loves the Son,</b>
            for the Father’s love is the reason for creating each creature: “You
            love everything which exists, and hate nothing which you have made”
            (Wis 11:25). Concerning his love for the Son we read in Matthew
            (3:17): “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased”; “He has
            brought us into the kingdom of the Son of his love,” that is, i.e.,
            of his beloved Son (Col 1:13).

            547 The reward for faith is beyond our comprehension, because it is
            eternal life. Hence he says,
            <b>Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life.</b>
            And this is shown from what has already been said. For if the Father
            has given everything he has to the Son, and the Father has eternal
            life, then he has given to the Son to be eternal life: “Just as the
            Father possesses life in himself, so he has given it to the Son to
            have life in himself” (below 5:26): and this belongs to Christ
            insofar as he is the true and natural Son of God. “That you may be
            in his true Son, Christ. This is the true God and eternal life” (1
            Jn 5:20).
            <b>Whoever believes in the Son</b>
            has that toward which he tends, that is, the Son, in whom he
            believes. But the Son is eternal life; therefore, whoever believes
            in him has eternal life. As it says below (10:27): “My sheep hear my
            voice... and I give them eternal life.”

            <b>whoever is unbelieving in the Son will not see life.</b>
            He does not say, “will not have,” but will not see, because eternal

            “It is a terrible thing to fall into the hands of the living God”
            (Heb 10:31). He says,
            <b>rests on him</b>, because this punishment will never be absent
            from the unbelieving, and because all who are born into this mortal
            life are the objects of God’s anger, which was first felt by Adam:
            “We were by nature,” that is, through birth, “children of anger”
            (Eph 2:3). And we are freed from this anger only by faith in Christ;
            and so the anger of God rests on those who do not believe in Christ,
            the Son of God.
