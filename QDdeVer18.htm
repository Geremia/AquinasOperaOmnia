                            Dicit enim Magister in IV Sentent. dist. 1, quod
                            homo ante peccatum Deum sine medio vidit. Sed videre
                            Deum sine medio, est videre per essentiam. Ergo in
                            statu innocentiae vidit Deum per essentiam.

                            1. The Master says: “Before sin, man saw God
                            independently of any medium.” But to see God
                            independently of any medium is to see God through
                            His essence. Therefore in the state of innocence man
                            saw God through His essence.

                                Sed dicebat, quod Magister intelligit quod vidit
                                Deum sine medio quoad nubilum culpae, non autem
                                sine medio creaturae.- Sed contra est quod
                                Magister ibidem dicit, quod quia nos per medium
                                Deum videmus, oportet quod ex visibilibus
                                creaturis in ipsum deveniamus. Ergo videtur quod
                                intelligat de medio creaturae. Sed videre sine
                                medio creaturae, est videre per essentiam. Ergo
                                et cetera.

                                2. It was said that the Master means that man
                                saw God without a medium as far as obscurity due
                                to sin is concerned, but not that he saw God
                                without using creatures as a medium.—On the
                                contrary, in that same place the Master says
                                that, since we see God through a medium, we must
                                reach Him by means of visible creatures.
                                Therefore, he seems to mean the use of creatures
                                as a medium. But to see without the use of
                                creatures as a medium is to see through the
                                essence. Therefore.

                                    Praeterea, Phil. IV, 7 dicitur: pax Dei quae
                                    exsuperat omnem sensum, hoc - secundum quod
                                    intelligitur de pace quam Deus facit in
                                    beatis in patria - Glosa ibid. sic exponit:
                                    omnem sensum, idest intellectum nostrum, non
                                    eorum qui semper vident faciem patris. Ex
                                    quo haberi potest quod pax sive gaudium
                                    beatorum excedit intellectum omnis illius
                                    qui gaudio illo non perfruitur. Sed Adam in
                                    statu innocentiae gaudia beatorum vidit:
                                    unde dicit Gregorius, IV dialogorum: homo
                                    peccando extra semet ipsum fusus iam illa
                                    caelestis patriae gaudia quae prius
                                    contemplari solebat, videre non poterat.
                                    Ergo Adam in illo statu gaudio caelestis
                                    patriae fruebatur.

                                    3. In Philippians (4:7) it is said: “And the
                                    peace of God, which surpasses all
                                    understanding.” But this means the peace
                                    which God gives the blessed in heaven. The
                                    Gloss explains it in this way: “All
                                    understanding, that is, our understanding,
                                    not the understanding of those who always
                                    see the face of the Father.” From this we
                                    see that the peace or joy of the blessed
                                    surpasses the understanding of all those who
                                    do not possess that joy. But Adam in his
                                    innocence saw the joys of the blessed.
                                    Hence, Gregory says: “Man, losing himself by
                                    sin, could not then see those joys of heaven
                                    which he was accustomed to contemplate
                                    before.” Therefore, in that state Adam
                                    possessed the joy of heaven.

                                        suum cognoscebat ea cognitione qua tunc

                                        per praesentiam contemplationis, est

                                        Ergo Deum per essentiam in statu illo

                                        4. Hugh of St. Victor says: “In that
                                        state man knew his Creator with the
                                        knowledge with which He was then more
                                        clearly seen as present in
                                        contemplation. But to see God as present
                                        in contemplation would seem to be to see
                                        Him through His essence. Therefore, in
                                        the state of innocence Adam saw God
                                        through His essence.

                                            fecit rationalem creaturam, ut

                                            habetur 1 dist. II Sent. Si igitur

                                            Non autem impediebat medium culpae,
                                            quia tunc ab ea immunis erat; nec

                                            creatura. Ergo Adam in statu
                                            innocentiae vidit Deum per
                                            essentiam.

                                            5. Man was made to see God. For God
                                            made rational creatures to
                                            participate in His beatitude. This
                                            consists in seeing Him, as is shown
                                            in the <i>Sentences.</i> Therefore,
                                            if Adam in the state of innocence
                                            did not see God through His essence,
                                            this was only because some medium
                                            prevented him from doing so.
                                            However, the medium due to sin did
                                            not prevent him, for he was then
                                            free from sin. Nor did the use of
                                            creatures as a medium prevent him,
                                            for God is closer to the rational
                                            soul than any creature is.
                                            Therefore, in the state of innocence
                                            Adam saw God through His essence.

                                                everyone has within him the
                                                desire of his perfection.
                                                Therefore, in his original state
                                                Adam desired to see God through
                                                His essence. But whoever is

                                                desires suffers. Therefore, if
                                                Adam did not then see God
                                                through His essence, he
                                                suffered. However, this is
                                                false, because suffering, since
                                                it is a punishment, cannot
                                                precede sin. Therefore, he saw
                                                God through His essence.

                                                        the formation of
                                                        actually intelligible
                                                        species through
                                                        abstraction from matter
                                                        and the conditions of
                                                        matter, which is the
                                                        work of the agent
                                                        intellect, and reception
                                                        in our understanding,
                                                        which is the work of the
                                                        possible intellect. But
                                                        the divine essence is of
                                                        itself intelligible,
                                                        inasmuch as it is
                                                        completely separated
                                                        from matter. It was also
                                                        at the very center of
                                                        man’s soul, since God is
                                                        said to be in all things
                                                        through His essence.
                                                        Therefore, since in the
                                                        state of innocence there
                                                        would be no obstacle in
                                                        the soul of man, it
                                                        seems that he saw God
                                                        through His essence.

                          sit, homini in statu innocentiae non competebat. Ergo
                          Adam in statu innocentiae non vidit Deum per

                          1. To know God through creatures is to know a cause
                          through an effect. But this is knowledge which
                          involves comparison and investigation, and, since this
                          is feeble and imperfect, it did not befit man in the
                          state of innocence. Therefore, in the state of
                          innocence Adam did not see God through creatures.

                              Praeterea, remota causa, removetur effectus. Sed
                              Isidorus assignat hanc causam quare homo Deum per
                              creaturas vidit, quia a creatore aversus ad
                              creaturas se convertit; quod tunc in statu
                              innocentiae nondum erat. Ergo tunc Deum per
                              creaturas homo non videbat.

                              2. When the cause is removed the effect is
                              removed. But Isidore says that the cause why man
                              sees God through creatures is that he turned from
                              the Creator and toward creatures. This was not yet
                              so at that time in the state of innocence.
                              Therefore, at that time man did not see God
                              through creatures.

                                  Praeterea, secundum Hugonem de sancto Victore
                                  homo in statu illo Deum cognoscebat per
                                  praesentiam contemplationis. Sed in
                                  contemplatione videtur sine medio creaturae.
                                  Ergo Deum non videbat per creaturas.

                                  3. According to Hugh of St. Victor, man in
                                  that state knew God, contemplating Him as
                                  present.” But He is seen in contemplation
                                  without the medium of creatures. Therefore, he
                                  did not see God through creatures.

                                      Praeterea, Isidorus dicit, quod Angelus,
                                      ante omnem creaturam factus, Deum per
                                      creaturam non cognovit. Sed homo in statu
                                      innocentiae sicut alter Angelus Deum
                                      vidit, secundum Damascenum. Ergo nec ipse
                                      Deum ex creaturis cognovit.

                                      4. Isidore says that the angels, created
                                      before the rest of creation, did not know
                                      God through creatures. But, according to
                                      Damascene, man in the state of innocence
                                      saw God as another angel. Therefore, he
                                      did not know God from creatures.

                                          creatori comparata, est tenebra. Ergo
                                          creator per creaturam cognosci non
                                          potest.

                                          5. Darkness is not the reason for
                                          knowing light. But, compared to the
                                          Creator, every creature is darkness.
                                          Therefore, the Creator cannot be known
                                          through creatures.

                                              6. Augustine says: “I say that
                                              perhaps He spoke with them [our
                                              first parents] in this way,
                                              although not with the same degree
                                              of participation in the divine
                                              wisdom as the angels possess, yet,
                                              with whatever greater limitations
                                              imposed by human nature, within
                                              the same general category of
                                              vision and conversation. “ From
                                              this it seems that we can conclude
                                              that man in the state of innocence
                                              knew God with the same mode of
                                              knowledge with which the angels
                                              know him. But angels do not know
                                              God through creatures, as is clear
                                              in Augustine and Dionysius.
                                              Therefore, man in the state of
                                              innocence did not see God through
                                              creatures.

                          cetera. Sed Adam in statu innocentiae habuit visionem
                          non aenigmaticam, sed apertam. Ergo fidem non habuit.

                          1. The knowledge of faith is obscure knowledge, as is
                          clear in the first Epistle to the Corinthians (13:12):
                          “We see now in a glass...” But in the state of
                          innocence Adam had plain, not obscure, knowledge.
                          Therefore, he did not have faith.

                              seek their absent Creator by faith.” We conclude
                              as before.

                                  sunt, per experimentum cognoscere non possunt.
                                  Adam autem, ut ibidem dicitur, per
                                  experimentum cognovit ea quae nos credimus.
                                  Ergo fidem non habuit.

                                  must be believed. But, as is said in the same
                                  place, Adam knew by experience what we
                                  believe. Therefore, he did not have faith.

                                      also the Redeemer. But in the state of
                                      innocence Adam seems to have known nothing
                                      about the Redeemer, because he did not
                                      foresee his fall, without which there
                                      would have been no redemption. Therefore,
                                      Adam did not have faith.

                                                          some things about God
                                                          are known to some
                                                          philosophers, as that
                                                          He is intelligible,
                                                          incorporeal, and so
                                                          on. Adam, however,
                                                          knew not only what can
                                                          be known about God by
                                                          natural reason, but
                                                          even more. However, he
                                                          did not attain to
                                                          vision of God through
                                                          His essence.
                                                          Consequently, it is
                                                          clear that he had
                                                          knowledge of God
                                                          through faith.

                          in creaturis futura erant. Ergo non omnium creaturarum

                          proper only to God, according to Isaiah (41:23): “Show
                          the things that are to come hereafter, and we shall
                          know that ye are gods.” But among creatures there were
                          many things which were in the future. Therefore, he
                          did not have knowledge of all creatures.

                              Praeterea, sicut dicit Avicenna in Lib. VI de

                              humanae necessarii, ut per eos scientiam perfectam
                              rerum capiat. Si igitur anima Adae scientiam
                              omnium rerum habuit ex sua conditione, frustra
                              sensus ei collati fuissent: quod esse non potest,
                              cum in operibus Dei nihil sit frustra. Ergo
                              scientiam omnium non habuit.

                              the human soul so that through them it may get
                              perfect knowledge of things. Therefore, if the
                              soul of Adam had knowledge of all things from the
                              beginning, his senses would have been given to him
                              to no purpose. But this cannot be, since nothing
                              is to no purpose in the works of God. Therefore,
                              he did not have knowledge of all things.

                                  Praeterea, sicut dicit Boetius in libro V de
                                  Consol.: hinc membrorum condita nube, non in
                                  totum est oblita sui, summamque tenet, singula
                                  perdens. Ubi ostenditur quod anima in
                                  principio suae conditionis habet confusam
                                  cognitionem, qua sciuntur res in universali;
                                  non autem distinctam, qua sciuntur singula in
                                  propriis naturis. Si igitur Adam talem
                                  cognitionem habuit qualem animam humanam in
                                  sui conditione decet habere, videtur quod non
                                  habuerit creaturarum cognitionem distincte,
                                  sed solum sub confusione quadam.

                                  3. As Boethius says: “Though the mind is born
                                  enfolded in the cloud of bodily members, it
                                  has not completely forgotten itself, and,
                                  while losing the particulars, it retains the
                                  sum.” Here it is shown that the soul, when
                                  first created, had confused knowledge, by
                                  which it knew things in general, but did not
                                  have distinct knowledge, by which it knew
                                  individual things in their proper natures.
                                  Therefore, if Adam had the kind of knowledge
                                  which it is fitting for the human soul to have
                                  when it is created, it seems that he did not
                                  have knowledge of creatures distinctly, but
                                  only in a confused way.

                                      de creaturis propriam cognitionem.

                                      4. Proper knowledge of a thing is had only
                                      through the existence of its proper
                                      species in the soul. But, as appears from
                                      the Philosopher, when the human soul is
                                      created, it is “like a tablet on which
                                      nothing is written.” Therefore, when Adam
                                      was first created, he could not have
                                      proper knowledge of created things.

                                          he had it by divine gift.—On the
                                          contrary, when first created, all men
                                          are equal with respect to merit, and
                                          specifically similar to each other.
                                          Therefore, if perfect knowledge of
                                          things was conferred on Adam by God
                                          when he was first created, it seems
                                          that with equal reason this is
                                          conferred on all other men when they
                                          are created. But we see that this is
                                          false.

                                              6. Nothing which is moved toward
                                              the perfection of knowledge is at
                                              the term of its perfection. But
                                              Adam was moved toward the
                                              perfection of knowledge.
                                              Therefore, he was not at the term
                                              of knowledge, as one who had
                                              perfect knowledge of creatures. I
                                              prove the minor: According to the
                                              Philosopher, before the intellect
                                              understands, it is not anything of
                                              the things which exist. But, after
                                              it understands, it is actually
                                              something of those things. Thus,
                                              at some time it is actually
                                              something of things that exist,
                                              and sometimes it is not. But
                                              everything which has this kind of
                                              existence is on the way to perfect
                                              act. Therefore, when first
                                              created, the human understanding
                                              is on the way to perfect
                                              knowledge. Hence, when Adam’s
                                              understanding was first created,
                                              it was not at the term of perfect
                                              knowledge, but on the way to
                                              perfection.

                                                          perfected at one time
                                                          except by one act of
                                                          one kind. Thus, in
                                                          first matter there can
                                                          be only one
                                                          substantial form, and

                                                          color. But the human
                                                          understanding is a
                                                          power which is
                                                          perfected by the
                                                          habits of the
                                                          sciences. Therefore,
                                                          it is impossible for
                                                          many habits to be in

                                                          Adam’s soul could not

                            Dicit enim Gregorius, IV dialogorum: in Paradiso
                            quippe homo assueverat verbis Dei perfrui, beatorum
                            Angelorum spiritibus cordis munditia et celsitudine

                            1. Gregory says: “In paradise man was accustomed to
                            enjoy the words of God and to share in purity of
                            heart and loftiness of vision with the spirits of
                            the beatified angels.” Therefore, through the
                            loftiness of his vision he seems to have attained
                            even to the vision of the angels.

                                2. On the words of Genesis (2:2 1), “Then the
                                Lord God cast a deep sleep upon Adam,” the Gloss
                                reads: “The correct interpretation of this
                                ecstasy is that it was given so that Adam’s
                                mind, sharing the company of the heavenly court,
                                might enter into the sanctuary of God and
                                understand the last things.”But he could not
                                share the company of the heavenly court unless
                                he knew the angels. Therefore, he had knowledge
                                of the angels.

                                    But, along with other creatures, even the
                                    angels are made in some way for man’s sake,
                                    as the Master says. Therefore, he had
                                    knowledge of the angels.

                                        4. It is more difficult to make
                                        something which is intelligible in
                                        potency become intelligible actually and
                                        to understand it than to understand that
                                        which is of itself actually
                                        intelligible. But Adam’s understanding
                                        could make species of material things,
                                        which of themselves are intelligible in
                                        potency, become actually intelligible,
                                        and in this way understand material
                                        things. Therefore, with much more reason
                                        he was able to understand the essences
                                        of the angels, which of themselves are
                                        actually intelligible, since they are
                                        free of matter.

                                                quiddity. But such a quiddity is
                                                the quiddity of a separate
                                                substance, that is to say, of an
                                                angel. Therefore, Adam’s
                                                intellect could know the essence
                                                of an angel.

                                                    takes place in sense. But
                                                    Adam’s understanding in the
                                                    state of innocence was whole

                                                    Consequently, he was able to

                          1. As Ambrose says, error is the source of every sin.
                          But Adam could sin. Therefore, he could be mistaken.

                              not. But in every such evaluation there is
                              deception of some sort. Therefore, before he
                              sinned, Adam in the state of innocence was
                              deceived.

                                  Praeterea, Magister dicit, II Sent., dist. 21,
                                  quod ideo mulier non horruit serpentem
                                  loquentem, quia cum noverit creatum esse,
                                  etiam officium loquendi a Deo accepisse
                                  putavit. Hoc autem falsum erat. Ergo mulier
                                  falsum opinata est antequam peccaret; ergo
                                  decepta fuit.

                                  3. The Master says: “The woman was not
                                  frightened by the fact that the serpent talked
                                  because, since she knew it, was created, she
                                  considered that it had received even the power
                                  of speech from God.” But this was false.
                                  Therefore, the woman judged falsely before she
                                  sinned. Hence, she was deceived.

                                      Augustine also says: “The devil was
                                      allowed to come in that form in order that
                                      his malice could be easily detected.” But,
                                      if in the state of innocence man could not
                                      have been deceived, the devil could have
                                      been detected in any form in which he
                                      came. Therefore, man could be deceived.

                                          serpent promised, she hoped to be able
                                          to obtain it; otherwise, her desire
                                          would have been stupid. I
                                          <big>foxvever,</big> there was no
                                          stupidity before the fall. But no one

                                          impossible. Therefore, since what the
                                          devil promised was impossible, it
                                          seems that in believing this the woman
                                          was deceived before the fall.

                                                  demons, since it is not united
                                                  to a body, seems to be much

                                                  infirmities, they thought He
                                                  was simply man, but, when they
                                                  saw him working miracles, they
                                                  thought He was God. Therefore,

                          such as he himself was. But Adam had full knowledge of
                          all natural things, as has been said. Therefore, his

                          at birth.

                              original justice on to them, as Anselm says.
                              Therefore, they would likewise have had all
                              knowledge.

                                  ignorance, and malice result from sin. But
                                  there would have been no wickedness, weakness,
                                  or concupiscence in those children immediately
                                  at birth. Therefore, there would not have been
                                  any ignorance either; hence, they would have
                                  had all knowledge.

                                      body. But they would have been born
                                      without any bodily defect. Therefore,

                                          angel.” But, immediately upon their
                                          creation, the angels had knowledge of
                                          all natural things. Therefore, for the
                                          same reason, men in the state of
                                          innocence had it, also.

                          resulted only from some bodily defect. But in that
                          state there was nothing in which the body resisted the
                          soul. Therefore the use of reason could not be
                          restricted.

                              propter defectum organi corporalis.

                              is not restricted in its activity because of a
                              defect of an organ. But the understanding is a
                              power which does not use an organ as is said in
                              <i>The Soul.</i> Therefore, the act of the
                              understanding could not then be impeded because of
                              the defect of a bodily organ.

                                  3. If it be said that the act of understanding
                                  was restricted because of a defect of body in
                                  so far as the understanding received something
                                  from the senses, the answer is that the
                                  understanding is higher than any sense power.
                                  But it seems to be out of order for the higher
                                  to receive from the lower. Therefore, since
                                  there was nothing out of order in man’s nature
                                  in that state, it seems that it would not have
                                  been necessary for the understanding to
                                  receive from the senses.

                                      imperfectionem organorum sensibilium.

                                      acquire knowledge through them. But, once
                                      it has acquired knowledge, it does not
                                      need them, just as a man does not need a
                                      horse once he has finished his journey, as
                                      Avicenna says. But, according to one
                                      opinion, children in the state of
                                      innocence had the fullness of all
                                      knowledge. Therefore, they could not be
                                      kept from using the knowledge they had
                                      because of imperfection in the sense
                                      organs.

                                          sense more than understanding. But
                                          children do not suffer so great a
                                          bodily defect that they cannot see and
                                          hear. Therefore, neither is their
                                          understanding hindered because of
                                          bodily defect, but seemingly because
                                          of the punishment for the first sin.
                                          But this would not have existed before
                                          the fall. Therefore, children at that
                                          time would have had the full use of
                                          understanding as soon as they were
                                          born.
