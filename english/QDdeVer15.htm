    <span style="font-weight: bold">Difficulties</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    It seems that they are, for
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. In <i>Spirit and Soul</i> we read: “When we want to rise from lower to
    higher things, first, senses come to our aid; then, imagination; then,
    reason; then, understanding; then, intelligence; and, in the highest place,
    there is wisdom, which is God Himself.” But imagination and sense are
    different powers. Therefore, reason and understanding are, too.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. As Gregory says, man has something in common with every creature, and for
    this reason is man called all creation. However, that by which man has
    something in common with plants is a power of the soul, the vegetative,
    which is distinct from reason, the proper power of man, as man. The same is
    true for the senses, by which he has something in common with brute animals.
    Therefore, with equai reason, his understanding, which he has in common with
    angels, who are above man, is a power different from reason, which is proper
    to the human race, as Boethius says.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. just as the perceptions of the proper senses terminate at the common
    sense, which makes judgments concerning them, so the discourse of reason
    terminates at understanding, so that judgment may be made about the things
    which reason has compared. For man judges of the things which reason
    compares when by analysis he reaches principles which are the objects of
    understanding. For this reason the art of judging is called analytical.
    Therefore, as common sense is a different power from proper sense, so
    understanding is different from reason.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    4. To comprehend and to judge are acts requiring different powers, as is
    clear in proper and common sense. For common sense judges about the things
    which proper sense perceives. But, as is said in
    <i>Spirit and Soul:</i> “Whatever sense perceives, imagination represents,
    thought forms, genius investigates, reason judges, memory retains, and
    intelligence comprehends.” Therefore, reason and intelligence are different
    powers.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    5. That which is simply composite relates to simple act in the same way as
    that which is altogether simple relates to composite act. But the divine
    intellect, which is simple in every way, has no composite act, but only the
    most simple act. Therefore, our reason, which is composite, inasmuch as it
    compares, does not have a simple act. But the act of understanding is
    simple’ “for it is understanding of things indivisible,” as is said in
    <i>The Soul.</i> Therefore, understanding and reason are not one power.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    6. According to the Commentator and the Philosopher, the rational soul knows
    itself through a likeness. “The mind, however, in which the image resides,
    knows itself through itself,” according to Augustine. Therefore, reason and
    mind, or understanding, are not the same.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    7. Powers are differentiated according to acts, and acts according to
    objects. But the objects of reason and understanding differ very greatly.
    For, as is said in <i>Spirit and Soul</i>: “The soul perceives bodies by
    sense, likenesses of bodies by imagination, natures of bodies by reason,
    created spirit by understanding, and uncreated spirit by intelligence.” But
    bodily nature differs very greatly from created spirit. Therefore,
    understanding and reason are different powers.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    8. Boethius says: “Sense, imagination, reason, and intelligence each look on
    man in a different way. Sense sees figure embodied in given matter, whereas
    imagination judges of figure alone without matter. Reason, in its turn,
    transcends imagination, examining with general consideration the species
    which exists in singular things. Moreover, the eye of intelligence has a
    more lofty existence, for intelligence goes beyond the scope of the universe
    and by sheer force of mind surveys simple form itself.” Therefore, just as
    imagination is a power different from sense, since imagination considers
    form outside of matter, and sense sees it embodied in matter, so
    intelligence, which considers form absolutely, is a power different from
    reason, which studies the general form as it exists in individual things.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    9. Boethius says: “As reasoning is related to understanding, as that which
    is produced, to that which exists, as time to eternity, and as the circle to
    its center point, so the changeable series of fate is related to the stable
    simplicity of providence.”“ But it is plain that there is an essential
    difference between providence and fate, between the circle and its center,
    between time and eternity, and between generation and existence. Therefore,
    reason, too, is essentially different from understanding.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    10. As Boethius says: “Reason belongs to the human race alone, as
    intelligence belongs only to the divine.” But the divine and the human
    cannot both share in the one essence of power. Therefore, they are not one
    power.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    11. The order of powers follows the order of acts. But to receive something
    absolutely, which seems to belong to understanding, is prior to comparison,
    which belongs to reason. Therefore, understanding is prior to reason. But
    nothing is prior to itself. Therefore, understanding and reason are not the
    same power.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    12. It is one thing to consider the entity of a thing absolutely, and
    another to consider it as in this thing. The human soul exercises both of
    these considerations. Therefore, in the human soul there must be two powers,
    one to know the absolute entity, which is understanding, and another to know
    the entity in something else, which seems to be reason. We conclude as
    before.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    13 In <i>Spirit and Soul</i> we read: “Reason is the sight of the mind by
    which it distinguishes good and evil, chooses virtues, and loves God.” These
    things seem to belong to the affections which are a different power from the
    understanding. Therefore, reason, too, is a different power from the
    understanding.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    14. The rational is distinguished from the concupiscible and irascible. But
    the irascible and concupiscible belong to the appetites. Therefore, reason
    does, also. We conclude as before.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    15. The Philosopher says: “The will is in the rational part.” But it is
    distinguished from understanding. We conclude as before.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    l. Augustine seems to say the opposite when he says: “We arrive at the image
    of God, which is man, in that by which he surpasses other animals, that is,
    in reason or intelligence. And whatever else there is of the rational or
    intellectual soul can be said to belong to that thing which is called mind
    or mental life.” From this it seems that he takes reason and intelligence as
    the same thing.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. In Augustine (and in the Gloss on Ephesians [14:23], “And be renewed in
    the spirit of your mind,”) we read: “We should understand that man is made
    in the image of God in that by which he surpasses irrational animals.” But
    this is reason itself, mind, intelligence, or whatever other name fits it
    better. Therefore, it seems that reason and understanding are for Augustine
    different names for the same power.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. Augustine says: “The image of that nature than which no nature is better
    should be sought and found in us in that than which our nature, also, has
    nothing better.”But the image of God is in us in the higher part of reason,
    as is said in <i>The Trinity</i>. Therefore, there is no other power in man
    better than reason. But, if intelligence or understanding were different
    from reason, they would be above reason, as is clear from the citations from
    Boethius and <i>Spirit and Soul</i> mentioned above. Therefore, in man,
    understanding is not a different power from reason.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    4. The more immaterial a power is, the more it can extend to many things.
    But common sense, which is a material power, institutes comparisons of
    proper sensibles by distinguishing them from one another, and also has
    knowledge of them separately. Otherwise, it would not be able to distinguish
    one from another, as is proved in <i>The Soul</i>. Therefore, it is much
    more certain that reason, which is a more immaterial power, can not only
    compare, but also perceive things separately, a function which belongs to
    understanding. Thus, understanding and reason do not seem to be different
    powers.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    5. As is said in <i>Spirit and Soul</i>: “The mind, capable of receiving
    everything, and stamped with the likeness of all things, is said to be the
    soul and to be a nature with a certain power and natural dignity.”1 But that
    which designates the whole soul should not be distinguished from some power
    of the soul. Therefore, the mind, which is a power of the soul, should not
    be distinguished from reason. Similarly, understanding, which seems to be
    the same thing as mind, should not be distinguished from it.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    6. There is a double composition in the activity of the human soul. There is
    one by which it joins and divides predicate and subject, by forming
    propositions. The other is that by which it joins by comparing principles
    with conclusions. In the first composition the same power of the human soul
    apprehends the simple things, that is, predicate and subject, through their
    quiddities, and forms a proposition by joining them. For both of these are
    attributed to the possible intellect, according to <i>The Soul</i>.
    Therefore, with like reason there will be one power which grasps principles,
    a function which belongs to understanding, and which orders principles to
    conclusions, a function which belongs to reason.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    7. In <i>Spirit and Soul</i> we read: “The soul is an intellectual or
    rational spirit.” From this it seems that reason is the same as
    understanding.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    8. Augustine says: “As soon as something arises which is not common to us
    and animals, it belongs to reason.” This same thing also belongs to
    understanding, according to the Philosopher. Therefore, reason and
    understanding are the same.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    9. Difference of objects in their accidental qualities does not indicate
    diversity of faculties. For a colored man and a colored stone are perceived
    by the same sensitive faculty, since it is incidental to the sensible thing
    in so far as it is a sensible thing, to be a man or a stone. But the objects
    which are ascribed to reason and understanding in <i>Spirit and Soul</i>,
    that is, “created spirit” and “corporeal nature,” do not differ, but agree,
    in their essential character as object of knowledge. For, just as a created
    incorporeal spirit is intelligible because it is immaterial, so, too, bodily
    natures are objects of understanding only in so far as they are separated
    from matter. Thus, both of these, in so far as they are known, share in one
    character of cognoscibility, the character of immateriality. Therefore,
    reason and understanding are not different powers.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    10. Every power that compares two things with each other must have knowledge
    of each separately. Hence, the Philosopher proves.that in us there must be
    one power which knows “white and sweet” because we can distinguish between
    them. But, just as one who distinguishes between different things relates
    them to each other, so also, he who compares them relates one to the other.
    Therefore,, it also belongs to the power which compares, namely, reason, to
    know something separately, which is an activity of understanding.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    11. It is more noble to compare than to be compared, just as it is more
    noble to act than to be acted upon. But a thing is understood and compared
    through the same thing. Therefore, the soul, also, understands and compares
    through the same thing. Therefore reason and understanding are the same.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    12. One habit does not exist in different powers. But it is possible for us
    to compare and perceive something separately by the same habit. Thus, faith,
    which perceives a thing separately, in so far as it clings to first truth,
    also compares, to the extent that by a sort of reasoning it sees first truth
    mirrored in creatures. Therefore, it is the same power which compares and
    which perceives something separately.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    For a clear understanding of this question we must investigate the
    difference between reason and understanding. We must bear in mind that,
    according to Augustine, just as among corporeal substances there is an
    orderly disposition, according to which some are said to be higher than
    others and have control over them, so, too, among spiritual substances there
    is a certain orderly disposition.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    The difference between higher and lower bodies seems to lie in this, that
    the lower bodies reach the perfection of their existence through the
    movement of generation, change, and increase. This is obvious in stones,
    plants, and animals. Higher bodies, however, have the perfection of their
    existence according to their substance, power, quantity, and figure
    immediately in their very beginning without any movement. This is obvious in
    the sun, moon, and stars. The perfection of spiritual nature, however, lies
    in the cognition of truth. Consequently, there are some higher spiritual
    substances which immediately in the beginning receive knowledge of truth
    without any movement or reasoning by a sudden or simple reception. This is
    the case with angels, and for this reason they are said to have godlike
    understanding. There are, also, lower spiritual substances, which can arrive
    at perfect knowledge of truth only through a certain movement, in which they
    go from one thing to another, in order to reach knowledge of things unknown
    through those which are known. This is proper to humar souls. And this is
    why angels are called intellectual substances, wherea souls are called
    rational substances.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Understanding seems to indicate simple and absolute knowledge. And one is
    said to understand (<i>intelligere</i>) because in some sense he reads
    (<i>legit</i>) the truth within (<i>intus</i>) the very essence of the
    thing. Reason, on the other hand, denotes a transition from one thing to
    another by which the human soul reaches or arrives at knowledge of something
    else. For this reason, Isaac says that reasoning is the progress of the
    cause to the thing caused.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Now, all movement proceeds from what is at rest, as Augustine says. For rest
    is the term of motion, as is said in the <i>Physics</i>. Thus, movement is
    related to rest as to its source and its term, as is reason, also, which is
    related to understanding as movement to rest and generation to existence, as
    is clear from the citation from Boethius given above. It is related to
    understanding as to its source and its term. It is related to it as its
    source because the human mind could not move from one thing to another
    unless the movement started from some simple perception of truth, and this
    perception is understanding of principles. Similarly, the movement of reason
    would not reach anything certain unless there were an examination of that
    which it came upon through discursive movement of the mind. This examination
    proceeds to first principles, the point to which reason pursues its
    analysis. As a result, we find that understanding is the source of reasoning
    in the process of discovery and its term in that of judging.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Consequently, although the knowledge proper to the human soul takes place
    through the process of reasoning, nevertheless, it participates to some
    extent in that simple knowledge which exists in higher substances, and
    because of which they are said to have intellective power. This is in
    keeping with the rule which Dionysius gives, that divine wisdom “always
    joins the limits of higher things to the beginnings of the lower things.”
    This is to say that the lower nature at its highest point reaches something
    of that which is lowest in the higher nature.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Dionysius also points out this difference between angels and souls when he
    says: “From divine wisdom the intellectual powers of angelic minds have pure
    and good acts of understanding, not gathering divine knowledge from
    divisible things or the senses or extended discussions, but uniformly
    understanding the intelligible things of God. 1134Later, he adds about
    souls: Therefore, because of the divine wisdom, souls have rationality, too,
    “but spread out, circling about the truth of existing things, by the
    diversity of division falling short of unitive minds. But through the
    reduction of many things to one by reflection souls are held worthy of acts
    of understanding equal to those of angels, in so far as this is proper and
    possible to SOUIS.”He says this because that which belongs to a higher
    nature cannot exist in a lower nature perfectly, but only according to a
    slight participation. Thus, in sensitive nature there is not reason, but
    only a participation of reason inasmuch as brute animals have a kind of
    natural prudence, as appears plainly in the <i>Metaphysics.</i>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    However, what is thus shared is not held as a possession, that is, as
    something perfectly within the power of the one who has it. In this sense it
    is said in the <i>Metaphysics</i> that knowledge of God is a divine and not
    a human possession. As a result, no power is assigned for that which is held
    in this manner. Thus, brute animals are not said to have any reason,
    although they share to some degree in prudence. But this exists in them
    according to a natural [instinctive] judgment. Similarly, there is no one
    special power in man through which he gets knowledge of truth simply,
    absolutely, and without movement from one thing to another. Such perception
    of truth is in man through a natural habit, which is called understanding of
    principles. Accordingly, there is no power in man separate from reason which
    is called understanding. Rather, reason itself is called understanding
    because it shares in the intellectual simplicity, by reason of which it
    begins and through which it terminates its proper activity. For this reason,
    the proper act of understanding is attributed to reason in
    <i>Spirit and Soul.</i> And that which is proper to reason is given as the
    act of reason, where it says that reason is the sight of the soul by which
    it looks at the true through itself; reasoning, however, is the
    investigation of reason.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Even if we conceded that it were properly and completely fitting for us to
    have some power for simple perception and independent knowledge of the truth
    which is in us, it would not be another power than reason. This is clear
    from what follows, for, according to Avicenna, different acts indicate a
    difference of powers only when they cannot be referred to the same
    principle. Thus, in physical things, to receive and to retain are not
    reduced to the same principle, but the former is referred to the wet and the
    latter to the dry.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Therefore, imagination, which retains bodily forms in a physical organ, is a
    different power from sense, which receives these forms through a physical
    organ. However, the act of reason, which is to move from one thing to
    another, and the act of understanding, which is to grasp truth directly, are
    related to each other as generation to existence and movement to rest. But
    to be at rest and to be moved are reduced to the same principle in all
    things in which both are found. For a thing is moved to a place through the
    same nature through which it rests in a place. And that which is at rest and
    that which is moved are like perfect and imperfect. Hence, the power which
    moves in thought from one thing to another and the power that perceives
    truth are not different powers, but one power which knows truth absolutely,
    in so far as it is perfect, and needs movement in thought from one thing to
    another, in so far as it is imperfect.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Consequently, in us, reason, taken strictly, can in no way be a power
    different from understanding. But, sometimes, the cogitative power, which is
    a power of the sensitive soul, is called reason, since it makes comparisons
    between individual forms, just as reason, properly so called, does between
    universal forms, as the Commentator says. This has a definite organ, the
    middle cell of the brain. And this reason is, without doubt, a power
    different from understanding. But we are not speaking of this at present.
  </p>

    <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. <i>Spirit and Soul</i> is not authentic and is not believed to belong to
    Augustine. Nevertheless, in support of what it says, one can say that in
    what he said the author did not intend to distinguish powers of the soul,
    but to show the different steps by which the soul advances in knowledge, so
    that through the senses it knows forms in matter, through imagination it
    knows accidental forms without matter, but with the conditions of matter.
    Through reason it knows the essential form of material things without the
    individual matter. From this it rises higher in the possession of some kind
    of knowledge of created spirits, and, thus, is said to have understanding,
    since spirits of this sort have prior knowledge of substances which exist
    entirely without matter. From this it goes even further to some knowledge of
    God himself, and thus is said to have intelligence, which gives the proper
    name of the act of understanding, since to know God is proper to God, whose
    understanding is His intelligence, that is, His act of understanding.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. As Boethius says: “The higher power embraces the lower, but the lower in
    no way rises to the higher.” Hence, a higher nature can do fully what
    belongs to the lower, but it cannot perform fully what belongs to one still
    higher. Therefore, the nature of the rational soul has powers for the things
    that belong to sensitive and vegetative nature, but not for the things that
    belong to the intellectual nature which exists above it.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. Since, according to the Philosopher, common sense perceives all
    sensibles, it must be drawn to them according to one common character;
    otherwise it would not have one object of its own. None of the proper senses
    can attain to this common character of object. Reason, on the other hand,
    reaches direct understanding as its term when, for example, the movement of
    reason concludes at science. Consequently, it is not necessary that in us
    understanding be a different power fromm reason, as common sense differs
    from the proper senses.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    4. To judge is not a property of reason through which it can be
    distinguished from understanding. For understanding, too, judges that this
    is true and that false. But judgment and the comprehension of intelligence
    are referred to reason to this extent, that in us judgment commonly takes
    place through analysis into principles, whereas direct comprehension of
    truth takes place through understanding.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    5. That which is altogether simple completely lacks composition. But simple
    things are preserved in composite things. Thus it is that what belongs to
    the composite, in so far as it is composite, is not found in what is simple.
    Accordingly, a simple body does not have taste, which follows upon mixture.
    But compound bodies have the things which belong to simple bodies, although
    in an inferior manner. Thus, hot and cold, light and heavy, are found in
    compound bodies. Therefore, there is no composition in the divine
    understanding, which is entirely simple. But our reason, although it is
    composite, can enter upon simple act and composite act, either as it puts
    subject and predicate together or joins principles in order to arrive at a
    conclusion, because there is something of the nature of the simple in it, as
    the model is in its image.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Therefore, in us, it is the same faculty which knows the simple quiddities
    of things, which forms propositions, and which reasons. The last of these is
    proper to reason, as reason; the other two can also belong to understanding,
    as understanding. Hence, the second is found in angels, since they know
    through many species, but only the first is in God, who und6rstands all
    things, simple and composite, by knowing His own essence.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    6. In some sense the soul knows itself through itself, inasmuch as to know
    is to possess in itself knowledge of itself, and in some sense it knows
    itself through a species of an intelligible object, in so far as knowing
    implies thinking and distinguishing of self. Thus, the Philosopher and
    Augustine are speaking of the same thing. Hence, the conclusion does not
    follow.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    7. Such difference of objects cannot diversify faculties, because it is
    based on accidental differences. This has been proved above. Bodily nature
    is thus given as the object of reason, because it is proper to human
    knowledge to begin from sense and phantasm. For this reason, the gaze of our
    understanding, which is properly called reason, inasmuch as reason is proper
    to the human race, first fastens on the natures of sensible things. From
    this it rises higher in its knowledge of created spirit, which is more
    within its competence according to its participation of higher nature than
    according to that which is proper and perfectly fitted to it.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    8. Boethius intends intelligence and reason to be different cognoscitive
    powers, not of the same subject, but of different subjects. Thus, he intends
    reason to belong to man, and so he says that it knows general forms existing
    in individual things, since human knowledge properly concerns forms drawn
    from the senses. Moreover, he intends intelligence to belong to higher
    substances, which in their first glance apprehend completely immaterial
    forms. Accordingly, he does not intend that reason should ever reach that
    which belongs to intelligence, since we can never in the weakness of this
    knowledge attain to sight of the quiddities of immaterial substances.
    However, we will do this in heaven when we will be made godlike through
    glory.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    9. In so far as reason and understanding are in different beings, they are
    not the same power. But the present question concerns them in so far as both
    exist in man.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    10. This reasoning proceeds correctly for acts which belong to different
    powers. But one power may have different acts, one of which is before the
    other. Thus the act of possible intellect is to understand essence and to
    form propositions.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    11., The soul knows both, but through the same power. Nevertheless, it seems
    proper to the human soul, as rational, to know being in this thing. But to
    know being simply seems to belong rather to the higher substances, as is
    clear from the passage cited above.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    12. To love God and to choose virtues are attributed to reason, not because
    they belong to it directly, but in so far as the will is attracted to God as
    its end, and to virtues as means to that end by the judgment of reason. It
    is in this way, too, that rational is distinguished from the irascible and
    the concupiscible, since we are inclined to action by the judgment of reason
    or by passion, which is in the irascible or concupiscible parts. The will is
    also said to be in reason inasmuch as it is in the rational part of the
    soul, just as memory is said to be in sense since it is in the sensitive
    part of the soul, and not because it is the same power.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. As Augustine says, the image of the Trinity is in the higher part of
        reason, but not in the lower. But the image of God in the soul is made
        up of the three powers. Therefore, lower reason does not belong to the
        same power or powers as higher reason. Thus, they seem to be different
        powers.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Since a part is taken with relation to the whole, it is in the same
        genus as the whole. But the soul is called only a potential
        (<i>potentialis</i>) whole. Therefore, the different parts of soul are
        different powers (<i>potentiae</i>) <i>.</i> But higher and lower reason
        are given by Augustine as different parts of reason. Therefore, they are
        different powers.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Everything eternal is necessary and everything temporal and subject
        to change is contingent, as appears from the Philosopher. But the
        Philosopher calls scientific the part of the soul which deals with
        necessary things, and <i>reasoning,</i> or <i>conjectural,</i> the part
        which deals with contingent things. Therefore, since, according to
        Augustine, higher reason embraces eternal things and lower reason
        administers temporal and perishable things, it seems that the
        <i>reasoning</i> is the same as lower reason and the
        <i>scientific</i> is the same as higher reason. But the
        <i>scientific</i> and <i>reasoning</i> are different powers, as the
        Philosopher also clearly shows. Therefore, higher and lower reason are
        different powers.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The Philosopher says that we must distinguish different powers of the
        soul for those things which are generically different, since every power
        of the soul which is limited to some genus is limited to it because of
        some likeness. Thus, the very diversity of objects according to genus
        bears witness to diversity of powers. But that which is eternal and that
        which is corruptible are entirely different generically, since
        corruptible and incorruptible do not belong to the same genus, as is
        said in the <i>Metaphysics.</i> Therefore, higher reason, whose object
        is eternal things is a different power from lower reason, which has
        perishable thing for its material object.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Powers are distinguished through acts, and acts through objects. But
        truth to be contemplated is a different object from good to be done.
        Therefore, higher reason, which contemplates truth, is a different power
        from lower reason, which is occupied with the good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. That which is not one in itself is much less one when compared with
        something else. But higher reason is not one power, but several, since
        the image which consists of the three powers exists in it. Therefore, it
        cannot be said that lower and higher reason are the one power.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. Reason is more simple than sense. However, in sense we do not find
        that the same power has different functions. Therefore, in the
        intellective part one power is much less able to have different
        functions. But higher and lower reason “are double in their functions,”
        as Augustine says. Therefore, they are different powers.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. Whenever things which are not reduced to the same principle are
        attributed to the soul, we must assign different powers in the soul
        according to this difference. Thus, imagination is distinguished from
        sense according to reception and retention. But the eternal and the
        corruptible cannot be reduced to the same principle. For, as is proved
        the <i>Metaphysics,</i> the proximate principles for corruptible and
        incorruptible things are not the same. Therefore, they should not be
        attributed to the same power of the soul. Thus, higher and lower reason
        are different powers.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. Augustine says” that through the three that co-operated in man’s
        sin—man, woman, and serpent—three things in us are indicated, namely,
        higher and lower reason and sensuality. But sensuality is a different
        power from lower reason. Therefore, lower reason, too, is different from
        higher reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. One power cannot at the same time sin and not sin. But, sometimes,
        lower reason sins when higher reason does not, as is clear from
        Augustine. Therefore, lower reason and higher reason are not one power.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. Different perfections belong to different subjects of perfection,
        since a proper act requires a proper power. But habits of the soul are
        perfections of its powers. Therefore, different habits belong to
        different powers. But, according to Augustine, higher reason is assigned
        for wisdom and lower reason for scientific knowledge, and these two are
        different habits. Therefore, higher and lower reason are different
        powers.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        12. Every power is perfected through its act. But diversity of acts
        leads to or manifests diversity of powers. Therefore, wherever there is
        diversity of acts, we should conclude to diversity of powers. But higher
        and lower reason have different acts, since “they are double in their
        functions,” as Augustine says. Therefore, they are different powers.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        13. Higher and lower reason differ more than the agent and the possible
        intellect, since we see that the act of the agent and the possible
        intellect concern the same intelligible thing. But, as has been said,
        the acts of higher and lower reason do not concern the same thing, but
        different things. However, the agent and the possible intellect are
        different powers. Therefore, higher and lower reason are, too.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        14. Everything that is drawn from something differs from it, for nothing
        is its own cause. But lower reason is drawn from higher reason, as
        Augustine says. Therefore, it is a different power from higher reason.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        15. Nothing is moved by itself, as is proved in the <i>Physics..</i> But
        higher reason moves lower reason in so far as it directs and governs it.
        Therefore, higher and lower reason are different powers.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Different powers of the soul are different things. But higher and
        lower reason are not different things. Consequently, Augustine says:
        “When we discuss the nature of the human mind, we are talking about one
        thing. And we divide it into the two which we have mentioned only by
        reason of its functions.”“ Therefore, higher and lower reason are not
        different powers.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The more immaterial a power is, the more it can extend to many
        things. But reason is more immaterial than sense. Yet, by the same
        sensitive power, sight, for example, we discern eternal things, either
        incorruptible or perpetual, namely the heavenly bodies, and corruptible
        things, as these lower things around us. Therefore, it is the same power
        of reason which contemplates eternal things and administers temporal
        things.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Before we can explain this question we have to know two things: how
        powers are distinguished, and how higher and lower reason differ. From
        these two we will be able to clarify the third point, which is the
        subject of our present inquiry, namely, whether higher and lower reason
        are one power or different powers.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We must bear in mind that diversity of powers is determined according to
        acts and objects. However, some” say that this is to be understood in
        the sense that diversity of acts and objects is only a sign of diversity
        of powers and not its cause. And others say that diversity of objects is
        the cause of diversity of powers in passive powers, but not in active
        powers.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But, if we study the matter carefully, we find that in both types of
        powers acts and objects are not only signs of diversity, but in some way
        causes of it. For every thing which has existence only because of some
        end has its manner determined for it from the end to which it is
        ordained. Thus, a saw has this kind of form and this kind of matter in
        order to be suitable for its end, which is to cut. But every power of
        the soul, whether active or passive, is ordained to act as to its end,
        as is clear in the <i>Metaphysics.</i> Hence, every power has a definite
        manner and species by reason of which it can be suitable for such an
        act. Therefore, powers are diversified because the diversity of acts
        required different principles from which to elicit acts. Moreover, since
        object is related to act as its term, and acts are specified by their
        terms, as is plain in the <i>Physics</i>, acts must also be
        distinguished according to their objects. Therefore diversity of objects
        brings about diversity of powers.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Diversity of objects, however, can be regarded in two ways: according to
        the nature of things and according to the diverse intelligible character
        of the objects. Diversity according to the nature of things appears in
        color and taste; diversity according to intelligible character of
        object, in the good and the true. Moreover, since powers which are acts
        of definite organs cannot extend beyond the disposition of their organs
        (for one and the same physical organ cannot be suitable for knowledge of
        all natures), it is necessary that powers which are attached to organs
        be limited to certain natures, that is, to physical natures. For
        activity which is exercised through a physical organ cannot go beyond
        physical nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        However, since there is something in corporeal nature in which all
        bodies agree, and something in which different bodies are diversified,
        it will be possible to make one power attached to the body suitable for
        all bodies according to that which they have in common. Thus, there is
        imagination for all bodies in so far as they share in the character of
        quantity, figure, and the things which follow on these. Hence, it
        extends not only to physical objects, but also to mathematical objects.
        Similarly, there is common sense in so far as in all the physical
        bodies, to which alone it extends, there is a force which is active and
        productive of change [in the sense].
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Some powers, however, are adapted to those aspects in which bodies are
        diversified by reason of a difference in the mode of producing change
        [in the sense]. Thus, sight relates to color, hearing to sound, and so
        on for the other senses. From the fact that the sensitive part of the
        soul uses an organ in its activity two things follow: first, a power
        referring to an object common to all beings cannot be attributed to it,
        for this would immediately transcend physical reality; second, it is
        possible to find in the sensitive soul powers which differ according to
        the different nature of the objects because of the disposition of the
        organ, which can be suited to this or that nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But the part of the soul which does not use a physical organ in its
        activity does not remain limited, but is in a sense infinite, in so far
        as it is immaterial. Therefore, its power extends to an object common to
        all beings. Hence, the object of understanding is said to be “something”
        (<i>quid</i>), which is found in all classes of beings. For this reason,
        the Philosopher says: “Understanding is that by which one does all
        things and by which one becomes all things.” Consequently, it is
        impossible to distinguish different powers in the intellective part
        according to different natures of the objects. We can do so only
        according to the different character of the object, that is to say, in
        so far as the act of the soul is directed to one and the same thing
        according to different relations at different times. Thus, goodness and
        truth in the intellective part distinguish understanding and will. For
        understanding is directed to intelligible truth as to a form, since it
        must be informed by that which is understood, and [the will] is directed
        to goodness as to an end.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        For this reason, the Philosopher says that truth is in the mind and good
        in things, since form is inside and end is outside. Moreovex, form and
        end do not perfect a thing for the same reason. Thus, goodness and truth
        do not have the same character of object.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is in this way, too, that the understanding is divided into agent and
        possible intellect. For something is not an object for the same reason
        when it is in act and when it is in potency, or when it acts or is acted
        upon. For what is actually intelligible is the object of possible
        intellect and, as it were, acts upon it so that by the actually
        intelligible it proceeds from potency to act. But the potentially
        intelligible is the object of agent intellect, in so far as by reason of
        the agent intellect it becomes actually intelligible.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Therefore, it is clear how powers can be distinguished in the
        intellective part. And higher and lower reason are distinguished in this
        way. There are certain natures higher than the rational soul, and
        certain natures lower. But, since everything that is understood is
        understood in the manner of the one understanding, in the rational soul
        the act of understanding things above the soul is lower than the things
        understood; but for things beneath the soul there is in the soul an act
        of understanding which is higher than the things themselves, since the
        things have a more noble existence in the soul than they do in
        themselves. Thus, the soul has a different relation to both types of
        things, and from this the different functions are derived. For it is
        called higher reason in its reference to higher natures, either as
        contemplating their nature and truth in themselves, or as receiving from
        them intelligible character and a kind of model for activity. It is
        called lower reason in so far as it is directed to lower things either
        to perceive them through contemplation or to manage them through
        activity. Both types of nature, however, the higher and the lower, are
        perceived by the human soul in their common character of intelligible,
        the higher in so far as it is immaterial in itself, and the lower in so
        far as it is divested of matter through the activity of the soul.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        From this it is clear that higher and lower reason are not different
        powers, but one and the same power which is related differently to
        different things.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. As we have said in the question on the mind, we see that the image of
        the Trinity in the soul is in the powers as in its root, but in its
        fullness it is in the acts of the powers. It is in this latter respect
        that the image is said to belong to higher and not to lower reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. A part of a power does not always denote a distinct power, but,
        sometimes, a part of a power is taken according to part of the objects
        in so far as the virtual division of quantity is considered. Thus, if
        someone can carry one hundred pounds, one who can carry only fifty
        pounds is said to have part of that power, although the power is
        specifically the same. It is in this sense that higher and lower parts
        are called parts of reason in so far as they are directed to part of the
        objects to which reason, as the term is generally used, refers.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. The scientific and the reasoning or conjectural parts are not the
        same as higher and lower reason, since we can have necessary
        considerations, which belong to the scientific, about lower natures with
        which lower reason is concerned; otherwise, <i>Physics</i> and
        <i>Metaphysics</i> would not be sciences. In the same way, higher reason
        also can in some way turn its attention to human acts, which depend on
        free will, and so are contingent; otherwise, sin, which occurs in such
        matters, would not be attributed to higher reason. Thus, higher reason
        is not completely distinct from the reasoning or conjectural part.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But the scientific part and the reasoning part are different powers
        because they are distinguished in relation to the nature of the
        intelligible object. For, since the act of any power does not extend
        beyond the scope of its object, every activity that cannot be reduced to
        the same formality of its object must belong to another power, which has
        another characteristic object. Now, the object of understanding is
        “something” (<i>quid</i>) as is said in <i>The Soul</i>. For this
        reason, the activity of understanding extends as far as the scope of the
        quiddity (<i>quod quid est</i>) of this “something” can extend. It is
        through this action that one at first knows principles themselves
        immediately, and from knowledge of these principles, by reasoning
        further, one arrives at knowledge of conclusions. This power, which is
        naturally ordained to analyze these conclusions into the quiddity (<i
          >quod quid est</i
        >), the Philosopher calls scientific.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        However, there are some things in which it is impossible to perform such
        an analysis and to arrive at the quiddity, because of the uncertainty of
        their existence. This is the case with contingent things, in so far as
        they are contingent. Hence, these are not known through their quiddity,
        which is the proper object of understanding, but in another way, namely,
        through a kind of conjecture about those things concerning which we
        cannot have certitude. For this, then, a different power is needed. And,
        since this faculty cannot bring the inquiry of reason to its term, as it
        were, to rest, but stays with the investigation, as it were, in motion,
        and attains no more than opinion about the objects of its inquiry, this
        power is, therefore, called the reasoning or the conjectural power from
        the term of its activity. But higher and lower reason are distinguished
        according to natures themselves and, therefore, are not different powers
        as the scientific and the conjectural are.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The objects of the scientific and the reasoning parts are generically
        different by reason of the proper class of objects of knowledge, since
        they are known according to different intelligible characters. But
        eternal and temporal things differ in natural genus and not in their
        character of object of knowledge, according to which we must look for
        likeness between faculty and object.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Truth, which is the object of contemplation, and goodness, which is
        the object of activity, belong to different faculties, the understanding
        and the will. But higher and lower reason are not distinguished in this
        way, for both can be speculative and active, although by reason of
        different things, as has been shown above. Consequently, the conclusion
        does not follow.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Nothing prevents that which contains many things from being one with
        something else which contains many things if both contain the same
        things. Thus, this heap and this collection of stones are one and the
        same thing. In this way, higher and lower reason are the same faculty,
        although both in a sense contain several powers, since both contain the
        same powers. Moreover, higher reason is not said to include several
        powers in the sense that the power of reason itself is divided into
        different powers, but in so far as the will is included in the
        understanding. This does not mean that the will and the understanding
        are one faculty, but that the will is set in motion by the perception of
        the understanding.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. Even in the sensitive part there is one power which has different
        functions, as the imagination, whose function it is to retain those
        things which have been received from the senses and represent them again
        to understanding. Accordingly, since the more immaterial a power is, the
        more things it can extend to, there is nothing to prevent one and the
        same power from having diverse functions in the intellective part, but
        not in the sensitive part.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. Although the eternal and temporal are not reduced to the same
        proximate principle, knowledge of the eternal and of the temporal are
        reduced to the same principle since both are grasped according to one
        character of immateriality by one who understands.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. According to Augustine, as man and woman, between whom there was the
        carnal marriage bond, belonged to human nature and the serpent did not,
        so lower reason, as woman, belongs to the nature of higher reason,
        whereas sensuality, as the serpent, does not.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. Since sin is an act, properly speaking, it does not belong to either
        higher or lower reason, but to man according to the former or latter.
        And, if one power is related to different things, there is nothing
        inconsistent in having sin according to one relation and not according
        to the other. Thus, although several habits are in one power, it happens
        that one sins according to the act of one habit and not according to the
        act of another, for example, if the same man is grammarian and geometer,
        and he makes a statement containing truth about lines and also a
        solecism.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. When a perfection brings the perfectible thing to completion
        according to its full capacity, it is impossible for one perfectible
        thing to have several perfections; in the same order. Therefore, matter
        cannot receive perfection from two subs ‘ tantial forms at the same
        time, because one matter has a capacity for only one substantial nature.
        However, the case is different with accidental forms, which do not give
        perfection to their objects according to their full potency.
        Consequently, it is possible for one perfectible thing to have many
        accidents. Therefore, there can be many habits of one power, since
        habitss are accidental perfections of powers, for they are superadded to
        the nature of the complete power.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        12. As Avicenna says, diversity of act sometimes indicates diversity of
        powers and sometimes does not. For there can be diversity in the acts of
        the soul in five ways. In one, it is according to strength and weakness,
        as to conjecture and to believe. In the second, it is according to
        swiftness and slowness, as to run and to be put in motion. In the third,
        it is according to habit and privation, as to be at rest and to be
        moved. In the fourth, it is according to relation to opposites of the
        same genus, as to sense white and to sense black. It is in the fifth
        when the acts belong to different genera, as to perceive and to move, or
        to sense sound and to sense color.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Accordingly, diversity of the first and second type does not manifest
        diversity of power, for it thus would be necessary to have as many
        distinct powers of soul as there are grades of strength or weakness and
        swiftness or slowness in acts. Similarly, diversity of the third and
        fourth type does not indicate diversity of power, since it belongs to
        the same power to occupy itself with both opposites. Hence, only
        diversity of the fifth type manifests diversity of power, so that we say
        that acts are generically different which do not agree in the character
        of their object. The diversity of acts of higher and lower reason does
        not display diversity of power in this way, as is clear from what has
        been said.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        13. Agent and possible intellect differ more than higher and lower
        reason, since agennand possible intellect refer to objects formally
        different, alth ‘ ough not materially different. For they refer to a
        different character of object, although both can be found in the same
        intelligible thing. For one and the same thing can first be intelligible
        in potency and then intelligible in act. But higher and lower reason
        refer to objects materially different, but not formally different. For
        they refer to different natures according to one character of object, as
        is clear from what has been said. But formal diversity is greater than
        material diversity. Therefore, the conclusion does not follow.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        14. Lower reason is said to be drawn from higher reason because of the
        things which lower reason perceives, for these are drawn from those
        which higher reason perceives. For lower natures are drawn from higher
        natures. Consequently, nothing prevents higher and lower reason from
        being the same power. Similarly, we see that it belongs to the same
        power to study the principles of a subalternating science and the
        principles of a subalternate science, although the latter are drawn from
        the former.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        15. Higher reason is said to move lower reason to this extent, that
        lower natures must be ruled according to higher natures, just as a
        subalternate science is ruled by the subalternating science.

        1. The Philosopher says: “The understanding is always correct.”, But
        reason is the same power as understanding, as was shown earlier.
        Therefore, reason is always correct. Therefore, there is no sin in it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. If anything that is receptive of some perfection is subject to
        defect, only, the defect which is opposite to the perfection can exist
        in it, since the same thing is receptive of contraries. But, according
        to Augustine, wisdom is the proper perfection of higher reason, and
        science is the proper perfection of lower reason. Therefore, stupidity
        and ignorance can be the only sins in higher or lower reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. According to Augustine all sin is in the will. But reason is a
        different power from the will. Therefore, sin is not in reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Nothing is receptive of its opposite, for opposites cannot exist
        together. But every sin of man is contrary to reason, for the evil of
        man is to be contrary to reason, as Dionysius says. Therefore, sin
        cannot exist in reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. A sin which is committed in regard to a certain subject matter cannot
        be attributed to the power which does not extend to that matter. But
        higher reason has eternal things and not delights of the flesh for its
        subject matter. Therefore, sins concerning pleasures of the flesh ought
        not in any way be attributed to higher reason, even though Augustine
        says that consent to an act is attributed to higher reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Augustine says that it is higher reason which contemplates higher
        things and clings to them, namely, through love. But sin does not
        restilt from this. Therefore, sin cannot exist in higher reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. The stronger is not overcome by the weaker. But reason is the
        strongest of the powers which we have within us. Therefore, it cannot be
        overcome by concupiscence or anger or something else of that sort.
        Therefore, sin cannot exist in it.

        1. Merit and demerit belong to the same thing. But merit resides in the
        act of reason. Therefore, so does demerit.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. According to the Philosopher” sin comes not only from passion, but
        also from choice. But choice consists in an act of reason, since it
        follows deliberation, as is said in the <i>Ethics.</i> Therefore, there
        is sin in reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Through reason we are directed in speculative and in practical
        matters. But in speculative matters there is sin of reason, as when one
        is guilty of paralogism in his reasoning. Therefore, in practical
        matters, also, there is sin in reason.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        According to Augustine, sin is sometimes in higher reason and sometimes
        in lower reason. To understand this we must first know two things: which
        act can be attributed to reason; also, which can be attributed to
        higher, and which to lower, reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Accordingly, we must bear in mind that, just as the apprehensive part is
        twofold, namely, the lower, which is the sensitive, and the higher,
        which is the intellective or reasoning part, so the appetitive part,
        also, is twofold, namely, the lower, which is called sense appetite and
        is divided into concupiscent and irascible, and the higher, which is
        called will. These two appetitive parts relate to the corresponding
        apprehensive parts similarly in some respects and differently in others.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        They relate similarly in this, that there can be no movement in either
        appetite unless some apprehension precedes. For that which is desirable
        moves the higher or lower appetite only when perceived by understanding
        or imagination or sense. Because of this, not only appetite, but also
        understanding, imagination, and sense, are called movers.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        They relate differently in this, that there is a natural inclination in
        the lower appetite, by which it is in a way naturally forced to tend
        toward that which is desirable. But the higher appetite is not
        determined to one thing, since the higher appetite is free, whereas the
        lower is not. For this reason, movement of the lower appetite is not
        attributed to the apprehensive power, because the cause of that movement
        does not come from perception, but from an inclination of the appetite.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Movement of the higher appetite, however, is attributed to its
        apprehensive faculty, reason, because the inclination of the higher
        appetite toward this or that is caused by a judgment of reason.
        Consequently, we divide the sources of movement into rational,
        irascible, and concupiscent. In the higher part we use the names which
        belong to perception and in the lower the names which belong to
        appetite.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Therefore, it is clear that an action is attributed to reason in two
        ways. According to one way, it is attributed to it because it belongs to
        it directly, inasmuch as it is elicited by reason itself, for instance,
        the making of a comparison about objects of activity or of knowledge. In
        the other way, it is attributed to it because it belongs to it mediately
        through the will, since the will is set in motion through its judgment.
        Furthermore, just as a movement of appetite which follows a judgment of
        reason is attributed to reason, so a movement of appetite which follows
        deliberation of higher reason is attributed to higher reason. This
        happens when one bases his deliberation about practical matters on the
        fact that something is acceptable to God, or prescribed by divine law,
        or acts in some similar way. However, the movement of appetite will
        belong to lower reason when it follows a judgment of lower reason, as
        when one decides about practical matters on the basis of lower causes,
        as, for instance, considering the depravity of the act, the dignity of
        reason, the enmity of men, or something of this sort.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        These two types of consideration are interrelated. For, according to the
        Philosopher, end has the character of principle in objects of activity.
        But in speculative sciences the judgment of reason reaches its
        perfection only when conclusions are analyzed into first principles.
        Hence, even in objects of activity the judgment of reason is brought to
        perfection only when there is reference to the last end. For only then
        will reason give the final decision on activity. And this decision is
        consent to the deed. Consequently, consent to the act is attributed to
        higher reason, which looks to the last end. But pleasure, whether it is
        complacency or consent in pleasure, is attributed to lower reason by
        Augustine.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Therefore, when one sins by giving consent to an evil act, the sin is in
        higher reason, but when one sins through pleasure alone with some
        deliberation, the sin is said to be in lower reason because the
        disposition of these lower things rests directly with it. Thus, sin is
        said to exist in higher or lower reason, in so far as the movements of
        appetite are attributed to reason. But, if we consider the proper act of
        reason, we say that sin is in the higher or lower reason when higher or
        lower reason is deceived in its proper act of comparison.

        1. According to the Philosopher, just as sense is never deceived in its
        proper sensible objects, but can be deceived concerning common and
        accidental sensibles, so understanding is never deceived about its
        proper object, quiddity, except perhaps accidentally, nor about first
        principles, which are known as soon as the terms are known, but is
        deceived in comparing and applying common principles to particular
        conclusions. Thus it comes about that reason loses its correctness and
        sin exists in it.

        2. Stupidity and ignorance are directly opposed to wisdom and science,
        as such, but in a certain sense all other sins are indirectly opposed to
        them, in so far as the rule of wisdom and science, which is required in
        activity, is perverted through sin. For this reason, every evil man is
        called one who does not know.

        3 Sin is said to be in the will not as in a subject but as in a cause,
        for the thing must be voluntary to be a sin. But that which is caused by
        the will is also attributed to reason, for the reason mentioned above.

        right reason, in which there can be no sin.

        5. Higher reason is led directly to eternal essences as to its proper
        objects. But from them it is in some measure diverted to temporal and
        perishable things, inasmuch as it judges of these temporal things
        through the eternal essences. Thus, when its judgment about some matter
        is turned from its proper course, that is ascribed to higher reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Although higher reason is ordained to this, that it cling to eternal
        things, it does not always cling to them. Thus, there can be sin in it.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. Socrates used a similar reasoning when he wanted to show that one who
        has certain knowledge does not sin, for, since certain knowledge is more
        powerful than passion, it is not overcome by it. In answer to this the
        Philosopher distinguishes certain knowledge into universal and
        particular, habitual and actual. And he makes a distinction in habitual
        certain knowledge on this basis, that a habit can be unhindered or
        repressed, as happens with those who are intoxicated. Accordingly, one
        who has universal knowledge in act may in a particular case with which a
        work is concerned have it only in a habit which is repressed through
        concupiscence or some other passion. As a result, the judgment of reason
        in the particular case cannot be informed according to the certain
        universal knowledge, and so it happens that reason errs in its choice.
        By reason of such an error of choice every evil man is one who does not
        know, however much certain knowledge in general he may have. In this
        way, also, reason is led to sin, inasmuch as it is repressed through
        concupiscence.

        It seems that it is not, for
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. As Augustine says, striking the breast and [saying] the Our Father
        are the remedies given for venial sins. But consent to pleasure without
        consent to the deed is numbered among the sins for which striking the
        breast and [saying] the Our Father are accepted as a remedy. For
        Augustine says: “Now, when the mind takes pleasure in illicit things in
        thought alone, not, indeed, seeing them as something to be done, but
        still holding and gladly desiring these things which should be rejected
        as soon as they reach the soul, this should be considered to be a sin,
        but far less a sin than if it decided to carry it out in deed.
        Therefore, pardon should be sought for such thoughts, too, and we should
        strike our breasts and say: ‘Forgive us our trespasses.” Therefore, the
        above-mentioned consent in pleasure is not a mortal sin.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Consent to a venial sin is venial, as consent to a mortal sin is
        mortal. But pleasure is a venial sin. Therefore, consent to it is
        venial.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. In the act of fornication we find two things for which it can be
        judged evil: the vehemence of the pleasure, which engulfs reason, and
        the harm coming from the act, namely, the uncertain condition of the
        children and other things of this sort which would result unless marital
        relations were regulated by law. But it cannot be said that fornication
        is a mortal sin by reason of the pleasure, for that intensity of
        pleasure exists in the marital act [in marriage], which is not a sin.
        Therefore, it is a mortal sin only because of the harm which comes from
        the act. So, one who consents to the pleasure of fornication, but not to
        the act, does not approach fornication under the aspect in which it is a
        mortal sin. Therefore, he does not seem to sin mortally.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Homicide is not less a sin than fornication. But one who thinks about
        homicide and takes pleasure and consents to the pleasure does not sin
        mortally. Otherwise, all who enjoyed hearing histories of wars, and
        consented to this pleasure, would sin mortally. But this does not seem
        probable. Therefore, consent to the pleasure of fornication is not a
        mortal sin.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Since venial and mortal sin are almost an infinite distance apart,
        which is seen from the distance between the punishment, a venial sin
        cannot become mortal. But the pleasure which consists in thought alone
        before consent is venial. Therefore, it cannot become mortal when the
        consent is added.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. The essence of mortal sin consists in turning away from God. But to
        turn away from God belongs not to lower reason, but to higher reason, to
        which, also, it belongs to turn to God. For opposites belong to the same
        faculty. Therefore, mortal sin cannot exist in lower reason, and so the
        consent to pleasure which is ascribed to lower reason by Augustine is
        not a mortal sin.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. As Augustine says: “If our desire is moved, it is like a woman being
        persuaded, but, finally, reason manfully curbs and represses our aroused
        desire. When this happens, we do not fall into sin.14From this, it
        seems, we perceive that in the spiritual marriage deep within us there
        is not sin if the woman sins, and the man does not. But when there is
        consent to pleasure and not to act, the woman sins, and not the man, as
        Augustine says. Therefore, consent to the pleasure is not a mortal sin.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. According to the Philosopher, pleasure in good and evil follows the
        activity by which it is caused. But the exterior act of fornication,
        which consists in bodily movement, is different from the interior act,
        namely, the thought. Therefore, pleasure which follows the interior act
        will be different from that which follows the external act. But the
        interior act is not of its nature a mortal sin, as the external act is.
        Therefore, the interior pleasure is not classified as a mortal sin;
        hence, consent to such pleasure does not seem to be a mortal sin.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. Only that seems to be a mortal sin which is forbidden by divine law,
        as is clear from the definition of sin given by Augustine: “Sin is word
        or deed or desire against the law of God.” But there is no law
        forbidding consent to pleasure. Therefore, it is not a mortal sin.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        10. It seems that we should pass the same judgment on interpretative
        consent and on express consent. But interpretative consent does not seem
        to be mortal sin because sin is carried over to another faculty only
        through an act of that faculty. In interpretative consent, however,
        there is not any act of reason, which is said to consent, but only
        negligence in repressing illicit movements. Therefore, interpretative
        consent to pleasure is not a mortal sin, and express consent is,
        likewise, not a mortal sin.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11. As has been said, an act is a mortal sin because it is against a
        divine precept. Otherwise, God would not be despised in the
        transgression of the precept, and thus the mind of the sinner would not
        be turned away from God. Lower reason, however, does not take the norm
        of the divine precept into consideration. For this is the task of higher
        reason, which considers eternal norms. Therefore, there can be no mortal
        sin in lower reason; hence, consent mentioned above is not a mortal sin.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        12. Since there are two elements in sin, turning toward and turning
        away, the turning away follows the turning toward. For, by the very fact
        one turns toward one contrary, he turns away from the other. But he who
        consents to the pleasure and not to the act does not fully turn to
        changeable good, since completeness is in the act. Therefore, in this
        there is not complete turning away; hence, no mortal sin.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        13. As the Gloss says: “God is more inclined to be merciful than to
        punish.” But, if one took pleasure in meditating on divine commands and
        consented to such pleasure, he would not merit, as long as he did not
        propose to fulfill the divine commands in deed. Therefore, neither will
        one merit punishment if he consents to the pleasure of sin, provided
        that he does not decide to fulfill it in deed. Accordingly, lie does not
        seem to sin mortally.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        14. The lower power of reason is compared to woman. But woman is not
        mistress of her will, for, as the Apostle says (1 Cor 7:4): she “does
        not have power over her body.” Therefore, neither is the lower part of
        reason master of its will; hence, it cannot sin.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. No one is damned except for mortal sin. But man will be damned for
        consent to pleasure. Hence, Augustine says: “The whole man will be
        damned, unless these things which are perceived to be sins only of
        thought, and which exist without the will to do them, but still with the
        will to delight the mind with them, are remitted through the grace of
        the Mediator.” Therefore, consent to pleasure is a mortal sin.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Pleasure in an activity and the activity itself are reduced to the
        same genus of sin, just as the activity of a virtue and pleasure in it
        are reduced to the same virtue. For it belongs to the just man to
        perform just deeds and to take pleasure in them, as is clear in the
        <i>Ethics.</i> But the act of fornication is classified as a mortal sin.
        Therefore, the pleasure in the thought of fornication is, too.
        Therefore, consent to the pleasure will be a mortal sin.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. If there could not be mortal sin in lower reason, gentiles, who
        consider only the lower norms of action, would not sin mortally by
        fornicating or doing something of the sort. This is obviously false.
        Therefore, there can be mortal sin in lower reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The question whether deliberate pleasure in bad thoughts is a mortal sin
        and the question about consent to pleasure is the same. For there can be
        no doubt whether deliberate pleasure in bad thoughts is a sin, if it is
        called such (<i>morosa</i>) from duration (<i>mora</i>) of time. For it
        is certain that mere length of time cannot give an act the character of
        mortal sin, unless something else intervenes, since length of time is
        not a circumstance aggravating to infinity. But what is doubtful seems
        to be this: whether the pleasure which is called such because of the
        superadded consent of reason is a mortal sin. There have been different
        opinions about this.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        For some have said that it is not a mortal sin, but venial. This opinion
        seems to be opposed to the words of Augustine, who threatens man with
        damnation because of such consent, as is clear from the passage cited.
        Furthermore, the almost universal opinion of moderns contradicts this
        [first] position, which seems, also, to tend toward danger for souls,
        since from consent in such pleasure a man can very readily fall into
        sin.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Hence, it seems that we must accept the second opinion, which makes such
        consent a mortal sin. The truth of this position can be seen from the
        following. For we must bear in mind that, just as sensible pleasure
        follows on the external act of fornication, so interior pleasure follows
        on the act of thinking. But a double pleasure follows on thought. One of
        these follows from the thought and the other from the thing thought of.
        For at times we take pleasure in thought because of the thought itself,
        from which we get actual knowledge of certain things, although the
        things displease us. Thus, a just man thinks about sins when he
        discusses or argues about them, and takes pleasure in the truth of this
        thought. But the pleasure follows because of the things thought when the
        thing thought about itself stirs up and attracts the affections. In some
        acts, these two thoughts obviously differ and are clearly distinct. But
        their distinction is more obscure in thoughts about sins of the flesh,
        because, due to the weakened condition of the concupiscible part, when
        there is thought of such desirable objects, there immediately follows in
        the concupiscible part a movement which is caused by these objects.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Therefore, the pleasure which follows thought because of the thought is
        ascribed to an altogether different genus than the pleasure of the
        exterior act. Consequently, when any such pleasure follows the thought
        of evil things, it is either no sin at all, but a praiseworthy pleasure,
        as when one takes delight in the knowledge of the truth; or, if there is
        some lack of moderation, it is classed under the sin of curiosity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But the pleasure which follows thought because of the thing thought
        about belongs to the same class as the pleasure of the external act.
        For, as is said in the <i>Metaphysics</i>, pleasure consists essentially
        in the act, but the hope and memory are pleasurable because of the act.
        From this it is clear that such pleasure is inordinate in its genus by
        reason of the same disorder which makes external pleasure inordinate.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Accordingly, if the external pleasure is conceded to be mortally sinful,
        then the interior pleasure, considered in itself and independently,
        belongs to the genus of mortal sin. Moreover, mortal sin results
        whenever reason gives itself over to mortal sin by approving of it. For
        the uprightness of justice is banished from reason when it is made
        subject to evil by approving of it. And reason makes itself subject to
        this disordered pleasure when it consents to it. This is the first
        subjection by which it enslaves itself. Sometimes, there follows on this
        subjection the choice of the disordered act itself, in order to attain
        this pleasure more perfectly. And, the more it seeks for further
        disorders to obtain pleasure, the more it advances in sin. Yet the
        consent by which it accepted the pleasure will be the first root of that
        whole progression. Thus, mortal sin begins there.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Consequently, we concede without reserve that consent in the pleasure of
        fornication or of any other mortal sin is a mortal sin. From this it
        also follows that whatever a man does because of consent to such
        pleasure with a view to fostering or holding it, such as shameful
        touches, or lustful kisses, or things such as these, the whole thing is
        a mortal sin.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. As Augustine says, [saying] the Our Father and [doing] other works of
        this sort have value not only to wipe out venial sins, but also for the
        remission of mortal sins, although they are not sufficient for the
        remission of mortal sins as they are for the remission of venial sins.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The pleasure that follows the pleasure in fornication because of the
        thing thought about is of its nature mortal, but it can be venial
        accidentally, in so far as it precedes deliberate assent which gives
        mortal sin its complete character. Without this, if the body were
        defiled by violence, there would not be mortal sin, for, as Lucy says,
        the body cannot be defiled with the defilement of sin without the
        consent of the mind. Therefore, when consent comes, the above-mentioned
        accident is withdrawn and there is mortal sin, as would happen in a
        woman who, if she gave consent, would be corrupted through violence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. The whole disorder of fornication, from whatever source it arises,
        flows over into the pleasure which it causes. Hence, one who approves
        pleasure of this sort sins mortally.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. If one took pleasure in the thought of murder because of the thing
        thought about, this would be only by reason of an inclination which he
        had toward murder; hence, he would sin mortally. However, if one took
        pleasure in such thought because of knowledge of the things about which
        he is thinking, or for some other reason of this sort, it would not
        always be a mortal sin. It would, rather, be classed under some other
        genus of sin than murder, such as curiosity or something else of this
        sort.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. The pleasure which was venial will never, as numerically the same,
        become mortal, but the act of consent added to it will be a mortal sin.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Although higher reason alone is of itself directed to God, lower
        reason to some degree shares in this conversion, in so far as it is
        ruled by higher reason. Similarly, the concupiscent and irascible are
        said to share in reason to some degree in so far as they obey reason.
        Thus, the turning away [from God] in mortal sin can belong to lower
        reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. In <i>Against the Manichaeans,</i> Augustine does not explain those
        three things as he does in <i>The Trinity.</i> In the latter, he
        attributes serpent to sensuality, woman to lower reason, and man to
        higher reason; whereas, in the former he attributes serpent to sense,
        woman to concupiscence or sensuality, and man to reason. Therefore, it
        is clear that the conclusion does not follow.

        8. The internal act, that is to say, thought, has pleasure of a kind
        different from the pleasure of the external act. And this follows
        thought for its own sake. But the pleasure which follows thought because
        of the act thought about is put in the same class [as the act] because
        no one takes pleasure in something unless he is attached to it and
        perceives it as agreeable. Consequently, one who consents to interior
        pleasure also approves the exterior pleasure and wants to enjoy it, at
        least by thinking about it.

        9. Consent to pleasure is forbidden by the precept: “Thou shall not
        covet...” (Exod. 20:17; Dent. 5:21). For it is not without cause that
        different precepts are given in the law for the external act and the
        internal desire. Nevertheless, even if it were not forbidden in any
        special commandment, all the consequences of fornication which concern
        the same object would be forbidden by the very fact that fornication is
        forbidden.

        10. Before reason considers its own pleasure or harm, it does not have
        interpretative consent, even though it does not resist. But, when it has
        considered the rising pleasure and the harm that will follow, it seems
        to consent, as a man seems to consent, unless he openly resists when.he
        perceives that he will be completely drawn to sin by pleasure of this
        sort, and will fall headlong. Then the sin is attributed to reason
        because of its act, since to act and not to act when one should are
        reduced to [one] genus, inasmuch as sin of omission is reduced to sin of
        act.

        13. As Dionysius says: “Good is caused by one whole and complete cause,
        but evil by individual defects.” Thus, more things are required for
        something to be a meritorious good than for it to be a blameworthy evil,
        although God is more inclined to reward good deeds than to punish evil
        ones. Consequently, consent to pleasure without consent to the deed is
        not enough for merit, but, when there is question of evil, it is enough
        for blame.

        We concede the arguments to the contrary, although the last concludes
        falsely. For it proceeds as though a gentile could not sin according to
        higher reason. And this is false, for there is no one who does not judge
        that something is the end of human life. And, when he uses that as a
        basis of his deliberation, he is using higher reason.

        1. It belongs to higher reason to cling to the eternal norms of conduct.
        Therefore, sin can be in it only in so far as it turns away from these
        eternal norms. But to turn away from them is a mortal sin. Therefore,
        there can be only mortal sin in higher reason.

        be contempt when one considers something to be evil and to be punished

        something in the soul in which there can be only mortal sin. But this is

        There can be venial and mortal sin in the higher part of reason.
        Nevertheless, there is some subject matter concerning which there can be
        only mortal sin in higher reason. This is plain in what follows. For
        higher reason has an act concerning some matter directly, that is,
        concerning eternal norms, and an act concerning some matter indirectly,
        that is, temporal norms, about which it judges according to eternal
        norms. With reference to its proper matter, eternal norms, it has a
        double act, one unpremeditated and one deliberate. But, since mortal sin
        is committed only after the act of deliberation, there can be venial sin
        in higher reason when there is an unpremeditated movement, and mortal
        when there is deliberate movement, as we see in the sin of infidelity.
        But it has only a deliberate act with reference to the matter of
        temporal things because it is directed to them only when it compares the
        eternal norms with them. Consequently, the act of higher reason will
        always be a mortal sin in this matter, if such matter is by nature a
        mortal sin. But, if it is by nature a venial sin, it will be venial, as
        is clear when one gives consent to an idle word.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Higher reason sins in this, that it turns away from eternal norms not
        only by acting against them, but by acting outside them, which is a
        venial sin.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Not every contempt makes a sin mortal, but contempt of God. And
        through this alone man is turned away from God. But, when one consents
        to a venial sin after any deliberation, no matter how much, he does not
        have contempt of God, unless, perhaps, he would judge that the sin is
        contrary to a divine commandment. Thus, the conclusion does not follow.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. That there can be only venial sin in sensuality comes from its
        imperfection. But reason is a perfect power and, therefore, there can be
        sin in it according to every difference of sin. For its act can be
        complete in any genus. Hence, if it is by nature a venial sin, it is
        venial; if it is by nature a mortal sin, it is mortal.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Although higher reason is not directly connected with the flesh, the
        weakening of the flesh reaches it, inasmuch as higher powers receive
        something from the lower powers.
