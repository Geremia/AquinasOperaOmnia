  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    It seems that it is, for
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. Explaining that line in the Apocalypse (20:12), “and another book was
    opened, which was the book of life,” the Gloss says: “The book of life is
    Christ, who will then appear in His power and give life to His own.”’ Now,
    at the final judgment, Christ will appear in human form, which is not
    something uncreated. Consequently, the book of life does not mean anything
    uncreated.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. Gregory says: “Our future judge Himself is called the book of life,
    because whoever sees Him will at once remember all he has done. Now,
    judgment has been given to Christ as man. This is clear from the words of
    John (5:2 7): “And he hath given him power to do judgment, because he is the
    son of man.” Therefore, Christ as man is the book of life, and the same must
    be said as before.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. A thing is called a book because it has received writing. But a thing is
    said to be receptive in so far as it contains material potency, which cannot
    exist in God. Therefore, nothing uncreated is called the book of life.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    4. Since <i>book</i> means a kind of collection, it signifies distinction
    and difference. But, being most simple, an uncreated nature contains nnoo
    diversity. Therefore, nothing in such a nature can be called a book.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    5. In every book, the writing is something other than the book. Now, the
    writing in a book is made up of figures, and by means of these we know the
    things which are read in the book. However, the ideas by which God knows
    things do not differ from the divine essence. Consequently, His uncreated
    nature cannot be called a book.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    6. But it was said that even though there is no real difference in the
    divine nature, there is nevertheless a conceptual difference.—On the
    contrary, a merely conceptual difference exists only in our mind.
    Consequently, if the difference which this book involves is only a
    conceptual difference, the book of life must exist only in our intellects,
    and hence will not be something uncreated.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    7. The book of life seems to be God’s knowledge of those who are to be
    saved. Moreover, the knowledge of the elect is contained in God’s knowledge
    of vision. Now, since the soul of Christ sees in the Word all the things
    that God knows with His knowledge of vision, it seems that it also knows the
    number of the elect and all those who have been chosen. Therefore, the soul
    of Christ can be called the book of life; hence, the book of life means
    something created.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    8. We read in Sirach (24:32): “All these are the book of life...”; and the
    Gloss on this passage adds: “That is, the new and old testament.” Now, the
    Old and New Testament are created. Therefore, the book of life means
    something created.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    9. A book seems to get its name from the fact that something is written in
    it. Writing, however, involves some imperfection; hence, in its initial
    purity, our intellect is compared to “a page on which nothing has been
    written.” But God’s nature is far more pure and simple than our intellect.
    Hence, it cannot be called a book.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    10. A book exists for someone to read. But God’s nature cannot be said to be
    a book in the sense that He reads it. This is evident from Augustine’s
    statement that its title, “Book of Life,” does not mean that God has to read
    it in order to know something which He did not know previously. Similarly,
    it cannot be called a book in the sense that someone other than God reads
    it, because no one can read anything unless he finds some diversity of
    markings—for example, no one can read a blank piece of paper, because it is
    undifferentiated. Therefore, God’s uncreated nature cannot be called a book.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    11. From a book one does not receive knowledge of things as from their cause
    but as from a sign of them. Now, God does not receive His knowledge of
    things, as it were, from a sign, but, as it were, from a cause. Therefore,
    God’s knowledge cannot be called the book of life.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    12. Nothing can be merely a sign of itself. Now, a book is a sign of truth.
    Consequently, since God is truth itself, He Himself cannot be called a book.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    13. A book and a teacher are principles of knowledge in different ways. Now,
    all wisdom is said to come from God as from a teacher. Therefore, it does
    not come from Him as from a book.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    14. A thing is represented differently in a mirror and in a book. Now,
    Wisdom (7:2 6) calls God a mirror because all things are represented in Him.
    Consequently, He cannot and should not be called a book.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    15. Even those books that are copied from the original are called books. But
    the minds of men and angels, in some sense, copy God’s mind when they
    receive knowledge of things from it. Consequently, if the divine mind is
    called the book of life, created minds should be similarly called; and thus
    it is not always something uncreated that is called the book of life.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    16. The book of life seems to imply a representation of life and an exercise
    of causality over it. Now, all this belongs to Christ as man, because in
    Him, as in a pattern, is represented all life, both that of grace and that
    of glory. For this reason it was said to Moses (Exodus 25:40): “Look and
    make it according to the pattern that was shewn thee in the mount.”
    Moreover, Christ merited life for us. Therefore, Christ Himself, as man, can
    be called the book of life.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. Augustine says: “We should know that there is a divine force which causes
    each one to remember his deeds, good or bad. Indeed, this divine power is
    called a book.” Now, a divine force is something uncreated. Therefore,
    something uncreated is also called the book of life.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <i>2.</i> In the same work, Augustine says: “The book of life is God’s
    foreknowledge, which cannot be mistaken.” But His foreknowledge is something
    uncreated. Therefore, the book of life is also something uncreated.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Applied to God, <i>book</i> can be used only metaphorically; thus, it is in
    this sense that the representation of life is called the book of life. In
    this connection, it should be noted that life can be represented in two
    ways: first, as it is in itself, or, secondly, as it can be participated in
    by certain individuals. Furthermore, life taken in itself can be represented
    in two ways. This can be done, first, by means of instruction; and this kind
    of representation pertains to the sense of hearing, which, as said in
    <i>The Senses and the Sensed</i>, is the chief sense for learning. Taken in
    this meaning, therefore, <i>the book of life</i> signifies that which
    contains instructions on how one should live. Consequently, the Old and New
    Testaments are called the book of life. The second way of representing life
    in itself is by giving a model; and this kind of representation pertains to
    the sense of sight. Consequently, Christ Himself is called the book of life,
    because, by looking at Him as at a model, we can see how we must live in
    order to attain eternal life.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    We are not speaking of the book of life in these senses, however, but only
    in the sense that the book of life is said to be the representation of those
    who are to attain eternal life, and whose names, according to a comparison
    drawn from human affairs, are said to be written down in this book.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    For, in a state that is wisely ruled, anyone who becomes a citizen must do
    so according to the ordinances of its ruler. Hence, those who are to be
    admitted to citizenship are enrolled as being, as it were, participants in
    the state. By using this enrollment, the ruler of the state is guided in
    rejecting persons from and in admitting them to the fellowship of the
    citizens subject to him. Now, the citizens who are ruled most perfectly by
    divine providence form the society of the Church triumphant, which is also
    called the City of God in Scripture.8 Hence, the enrollment or
    representation of those who are to be admitted to that society is called the
    book of life. This is clear from Scripture’s manner of speaking. For
    example, Luke (10:20) says: “Rejoice in this, that your names are written in
    heaven,” that is, in the book of life; Isaiah (4:3): “Everyone... shall be
    called holy... that is written in life in Jerusalem”; and in the Epistle to
    the Hebrews (12:22-23) we read: “But you are come... to the city of the
    living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to the company of many thousands of
    angels, and to the church of the first-born who are written in the heavens.”
    It is necessary, therefore, to carry out the metaphor—and say that from this
    enrollment the ruler of the society shall know those who are to be given
    life. The bestowal of life, of course, belongs to God alone. However, God is
    not guided by anything created, for He is a rule that is directed by nothing
    extrinsic to Himself. Consequently, the book of life, in the sense in which
    we are now using it, means something uncreated.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1-2. Our answer is clear from what we have said above. For the Gloss and
    Gregory’s statement concern the book of life in another sense, namely, as it
    means a model for living: anyone who looks at it can tell whether or not he
    conforms to it.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. When terms are applied to God, the general rule should be observed that
    in no respect can imperfection be contained in predicates applied to the
    divinity. Consequently, whatever implies matter, privation, or time must be
    removed. Now, that it receives markings from something extrinsic belongs to
    a book in so far as it is temporal and newly written. These notes are not
    included in the predicate when it is applied to God.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    4. The very notion of <i>book</i> implies a difference existing between the
    things known by its means, because a book hands down the knowledge of many
    things. But that a book must have diversity to hand down knowledge of many
    things is a defect in the book. It would be much more perfect if it could
    teach by means of one thing all that it now explains by means of many
    things. Consequently, since God is most perfect, the book of life is such
    that it shows many things by means of that which is one in the highest
    degree.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    5. That the letters written in a book differ from the pages on which they
    are written is due to a defect of material books. For, because books are
    composite things, that which has is not the same as that which is had.
    Consequently, in God these ideas differ from His essence, not really, but
    only conceptually.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    6. Although the distinction between the writing and that in which it is
    written is merely conceptual, the representation, which completes the notion
    of a book, is not only in our mind but also in God. Hence, the book of life
    is really in God.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    7. As indicated above, the book of life directs God, who gives life, in His
    giving of life. Now, even though the soul of Christ knows all the elect, God
    is directed, not by Christ’s human knowledge, but by His own uncreated
    knowledge, which is Himself. Hence, the knowledge possessed by the soul of
    Christ cannot be called the book of life in the sense in which we are
    speaking of it.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    8. The reply is clear from what has been said.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    9. Although there is no diversity but only the greatest purity in God, He is
    nonetheless compared to a book that has been written in, and not to the
    blank page to which our intellect has been compared. For our intelligence is
    compared to a blank page because it is in potency to all intelligible forms,
    and as yet has none of them actually. In God’s intellect, however, all the
    forms of things exist in act, and in Him they are one. Consequently, in God
    the formal character of writing is compatible with His oneness.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    10. God Himself reads the book of life, and others can read it in so far as
    they are allowed to do so. Augustine does not mean to deny that God reads
    the book of life; he denies only that He reads it in order to know what He
    previously did not know. Moreover, others can read the book of life, even
    though it is entirely simple, since it is possible for one and the same
    reality to be the intelligible character of many things.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    11. One thing is a likeness of another in two ways. In the first way, it is
    the model for the other thing and thus its cause; second, it itself can be
    modeled upon the other, and thus be its effect and sign. Now, in the case of
    men, a book conforms to their knowledge, which, in turn, is caused by
    things. Consequently, they receive knowledge of things from a book, not as
    from a cause, but as from a sign. However, God’s knowledge is the cause of
    things, since it contains the archetypes of all things. Hence, knowledge is
    received from the book of life as from a cause, and not as from as a sign.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    12. The book of life is uncreated truth itself as well as a likeness of
    created truth, just as a created book is a sign of truth.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    13. In God, exemplary and efficient causality come to the same thing.
    Consequently, from the fact that He is an exemplary cause He can be called a
    book, and from the fact that He is the efficient cause of wisdom He can be
    called a teacher.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    14. The representation a mirror gives differs from that which a book gives,
    because it refers directly to things while that of a book refers to things
    through the medium of knowledge. For the letters contained in a book are
    only signs of words, and these, in turn, are signs of concepts, which are
    likenesses of things. A mirror, however, reflects the forms of things. Yet
    in God the species of things are reflected in both ways, because He knows
    things and He knows that He knows them. Consequently, in God both the notion
    of mirror and the notion of book can be verified.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    15. The minds of the saints can also be called books. This is clear from the
    Apocalypse (20:12): “And the books were opened”—which Augustine explains as
    meaning the hearts of the just. However, the saints’ minds cannot be called
    books of life in the sense in which we are taking this term. This is clear
    from what has been said.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    16. Although Christ as man is an archetype and, in some sense, the cause of
    life, as man He is not the cause of the life of glory through His authority
    nor an archetype directing God in His bestowal of life. Consequently, Christ
    as man cannot be called the book of life.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It seems that it is predicated personally, for
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. In the Psalms (39:8) we read: “In the head of the book it is written
        of me...” and the Gloss explains: “That is, in the Father, who is my
        head.” Now, in God nothing has a head except that which has a principle.
        But <i>that which has a Principle</i> is a personal predicate in matters
        pertaining to God. Therefore, the book of life is a personal
        predication.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. just as word signifies knowledge proceeding from another,
        <i>book</i> also signifies this, because the writing in a book proceeds
        from a writer. Now, for the reason already given, word is predicated
        personally of God. Consequently, the book of life is also a personal
        predication.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. It was said, however, that word implies a real procession, whereas
        <i>book</i> implies a procession only according to our way of
        understanding.—On the contrary, we can name God only from the things
        that exist here below. But, in our experience, a word coming from a
        speaker is really distinct from him, and so is a book really distinct
        from its author. For this reason, therefore, both terms imply a real
        distinction in God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. There is greater distance between one who speaks and his oral word
        than there is between him and the word within his heart; and an even
        greater distance is between him and a written word signifying the word
        within his heart. Consequently, if the divine Word, which, as Augustine
        says, resembles the word within the heart, is really distinct from the
        one who utters it, much more distinct will be a book, since this implies
        writing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. That which is attributed to a thing should belong to it according to
        all that belongs to its nature. Now, the notion of a book demands not
        only that it represent something but also that it be written by someone.
        Consequently, in matters concerning God, the word <i>book</i> is taken
        according as a book is something by another. Hence, it is predicated

        The book of life is predestination itself. This is clear from

        essence, never of the divine Persons. Consequently, the book of life is
        similarly predicated.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Some say that the book of life is sometimes a personal, sometimes, an
        essential predication: in so far as it is used of God according to the
        notion of writing, it is predicated personally, and in this usage it
        implies origin from another, for a book has to be written by another;
        but, in so far as it implies a representation of the things written in
        the book it is predicated essentially.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        This distinction, however, does not seem reasonable, because a term used
        of God is not predicated personally unless its meaning in connection
        with God implies a relation of origin. Moreover, with regard to words
        used in a transferred sense, a metaphor is not to be understood as
        indicating complete resemblance, but only some agreement in a
        characteristic belonging to the nature of the thing whose name is being
        applied. For example, the word lion is applied to God, not because of a
        resemblance between two natures possessing sensation, but because of a
        resemblance based on one property of the lion. Consequently, the book of
        life is not predicated of God according to what is common to all
        products of art, but only according to that which is proper to a book as
        a book. Now, to come from an author does not belong to a book as a book
        but only as it is a product of art; and, in a similar manner, a house is
        from a builder, and a knife is from a cutler. On the other hand, to
        represent the things written about in the book belongs to the notion of
        a book as such. Consequently, as long as this representation remains,
        the book remains a book, even though it is not written by another and is
        not a product of art. Fro’ m this it is clear that <i>book</i> is
        applied to God, not in so far as a book is written by another, but in so
        far as a book represents the things which are written in it. Therefore,
        since representation is common to the entire Trinity, <i>book</i> is
        predicated, not personally of God, but only essentially.

        1. Words that are predicated essentially of God sometimes stand for the
        persons. Hence, <i>God</i> sometimes stands for the person of the
        Father, sometimes for the person of the Son, as when we say “God begets”
        or “God begotten.” Similarly, even though <i>book</i> is predicated
        essentially, it can sometimes stand for the person of the Son. In this
        sense, in matters pertaining to divinity, the book of life can be said
        to have a head or principle.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. According to its intelligible character, the term <i>word</i> when
        used of God implies origin from another. This has already been
        discussed. But <i>book</i> does not imply the notion of origin when the
        term is applied to God. Hence, no parallel can be drawn.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Although in the case of creatures a book really proceeds from a
        writer, just as a word does from a speaker, nevertheless, that
        procession is not implied by <i>book</i> as it is implied by word. For
        procession from a writer is not implied any more by <i>book</i> than a
        procession from a builder is implied by <i>house.</i>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. That argument would hold if the notion of the written word belonged
        to the very notion of book. This, however, is not true. Hence, the
        argument proves nothing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. That argument holds for words that are used literally. But when words
        are used metaphorically, as <i>book is</i> used here, it is not
        necessary that the term predicated express of its subject everything
        implied by that term taken literally. Otherwise, God, who is called a
        lion in the metaphorical sense, would have to have claws and a mane.

        To appropriate means nothing else than to contract something common,
        making it something proper. Now, what is common to the entire Trinity
        cannot be appropriated to a single Person on the grounds that this
        belongs more to this Person than it does to another. Such an action
        would deny the equality of the Persons. However, appropriation may be
        made on the grounds that what is common nevertheless has a greater
        resemblance to what is proper to one person than it has to what is
        proper to another. For example, goodness resembles what is proper to the
        Holy Spirit, who proceeds as love, because goodness is the object of
        love, and so is appropriated to the Holy Spirit. Again, power is
        appropriated to the Father because power as such is a principle, and
        being the principle of all divinity is proper to the Father. Similarly,
        wisdom is appropriated to the Son, because it resembles what is proper
        to the Son, since the Son proceeds from the Father as His Word, and word
        describes an intellectual procession. Consequently, because the book of
        life pertains to knowledge, it should be appropriated to the Son.

        1. Although life is appropriated to the Holy Spirit, knowledge of life
        is appropriated to the Son; and it is this that the book of life

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The Father is called the head of the book, not because the notion of
        book has more in common with Him than with the Son, but because the Son,
        to whom the name of <i>book of life</i> is appropriated, has His origin
        from the Father.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. There is no inconsistency in something being appropriated to
        different persons if this is done under different formalities. For
        example, the gift of wisdom is appropriated to the Holy Spirit in so far
        as it is a gift, because love is the reason for all gifts, but it is
        also appropriated to the Son in so far as it is wisdom. Similarly,
        memory is appropriated to the Father in so far as it is a principle of
        understanding; but, in so far as it is a power of knowing, it is
        appropriated to the Son. Now, it is in the memory as a knowing power
        that a thing is said to be written in it. Hence, in this sense, memory
        can have the nature of a book. Consequently, being the book of life is
        appropriated more to the Son than to the Father.

        4. Although being the book of life is appropriated to the Son, this also
        belongs to the Father, since it is a property of all the Persons, not of
        only one of them. Hence, there is no inconsistency in saying that
        something is written in the Father.

        As is clear from what has been said previously,
        <i>the book of life</i> is used of God because of its resemblance to the
        document which directs a chief of state in admitting persons to and
        excluding them from citizenship. Now, this document lies between two
        operations, for it is subsequent to the decision of the head of the
        state, who selects those whom he wishes to admit in preference to those
        whom he excludes, and it is anterior to the admission or exclusion.
        Moreover, this document is merely a kind of representation of his
        antecedent decision. Similarly, the book of life is also nothing more
        than an inscription in the divine mind of God’s predestination, for by
        this act of predestining God predetermines who are to be admitted to the
        life of glory. Moreover, His knowledge of this predestination is always
        with Him; and His knowledge that He has predestined some is, as it were,
        His predestination written in Him as in a book of life.

        Considered formally, therefore, the book of life and predestination are

        but not in the same manner. Predestination regards that effect without
        any intervening medium; the book of life regards it through the medium
        of predestination. Similarly, the likenesses of things in our soul are
        direct likenesses; but the words written in a book indicate merely what
        the soul has received. Hence, a book is only mediately a sign of things.

        1. As Augustine says, the book of life is God’s knowledge. But God knows
        His own life, just as He knows that of others. Consequently, the book of
        life concerns uncreated life also.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The book of life represents life, but not created life; for what is

        predication. Now, life is predicated primarily of God rather than of
        creatures, because His life, as Dionysius has shown, is the origin of
        all life. Therefore, since <i>life is</i> used simply in the phrase
        <i>the book of life,</i> it should be understood as referring to
        uncreated life.

        Therefore He can be said to be a book with respect to the life of the

        5. Book is predicated as being in a relation to that about which the
        book is written. But the Son is written about in the book of life, foi
        we read in the Psalms (39:8): “In the head of the book it is written of
        me...” Now, the life of the Son is not created. Hence, the book of life
        is concerned with uncreated life.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. A book and the subject treated there cannot be identical in regard to
        the same thing. Now, a creature is a book revealing God. Therefore, God
        cannot be a book revealing created life. Hence, the book of life can be
        spoken of only in relation to uncreated life.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. Words, like books, pertain to knowledge. Now, Word is predicated
        primarily of the divine essence rather than of a creature, because, by
        uttering Himself, the Father utters all creatures. Consequently, the
        book of life is primarily concerned with uncreated life rather than with
        created life.

        1. According to Augustine, the book of life is predestination, However,
        predestination regards only creatures. Therefore, the book of life
        regards only creatures.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. A book represents a thing only by means of figures and likenesses.
        Now, God knows Himself, not by means of likenesses, but by means of His
        own essence. Therefore, He is not a book with respect to Himself.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        As is clear from what has been said previously, the book of life is an
        enrollment which directs the one who confers life in his bestowal of it,
        in accordance with what has been preordained concerning a certain
        person. Therefore, the life from which the book of life is named has two
        aspects. The first is that this life is acquired through someone’s
        grant; the second is that it follows upon the afore-mentioned enrollment
        which directs its being granted.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Neither of these features is found in uncreated life. God does not
        acquire His life of glory but has it by His very nature. Moreover, no
        knowledge precedes His life, but, according to our manner of
        understanding, His life precedes even His knowledge. Consequently, the
        book of life cannot be spoken of in relation to uncreated life.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Not all of God’s knowledge is called the book of life, but only that
        concerning the life which the elect are to possess. This can be gathered
        from the words that follow the section quoted.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. To represent a thing means to bear its likeness. There are two kinds
        of likenesses, however. The first kind, like the likeness in the
        practical intellect, produces a thing. Through a likeness of this kind,
        what is first can represent what is second. The second kind of likeness
        comes from the thing whose likeness it is. Through a likeness of this
        kind, what comes later represents what comes first, and not conversely.
        However, the book of life represents life, not by means of the second
        type of likeness, but by means of the first.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. What is predicated simply is sometimes understood as applying to that
        about which it is predicated only secondarily, because some
        qualification has been added. For example, <i>being</i> [with the added
        qualification] in <i>another</i> is understood as signifying an
        accident. Similarly, <i>life,</i> because of the added qualification
        <i>book</i>, is understood as signifying created life, which is life
        only secondarily.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. A figure represents its original as its principle, because a figure
        and an image are drawn from the archetype as from a principle. The book
        of life, however, represents life as something that it itself has
        caused. Now, it belongs to God the Father to be the principle of the
        Son, who is the figure of the Father, but the life of the Father cannot
        have anything as its principle. Therefore, there is no parallel between
        life and a figure.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. That text of the Psalms is understood of the Son according to His
        human nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. A cause represents its effect, and the effect its cause. This is
        clear from what has been said. Accordingly, God can be called a book
        with respect to creatures, and creatures a book with respect to God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. By the force of its own proper signification, Word does not denote
        the principle of that which is expressed by the word;
        <i>but the book of life</i> as taken here does. Hence, the two are not
        similar.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Natural life, as well as the life of glory, is represented in God’s
        knowledge. Now, God’s knowledge of the life of glory is called the book
        of life. Therefore, His knowledge of natural life should be similarly
        called.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. God’s knowledge contains all things according to the manner of life,
        because we read in John (1:3-4): “What was made, in Him was life...”
        Therefore, His knowledge should be called the book of life with respect
        to all things, especially living things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Just as a person is preordained by God’s providence to the life of
        glory, so is he also preordained to natural life. Now, as mentioned
        previously, the knowledge of those preordained to the life of glory is
        called the book of life. Therefore, the knowledge of those preordained
        to natural life also is called the book of life.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. In its explanation of that verse in the Apocalypse (3:5), “1 will not
        blot out his name out of the book of life,” the Gloss reads: “The book
        of life is God’s knowledge, in which all things are clear.’13
        Consequently, the book of life is said to concern all things, hence,
        even natural life.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. The book of life is, as it were, knowledge of the life of glory. But
        the life of glory cannot be known unless natural life is also known.
        Therefore, the book of life likewise concerns natural life.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. The word <i>life</i> has been taken from natural life and applied to
        the life of glory. Now, a thing is said more truly of that of which it
        is said properly than of that to which it is merely applied. Therefore,
        the book of life concerns natural life more than it concerns the life of
        glory.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. What is more permanent and common is more noble. Now, natural life is
        more permanent than the life of glory or of grace. Similarly, it is more
        common, because natural life continues with the life of grace or of
        glory; but the opposite is not true. Therefore, natural life is more
        noble than the life of grace and glory. Hence, the book of life concerns
        the life of nature more than it concerns the life of grace or of glory.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. As Augustine says, the book of life is, in a sense, predestination.
        But predestination does not concern natural life. Hence, neither does
        the book of life.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The book of life concerns the life which is given by God directly.
        Natural life, however, is given by God through the medium of natural
        causes. Therefore, the book of life is not about natural life.

        The book of life, as mentioned previously, is that knowledge which
        directs the giver of life in His bestowal of it. Now, when we give
        anything, we need no direction unless it is necessary to separate those
        to whom bestowal is to be made from those to whom it is not to be made.
        Hence, the book of life concerns only that life which is to be granted
        by choice. Natural life, however, like all other natural goods, is
        supplied to all in general, according to each one’s capacity. The book
        of life, therefore, does not concern natural life but only that life
        which, according to a choice made by God’s will, is given to some and
        not to others.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Although natural life and the life of glory are represented in God’s
        knowledge, His knowledge of natural life does not fulfill the notion of
        the book of life as does His knowledge of the life of glory for the
        reason given.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The book of life gets its name, not from the fact that it has life,
        but because it is a book about the life to which some are preordained by
        God’s election, and because the names of these persons are written down
        in it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. In His providence, God gives life to some as a thing due to their
        nature, but He grants the life of glory only according to the good
        pleasure of His will. Consequently, He gives natural life to everything
        which can receive it, but not the life of glory. Hence, there is no book
        of natural life as there is a book of the life of glory.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The Gloss is not to be understood as meaning that all things are
        clear—that is, all things are contained—in the book of life. It means,
        rather, that all which is written in it is clear, that is, all is
        determined.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. The book of life implies, as has been said, not only knowledge of the
        life of glory but also God’s choice—not, however, with respect to merely
        natural life.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. The life of glory is less known to us than natural life is.
        Consequently, we come to know the life of glory after knowing natural
        life. Similarly, we name the life of glory from natural life, even
        though more of the nature of life belongs to the life of glory than
        belongs to natural life. This is true of all the names that we give God
        which are taken from creatures. Consequently, when the word
        <i>life is</i> used by itself, it need not be understood as necessarily
        referring to natural life.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. The life of glory, taken by itself, is more permanent than natural
        life, because it makes natural life stable. Accidentally, however,
        natural life is more permanent than the life of grace; that is, it is
        more closely related to the living thing, to which natural life, but not
        the life of glory, is due by reason of its essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Moreover, while natural life is more common in one sense than the life
        of glory, in another sense it is less common. For a thing is said to be
        common in two senses. First, it is said to be common through effect or
        predication; that is, it is found in many things according to one
        intelligible character. In this sense, that which is more common is not
        more noble but more imperfect, as animal is, which is more common than
        man. Now, it is in this sense that natural life is more common than the
        life of glory. Second, a thing is said to be common after the manner of
        a cause; that is, it resembles a cause which, while remaining
        numerically one, extends to many effects. In this sense, what is more
        common is more noble. For example, the preservation of a city is more
        noble than the preservation of a family. In this sense, natural life is
        not more common.,than the life of glory.

        is found in a nobler manner in the cause. Now, glory is the effect of
        grace. Consequently, the life of grace is more noble than the life of
        glory. Hence, the book of life concerns the life of grace more than it
        does the life of glory.

        2. As mentioned earlier, the book of life is the enrollment of those who
        are predestined. But predestination, in general, is the preparation of
        grace and glory. Therefore, the book of life concerns, in general, the
        life of grace as well as the life of glory.

        3. The book of life designates certain persons as citizens of that city
        in which there is life. But, just as some are made citizens of the
        heavenly Jerusalem through the life of glory, so some are made citizens
        of the Church militant through the life of grace. Therefore, the book of
        life concerns the life of grace as well as the life of glory.

        4. What is predicated of many is understood as predicated without

        mentioned, it is understood as referring to the life of grace.

        of life without qualification; it is written there only in a certain
        respect, namely, in so far as he is in the state of grace. Therefore,

        <i>The book of life</i> means the enrollment of someone who will obtain
        life as a kind of reward and possession, for men of this sort are
        customarily enrolled in something. Now, a thing is said to be a
        possession, properly speaking, when it can be had at one’s command; and
        such a thing has no defects. Consequently, the Philosopher says that
        knowledge had about God “is not a human possession” but divine, because
        only God knows Himself perfectly, while man’s knowledge of God is
        necessarily defective. Thus, life will be had as a possession when
        through life all the defects opposed to life are excluded. Now, this is
        what the life of glory does; it excludes all death, spiritual as well as
        physical, so that there remains not even the possibility of dying. The
        life of grace does not do this. Consequently, the book of life does not
        concern the life of grace without qualification, but only the life of
        glory.

        1. Certain causes are more noble than their effects, namely, the
        efficient, formal, and final causes. Hence, what exists in these causes
        exists in a more noble manner than what exists in their effects. On the
        other hand, matter is less perfect than its effects. Consequently, a
        thing exists in a material cause in a less noble manner than it does in
        the effect of this cause; for in matter it is incomplete and potential,
        but in the effect of the material cause its existence is actual.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Now, every disposition that prepares a subject to receive a perfection
        can be reduced to the material cause; and it is in this way that grace
        is the cause of glory. Consequently, life exists in glory in a more
        noble way than it does in grace.

        2. Predestination does not concern grace except as grace is ordained to

        3. Although those who possess the life of grace are citizens of the
        Church militant, the condition of the Church militant is not one in
        which life is possessed fully, because the possibility of dying still
        remains. Hence, the book of life is not spoken of in relation to these
        individuals.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Although in the line of generation, the life of grace is prior to the
        life of glory, nevertheless, in the line of perfection the life of glory
        is prior—just as the end is prior to the means to the end.

        1. In its comment on Luke (10:20), “Rejoice in this, that your names are
        written...,” the Gloss reads: “By means of his heavenly or earthly
        deeds, a person is, as it were, engraved on God’s memory forever.”’ Now,
        just as a person is ordained to life through heavenly deeds, that is,
        through works of justice, so is he also ordained to death through
        earthly deeds, that is, through works of sin. Hence, as there is in God
        an enrollment of those ordained to life, so is there also in Him an
        enrollment of those ordained to death. Consequently, just as there is
        said to be a book of life in God, so should there also be said to be in
        Him a book of death.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The book of life is said to be in God only inasmuch as He has a list
        of those for whom He has prepared an eternal reward—a list resembling
        that which a ruler on earth has, containing the names of those whom he
        has decided to honor. But a ruler on earth has a list of punishments and
        tortures as well as a list of honors and rewards. Therefore, God also
        has a book of death.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. just as God knows the predestination by which He prepares some for
        life, so does He also know His reprobation by which He prepares others
        for death. Now, the knowledge which God has of His predestination is
        called the book of life, as mentioned earlier. Therefore, His knowledge
        of reprobation should be called the book of death.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        According to Dionysius, “We should not venture to say anything about God
        unless we can support what we are saying from Scripture.” Now, we do not
        find anything in Scripture that refers to a book of death as it refers
        to the book of life. Therefore, we should not affirm the existence of a
        book of death.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        A person’s knowledge about matters written in a book is superior to his
        knowledge of other matters. Hence, in connection with God’s knowledge of
        things, the term <i>book</i> is used of knowledge that is superior in
        kind to His knowledge of other truths.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Now, there are two kinds of knowledge in God, namely, knowledge of
        simple understanding and knowledge of approval. His knowledge of simple
        understanding concerns all things, both the good and the evil; but His
        knowledge of approval concerns only the good. Hence, the good are known
        to God in a more special way than the others; and for this reason they
        are said to be written in a book, while the evil are not. Consequently,
        a book of death is not spoken of as the book of life is.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Some explain “heavenly deeds” as meaning the labors of the
        contemplative life, and “earthly deeds” as meaning the labors of the
        active life. If a person performs one or the other, however, he is
        enrolled for life and not for death. Therefore, both enrollments pertain
        to the book of life and neither to a book of death. Others understand
        “earthly deeds” as meaning works of sin, which, taken by themselves,
        simply ordain a person to death, although he may, for another reason, be
        ordained to life inasmuch as he may rise again after his fall, more
        cautious and humble.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        One might also answer—and this is the better explanation—that when a
        thing is said to be known by means of some other thing, this statement
        can be understood in two ways. First, <i>by means of</i> may signify the
        cause of the knowledge on the part of the knower. This cannot be its
        meaning in the Gloss, however, because the works one does’ whether they
        be good or bad, are not a cause of God’s foreknowledge ‘ of His
        predestination, or of His eternal reprobation. Second,
        <i>by means of</i> may signify the cause on the part of what is known.
        This is its meaning in the Gloss. For a person is engraved on God’s
        memory by means of the works he has done, not because his works of the
        kind described are the cause of God’s knowing him, but because God knows
        that on account of these works he will possess life or death.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is clear from this that the Gloss is not speaking of that enrollment
        for life which pertains to the book of life and is on the part of God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Things are written in a book so that they may be known forever. Men
        who are punished, however, are kept by their very punishments from being
        known by other men. Hence, their names are written down only.
        temporarily until the time when their punishment is inflicted upon them.
        But those who are thought worthy of honors and rewards have their names
        written down unconditionally in order that they may be kept, as it were,
        in everlasting memory.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. God does not have a special knowledge of the reprobate as He has of
        the predestined. Hence, no comparison can be made.
