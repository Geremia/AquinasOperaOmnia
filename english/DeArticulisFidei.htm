      <h3>THE SACRAMENTS OF THE CHURCH</h3>
    </center>
    <p>
      We shall now consider the Sacraments of the Church. We shall treat them
      under one heading, since they all pertain to the effect of grace. First of
      all, that must be known which St. Augustine wrote in the tenth book of
      "The City of God": "a Sacrament is a sacred thing" or "the sign of a
      sacred thing." <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#1">[1]</a> Even in the Old
      Law there were certain sacraments, that is, signs of a sacred thingâ€”for
      example, the paschal lamb and other legal sacred signs or "sacraments"
      which, however, did not cause grace but only signified or indicated the
      grace of Christ. The Apostle calls these "sacraments" "weak and needy
      elements." <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#2">[2]</a> They were needy
      because they did not contain grace, and they were weak because they could
      not confer grace. In them, as St. Augustine says, the merits of Christ
      brought about salvation in a more hidden manner under the cover of visible
      things. The Sacraments of the New Law, on the other hand, both contain
      grace and confer it. A Sacrament of the New Law is a visible form of
      invisible grace. Thus, the exterior washing which takes place when the
      water is poured in Baptism represents that interior cleansing which takes
      away sin by virtue of the Sacrament of Baptism.
      <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#3">[3]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      There are seven Sacraments of the New Law: Baptism, Confirmation, the
      Eucharist, Penance, Extreme Unction, Orders, and Matrimony. The first five
      of these Sacraments are intended to bring about the perfection of the
      individual man in himself; whereas the other two, Orders and Matrimony,
      are so constituted that they perfect and multiply the entire Church.
    </p>
    <p><b>THE SPIRITUAL AND THE PHYSICAL LIFE: AN ANALOGY</b></p>
    <p>
      The spiritual life conforms to the physical life. In the physical life man
      is perfected in three chief ways: first, by generation, in that he is born
      into this world; secondly, by growth, through which he is brought up into
      stature and perfect strength; thirdly, by food which sustains man's life
      and powers. This would suffice were it not that man is attacked by
      illnesses, and hence, fourthly, he needs something which will bring him
      back to health.
    </p>
    <p>
      This also holds true in the spiritual life. First, man needs regeneration
      or re-birth which is brought through the Sacrament of Baptism: "Unless a
      man be born again of water and the Holy Spirit, he cannot enter into the
      kingdom of God." <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#4">[4]</a> Secondly, it is
      necessary that man develop perfect strength, which is, as it were, a
      spiritual growth, and this indeed comes to him in the Sacrament of
      Confirmation. This is like the strengthening which the Apostles received
      when the Holy Spirit came upon them and confirmed them. The Lord had said
      to them: "But stay you in the city of Jerusalem till you be endued with
      power from on high." <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#5">[5]</a> The third
      similarity is that man must be fed with spiritual food: "Unless you eat
      the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink His blood, you shall not have life
      in you." <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#6">[6]</a> Fourthly, man must be
      healed spiritually through the Sacrament of Penance: "Heal, O Lord, my
      soul, for I have sinned against You."
      <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#7">[7]</a> Lastly, one is healed both in
      soul and in body in the Sacrament of Extreme Unction: "Is any man sick
      among you? Let him bring in the priests of the church, and let them pray
      over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer
      of faith shall save the sick man, and the Lord shall raise him up, and if
      he be in sins, they shall be forgiven him."
      <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#8">[8]</a> Two of the Sacraments, Orders and
      Matrimony, are instituted for the common good of the Church. Through the
      Sacrament of Orders the Church is ruled and is spiritually multiplied; and
      through Matrimony it is increased physically in numbers.
      <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#9">[9]</a>
    </p>
    <p><b>THE SEVEN SACRAMENTS IN GENERAL</b></p>
    <p>
      The seven Sacraments have some things which they all hold in common, and
      some things which are proper to each one. That which is common to all the
      Sacraments is that they confer grace. It is also common to all the
      Sacraments that a Sacrament is made up of words and physical acts. And so
      also Christ, who is the Author of the Sacraments, is the Word made flesh.
      And just as the flesh of Christ was sanctified, and has the power of
      sanctifying because of the Word united to itself, so also the Sacraments
      are made holy and have the power of sanctifying through the words which
      accompany the action. Thus, St. Augustine says: "The word is joined to the
      element, and the Sacrament is made."
      <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#10">[10]</a> Now, the words by which the
      Sacraments are sanctified are called the form of the Sacraments; and the
      things which are sanctified are called the matter of the Sacraments.
      Water, for example, is the matter of Baptism, and the holy chrism is the
      matter of Confirmation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In each Sacrament there is required a minister, who confers the Sacrament
      with the intention of doing that which the Church intends. If any one of
      these three requirements is lacking, the Sacrament is not brought into
      being, viz., if there is lacking the due form of the words, or if the
      matter is not present, or if the minister does not intend to confer the
      Sacrament. <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#11">[11]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect of the Sacrament is likewise impeded through the fault of the
      recipient, for example, if one feigns to receive it and with a heart
      unprepared to receive worthily. Such a one, although he actually receives
      the Sacrament, does not receive the effect of the Sacrament, that is, the
      grace of the Holy Spirit. "For the Holy Spirit of discipline will flee
      from the deceitful." <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#12">[12]</a> On the
      other hand, however, there are some who never even receive sacramentally,
      yet who receive the effect of the Sacrament because of their devotion
      towards the Sacrament, which they may have in desire or in a vow.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are some things which are characteristic of each individual
      Sacrament. Certain ones impress a character on the soul which is a certain
      spiritual sign distinct from the other Sacraments. Such are the Sacraments
      of Orders, Baptism, and Confirmation. The Sacraments which give a
      character are never repeated in the same person who has once received it.
      Thus, he who is baptized need never again receive this Sacrament; neither
      can he who has been confirmed receive Confirmation again; and one who has
      been ordained need never repeat his ordination. The reason is that the
      character which each of these Sacraments impresses is indelible.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the other Sacraments, however, a character is not impressed on the
      recipient, and hence they can be repeated as far as the person is
      concerned, not however as far as the matter is concerned. Thus, one can
      frequently receive Penance, frequently receive the Eucharist, and can be
      anointed more than once with Extreme Unction, and likewise he can be
      married more than once. Yet, regarding the matter, the same Host cannot be
      frequently consecrated, nor ought the oil of the sick be frequently
      blessed. <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#13">[13]</a>
    </p>
    <h3>BAPTISM</h3>
    <p>
      Having considered the Sacraments in general, it is now necessary to say
      something about each one in particular. First, we consider Baptism, of
      which it must be known that the matter of this Sacrament is natural water,
      and it makes no difference whether it is cold or warm. In artificial
      waters, however, such as rose water, one cannot baptize. The form of
      Baptism is: "I baptize You in the name of the Father and of the Son and of
      the Holy Spirit." The minister of Baptism ordinarily is the priest, whose
      office it is to baptize. In case of necessity, however, not only a deacon
      but also any lay person, even a pagan or a heretic, can baptize as long as
      he observes the form specified by the Church, and intends to act according
      to the intention of the Church. If a person is baptized by these not in a
      case of necessity, he received the Sacrament and must not again be
      baptized; but the grace of the Sacrament is not received, because such
      persons are not truly deputed to baptize outside of cases of necessity,
      and, hence, they act contrary to the law of the Church regulating
      reception of the Sacraments. <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#14">[14]</a>
    </p>
    <p><b>THE EFFECT OF BAPTISM</b></p>
    <p>
      The effect of Baptism is to remit both original and actual sin as well as
      all guilt and punishment which they incur. No kind of punishment must be
      enjoined for past sins upon those just newly baptized. Hence, those who
      die immediately after Baptism are admitted to the glory of God without
      delay. The effect, therefore, of Baptism is the opening of the gates of
      paradise.
    </p>
    <p><b>ERRORS CONCERNING BAPTISM</b></p>
    <p>
      There have been certain errors concerning this Sacrament. The first was
      that of the Solentiani, who received a baptism not of water but of the
      spirit. Against them the Lord says: "Unless a man be born again of water
      and the Holy Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God."
      <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#15">[15]</a> The second error was that of
      the Donatists, who re-baptized those who had been baptized by the
      Catholics. Against them it is written: "One faith, one baptism."
      <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#16">[16]</a> They also err in holding that a
      man in the state of sin cannot baptize. Against them it is said: "He upon
      whom you see the Spirit descending, and remaining upon Him, He it is who
      baptizes." <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#17">[17]</a> It is thus seen that
      a minister who is himself evil does not invalidate either this or any of
      the other Sacraments, because it is Christ who, by the merits of His
      passion, gives to each Sacrament its efficacy; and He is good. The fourth
      error is that of the Pelagians who say that children must be baptized
      because by their regeneration they, as adopted children of God, are
      admitted into the kingdom, but by this regeneration they are not freed
      from original sin.
    </p>
    <h3>CONFIRMATION</h3>
    <p>
      The second Sacrament is Confirmation. The matter of this Sacrament is
      chrism made from oil, which signifies the bright lustre of conscience, and
      from balsam, which signifies the odor of a good name; both of which are
      blessed by the bishop. The form of this Sacrament is: "I sign You with the
      sign of the cross, and I confirm You with the chrism of salvation, in the
      name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen."
      <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#18">[18]</a> The minister of this Sacrament
      is solely the bishop. <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#19">[19]</a> It is not
      licit for a priest to anoint on the forehead with chrism those who are to
      be confirmed. <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#20">[20]</a>
    </p>
    <p><b>THE EFFECT OF CONFIRMATION</b></p>
    <p>
      The effect of Confirmation is that the Holy Spirit is imparted to give
      strength, just as He was given to the Apostles on the day of Pentecost.
      Thus, the Christian must boldly confess the name of Christ. The one who is
      confirmed is anointed on the forehead wherein is the seat of fear; so that
      he will not blush to confess either the name of Christ or especially the
      cross of Christ, which to the Jews was a scandal and to the pagans
      foolishness. For this reason he is signed with the sign of the cross.
    </p>
    <p><b>ERRORS CONCERNING CONFIRMATION</b></p>
    <p>
      Certain of the Greeks erred concerning this Sacrament in saying that it
      could be administered by one who is only a priest. Against this it is said
      that the Apostles sent the Apostles Peter and John to impose hands upon
      those who had been baptized by Philip the deacon, and they received the
      Holy Spirit. Now, the bishops of the Church are in the places of the
      Apostles, and in their place also do they impose hands when the Sacrament
      of Confirmation is administered.
    </p>
    <h3>THE HOLY EUCHARIST</h3>
    <p>
      The third Sacrament is the Holy Eucharist. Its matter is wheaten bread and
      wine from the grape mixed with a little water so that the water becomes
      part of the wine. The water signifies the faithful who are incorporated
      into Christ. Other than wheaten bread and wine from the grape cannot be
      the matter for this Sacrament. The form of this Sacrament is the very
      words of Christ, "This is My Body," and "This is the chalice of My Blood
      of the new and eternal testament; the mystery of faith; which shall be
      shed for you and for many, to the remission of sins." These words spoken
      by the priest in the person of Christ brings into being this Sacrament.
      The minister of this Sacrament is the priest; and no one else can
      consecrate this matter into the Body of Christ.
    </p>
    <p><b>THE EFFECT OF THE EUCHARIST</b></p>
    <p>
      The effect of this Sacrament is twofold: first, in the very consecration
      of the Sacrament, since in virtue of the above words bread is changed into
      the Body of Christ, and wine into His Blood; so that Christ is entirely
      contained under the appearances of bread which remain without a subject;
      and Christ is entirely contained under the appearances of wine. And,
      moreover, under each part of the consecrated Host and of the consecrated
      wine, Christ is totally present even after the separation is made.
      <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#21">[21]</a> The second effect of this
      Sacrament brought about in the soul of one who worthily receives is the
      union of man with Christ, as He himself says: "He who eats My Flesh, and
      drinks My Blood, abides in Me, and I in him."
      <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#22">[22]</a> And since man is incorporated
      with Christ and united to His members through grace, it follows that
      through this Sacrament grace is increased in those who receive it
      worthily. Thus, therefore, in this Sacrament there is that which is the
      Sacrament alone ("sacramentum tantum"), that is, the species of bread and
      wine; and that which is known as the "res et sacramentum," that is, the
      true Body of Christ; and that which is the "res tantum," that is the unity
      of the Mystical Body, that is, the Church which this Sacrament both
      signifies and causes. <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#23">[23]</a>
    </p>
    <p><b>ERRORS CONCERNING THE EUCHARIST</b></p>
    <p>
      There have been many errors regarding this Sacrament. The first error is
      of those who say that in this Sacrament is not the true Body of Christ but
      only a sign of it. The author of this error is said to be Berengarius
      against whom it is written: "For My Flesh is meat indeed; and My Blood is
      drink indeed." <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#24">[24]</a> The second is
      the error of the Arrodinici, who offer in their sacrament bread and cheese
      because they say men at first made offerings of the fruits of the earth
      and of their flocks. Against this, however, stands the fact that the Lord
      who is the institutor of this Sacrament gave to His disciples bread and
      wine. The third is the error of the Cataphrygae and the Praeputiati, who
      drew the blood of an infant from tiny punctures in its body, and mixing
      this with flour made a bread of it; and thus asserted that they
      consecrated the sacrament. This is more like the sacrifices of demons than
      that of Christ: "And they shed innocent blood... which they sacrificed to
      the idols of Chanaan." <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#25">[25]</a> The
      fourth is the error of the Aquarii, who offer water only in their
      sacrifices. But against this are the words from the mouth of Wisdom, which
      is Christ: "Drink the wine which I have mingled for you."
      <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#26">[26]</a> Another error is that of the
      Poor People of Lyons who hold that any just man can consecrate this
      Sacrament. Against such errors is the fact that the Lord gave to the
      Apostles the power to celebrate this Sacrament; and hence only those who
      receive this power in a certain succession from the Apostles can
      consecrate this Sacrament.
    </p>
    <h3>PENANCE</h3>
    <p>
      The fourth Sacrament is Penance. The matter,
      <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#27">[27]</a> as it were, of this Sacrament
      is the acts of the penitent, which are called the three parts of Penance.
      The first part is a heart-felt contrition, by which one is sorry for the
      sins one has committed, and determines not to sin again. The second part
      is confession, which consists in this that the sinner confesses all the
      sins of which he is mindful to the priest; and all of them at one time to
      one priest, not dividing them to a number of priests. The third part is
      satisfaction, which is enjoined according to the judgment of the priest;
      and consists especially in fasting and prayer and almsgiving.
    </p>
    <p>
      The form of this Sacrament is the words of absolution which the priest
      speaks when he says: "I absolve You" ("Ego te absolvo"). The minister of
      this Sacrament is the priest having authority to absolve, which is either
      ordinary or by commission of his superior. The effect of this Sacrament is
      absolution from sin. <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#28">[28]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Concerning this Sacrament is the error of the Novati, who say that any one
      who has sinned after having been baptized cannot receive pardon through
      the Sacrament of Penance. Against this are the words: "Be mindful
      therefore from where you have fallen; and do penance, and do the first
      works." <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#29">[29]</a>
    </p>
    <h3>EXTREME UNCTION</h3>
    <p>
      The fifth Sacrament is Extreme Unction. Its matter is olive oil blessed by
      the bishop. This Sacrament should only be received by those who are in
      danger of death through sickness. They are to be anointed in the places of
      the five senses: that is, on the eyes, because it is the organ of the
      sense of sight; on the ears, because of hearing; on the nostrils, because
      of smell; on the lips, because of taste or speech; and on the hands
      because of touch, and on the feet because of walking.
      <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#30">[30]</a> The form of this Sacrament is
      this: "Through this anointing and through His most divine mercy, may the
      Lord forgive You whatever thou hast committed through sight" (and so on
      for the other senses). The minister of this Sacrament is the priest. The
      effect of this Sacrament is a medicine for both mind and body.
      <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#31">[31]</a> Concerning this Sacrament is
      the error of the Elaeonitae, who are said to anoint their dying with oil
      and balsam and water and to accompany the anointing with invocations in
      Hebrew pronounced over the head of the sick. This is, however, contrary to
      the form handed down by St. James, as given above.
    </p>
    <h3>HOLY ORDERS</h3>
    <p>
      The sixth Sacrament is Holy Orders. There are seven orders: priesthood,
      deaconate, subdeaconate, acolyte, exorcist, lector, and porter. Tonsure
      (clerk-ship, clericatus) is not an order, but a formal profession of
      giving one's life to the divine ministry. The episcopate is rather a
      dignity than an order. <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#32">[32]</a> The
      matter of this Sacrament is that matter which is handed over to the
      candidate at the conferring of the order. Thus, priesthood is conferred by
      the handing over of the chalice, and so each order is conferred by the
      handing over of that matter which in a special way pertains to the
      ministry of that particular order. The form of this Sacrament is this:
      "Receive the power to offer sacrifice in the Church for the living and the
      dead." And similarly power is conferred in the other orders. The minister
      of this Sacrament is the bishop who confers the orders. The effect of this
      Sacrament is an increase of grace for the performance of the duties of a
      worthy minister of Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      Concerning this Sacrament was the error of Arius, who taught that the
      priesthood could not be distinguished from the episcopate.
    </p>
    <h3>MATRIMONY</h3>
    <p>
      Matrimony is the seventh Sacrament. It is a sign of the union between
      Christ and the Church. The efficient cause of Matrimony is the mutual
      consent expressed in words effective in the present by the parties.
      <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#33">[33]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Matrimony has a threefold good. The first is the birth of children and the
      educating of them to the worship of God. The second is that fidelity which
      one must render to the other; and the third is that it is a Sacrament, or,
      in other words, the indivisibility of Matrimony which shows forth the
      indivisible union of Christ and His Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Concerning Matrimony there are a number of errors. The first is that of
      Tatian, who condemned marriage, and against such it is written: "If thou
      take a wife, thou hast not sinned."
      <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#34">[34]</a> The second error is that of
      Jovinian, who made marriage equal to virginity. The third is that of the
      Nicolaitae, who mutually exchange their wives. There were also many other
      heretics who taught and worked impurities, and against which are the words
      of St. Paul: "Marriage honorable in all, and the bed undefiled."
      <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#35">[35]</a>
    </p>
    <h3>SEVEN GIFTS OF ETERNAL GLORY</h3>
    <p>
      By the reception of these Sacraments, man is led to future eternal glory
      which consists in seven gifts, three of the soul and four of the body. The
      first gift given to the soul is the vision of God in His essence,
      according to the words: "We shall see Him as He is."
      <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#36">[36]</a> The second gift is
      comprehension, or that understanding of God as the reward of our merits:
      "So run that you may obtain."
      <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#37">[37]</a> The third is perfect enjoyment,
      wherein we shall have full happiness in God: "Then shall you abound in
      delights of the Almighty, and shall lift up your face to God."
      <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#38">[38]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The first gift which shall be enjoyed by the body is that of
      impassibility, <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#39">[39]</a> for "this
      corruptible must put on incorruption."
      <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#40">[40]</a> The second gift is brilliancy:

        amongst those things which have been instituted as signs. It makes known
        to us by a certain appearance and resemblance that which God by His
        invisible power, accomplishes in our souls... In order to explain more
        fully the nature of a Sacrament it should be taught that it is a thing
        subject to the senses which possesses, by divine institution, the power
        not only of signifying holiness and justice, but also to impart both to
        the recipient. Hence, it is easy to see that the images of the Saints,
        crosses, and the like, although they are signs of sacrcd things, cannot
        be called Sacraments. Thus, the solemn ablution of the body [in Baptism]
        not only signifies, but also has the power to effect a sacred thing
        which is worked interiorly in the soul by the invisible operation of the
        Holy Spirit" ("Roman Catechism," "Sacraments in General," Chapter I, 6

        that the 'sensible thing' which enters into the definition of a
        Sacrament as already given, although constituting but one sign, is of a
        twofold nature. Every Sacrament consists of two things: 'matter' which
        is called the element, and 'form' which is commonly called the word...
        In order to make the meaning of the rite that is being performed easier
        and clearer, words had to be added to the matter. Water for example, has
        the quality of cooling as well as of making clean, and may e symbolic of
        either. In Baptism, therefore, unless the words were added, it would not
        be certain which meaning of the sign was intended. When the words are
        added, we immediately understand that the Sacrament possesses and
        signifies the power of cleansing... Although God is the author and
        dispenser of the Sacraments, He nevertheless willed that they should be
        administered by men in His Church, not by Angels. The ministers of the
        Sacraments, in performing their duties, do not act in their own persons
        but in that they represent Christ, and hence, be they good or bad, they
        validly confer the Sacraments as long as they make use of the matter and
        the form always observed in the Catholic Church according to the
        institution of Christ, and intend to do what the Church does in the
        administration of the Sacraments" ("Roman Catechism," "loc. cit.," 16
        and 24).</a

        perform a sacred act, and distinguishes us by some mark one from
        another. This is seen for example, in Baptism, whose character first
        renders one qualified to recieve the other Sacraments, and, secondly, by
        it the Christian is distinguished from those who do not profess the
        faith" ("Roman Catechism," "loc. cit.," 31).</a

        necessity, however, anyone who observes the proper form and intention
        can baptize validly but not licitly; and an adult who permits himself to
        be baptized without necessity by a layman would be acting illicitly, but
        the baptism is valid. For such conduct places an "obex" (obstacle or
        hindrance) to the reception of grace. The grace of the Sacrament is
        revived ("reviviscitur") with at least contrition, and probably
        attrition, or simply by an act of perfect contrition.</a

        entire, under either species that, as under the species of bread are
        contained not only the body but also the blood and Christ entire, so in
        like manner under the species of wine are truly contained not only the
        blood, but also the body and Christ entire. These are matters on which
        the faithful cannot entertain a doubt. Wisely, however, was it ordained
        that two distinct consecrations should take place. They represent in a
        more lively manner the Passion of Our Lord, in which His blood was
        separated from His body; and hence in the form of consecration we
        commemorate the shedding of His blood. Again, since the Sacrament is to
        be used by us as the food and nourishment of our souls, it was most
        appropriate that it should be instituted as food and drink, two things
        which obviously constitute the complete sustenance of man.<br />
        "Nor should it be forgotten that Christ is, whole and entire. contained
        not only under either species, but also in each particle of either
        species. 'Each,' says St. Augustine, 'receives Christ the Lord, and He
        is entire in each portion. He is not diminished by being given to many,
        but gives Himself whole and entire to each' (cited in Gratian, 'De
        consecratione,' dist. 2). This is also an obvious inference from the
        narrative of the Evangelists. It is not to be supposed that Our Lord
        consecrated the bread used at the Last Supper in separate parts,
        applying the form particularly to each, but that all the bread then used
        for the sacred mysteries was consecrated at the same time and with the
        same form, and in a quantity sufficient for all the Apostles. That the
        consecration of the chalice was performed in this manner, is clear from
        these words of the Saviour: 'Take and divide it among you' (Luke, xxii,
        17)" ("Roman Catechism," "The Eucharist," 35-36).</a

        united as living members to His Body. For it is written, 'He that eateth

        give is My flesh for the life of the world' (John, vi. 58)... For the

        ("Penance," 13) follows this teaching. "The faithful should be
        especially informed on the matter of this Sacrament. That it differs
        from the other Sacraments in that for them the matter is something,
        whether natural or artificial; the matter as it were (quasi-materia) of
        Penance is the acts of the penitent, i.e., contrition confession, and
        satisfaction. This has thus been defined by the Council of Trent... It
        is not because they are not the real matter that they are called by the
        Council the matter as it were, but because they are not of that sort of
        matter which is applied externally, such, for instance, as water in
        Baptism and chrism in Confirmation."</a

        to receive the grace of this Sacrament with the greatest possible
        devotion. The form is: 'I absolve You,' as may be inferred not only from
        the words: 'Whatsoever you shall bind upon earth shall be bound also in
        heaven' (Matt., xviii. 18), but also from the teaching of Christ Our
        Lord, handed down to us by the Apostles... The minister of the Sacrament
        of Penance must be a priest possessing ordinary or delegated
        jurisdiction, as is evident in the law of the Church. Whoever performs
        this sacred duty must be invested not only with the powers of orders,
        but also with that of jurisdiction. We have greatest proof of this
        ministry in the words of Our Lord: 'Whose sins you shall forgive, they
        are forgiven them; and whose sins you shall retain, they are retained'
        John, xx. 23). These words were not addressed to all, but only to the
        Apostles, who are succeeded in this ministry by priests" ("Roman
        Catechism," loc. cit., 54).</a

        considering the various offices that are necessary for the celebration
        of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass and the administration of the Blessed
        Sacrament. This is the chief scope of their institution. They are
        divided into major or sacred orders (priesthood, deaconship.
        subdeaconship) and minor orders... The bishops are placed over the
        various dioceses to govern, not only the other ministers of the Church,
        but also the faithful, and to promote their salvation with supreme care
        and diligence." Roman Catechism," "Holy Order," 26). It is the common

        because without the consent and the contract, the obligation and the
        bond cannot exist... God Himself instituted marriage, and, as the
        Council of Trent declares, He made it perpetual and indissoluble. 'What
        God hath joined together, let no man put asunder,' said Our Lord (Matt.,
        xix. 6). It belongs to marriage as a natural contract to be
        indissoluble; but, above all, its indissolubility arises from its nature
        as a Sacrament. This sacramental character raises marriage to the
        highest perfection. Moreover, dissolubility of marriage is immediately
        contrary to the proper education of children and to the other advantages
        of marriage. Holy Scripture frequently proposed to us the divine union
        of Christ and His Church under the figure of marriage" ("Roman
