    <h2>EXPLANATION OF THE LORD'S PRAYER</h2>
  </center>
  <h3>FIVE QUALITIES OF PRAYER</h3>
  <p>
    "Our Father who art in heaven." Among all other prayers, the Lord's Prayer
    holds the chief place. It has five excellent qualities which are required in
    all prayer. A prayer must be confident, ordered, suitable, devout and
    humble.
  </p>
  <p>
    It must be confident: "Let us, therefore, go with confidence to the throne
    of grace."[1] It must not be wanting in faith, as it is said: "But let him
    ask in faith, nothing wavering."[2] That this is a most trustworthy prayer
    is reasonable, since it was formed by Him who is our Advocate and the most
    wise Petitioner for us: "In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and
    knowledge;"[3] and of whom it is said: "For we have an advocate with the
    Father, Jesus Christ the just one."[4] Hence, St. Cyprian says: "Since we
    have Christ as our Advocate with the Father for our sins, when we pray on
    account of our faults, we use the very words of our Advocate."[5]
  </p>
  <p>
    Furthermore, this prayer is even more worthy of confidence in that He who
    taught us how to pray, graciously hears our prayer together with the Father,
    as it is said in the Psalm: "He shall cry to Me, and I will hear him."[6]
    Thus writes St. Cyprian: "It is a friendly, familiar, and devout prayer to
    ask of the Lord in His own words."[7] And so no one goes away from this
    prayer without fruit. St. Augustine says that through it our venial sins are
    remitted.[8]
  </p>
  <p>
    Moreover, our prayer must be suitable, so that a person asks of God in
    prayer what is good for him. St. John Damascene says: "Prayer is the asking
    of what is right and fitting from God."[9] Many times our prayer is not
    heard because we seek that which is not good for us: "You ask and you do not
    receive, because you ask amiss."[10] To know, indeed, what one ought to pray
    for is most difficult; for it is not easy to know what one ought to desire.
    Those things which we rightly seek in prayer are rightly desired; hence the
    Apostle says: "For we know not what we should pray for as we ought."[11]
    Christ Himself is our Teacher; it is He who teaches us what we ought to pray
    for, and it was to Him that the disciples said: "Lord, teach us to
    pray."[12] Those things, therefore, which He has taught us to pray for, we
    most properly ask for. "Whatsoever words we use in prayer," says St.
    Augustine, "we cannot but utter that which is contained in our Lord's
    Prayer, if we pray in a suitable and worthy manner."[13]
  </p>
  <p>
    Our prayer ought also to be ordered as our desires should be ordered, for
    prayer is but the expression of desire. Now, it is the correct order that we
    prefer spiritual to bodily things, and heavenly things to those merely
    earthly. This is according to what is written: "Seek ye first therefore the
    kingdom of God and His justice, and all these things shall be added unto
    you."[14] Here Our Lord shows that heavenly things must be sought first, and
    then things material.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our prayer must be devout, because a rich measure of piety makes the
    sacrifice of prayer acceptable to God: "In Thy name I will lift up my hands.
    Let my soul be filled with marrow and fatness."[15] Many times because of
    the length of our prayers our devotion grows cool; hence Our Lord taught us
    to avoid wordiness in our prayers: "When you are praying, speak not
    much."[16] And St. Augustine says: "Let much talking be absent from prayer;
    but as long as fervor continues, let prayer likewise go on."[17] For this
    reason the Lord made His Prayer short. Devotion in prayer rises from charity
    which is our love of God and neighbor, both of which are evident in this
    prayer. Our love for God is seen in that we call God "our Father;" and our
    love for our neighbor when we say: "Our Father... forgive us our
    trespasses," and this leads us to love of neighbor.
  </p>
  <p>
    Prayer ought to be humble: "He hath had regard for the prayer of the
    humble."[18] This is seen in the parable of the Pharisee and the Publican
    (Luke, xviii. 9-15), and also in the words of Judith: "The prayer of the
    humble and the meek hath always pleased Thee."[19] This same humility is
    observed in this prayer, for true humility is had when a person does not
    presume upon his own powers, but from the divine strength expects all that
    he asks for.
  </p>
  <p>
    It must be noted that prayer brings about three good effects. First, prayer
    is an efficacious and useful remedy against evils. Thus, it delivers us from
    the sins we have committed: "Thou hast forgiven the wickedness of my sin.
    For this shall every one that is holy pray to Thee in a seasonable
    time."[20] The thief on the Cross prayed and received forgiveness: "This day
    thou shalt be with Me in paradise."[21] Thus also prayed the Publican, and
    "went down to his home justified."[22] Prayer, also, frees one from the fear
    of future sin, and from trials and sadness of soul: "Is any one of you sad?
    Let him pray."[23] Again it delivers one from persecutors and enemies:
    "Instead of making me a return of love, they detracted me, but I gave myself
    to prayer."[24]
  </p>
  <p>
    In the second place, prayer is efficacious and useful to obtain all that one
    desires: "All things whatsoever you ask when you pray, believe that you
    shall receive."[25] When our prayers are not heard, either we do not
    persevere in prayer, whereas "we ought always to pray, and not to
    faint,"[26] or we do not ask for that which is more conducive to our
    salvation. "Our good Lord often does not give us what we wish," says St.
    Augustine, "because it would really be what we do not wish for." St. Paul
    gives us an example of this in that he thrice prayed that the sting of his
    flesh be removed from him, and his prayer was not heard.[27] Thirdly, prayer
    is profitable because it makes us friends of God: "Let my prayer be directed
    as incense in Thy sight."[28]

  <h3>THE OPENING WORDS OF THE LORD'S PRAYER</h3>
  <p><b>PREPARATION FOR THE PETITIONS</b></p>
  <p>
    Our FATHER.--Note here two things, namely, that God is our Father, and what
    we owe to Him because He is our Father. God is our Father by reason of our
    special creation, in that He created us in His image and likeness, and did
    not so create all inferior creatures: "Is not He thy Father, that made thee,
    and created thee?"[1] Likewise God is our Father in that He governs us, yet
    treats us as masters, and not servants, as is the case with all other
    things. "For Thy providence, Father, governeth all things;"[2] and "with
    great favor disposest of us."[3] God is our Father also by reason of
    adoption. To other creatures He has given but a small gift, but to us an
    heredity--indeed, "if sons, heirs also."[4] "For you have not received the
    spirit of bondage again in fear; but you have received the spirit of
    adoption of sons, whereby we cry, Abba (Father)."[5]
  </p>
  <p>
    We owe God, our Father, four things. First, honor: "If then I be a Father,
    where is My honor?"[6] Now, honor consists in three qualities. (1) It
    consists in giving praise to God: "The sacrifice of praise shall glorify
    Me."[7] This ought not merely come from the lips, but also from the heart,
    for: "This people draw near Me with their mouth, and with their lips glorify
    Me, but their heart is far from Me."[8] (2) Honor, again, consists in purity
    of body towards oneself: "Glorify and bear God in your body."[9] (3) Honor
    also consists in just estimate of one's neighbor, for: "The king's honor
    loveth judgment."[10]
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly, since God is our Father, we ought to imitate Him: "Thou shalt call
    Me Father, and shalt not cease to walk after Me."[11] This imitation of our
    Father consists of three things. (1) It consists in love: "Be ye therefore
    followers of God, as most dear children; and walk in love."[12] This love of
    God must be from the heart. (2) It consists in mercy: "Be ye merciful."[13]
    This mercy must likewise come from the heart, and it must be in deed. (3)
    Finally, imitation of God consists in being perfect, since love and mercy
    should be perfect: "Be ye therefore perfect, as also your Heavenly Father is
    perfect."[14]
  </p>
  <p>
    Thirdly, we owe God obedience: "Shall we not much more obey the Father of
    spirits?"[15] We must obey God for three reasons. First, because He is our
    Lord: "All things that the Lord has spoken we will do, we will be
    obedient."[16] Secondly, because He has given us the example of obedience,
    for the true Son of God "became obedient to His Father even unto death."[17]
    Thirdly, because it is for our good: "I will play before the Lord who hath
    chosen me."[18] Fourthly, we owe God patience when we are chastised by Him:
    "Reject not the correction of the Lord; and do not faint when thou art
    chastised by Him. For whom the Lord loveth He chastises; and as a father in
    the son He pleaseth Himself.[19]
  </p>
  <p>
    OUR Father.--From this we see that we owe our neighbor both love and
    reverence. We must love our neighbor because we are all brothers, and all
    men are sons of God, our Father: "For he that loveth not his brother whom he
    seeth, how can he love God whom he seeth not?"[20] We owe reverence to our
    neighbor because he is also a child of God: "Have we not all one Father?
    Hath not one God created us? Why then does everyone of us despise his
    brother?"[21] And again: "With honor preventing one another."[22] We do this
    because of the fruit we receive, for "He became to all that obey the cause
    of eternal salvation."[23]
  </p>
  <p>(For "Questions for Discussion" see Chapter 6.)</p>
  <p><b>THE PREEMINENCE OF GOD</b></p>
  <p>
    Who Art in Heaven.--Among all that is necessary for one who prays, faith is
    above all important: "Let him ask in faith, nothing wavering."[24] Hence,
    the Lord, teaching us to pray, first mentions that which causes faith to
    spring up, namely, the kindness of a father. So, He says "Our Father," in
    the meaning which is had in the following: "If you then being evil know how
    to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father from
    heaven give the good Spirit to them that ask him!"[25] Then, He says "Who
    art in heaven" because of the greatness of His power: "To Thee have I lifted
    up my eyes, who dwellest in heaven."[26]
  </p>
  <p>
    The words, "who art in heaven," signify three things. First, it serves as a
    preparation for him who utters the prayer, for, as it is said: "Before
    prayer prepare thy soul."[27] Thus, "in heaven" is understood for the glory
    of heaven: "For your reward is very great in heaven."[28] And this
    preparation ought to be in the form of an imitation of heavenly things,
    since the son ought to imitate his Father: "Therefore, as we have borne the
    image of the earthly, let us bear also the image of the heavenly."[29] So
    also this preparation ought to be through contemplation of heavenly things,
    because men are wont to direct their thoughts to where they have a Father
    and others whom they love, as it is written: "For where thy treasure is,
    there is thy heart also."[30] The Apostle wrote: "Our conversation is in
    heaven."[31] Likewise, we prepare through attention to heavenly things, so
    that we may then seek only spiritual things from Him who is in heaven: "Seek
    things that are above, where Christ is."[32]
  </p>
  <p>
    "Who art in heaven" can also pertain to Him who hears us, who is nearest to
    us; and then the "in heaven" is understood to mean "in devout persons" in
    whom God dwells, as it is written: "Thou, O Lord, art among us."[33] For
    holy persons are called "the heavens" in the Psalm: "The heavens show forth
    the glory of God,"[34] since God dwells in the devout through faith. "That
    Christ may dwell by faith in your hearts."[35] God also dwells in us through
    love: "He that abideth in charity, abideth in God and God in him."[36] And
    also through the keeping of the commandments: "If any one love Me, he will
    keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him, and will
    make Our abode with him."[37]
  </p>
  <p>
    In the third place, "who art in heaven" can pertain to Him who is in heaven,
    He who cannot be included in the physical heavens, for "the heaven and the
    heaven of heavens cannot contain Thee."[38] And so it can mean that God is
    all-seeing in His survey of us, in that He sees us from above, that is, from
    heaven: "Because He hath looked forth from His high sanctuary; from heaven
    the Lord hath looked upon the earth."[39] It also signifies how sublime is
    God in His power: "The Lord hath prepared His throne in heaven";[40] and
    that He lives without change through eternity: "But Thou, O Lord, endurest
    forever."[41] And again: "Thy years shall not fail."[42] And so of Christ
    was it written: "His throne as the days of heaven."[43]
  </p>
  <p>
    The Philosopher says that on account of the incorruptibility of the heavens
    all have considered them as the abode of spirits.[44] And so "who art in
    heaven" tends to give us confidence in our prayer which arises from a
    threefold consideration: of God's power, of our familiarity with Him, and of
    the fitness of our requests.
  </p>
  <p>
    The power of Him to whom we pray is implied if we consider "heaven" as the
    corporeal heavens. God is not limited by any physical bounds: "Do not I fill
    heaven and earth? saith the Lord."[45] Nevertheless, He is said to be in the
    corporeal heavens to indicate two things: the extent of His power and the
    greatness of His nature. The former of these attributes is contrary to the
    view that all things happen out of necessity, by a fate regulated by the
    celestial bodies; and thus all prayer would be vain and useless. But such is
    absurd, since God dwells in the heavens as their Lord: "The Lord has
    prepared His throne in heaven."[46] The latter attribute, viz., His sublime
    nature, is against those who in praying propose or build up any corporeal
    images of God. Therefore, God is stated to be "in heaven" in that He exceeds
    all corporeal things, and even the desires and intellects of men; so that
    whatsoever man thinks or desires is far less than God. Thus, it is said:
    "Behold, God is great, exceeding our knowledge."[47] And again: "The Lord is
    high above all nations."[48] And finally: "To whom then have you likened
    God? Or what image will you make for Him?"[49]
  </p>
  <p>
    Familiar intercourse with God is shown through this "in heaven." Some indeed
    have said that because of His great distance from us God does not care for
    men, and they cite these words: "He walketh about the poles of heaven, and
    He doth not consider our things."[50] Against this is the fact that God is
    nearer to us than we are to ourselves. This brings confidence to one who
    prays. First, because of the nearness of God: "The Lord is nigh unto all
    them that call upon Him."[51] Hence, it is written: "But thou when thou
    shalt pray, enter into thy chamber,"[52] that is, into thy heart. Second,
    because of the intercession of all the Saints among whom God dwells; for
    from this arises faith to ask through their merits for what we desire: "Turn
    to some of the Saints,"[53] and, "Pray one for another, that you may be
    saved."[54]
  </p>
  <p>
    This part of the prayer--that is, "in heaven"--is appropriate and fitting
    also, if "in heaven" is taken to mean that spiritual and eternal good in
    which true happiness consists. Because of it our desires are lifted up
    towards heavenly things; since our desires ought to tend towards where we
    have our Father, because there is our true home: "Seek the things that are
    above."[55] And again: "Unto an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled,
    and that cannot fade, reserved in heaven for you."[56] Moreover, from it we
    are told that, if our life is to be in heaven, then we ought to be conformed
    to our Heavenly Father: "Such as is the heavenly, such also are they that
    are heavenly."[57] From all this the words "in heaven" are most appropriate
    in prayer in that they signify both a heavenly desire and heavenly life.

    1. Deut., xxxii. 6. "The first word which, by the command and institution of
    Our Lord, we say in this prayer is 'Father.' The Saviour could, indeed, have
    begun this prayer with some other word more expressive of His majesty, such
    as 'Creator' or 'Lord.' Yet, He omitted all such expressions as they might
    be associated with fear, and instead of them He has chosen a word which
    inspires love and confidence. What name is more tender than that of Father?
    It is a name which expresses both indulgence and love" ("Roman Catechism,"

  <h3>THE FIRST PETITION: "Hallowed Be Thy Name."</h3>
  <p>
    This is the first petition, and in it we ask that God's name be manifested
    and declared in us. The name of God, first of all, is wonderful because it
    works wonders in all creatures. Thus said Our Lord: "In My name they shall
    cast out devils, they shall speak new tongues. They shall take up serpents;
    and if they shall drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them."[1]
  </p>
  <p><b>GOD'S NAME IS LOVABLE</b></p>
  <p>
    This name is lovable: "There is no other name under heaven given to men,
    whereby we must be saved."[2] We all should desire to be saved. We have an
    example in Blessed Ignatius, who had such great love for the name of Christ
    that, when Trajan ordered him to deny it, he affirmed that it could not be
    dragged from his mouth. Then, the emperor threatened to have him beheaded,
    and thus take the name of Christ out of the mouth of the Saint. But Ignatius
    replied: "Even though you take it from my mouth, you will never snatch it
    from my heart. I have this name written in my heart and there I never cease
    to invoke it." Trajan heard this and wished to put it to the test. He had
    the servant of God beheaded and then commanded that his heart be taken out,
    and there upon the heart was found the name of Christ inscribed in letters
    of gold. This name had been engraved on the heart as a seal.
  </p>
  <p><b>GOD'S NAME IS VENERABLE</b></p>
  <p>
    The name of God is venerable: "In the name of Jesus every knee should bow,
    of those that are in heaven, on earth, and under the earth."[3] "Those that
    are in heaven" refers to the Angels and the blessed; "those that are on
    earth" to people living in this world, who do so for love of heaven which
    they wish to gain; "those under the earth" to the damned, who do so out of
    fear.
  </p>
  <p><b>GOD'S NAME IS INEFFABLE</b></p>
  <p>
    This name is ineffable, for in the telling of it every tongue is wholly
    inadequate. Accordingly, it is sometimes compared to created things as, for
    instance, it is likened to a rock because of its firmness: "Upon this rock I
    will build My Church."[4] It is likened to a fire because of its purifying
    power; for as fire purifies metal, so does God purify the hearts of sinners:
    "My God is a consuming fire."[5] It is compared to light because of its
    power of enlightening; for as light illumines the darkness, so does the name
    of God overcome the darkness of the mind: "O my God, enlighten my
    darkness."[6]
  </p>
  <p><b>MEANING OF HALLOWED</b></p>
  <p>
    We pray that this name may be manifested in us, that it be known and revered
    as holy. Now "holy" (or hallowed) may have a threefold meaning. First, it is
    the same as firm. Thus, those who are firmly established in eternal
    happiness are all the blessed in heaven, the Saints. In this sense, none is
    a "Saint" on earth because here all is continually changeable. As St.
    Augustine says: "I sank away from Thee, O Lord, and I wandered too much
    astray from Thee who art my firm support."[7]
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly, "holy" may be understood as "unearthly." The holy ones who are in
    heaven have naught earthly about them: "I count (all things)... but as dung,
    that I may gain Christ."[8] Earth may signify sinners. This would arise as
    reference to production. For if the earth is not cultivated, it will produce
    thorns and thistles. Similarly, if the soul of the sinner is not cultivated
    by grace, it will produce only thistles and thorns of sins: "Thorns and
    thistles shall it bring forth to thee."[9] Again, earth may signify sinners
    as regards its darkness. The earth is dark and opaque; and so also is the
    sinner dark and obstructive to light: "Darkness was on the face of the
    deep."[10] And, finally, earth is a dry element which will fall to pieces
    unless it is mixed with the moisture of water. So God placed earth just
    above water: "Who established the earth above the waters."[11] So also the
    soul of the sinner is dry and without moisture as it is said: "My soul is as
    earth without water unto Thee."[12]
  </p>
  <p>
    "Holy" may, finally, be understood as "laved in blood," since the Saints in
    heaven are called Saints because they have been washed in blood: "These are
    they who are come out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and
    have made them white in the blood of the Lamb."[13] And again: "He hath
    washed us from our sins in His blood."[14]

  <h3>THE SECOND PETITION: "Thy Kingdom Come."</h3>
  <p>
    The Holy Spirit makes us love, desire and pray rightly; and instills in us,
    first of all, a fear whereby we ask that the name of God be sanctified. He
    gives us another gift, that of piety. This is a devout and loving affection
    for our Father and for all men who are in trouble. Now, since God is our
    Father, we ought not only reverence and fear Him, but also have towards Him
    a sweet and pious affection. This love makes us pray that the kingdom of God
    may come: "We should live soberly and justly in this world, looking for the
    blessed hope and coming of the glory of the great God."[1]
  </p>
  <p>
    It may be asked of us: "Why, since the kingdom of God always was, do we then
    ask that it may come?" This, however, can be understood in three ways.
    First, a king sometimes has only the right to a kingdom or dominion, and yet
    his rule has not been declared because the men in his kingdom are not as yet
    subject to him. His rule or dominion will come only when the men of his
    kingdom are his subjects. Now, God is by His very essence and nature the
    Lord of all things; and Christ being God and Man is the Lord over all
    things: "And He gave Him power and glory and a kingdom."[2] It is,
    therefore, necessary that all things be subject to Him. This is not yet the
    case, but will be so at the end of the world: "For He must reign, until He
    hath put all His enemies under His feet."[3] Hence it is for this we pray
    when we say: "Thy kingdom come."
  </p>
  <p><b>WHY WE PRAY THUS</b></p>
  <p>
    In so doing we pray for a threefold purpose: that the just may be
    strengthened, that sinners may be punished, and that death be destroyed.
    Now, the reason is that men are subject to Christ in two ways, either
    willingly or unwillingly. Again, the will of God is so efficacious that it
    must be fully complied with; and God does wish that all things be subject to
    Christ. Hence, two things are necessary: either man will do the will of God
    by subjecting himself to His commands, as do the just; or God shall exert
    His will and punish those who are sinners and His enemies; and this will
    take place at the end of the world: "Until I make Thy enemies Thy
    footstool."[4]
  </p>
  <p>
    It is enjoined upon the faithful to pray that the kingdom of God may come,
    namely, that they subject themselves completely to Him. But it is a terrible
    thing for sinners, because for them to ask the coming of God's kingdom is
    nothing else than to ask that they be subjected to punishment: "Woe to them
    that desire the day of the Lord!"[5] By this prayer, too, we ask that death
    be destroyed. Since Christ is life, death cannot exist in His kingdom,[6]
    because death is the opposite of life: "And the enemy, death, shall be
    destroyed last."[7] "He shall cast death down headlong forever."[8] And this
    shall take place at the last resurrection: "Who will reform the body of our
    lowness, made like to the body of His glory."[9]
  </p>
  <p>
    In a second sense, the kingdom of heaven signifies the glory of paradise.
    Nor is this to be wondered at, for a kingdom ("regnum") is nothing other
    than a government ("regimen"). That will be the best government where
    nothing is found contrary to the will of the governor. Now, the will of God
    is the very salvation of men, for He "will have all men to be saved";[10]
    and this especially shall come to pass in paradise where there will be
    nothing contrary to man's salvation. "They shall gather out of His kingdom
    all scandals."[11] In this world, however, there are many things contrary to
    the salvation of men. Hence, when we pray, "Thy kingdom come," we pray that
    we might participate in the heavenly kingdom and in the glory of paradise.
  </p>
  <p><b>WHY WE DESIRE THIS KINGDOM</b></p>
  <p>
    This kingdom is greatly to be desired for three reasons. (1) It is to be
    greatly desired because of the perfect justice that obtains there: "Thy
    people shall be all just."[12] In this world the bad are mingled with the
    good, but in heaven there will be no wicked and no sinners. (2) The heavenly
    kingdom is to be desired because of its perfect liberty. Here below there is
    no liberty, although all men naturally desire it; but above there will be
    perfect liberty without any form of oppression: "Because the creature also
    shall be delivered from the servitude of corruption."[13] Not only will men
    then be free, but indeed they will all be kings: "And Thou hast made us to
    our God a kingdom."[14] This is because all shall be of one will with God,
    and God shall will what the Saints will, and the Saints shall will
    whatsoever God wills; hence, in the will of God shall their will be done
    All, therefore, shall reign, because the will of all shall be done, and the
    Lord shall be their crown: "In that day, the Lord of hosts shall be a crown
    of glory and a garland of joy to the residue of His people."[15] (3) The
    kingdom of God is to be desired because of the marvellous riches of heaven:
    "The eye hath not seen O God, besides Thee, what things Thou hast prepared
    for them that wait for Thee."[16] And also: "Who satisfieth thy desire with
    good things."[17]
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that man will find everything that he seeks for in this world more
    excellently and more perfectly in God alone. Thus, if it is pleasure you
    seek, then in God you will find the highest pleasure: "You shall see and
    your heart shall rejoice."[18] "And everlasting joy shall be upon their
    heads."[19] If it is riches, there you will find it in abundance: "When the
    soul strays from Thee, she looks for things apart from Thee, but she finds
    all things impure and useless until she returns to Thee," says St.
    Augustine.[20]
  </p>
  <p>
    Lastly, "Thy kingdom come" is understood in another sense because sometimes
    sin reigns in this world. This occurs when man is so disposed that he
    follows at once the enticement of sin. "Let not sin reign in your mortal
    body,"[21] but let God reign in your heart; and this will be when thou art
    prepared to obey God and keep all His Commandments. Therefore, when we pray
    to God that His kingdom may come, we pray that God and not sin may reign in
    us.
  </p>
  <p>
    May we through this petition arrive at that happiness of which the Lord
    speaks: "Blessed are the meek!"[22] Now, according to what we have first
    explained above, viz., that man desires that God be the Lord of all things,
    then let him not avenge injuries that are done him, but let him leave that
    for the Lord. If you avenge yourself, you do not really desire that the
    kingdom of God may come. According to our second explanation (i.e.,
    regarding the glory of paradise), if you await the coming of this kingdom
    which is the glory of paradise, you need not worry about losing earthly
    things. Likewise, if according to the third explanation, you pray that God
    may reign within you, then you must be humble, for He is Himself most
    humble: "Learn of Me because I am meek and humble of heart."[23]

    traitor, no deserter, and that all may so act that they may come with joy
    into the presence of God their King: and may reach the possession of the
    heavenly kingdom prepared for them from all eternity" ("Roman Catechism."

  </p>
  <h3>THE THIRD PETITION: "Thy Will Be Done on Earth as It Is in Heaven."</h3>
  <p>
    The third gift which the Holy Spirit works in us is called the gift of
    knowledge. The Holy Spirit not only gives us the gift of fear and the gift
    of piety (which is a sweet affection for God, as we have said); but He also
    makes man wise. It was this for which David prayed: "Teach me goodness and
    discipline and knowledge."[1] This knowledge which the Holy Spirit teaches
    us is that whereby man lives justly. Among all that goes to make up
    knowledge and wisdom in man, the principal wisdom is that man should not
    depend solely upon his own opinion: "Lean not upon thy own prudence."[2]
    Those who put all their trust in their own judgment so that they do not
    trust others, but only themselves, are always found to be stupid and are so
    adjudged by others: "Hast thou seen a man wise in his own conceit? There
    shall be more hope of a fool than of him."[3]
  </p>
  <p><b>THE WILL OF GOD</b></p>
  <p>
    Out of humility one does not trust one's own knowledge: "Where humility is
    there is also wisdom."[4] The proud trust only themselves. Now, the Holy
    Spirit, through the gift of wisdom, teaches us that we do not our own will
    but the will of God. It is through this gift that we pray of God that His
    "will be done on earth as it is in heaven." And in this is seen the gift of
    knowledge. Thus, one says to God "let Thy will be done," in the same way as
    one who is sick desires something from the physician; and his will is not
    precisely his own, because it is the will of the physician. Otherwise, if
    his desire were purely from his own will, he would be indeed foolish. So we
    ought not to pray other than that in us God's will may be done; that is,
    that His will be accomplished in us. The heart of man is only right when it
    is in accord with the will of God. This did Christ: "Because I came down
    from heaven, not to do My own will but the will of Him that sent Me."[5]
    Christ, as God, has the same will with the Father; but as a Man He has a
    distinct will from the Father's, and it was according to this that He says
    He does not do His will but the Father's. Hence, He teaches us to pray and
    to ask: "Thy will be done."[6]
  </p>
  <p><b>WHAT DOES GOD WILL?</b></p>
  <p>
    But what is this that is asked? Does not the Psalm say: "Whatsoever the Lord
    pleased [has willed], He hath done?"[7] Now, if He has done all that He has
    willed both in heaven and on earth, what then is the meaning of this: "Thy
    will be done on earth as it is in heaven"? To understand this we must know
    that God wills of us three things, and we pray that these be accomplished.
    The first thing that God wills is that we may have eternal life. Whoever
    makes something for a certain purpose, has a will regarding it which is in
    accord with the purpose for which he made it. In like manner, God made man,
    but it was not for no purpose, as it is written: "Remember what my substance
    is; for hast Thou made all the children of men in vain?"[8]
  </p>
  <p>
    Hence, God made men for a purpose; but this purpose was not for their mere
    pleasures, for also the brutes have these, but it was that they might have
    eternal life. The Lord, therefore, wills that men have eternal life. Now,
    when that for which a thing is made is accomplished, it is said to be saved;
    and when this is not accomplished, it is said to be lost. So when man gains
    eternal life, he is said to be saved, and it is this that the Lord wills:
    "Now, this is the will of My Father that sent Me, that every one who seeth
    the Son and believeth in Him may have life everlasting."[9] This will of God
    is already fulfilled for the Angels and for the Saints in the Fatherland,
    for they see God and know and enjoy Him. We, however, desire that, as the
    will of God is done for the blessed who are in heaven, it likewise be done
    for us who are on earth. For this we pray when we say "Thy will be done" for
    us who are on earth, as it is for the Saints who are in heaven.
  </p>
  <p><b>THE COMMANDMENTS: GOD'S WILL</b></p>
  <p>
    In the second place, the will of God for us is that we keep His
    Commandments. When a person desires something, he not only wills that which
    he desires, but also everything which will bring that about. Thus, in order
    to bring about a healthy condition which he desires, a physician also wills
    to put into effect diet, medicine, and other needs. We arrive at eternal
    life through observance of the Commandments, and, accordingly, God wills
    that we observe them: "But if thou wilt enter into life, keep the
    Commandments."[10] "Your reasonable service... that you may prove what is
    the good and the acceptable and the perfect will of God."[11] That is, good
    because it is profitable: "I am the Lord thy God that teach thee profitable
    things."[12] And acceptable, that is, pleasing: "Light is risen to the just;
    and joy to the right heart."[13] And perfect, because noble: "Be you
    therefore perfect, as your Heavenly Father is perfect."[14] When we say "Thy
    will be done," we pray that we may fulfill the Commandments of God. This
    will of God is done by the just, but it is not yet done by sinners. "In
    heaven" here signifies the just; while "on earth" refers to sinners. We,
    therefore, pray that the will of God may be done "on earth," that is, by
    sinners, "as it is in heaven," that is, by the just.[15]
  </p>
  <p><b>LET THY WILL BE DONE</b></p>
  <p>
    It must be noted that the very words used in this petition teach us a
    lesson. It does not say "Do" or "Let us do," but it says, "[Let] Thy will be
    done," because two things are necessary for eternal life: the grace of God
    and the will of man. Although God has made man without man, He cannot save
    man without his cooperation. Thus, says St. Augustine: "Who created thee
    without thyself, cannot save thee without thyself,"[16] because God wills
    that man cooperate with Him or at least put no obstacle in His way: "Turn ye
    to Me, saith the Lord of hosts, and I will turn to you."[17] "By the grace
    of God, I am what I am. And His grace in me hath not been void."[18] Do not,
    therefore, presume on your own strength, but trust in God's grace; and be
    not negligent, but use the zeal you have. It does not say, therefore, "Let
    us do," lest it would seem that the grace of God were left out; nor does it
    say, "Do," lest it would appear that our will and our zeal do not matter. He
    does say "Let it be done" through the grace of God at the same time using
    our desire and our own efforts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thirdly, the will of God in our regard is that men be restored to that state
    and dignity in which the first man was created. This was a condition in
    which the spirit and soul felt no resistance from sensuality and the flesh.
    As long as the soul was subject to God, the flesh was in such subjection to
    the spirit that no corruption of death, or weakness, or any of the passions
    were felt. When, however, the spirit and the soul, which were between God
    and the flesh, rebelled against God by sin, then the body rebelled against
    the soul. From that time death and weaknesses began to be felt together with
    continual rebellion of sensuality against the spirit: "I see another law in
    my members, fighting against the law of my mind."[19] "The flesh lusteth
    against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh."[20]
  </p>
  <p>
    Thus, there is an endless strife between the flesh and the spirit, and man
    is continually being brought lower by sin. The will of God, therefore, is
    that man be restored to his primal state so that no more would the flesh
    rebel against the spirit: "For this is the will of God, your
    sanctification."[21] Now, this will of God cannot be fulfilled in this life,
    but it will be fulfilled in the resurrection of the just, when glorified
    bodies shall arise incorrupt and most perfect: "It is sown a natural body;
    it shall rise a spiritual body."[22] In the just the will of God is
    fulfilled relative to the spirit, which abides in justice and knowledge and
    perfect life. Therefore, when we say "Thy will be done," let us pray that
    His will also may be done regarding the flesh. Thus, the sense of "Thy will
    be done on earth" is that it may be done "for our flesh," and "as it is in
    heaven" means in our spirit. Thus, we take "in heaven" for our spirit, and
    "on earth" as our flesh.[23]
  </p>
  <p>
    By means of this petition we arrive at the happiness of those who mourn, as
    it is written: "Blessed are they that mourn; for they shall be
    comforted."[24] This can be applied to each of the threefold explanations we
    have given above. According to the first we desire eternal life. And in this
    very desire we are brought to a mourning of soul: "Woe is me, that my
    sojourning is prolonged."[25] This desire in the Saints is so vehement that
    because of it they wish for death, which in itself is something naturally to
    be avoided: "But we are confident and have a good will to be absent rather
    from the body and to be present with the Lord."[26] Likewise, according to
    our second explanation--viz., that we will to keep the Commandments --they
    who do so are in sorrow. For although such be sweet for the soul, it is
    bitter indeed for the flesh which is continually kept in discipline. "Going,
    they went and wept," which refers to the flesh, "But coming, they shall come
    with joyfulness," which pertains to the soul.[27] Again, from our third
    explanation (that is, concerning the struggle which is ever going on between
    the flesh and the spirit), we see that this too causes sorrow. For it cannot
    but happen that the soul be wounded by the venial faults of the flesh; and
    so in expiating for these the soul is in mourning. "Every night," that is,
    the darkness of sin, "I will wash my bed [that is, my conscience] with my
    tears."[28] Those who thus sorrow will arrive at the Fatherland, where may
    God bring us also!

  <h3>
    THE FOURTH PETITION THE FOURTH PETITION "Give Us This Day Our Daily Bread."
  </h3>
  <p>
    Sometimes it happens that one of great learning and wisdom becomes fearful
    and timid; and, therefore, it is necessary that he have fortitude of heart
    lest he lack necessities: "It is He that giveth strength to the weary, and
    increaseth force and might to them that are not."[1] The Holy Spirit gives
    this fortitude: "And the Spirit entered into me,... and He set me upon my
    feet."[2] This fortitude which is given by the Holy Ghost so strengthens the
    heart of man that he does not fear for the things that are necessary for
    him, but he trusts that God will provide for all his needs. The Holy Spirit
    who gives us this strength teaches us to pray to God: "Give us this day our
    daily bread." And thus He is called the Spirit of fortitude.
  </p>
  <p>
    It must be noted that in the first three petitions of this prayer only
    things spiritual are asked for--those which indeed begin to be in this world
    but are only brought to fruition in the life eternal. Thus, when we pray
    that the name of God be hallowed, we really ask that the name of God be
    known; when we pray that the kingdom of God may come, we ask that we may
    participate in God's kingdom; and when we pray that the will of God be done,
    we ask that His will be accomplished in us. All these things, however,
    although they have their beginning here on earth, cannot be had in their
    fullness except in heaven. Hence, it is necessary to pray for certain
    necessaries which can be completely had in this life. The Holy Spirit, then,
    taught us to ask for the requirements of this present life which are here
    obtainable in their fullness, and at the same time He shows that our
    temporal wants are provided us by God. It is this that is meant when we say:
    "Give us this day our daily bread."[3]
  </p>
  <p>
    In these very words the Holy Spirit teaches us to avoid five sins which are
    usually committed out of the desire for temporal things. The first sin is
    that man, because of an inordinate desire, seeks those things which go
    beyond his state and condition of life. He is not satisfied with what befits
    him. Thus, if he be a soldier and desires clothes, he will not have them
    suitable for a soldier, but rather for a knight; or if he be a cleric,
    clothes fit for a bishop. This vicious habit withdraws man from spiritual
    things, in that it makes his desires cleave to transitory things. The Lord
    taught us to avoid this vice by instructing us to ask for the temporal
    necessities of this present life as they are in accord with the position of
    each one of us. All this is understood under the name of "bread." And so He
    does not teach us to pray for that which is luxurious, nor for variety, nor
    for what is over-refined, but for bread which is common to all and without
    which man's life could not be sustained: "The chief thing for man's life is
    water and bread."[4] And: "Having food and wherewith to be covered, with
    these we are content."[5]
  </p>
  <p>
    The second sin is that some in acquiring temporal goods burden others and
    defraud them. This vicious practice is dangerous, because goods thus taken
    away can be restored only with difficulty. For, as St. Augustine says: "The
    sin is not forgiven until that which is taken away is restored."[6] "They
    eat the bread of wickedness."[7] The Lord teaches us to avoid this sin, and
    to pray for our own bread, not that of another. Robbers do not eat their own
    bread, but the bread of their neighbor.
  </p>
  <p>
    The third sin is unnecessary solicitude. There are some who are never
    content with what they have, but always want more. This is wholly
    immoderate, because one's desire must always be measured by his need: "Give
    me neither beggary nor riches, but give me only the necessaries of life."[8]
    We are taught to avoid this sin in the words, "our daily bread," that is,
    bread of one day or for one time.[9]
  </p>
  <p>
    The fourth sin is inordinate voracity. There are those who in one day would
    consume what would be enough for many days. Such pray not for bread for one
    day, but for ten days. And because they spend too much, it happens what they
    spend all their substance. "They that give themselves to drinking and that
    club together shall be consumed."[10] And: "A workman that is a drunkard
    shall not be rich."[11]
  </p>
  <p>
    The fifth sin is ingratitude. A person grows proud in his riches, and does
    not realize that what he has comes from God. This is a grave fault, for all
    things that we have, be they spiritual or temporal, are from God: "All
    things are Thine; and we have given Thee what we received of Thy hand."[12]
    Therefore, to take away this vice, the prayer has, "Give us" even "our daily
    bread," that we may know that all things come from God.
  </p>
  <p>
    From all this we draw one great lesson. Sometimes one who has great riches
    makes no use of them, but suffers spiritual and temporal harm; for some
    because of riches have perished. "There is also another evil which I have
    seen under the sun, and that frequent among men. A man to whom God hath
    given riches and substance and honor, and his soul wanteth nothing of all
    that he desireth; yet God doth not give him power to eat thereof, but a
    stranger shall eat it up."[13] And again: "Riches kept to the hurt of the
    owner."[14] We ought, therefore, pray that our riches will be of use to us;
    and it is this we seek for when we say, "Give us our bread," that is, make
    our riches be of use to us. "His bread in his belly shall be turned into the
    gall of asps within him. The riches which he hath swallowed, he shall vomit
    up; and God shall draw them out of his belly."[15]
  </p>
  <p>
    Another great vice is concerned with the things of this world, viz.,
    excessive solicitude for them. For there are some who daily are anxious
    about temporal goods which are enough for them for an entire year; and they
    who are thus troubled will never have rest: "Be not solicitous therefore,
    saying: "What shall we eat, or What shall we drink, or Wherewith shall we be
    clothed?"[16] The Lord, therefore, teaches us to pray that to-day our bread
    will be given us, that is, those things which will be needful for us for the
    present time.
  </p>
  <p>
    One may also see in this bread another twofold meaning, viz., Sacramental
    Bread and the Bread of the Word of God. Thus, in the first meaning, we pray
    for our Sacramental Bread which is consecrated daily in the Church, so that
    we receive it in the Sacrament, and thus it profits us unto salvation: "I am
    the living bread which came down from heaven."[17] And: "He that eateth and
    drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh judgment to himself."[18]
  </p>
  <p>
    In the second meaning this bread is the Word of God: "Not in bread alone
    doth man live, but in every word that proceedeth from the mouth of God."[19]
    We pray, therefore, that He give us bread, that is, His Word.[20] From this
    man derives that happiness which is a hunger for justice. For after
    spiritual things are considered, they are all the more desired; and this
    desire arouses a hunger, and from this hunger follows the fullness of life
    everlasting.

  </p>
  <h3>
    THE FIFTH PETITION: "And Forgive Us Our Trespasses As We Forgive Those Who
    Trespass Against Us."
  </h3>
  <p>
    There are some men of great wisdom and fortitude who, because they trust too
    much in their own strength, do not wisely carry out what they attempt, and
    they do not bring to completion that which they have in mind. "Designs are
    strengthened by counsels."[1] It must be known that the Holy Ghost who gives
    fortitude also gives counsel. Every good counsel concerning the salvation of
    man is from the Holy Ghost. Thus, counsel is necessary for man when he is in
    difficulty, just as is the counsel of physicians when one is ill. When man
    falls into spiritual illness through sin, he must look for counsel in order
    to be healed. This necessity for counsel on the part of the sinner is shown
    in these words: "Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to thee,
    and redeem thou thy sins with alms."[2] The best counsel, therefore, against
    sin is alms and mercy. Hence, the Holy Spirit teaches sinners to seek and to
    pray: "Forgive us our trespasses."[3]
  </p>
  <p>
    We owe God that which we have taken away from His sole right; and this right
    of God is that we do His will in preference to our own will. Now, we take
    away from God's right when we prefer our will to God's will, and this is a
    sin. Sins, therefore, are our trespasses.[4] And it is the counsel of the
    Holy Spirit that we ask God pardon for our sins, and so we say: "Forgive us
    our trespasses."
  </p>
  <p>
    We can consider these words in three ways: (1) Why do we make this petition?
    (2) How may it be fulfilled? (3) What is required on our part?
  </p>
  <p><b>WHY DO WE MAKE THIS PETITION?</b></p>
  <p>
    It must be known that from this petition we can draw two things that are
    necessary for us in this life. One is that we be ever in a state of salutary
    fear and humility. There have been some, indeed, so presumptuous as to say
    that man could live in this world and by his own unaided strength avoid sin.
    But this condition has been given to no one except Christ, who had the
    Spirit beyond all measure, and to the Blessed Virgin, who was full of grace
    and in whom there was no sin. "And concerning whom," that is, the Virgin,
    "when it is a question of sin I wish to make no mention," says St.
    Augustine.[5] But for all the other Saints, it was never granted them that
    they should not incur at least venial sin: "If we say that we have no sin,
    we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us."[6] And, moreover, this
    very petition proves this; for it is evident that all Saints and all men say
    the "Our Father" in which is contained "Forgive us our trespasses." Hence,
    all admit and confess that they are sinners or trespassers. If, therefore,
    you are a sinner, you ought to fear and humble yourself.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another reason for this petition is that we should ever live in hope.
    Although we be sinners, nevertheless we must not give up hope, lest our
    despair drive us into greater and different kinds of sins. As the Apostle
    says: "Who despairing, have given themselves up to lasciviousness, unto the
    working of all uncleanness."[7] It is, therefore, of great help that we be
    ever hopeful; for in the measure that man is a sinner, he ought to hope that
    God will forgive him if he be perfectly sorry for sin and be converted. This
    hope is strengthened in us when we say: "Forgive us our trespasses."
  </p>
  <p>
    The Novatiani destroyed this hope, saying that one who has sinned but once
    after Baptism can never look for mercy. But this is not true, if Christ
    spoke truly when He said: "I forgave thee all the debt, because thou
    besoughtest Me."[8] In whatsoever day, therefore, you ask, you can receive
    mercy if with sorrow for sin you make your prayer. Both fear and hope arise
    from this petition. For all sinners who are contrite and confess their
    guilt, receive mercy. Hence, this petition is necessary.
  </p>
  <p><b>THE FULFILLMENT OF THIS PETITION</b></p>
  <p>
    Concerning the second consideration of this petition (viz., how it may be
    fulfilled), it must be known that there are two factors in sin: the fault by
    which God is offended, and the punishment which is due because of this
    fault. But the sin is taken away in contrition which goes with the purpose
    to confess and make satisfaction: "I said: I will confess against myself my
    injustice to the Lord. And Thou hast forgiven the wickedness of my sin"[9]
    One has no need to fear then, because for the remission of a fault
    contrition with a purpose to confess is sufficient.[10]
  </p>
  <p>
    But one might say: "If sin is thus taken away when a man is contrite, of
    what necessity is the priest?" To this it must be said that God does forgive
    the sin in contrition, and eternal punishment is changed to temporal, but
    nevertheless the debt of temporal punishment remains. If one should die
    without confession, not out of contempt for it but prevented from it, one
    would go to purgatory, where the punishment, as St. Augustine says, is very
    great. When you confess, the priest absolves you of this punishment in
    virtue of the keys to which you subject yourself in confession.[11] When,
    therefore, one has confessed, something of this punishment is taken away;
    and similarly when he has again confessed, and it could be that after he has
    confessed many times, all would be remitted.
  </p>
  <p>
    The successors of the Apostles found another mode of remission of this
    punishment, namely, the good use of indulgences, which have their force for
    one living in the state of grace, to the extent that is claimed for them and
    as indicated by the grantor. That the Pope can bring this about, is
    sufficiently evident. Many holy men have accomplished much good, and they
    have not greatly sinned, at least not mortally; and these good deeds were
    done for the common use of the Church. Likewise the merits of Christ and the
    Blessed Virgin are, as it were, in a treasury; and from it the Supreme
    Pontiff and they who are by him permitted can dispense these merits where it
    is necessary. Thus, therefore, sins are taken away not only as regards their
    guilt by contrition,[12] but also as regards punishment for them in
    confession and through indulgences.[13]
  </p>
  <p><b>WHAT MUST WE DO?</b></p>
  <p>
    Concerning the third consideration of this petition, it must be known that
    on our part we are required to forgive our neighbor the offenses which he
    commits against us. Thus, we say: "As we forgive those who trespass against
    us." Otherwise God would not forgive us: "Man to man reserveth anger: and
    doth he seek remedy of God?"[14] "Forgive and you shall be forgiven."[15]
    Therefore, only in this petition is there a condition when it says: "As we
    forgive those who trespass against us." If you do not forgive, you shall not
    be forgiven.
  </p>
  <p>
    But you may think, "I shall say what goes first in the petition, namely,
    'forgive us,' but that 'As we forgive those who trespass against us,' I
    shall not say." Would you seek to deceive Christ? You certainly do not
    deceive Him. For Christ who made this prayer remembers it well, and cannot
    be deceived. If therefore, you say it with the lips, let the heart fulfill
    it.
  </p>
  <p>
    But one may ask whether he who does not intend to forgive his neighbor ought
    to say: "As we forgive those who trespass against us." It seems not, for
    such is a lie. But actually it must be said that he does not lie, because he
    prays not in his own person, but in that of the Church which is not
    deceived, and, therefore the petition itself is in the plural number.[16]
    And it must also be known that forgiveness is twofold. One applies to the
    perfect, where the one offended seeks out the offender: "Seek after
    peace."[17] The other is common to all, and to it all are equally bound,
    that one offended grant pardon to the one who seeks it: "Forgive thy
    neighbor if he hath hurt thee; and then shall thy sins be forgiven to thee
    when thou prayest."[18] And from this follows that other beatitude: "Blessed
    are the merciful." For mercy causes us to have pity on our neighbor.

    satisfaction or by suffering.... With regard to serious sins, however, this

    sanctifying grace is imparted whereby the guilt of mortal sin is taken away
    and at the same time the guilt of eternal punishment; (2) the guilt of
    temporal punishment is more or less remitted according to the dispositions
    of the penitent "and the disposition can be such that in virtue of
    contrition the entire punishment is removed," says St. Thomas (IV Sent.,
    Dist. xviii, art. 3, sol. 2, ad. 4). The Council of Trent (Session XIV, cap.
    2) teaches that this entire remission of punishment, which is obtained
    through Baptism, is not obtained through the Sacrament of Penance "without
    much tears and labors" ("magnis nostris fletibus et laboribus"). For other
    effects of this Sacrament, such as the bestowal of sacramental grace and the
    revival of the merits of former good works, see the Manuals of Moral
    Theology (e.g., Aertnys-Damen, II, lib. VI, tract. v, n. 272). 12. See
    footnote above. 13. An indulgence is a remission of that temporal punishment
    which, even after the sin is forgiven, we have yet to undergo either here or
    in purgatory. Indulgences derive their value and efficacy from the spiritual
    treasury of the Church. which consists of the superabundant merits of
    Christ, His Blessed Mother. and the Saints. This treasury is to be
    considered as the common property of the faithful, committed to the
    administration of the Church. In virtue of the Communion of Saints, by which
    we are united as members of one body, the abundance of some supplies for the
    want of others. The Council of Trent (Session XXV) points out to all the

    neighbor, we pray also for them while offering prayers for ourselves"

  <h3>THE SIXTH PETITION: "And Lead Us Not Into Temptation."</h3>
  <p>
    There are those who have sinned and desire forgiveness for their sins. They
    confess their sins and repent. Yet, they do not strive as much as they
    should in order that they may not fall into sin again. In this indeed they
    are not consistent. For, on the one hand, they deplore their sins by being
    sorry for them; and, on the other hand, they sin again and again and have
    them again to deplore. Thus it is written: "Wash yourselves, be clean. Take
    away the evil of your devices from my eyes. Cease to do perversely."[1]
  </p>
  <p>
    We have seen in the petition above that Christ taught us to seek forgiveness
    for our sins. In this petition, He teaches us to pray that we might avoid
    sin--that is, that we may not be led into temptation, and thus fall into
    sin. "And lead us not into temptation."[2]
  </p>
  <p>
    Three questions are now considered: (1) What is temptation? (2) In what ways
    is one tempted and by whom? (3) How is one freed from temptation?
  </p>
  <p><b>WHAT IS TEMPTATION?</b></p>
  <p>
    Regarding the first, it must be known that to tempt is nothing other than to
    test or to prove. To tempt a man is to test or try his virtue. This is done
    in two ways just as a man's virtue requires two things. One requirement is
    to do good, the other is to avoid evil: "Turn away from evil and do
    good."[3] Sometimes a man's virtue is tried in doing good, and sometimes it
    is tested in avoiding evil. Thus, regarding the first, a person is tried in
    his readiness to do good, for example, to fast and such like. Then is thy
    virtue great when thou art quick to do good. In this way does God sometimes
    try one's virtue, not, however, because such virtue is hidden from Him, but
    in order that all might know it and it would be an example to all. God
    tempted Abraham in this way, and Job also.[4] For this reason God frequently
    sends trials to the just, who in sustaining them with all patience make
    manifest their virtue and themselves increase in virtue: "The Lord your God
    trieth you, that it may appear whether you love Him with all your heart and
    with all your soul, or not."[5] Thus does God tempt man by inciting him to
    good deeds.
  </p>
  <p>
    As to the second, the virtue of man is tried by solicitation to evil. If he
    truly resists and does not give his consent, then his virtue is great. If,
    however, he falls before the temptation, he is devoid of virtue. God tempts
    no man in this way, for it is written: "God is not a tempter of evils, and
    He tempteth no man."[6]
  </p>
  <p><b>HOW IS ONE TEMPTED?</b></p>
  <p>
    The Temptations of the Flesh.--Man is tempted by his own flesh, by the devil
    and by the world. He is tempted by the flesh in two ways. First, the flesh
    incites one to evil. It always seeks its own pleasures, namely, carnal
    pleasures, in which often is sin. He who indulges in carnal pleasures
    neglects spiritual things: "Every man is tempted by his own
    concupiscence."[7]
  </p>
  <p>
    Secondly, the flesh tempts man by enticing him away from good. For the
    spirit on its part would delight always in spiritual things, but the flesh
    asserting itself puts obstacles in the way of the spirit: "The corruptible
    body is a load upon the soul."[8] "For I am delighted with the law of God,
    according to the inward man. But I see another law in my members, fighting
    against the law of my mind, and captivating me in the law of sin, that is in
    my members."[9] This temptation which comes from the flesh is most severe,
    because our enemy, the flesh, is united to us; and as Boethius says: "There
    is no plague more dangerous than an enemy in the family circle." We must,
    therefore, be ever on our guard against this enemy: "Watch and pray that ye
    enter not into temptation."[10]
  </p>
  <p>
    The Temptations of the Devil.--The devil tempts us with extreme force. Even
    when the flesh is subdued, another tempter arises, namely, the devil against
    whom we have a heavy struggle. Of this the Apostle says: "Our wrestling is
    not against flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers, against
    the rulers of the world of this darkness, against the spirits of wickedness
    in high places."[11] For this reason he is very aptly called the tempter:
    "Lest perhaps he that tempteth should have tempted you."[12]
  </p>
  <p>
    The devil proceeds most cunningly in tempting us. He operates like a
    skillful general when about to attack a fortified city. He looks for the
    weak places in the object of his assault, and in that part where a man is
    most weak, he tempts him. He tempts man in those sins to which, after
    subduing his flesh, he is most inclined. Such, for instance, are anger,
    pride and the other spiritual sins. "Your adversary the devil, as a roaring
    lion, goeth about seeking whom he may devour."[13]
  </p>
  <p>
    How the Devil Tempts Us.--The devil does two things when he tempts us. Thus,
    he does not at once suggest something that appears to us as evil, but
    something that has a semblance of good. Thereby he would, at least in the
    beginning, turn a man from his chief purpose, and then afterwards it will be
    easier to induce him to sin, once he has been turned away ever so little.
    "Satan himself transformeth himself into an angel of light."[14] Then when
    he has once led man into sin, he so enchains him as to prevent his rising up
    out of his sin. The devil, therefore, does two things: he deceives a man
    first, and then after betraying him, enthralls him in his sin.
  </p>
  <p>
    Temptations of the World.--The world has two ways of tempting man. The first
    is excessive and intemperate desire for the goods of this life: "The desire
    of money is the root of all evil."[15] The second way is the fears
    engendered by persecutors and tyrants: "We are wrapped up in darkness."[16]
    "All that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution."[17] And
    again: "Fear not those that slay the body."[18]
  </p>
  <p>
    How Is One Freed from Temptation?--Now we have seen what temptation is, and
    also in what way and by whom one is tempted. But how is one freed from
    temptation? In this we must notice that Christ teaches us to pray, not that
    we may not be tempted, but that we may not be led into temptation. For it is
    when one overcomes temptation that one deserves the reward. Thus it is said:
    "Count it all joy when you shall fall into divers temptations."[19] And
    again: "Son, when thou comest to the service of God,... prepare thy soul for
    temptation."[20] Again: "Blessed is the man that endureth temptation; for
    when he hath been proved, he shall receive the crown of life."[21] Our Lord,
    therefore, teaches us to pray that we be not led into temptation, by giving
    our consent to it: "Let no temptation take hold on you, but such as is
    human."[22] The reason is that it is human to be tempted, but to give
    consent is devilish.
  </p>
  <p>
    But does God lead one to evil, that he should pray: "Lead us not into
    temptation"? I reply that God is said to lead a person into evil by
    permitting him to the extent that, because of his many sins, He withdraws
    His grace from man, and as a result of this withdrawal man does fall into
    sin. Therefore, we sing in the Psalm: "When my strength shall fail, do not
    Thou forsake me."[23] God, however, directs man by the fervor of charity
    that he be not led into temptation. For charity even in its smallest degree
    is able to resist any kind of sin: "Many waters cannot quench charity."[24]
    He also guides man by the light of his intellect in which he teaches him
    what he should do. For as the Philosopher says: "Every one who sins is
    ignorant."[25] "I will give thee understanding and I will instruct
    thee."[26] It was for this last that David prayed, saying: "Enlighten my
    eyes that I never sleep in death; lest at any time my enemy say: I have
    prevailed against him."[27] We have this through the gift of understanding.
    Therefore, when we refuse to consent to temptation, we keep our hearts pure:
    "Blessed are the clean of heart, for they shall see God."[28] And it follows
    from this petition that we are led up to the sight of God, and to it may God
    lead us all!

  <h3>SEVENTH PETITION: "But Deliver Us from Evil. Amen."</h3>
  <p>
    The Lord has already taught us to pray for forgiveness of our sins, and how
    to avoid temptations. In this petition, He teaches us to pray to be
    preserved from evil, and indeed from all evil in general, such as sin,
    illness, affliction and all others, as St. Augustine explains it.[1] But
    since we have already mentioned sin and temptation, we now must consider
    other evils, such as adversity and all afflictions of this world. From these
    God preserves us in a fourfold manner.
  </p>
  <p>
    First, He preserves us from affliction itself; but this is very rare because
    it is the lot of the just in this world to suffer, for it is written: "All
    that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution."[2] Once in a
    while, however, God does prevent a man from being afflicted by some evil;
    this is when He knows such a one to be weak and unable to bear it. Just so a
    physician does not prescribe violent medicines to a weak patient. "Behold, I
    have given before thee a door opened, which no man can shut; because thou
    hast little strength."[3] In heaven this will be a general thing, for there
    no one shall be afflicted. "In six troubles," those, namely, of this present
    life which is divided into six periods, "He shall deliver thee, and in the
    seventh evil shall not touch thee."[4] "They shall no more hunger nor
    thirst."[5]
  </p>
  <p>
    Second, God delivers us from afflictions when He consoles us in them; for
    unless He console us, we could not long persevere: "We were pressed out of
    measure above our strength so that we were weary even of life."[6] "But God,
    who comforteth the humble, comforted us."[7] "According to the multitude of
    my sorrows in my heart, Thy comforts have given joy to my soul."[8]
  </p>
  <p>
    Third, God bestows so many good things upon those who are afflicted that
    their evils are forgotten: "After the storm Thou makest a calm."[9] The
    afflictions and trials of this world, therefore, are not to be feared, both
    because consolations accompany them and because they are of short duration:
    "For that which is at present momentary and light of our tribulation,
    worketh for us above measure exceedingly an eternal weight of glory."[10]
  </p>
  <p>
    Fourth, we are preserved from afflictions in this way that all temptations
    and trials are conducive to our own good. We do not pray, "Deliver us from
    tribulation," but "from evil." This is because tribulations bring a crown to
    the just, and for that reason the Saints rejoiced in their sufferings: "We
    glory also in tribulations, knowing that tribulation worketh patience."[11]
    "In time of tribulation Thou forgivest sins."[12]
  </p>
  <p><b>THE VALUE OF PATIENCE</b></p>
  <p>
    God, therefore, delivers man from evil and from affliction by converting
    them to his good. This is a sign of supreme wisdom to divert evil to good.
    And patience in bearing trials is a result of this. The other virtues
    operate by good things, but patience operates in evil things, and, indeed,
    it is very necessary in evil things, namely, in adversity: "The learning of
    a man is known by his patience."[13]
  </p>
  <p>
    The Holy Spirit through the gift of wisdom has us use this prayer, and by it
    we arrive at supreme happiness which is the reward of peace. For it is by
    patience we obtain peace, whether in time of prosperity or of adversity. For
    this reason the peace-makers are called the children of God, because they
    are like to God in this, that nothing can hurt God and nothing can hurt
    them, whether it be prosperity or adversity: "Blessed are the peace-makers,
    for they shall be called the children of God."[14]
  </p>
  <p>"Amen." This is general ratification of all the petitions.[15]</p>
  <h3>A SHORT EXPLANATION OF THE WHOLE PRAYER</h3>
  <p>
    By way of brief summary, it should be known that the Lord's Prayer contains
    all that we ought to desire and all that we ought to avoid. Now, of all
    desirable things, that must be most desired which is most loved, and that is
    God.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, you seek, first of all, the glory of God when you say: "Hallowed
    be Thy name." You should desire three things from God, and they concern
    yourself. The first is that you may arrive at eternal life. And you pray for
    this when you say: "Thy kingdom come." The second is that you will do the
    will of God and His justice. You pray for this in the words: "Thy will be
    done on earth as it is in heaven." The third is that you may have the
    necessaries of life. And thus you pray: "Give us this day our daily bread."
    Concerning all these things the Lord says: "Seek ye first the kingdom of
    God," which complies with the second, "and all these things shall be added
    unto you,"[16] as in accord with the third.
  </p>
  <p>
    We must avoid and flee from all things which are opposed to the good. For,
    as we have seen, good is above all things to be desired. This good is
    fourfold. First, there is the glory of God, and no evil is contrary to this:
    "If thou sin, what shalt thou hurt Him? And if thou do justly, what shall
    thou give Him?"[17] Whether it be the evil inasmuch as God punishes it, or
    whether it be the good in that God rewards it--all redound to His glory.
  </p>
  <p>
    The second good is eternal life, to which sin is contrary: because eternal
    life is lost by sin. And so to remove this evil we pray: "Forgive us our
    trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us." The third good is
    justice and good works, and temptation is contrary to this, because
    temptation hinders us from doing good. We pray, therefore, to have this evil
    taken away in the words: "Lead us not into temptation." The fourth good is
    all the necessaries of life, and opposed to this are troubles and
    adversities. And we seek to remove them when we pray: "But deliver us from
    evil. Amen."

    'The word 'Amen' which brings the Lord's Prayer to a close contains, as it
    were, the germs of many of those thoughts and considerations which we have
    just treated Indeed, so frequent was this Hebrew word in the mouth of Our
    Lord that it pleased the Holy. Spirit to have it retained in the Church of
    God. The meaning of it may be said to be: 'Know that thy prayers are heard.'
    It has the force of a response, as if God answers the prayer of the
    suppliant and graciously dismisses him after He has kindly heard his
    prayers" ("Roman Catechism," "loc. cit.," Chapter xvii. 4). 16. Matt., vi.
