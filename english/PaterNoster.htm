<H3>FIVE QUALITIES OF PRAYER</H3>

<P>"Our Father who art in heaven." Among all other prayers, the Lord's Prayer holds the chief 
place. It has five excellent qualities which are required in all prayer. A prayer must be 
confident, ordered, suitable, devout and humble.
<P>It must be confident: "Let us, therefore, go with confidence to the throne of grace."[1] It 
must not be wanting in faith, as it is said: "But let him ask in faith, nothing 
wavering."[2] That this is a most trustworthy prayer is reasonable, since it was formed by 
Him who is our Advocate and the most wise Petitioner for us: "In whom are hid all the 
treasures of wisdom and knowledge;"[3] and of whom it is said: "For we have an advocate 
with the Father, Jesus Christ the just one."[4] Hence, St. Cyprian says: "Since we have 
Christ as our Advocate with the Father for our sins, when we pray on account of our faults, 
we use the very words of our Advocate."[5]
<P>Furthermore, this prayer is even more worthy of confidence in that He who taught us how to 
pray, graciously hears our prayer together with the Father, as it is said in the Psalm: "He 
shall cry to Me, and I will hear him."[6] Thus writes St. Cyprian: "It is a friendly, 
familiar, and devout prayer to ask of the Lord in His own words."[7] And so no one goes 
away from this prayer without fruit. St. Augustine says that through it our venial sins are 
remitted.[8]

<P>Moreover, our prayer must be suitable, so that a person asks of God in prayer what is good 
for him. St. John Damascene says: "Prayer is the asking of what is right and fitting from 
God."[9] Many times our prayer is not heard because we seek that which is not good for us: 
"You ask and you do not receive, because you ask amiss."[10] To know, indeed, what one 
ought to pray for is most difficult; for it is not easy to know what one ought to desire. 
Those things which we rightly seek in prayer are rightly desired; hence the Apostle says: 
"For we know not what we should pray for as we ought."[11] Christ Himself is our Teacher; 
it is He who teaches us what we ought to pray for, and it was to Him that the disciples 
said: "Lord, teach us to pray."[12] Those things, therefore, which He has taught us to pray 
for, we most properly ask for. "Whatsoever words we use in prayer," says St. Augustine, "we 
cannot but utter that which is contained in our Lord's Prayer, if we pray in a suitable and 
worthy manner."[13]
<P>Our prayer ought also to be ordered as our desires should be ordered, for prayer is but the 
expression of desire. Now, it is the correct order that we prefer spiritual to bodily 
things, and heavenly things to those merely earthly. This is according to what is written: 
"Seek ye first therefore the kingdom of God and His justice, and all these things shall be 
added unto you."[14] Here Our Lord shows that heavenly things must be sought first, and 
then things material.
<P>Our prayer must be devout, because a rich measure of piety makes the sacrifice of prayer 
acceptable to God: "In Thy name I will lift up my hands. Let my soul be filled with marrow 
and fatness."[15] Many times because of the length of our prayers our devotion grows cool; 
hence Our Lord taught us to avoid wordiness in our prayers: "When you are praying, speak 
not much."[16] And St. Augustine says: "Let much talking be absent from prayer; but as long 
as fervor continues, let prayer likewise go on."[17] For this reason the Lord made His 
Prayer short. Devotion in prayer rises from charity which is our love of God and neighbor, 
both of which are evident in this prayer. Our love for God is seen in that we call God "our 
Father;" and our love for our neighbor when we say: "Our Father . . . forgive us our 
trespasses," and this leads us to love of neighbor.
<P>Prayer ought to be humble: "He hath had regard for the prayer of the humble."[18] This is 
seen in the parable of the Pharisee and the Publican (Luke, xviii. 9-15), and also in the 
words of Judith: "The prayer of the humble and the meek hath always pleased Thee."[19] This 
same humility is observed in this prayer, for true humility is had when a person does not 
presume upon his own powers, but from the divine strength expects all that he asks for.
<P>It must be noted that prayer brings about three good effects. First, prayer is an 
efficacious and useful remedy against evils. Thus, it delivers us from the sins we have 
committed: "Thou hast forgiven the wickedness of my sin. For this shall every one that is 
holy pray to Thee in a seasonable time."[20] The thief on the Cross prayed and received 
forgiveness: "This day thou shalt be with Me in paradise."[21] Thus also prayed the 
Publican, and "went down to his home justified."[22] Prayer, also, frees one from the fear 
of future sin, and from trials and sadness of soul: "Is any one of you sad? Let him 
pray."[23] Again it delivers one from persecutors and enemies: "Instead of making me a 
return of love, they detracted me, but I gave myself to prayer."[24]
<P>In the second place, prayer is efficacious and useful to obtain all that one desires: "All 
things whatsoever you ask when you pray, believe that you shall receive."[25] When our 
prayers are not heard, either we do not persevere in prayer, whereas "we ought always to 
pray, and not to faint,"[26] or we do not ask for that which is more conducive to our 
salvation. "Our good Lord often does not give us what we wish," says St. Augustine, 
"because it would really be what we do not wish for." St. Paul gives us an example of this 
in that he thrice prayed that the sting of his flesh be removed from him, and his prayer 
was not heard.[27] Thirdly, prayer is profitable because it makes us friends of God: "Let 
my prayer be directed as incense in Thy sight."[28]

<H3>THE OPENING WORDS OF THE LORD'S PRAYER</H3>
<P><B>PREPARATION FOR THE PETITIONS</B>
<P>Our FATHER.--Note here two things, namely, that God is our Father, and what we owe to Him 
because He is our Father. God is our Father by reason of our special creation, in that He 
created us in His image and likeness, and did not so create all inferior creatures: "Is not 
He thy Father, that made thee, and created thee?"[1] Likewise God is our Father in that He 
governs us, yet treats us as masters, and not servants, as is the case with all other 
things. "For Thy providence, Father, governeth all things;"[2] and "with great favor 
disposest of us."[3] God is our Father also by reason of adoption. To other creatures He 
has given but a small gift, but to us an heredity--indeed, "if sons, heirs also."[4] "For 
you have not received the spirit of bondage again in fear; but you have received the spirit 
of adoption of sons, whereby we cry, Abba (Father)."[5]

<P>We owe God, our Father, four things. First, honor: "If then I be a Father, where is My 
honor?"[6] Now, honor consists in three qualities. (1) It consists in giving praise to God: 
"The sacrifice of praise shall glorify Me."[7] This ought not merely come from the lips, 
but also from the heart, for: "This people draw near Me with their mouth, and with their 
lips glorify Me, but their heart is far from Me."[8] (2) Honor, again, consists in purity 
of body towards oneself: "Glorify and bear God in your body."[9] (3) Honor also consists in 
just estimate of one's neighbor, for: "The king's honor loveth judgment."[10]
<P>Secondly, since God is our Father, we ought to imitate Him: "Thou shalt call Me Father, and 
shalt not cease to walk after Me."[11] This imitation of our Father consists of three 
things. (1) It consists in love: "Be ye therefore followers of God, as most dear children; 
and walk in love."[12] This love of God must be from the heart. (2) It consists in mercy: 
"Be ye merciful."[13] This mercy must likewise come from the heart, and it must be in deed. 
(3) Finally, imitation of God consists in being perfect, since love and mercy should be 
perfect: "Be ye therefore perfect, as also your Heavenly Father is perfect."[14]
<P>Thirdly, we owe God obedience: "Shall we not much more obey the Father of spirits?"[15] We 
must obey God for three reasons. First, because He is our Lord: "All things that the Lord 
has spoken we will do, we will be obedient."[16] Secondly, because He has given us the 
example of obedience, for the true Son of God "became obedient to His Father even unto 
death."[17] Thirdly, because it is for our good: "I will play before the Lord who hath 
chosen me."[18] Fourthly, we owe God patience when we are chastised by Him: "Reject not the 
correction of the Lord; and do not faint when thou art chastised by Him. For whom the Lord 
loveth He chastises; and as a father in the son He pleaseth Himself.[19]
<P>OUR Father.--From this we see that we owe our neighbor both love and reverence. We must 
love our neighbor because we are all brothers, and all men are sons of God, our Father: 
"For he that loveth not his brother whom he seeth, how can he love God whom he seeth 
not?"[20] We owe reverence to our neighbor because he is also a child of God: "Have we not 
all one Father? Hath not one God created us? Why then does everyone of us despise his 
brother?"[21] And again: "With honor preventing one another."[22] We do this because of the 
fruit we receive, for "He became to all that obey the cause of eternal salvation."[23]
<P>(For "Questions for Discussion" see Chapter 6.)
<P><b>THE PREEMINENCE OF GOD</b>
<P>Who Art in Heaven.--Among all that is necessary for one who prays, faith is above all 
important: "Let him ask in faith, nothing wavering."[24] Hence, the Lord, teaching us to 
pray, first mentions that which causes faith to spring up, namely, the kindness of a 
father. So, He says "Our Father," in the meaning which is had in the following: "If you 
then being evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your 
Father from heaven give the good Spirit to them that ask him!"[25] Then, He says "Who art 
in heaven" because of the greatness of His power: "To Thee have I lifted up my eyes, who 
dwellest in heaven."[26]
<P>The words, "who art in heaven," signify three things. First, it serves as a preparation for 
him who utters the prayer, for, as it is said: "Before prayer prepare thy soul."[27] Thus, 
"in heaven" is understood for the glory of heaven: "For your reward is very great in 
heaven."[28] And this preparation ought to be in the form of an imitation of heavenly 
things, since the son ought to imitate his Father: "Therefore, as we have borne the image 
of the earthly, let us bear also the image of the heavenly."[29] So also this preparation 
ought to be through contemplation of heavenly things, because men are wont to direct their 
thoughts to where they have a Father and others whom they love, as it is written: "For 
where thy treasure is, there is thy heart also."[30] The Apostle wrote: "Our conversation 
is in heaven."[31] Likewise, we prepare through attention to heavenly things, so that we 
may then seek only spiritual things from Him who is in heaven: "Seek things that are above, 
where Christ is."[32]
<P>"Who art in heaven" can also pertain to Him who hears us, who is nearest to us; and then 
the "in heaven" is understood to mean "in devout persons" in whom God dwells, as it is 
written: "Thou, O Lord, art among us."[33] For holy persons are called "the heavens" in the 
Psalm: "The heavens show forth the glory of God,"[34] since God dwells in the devout 
through faith. "That Christ may dwell by faith in your hearts."[35] God also dwells in us 
through love: "He that abideth in charity, abideth in God and God in him."[36] And also 
through the keeping of the commandments: "If any one love Me, he will keep My word, and My 
Father will love him, and We will come to him, and will make Our abode with him."[37]
<P>In the third place, "who art in heaven" can pertain to Him who is in heaven, He who cannot 
be included in the physical heavens, for "the heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot 
contain Thee."[38] And so it can mean that God is all-seeing in His survey of us, in that 
He sees us from above, that is, from heaven: "Because He hath looked forth from His high 
sanctuary; from heaven the Lord hath looked upon the earth."[39] It also signifies how 
sublime is God in His power: "The Lord hath prepared His throne in heaven";[40] and that He 
lives without change through eternity: "But Thou, O Lord, endurest forever."[41] And again: 
"Thy years shall not fail."[42] And so of Christ was it written: "His throne as the days of 
heaven."[43]
<P>The Philosopher says that on account of the incorruptibility of the heavens all have 
considered them as the abode of spirits.[44] And so "who art in heaven" tends to give us 
confidence in our prayer which arises from a threefold consideration: of God's power, of 
our familiarity with Him, and of the fitness of our requests.
<P>The power of Him to whom we pray is implied if we consider "heaven" as the corporeal 
heavens. God is not limited by any physical bounds: "Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith 
the Lord."[45] Nevertheless, He is said to be in the corporeal heavens to indicate two 
things: the extent of His power and the greatness of His nature. The former of these 
attributes is contrary to the view that all things happen out of necessity, by a fate 
regulated by the celestial bodies; and thus all prayer would be vain and useless. But such 
is absurd, since God dwells in the heavens as their Lord: "The Lord has prepared His throne 
in heaven."[46] The latter attribute, viz., His sublime nature, is against those who in 
praying propose or build up any corporeal images of God. Therefore, God is stated to be "in 
heaven" in that He exceeds all corporeal things, and even the desires and intellects of 
men; so that whatsoever man thinks or desires is far less than God. Thus, it is said: 
"Behold, God is great, exceeding our knowledge."[47] And again: "The Lord is high above all 
nations."[48] And finally: "To whom then have you likened God? Or what image will you make 
for Him?"[49]
<P>Familiar intercourse with God is shown through this "in heaven." Some indeed have said that 
because of His great distance from us God does not care for men, and they cite these words: 
"He walketh about the poles of heaven, and He doth not consider our things."[50] Against 
this is the fact that God is nearer to us than we are to ourselves. This brings confidence 
to one who prays. First, because of the nearness of God: "The Lord is nigh unto all them 
that call upon Him."[51] Hence, it is written: "But thou when thou shalt pray, enter into 
thy chamber,"[52] that is, into thy heart. Second, because of the intercession of all the 
Saints among whom God dwells; for from this arises faith to ask through their merits for 
what we desire: "Turn to some of the Saints,"[53] and, "Pray one for another, that you may 
be saved."[54]
<P>This part of the prayer--that is, "in heaven"--is appropriate and fitting also, if "in 
heaven" is taken to mean that spiritual and eternal good in which true happiness consists. 
Because of it our desires are lifted up towards heavenly things; since our desires ought to 
tend towards where we have our Father, because there is our true home: "Seek the things 
that are above."[55] And again: "Unto an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that 
cannot fade, reserved in heaven for you."[56] Moreover, from it we are told that, if our 
life is to be in heaven, then we ought to be conformed to our Heavenly Father: "Such as is 
the heavenly, such also are they that are heavenly."[57] From all this the words "in 
heaven" are most appropriate in prayer in that they signify both a heavenly desire and 
heavenly life.

<P>1. Deut., xxxii. 6. "The first word which, by the command and institution of Our Lord, we 
say in this prayer is 'Father.' The Saviour could, indeed, have begun this prayer with some 
other word more expressive of His majesty, such as 'Creator' or 'Lord.' Yet, He omitted all 
such expressions as they might be associated with fear, and instead of them He has chosen a 
word which inspires love and confidence. What name is more tender than that of Father? It 
is a name which expresses both indulgence and love" ("Roman Catechism," Lord's Prayer, 
Chapter IX, 1).

<H3>THE FIRST PETITION: "Hallowed Be Thy Name."</H3>


<P>This is the first petition, and in it we ask that God's name be manifested and declared in 
us. The name of God, first of all, is wonderful because it works wonders in all creatures. 
Thus said Our Lord: "In My name they shall cast out devils, they shall speak new tongues. 
They shall take up serpents; and if they shall drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt 
them."[1]

<P><B>GOD'S NAME IS LOVABLE</B>
<P>This name is lovable: "There is no other name under heaven given to men, whereby we must be 
saved."[2] We all should desire to be saved. We have an example in Blessed Ignatius, who 
had such great love for the name of Christ that, when Trajan ordered him to deny it, he 
affirmed that it could not be dragged from his mouth. Then, the emperor threatened to have 
him beheaded, and thus take the name of Christ out of the mouth of the Saint. But Ignatius 
replied: "Even though you take it from my mouth, you will never snatch it from my heart. I 
have this name written in my heart and there I never cease to invoke it." Trajan heard this 
and wished to put it to the test. He had the servant of God beheaded and then commanded 
that his heart be taken out, and there upon the heart was found the name of Christ 
inscribed in letters of gold. This name had been engraved on the heart as a seal.

<P><B>GOD'S NAME IS VENERABLE</B>
<P>The name of God is venerable: "In the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those that 
are in heaven, on earth, and under the earth."[3] "Those that are in heaven" refers to the 
Angels and the blessed; "those that are on earth" to people living in this world, who do so 
for love of heaven which they wish to gain; "those under the earth" to the damned, who do 
so out of fear.
<P><B>GOD'S NAME IS INEFFABLE</B>

<P>This name is ineffable, for in the telling of it every tongue is wholly inadequate. 
Accordingly, it is sometimes compared to created things as, for instance, it is likened to 
a rock because of its firmness: "Upon this rock I will build My Church."[4] It is likened 
to a fire because of its purifying power; for as fire purifies metal, so does God purify 
the hearts of sinners: "My God is a consuming fire."[5] It is compared to light because of 
its power of enlightening; for as light illumines the darkness, so does the name of God 
overcome the darkness of the mind: "O my God, enlighten my darkness."[6]

<P><B>MEANING OF HALLOWED</B>
<P>We pray that this name may be manifested in us, that it be known and revered as holy. Now 
"holy" (or hallowed) may have a threefold meaning. First, it is the same as firm. Thus, 
those who are firmly established in eternal happiness are all the blessed in heaven, the 
Saints. In this sense, none is a "Saint" on earth because here all is continually 
changeable. As St. Augustine says: "I sank away from Thee, O Lord, and I wandered too much 
astray from Thee who art my firm support."[7]
<P>Secondly, "holy" may be understood as "unearthly." The holy ones who are in heaven have 
naught earthly about them: "I count (all things) . . . but as dung, that I may gain 
Christ."[8] Earth may signify sinners. This would arise as reference to production. For if 
the earth is not cultivated, it will produce thorns and thistles. Similarly, if the soul of 
the sinner is not cultivated by grace, it will produce only thistles and thorns of sins: 
"Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee."[9] Again, earth may signify sinners as 
regards its darkness. The earth is dark and opaque; and so also is the sinner dark and 
obstructive to light: "Darkness was on the face of the deep."[10] And, finally, earth is a 
dry element which will fall to pieces unless it is mixed with the moisture of water. So God 
placed earth just above water: "Who established the earth above the waters."[11] So also 
the soul of the sinner is dry and without moisture as it is said: "My soul is as earth 
without water unto Thee."[12]
<P>"Holy" may, finally, be understood as "laved in blood," since the Saints in heaven are 
called Saints because they have been washed in blood: "These are they who are come out of 
great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and have made them white in the blood of 
the Lamb."[13] And again: "He hath washed us from our sins in His blood."[14]

<H3>THE SECOND PETITION: "Thy Kingdom Come."</H3>

<P>The Holy Spirit makes us love, desire and pray rightly; and instills in us, first of all, a 
fear whereby we ask that the name of God be sanctified. He gives us another gift, that of 
piety. This is a devout and loving affection for our Father and for all men who are in 
trouble. Now, since God is our Father, we ought not only reverence and fear Him, but also 
have towards Him a sweet and pious affection. This love makes us pray that the kingdom of 
God may come: "We should live soberly and justly in this world, looking for the blessed 
hope and coming of the glory of the great God."[1]


<P>It may be asked of us: "Why, since the kingdom of God always was, do we then ask that it 
may come?" This, however, can be understood in three ways. First, a king sometimes has only 
the right to a kingdom or dominion, and yet his rule has not been declared because the men 
in his kingdom are not as yet subject to him. His rule or dominion will come only when the 
men of his kingdom are his subjects. Now, God is by His very essence and nature the Lord of 
all things; and Christ being God and Man is the Lord over all things: "And He gave Him 
power and glory and a kingdom."[2] It is, therefore, necessary that all things be subject 
to Him. This is not yet the case, but will be so at the end of the world: "For He must 
reign, until He hath put all His enemies under His feet."[3] Hence it is for this we pray 
when we say: "Thy kingdom come."

<P><B>WHY WE PRAY THUS</B>
<P>In so doing we pray for a threefold purpose: that the just may be strengthened, that 
sinners may be punished, and that death be destroyed. Now, the reason is that men are 
subject to Christ in two ways, either willingly or unwillingly. Again, the will of God is 
so efficacious that it must be fully complied with; and God does wish that all things be 
subject to Christ. Hence, two things are necessary: either man will do the will of God by 
subjecting himself to His commands, as do the just; or God shall exert His will and punish 
those who are sinners and His enemies; and this will take place at the end of the world: 
"Until I make Thy enemies Thy footstool."[4]

<P>It is enjoined upon the faithful to pray that the kingdom of God may come, namely, that 
they subject themselves completely to Him. But it is a terrible thing for sinners, because 
for them to ask the coming of God's kingdom is nothing else than to ask that they be 
subjected to punishment: "Woe to them that desire the day of the Lord!"[5] By this prayer, 
too, we ask that death be destroyed. Since Christ is life, death cannot exist in His 
kingdom,[6] because death is the opposite of life: "And the enemy, death, shall be 
destroyed last."[7] "He shall cast death down headlong forever."[8] And this shall take 
place at the last resurrection: "Who will reform the body of our lowness, made like to the 
body of His glory."[9]

<P>In a second sense, the kingdom of heaven signifies the glory of paradise. Nor is this to be 
wondered at, for a kingdom ("regnum") is nothing other than a government ("regimen"). That 
will be the best government where nothing is found contrary to the will of the governor. 
Now, the will of God is the very salvation of men, for He "will have all men to be 
saved";[10] and this especially shall come to pass in paradise where there will be nothing 
contrary to man's salvation. "They shall gather out of His kingdom all scandals."[11] In 
this world, however, there are many things contrary to the salvation of men. Hence, when we 
pray, "Thy kingdom come," we pray that we might participate in the heavenly kingdom and in 
the glory of paradise.
<P><B>WHY WE DESIRE THIS KINGDOM</B>
<P>This kingdom is greatly to be desired for three reasons. (1) It is to be greatly desired 
because of the perfect justice that obtains there: "Thy people shall be all just."[12] In 
this world the bad are mingled with the good, but in heaven there will be no wicked and no 
sinners. (2) The heavenly kingdom is to be desired because of its perfect liberty. Here 
below there is no liberty, although all men naturally desire it; but above there will be 
perfect liberty without any form of oppression: "Because the creature also shall be 
delivered from the servitude of corruption."[13] Not only will men then be free, but indeed 
they will all be kings: "And Thou hast made us to our God a kingdom."[14] This is because 
all shall be of one will with God, and God shall will what the Saints will, and the Saints 
shall will whatsoever God wills; hence, in the will of God shall their will be done All, 
therefore, shall reign, because the will of all shall be done, and the Lord shall be their 
crown: "In that day, the Lord of hosts shall be a crown of glory and a garland of joy to 
the residue of His people."[15] (3) The kingdom of God is to be desired because of the 
marvellous riches of heaven: "The eye hath not seen O God, besides Thee, what things Thou 
hast prepared for them that wait for Thee."[16] And also: "Who satisfieth thy desire with 
good things."[17]

<P>Note that man will find everything that he seeks for in this world more excellently and 
more perfectly in God alone. Thus, if it is pleasure you seek, then in God you will find 
the highest pleasure: "You shall see and your heart shall rejoice."[18] "And everlasting 
joy shall be upon their heads."[19] If it is riches, there you will find it in abundance: 
"When the soul strays from Thee, she looks for things apart from Thee, but she finds all 
things impure and useless until she returns to Thee," says St. Augustine.[20]

<P>Lastly, "Thy kingdom come" is understood in another sense because sometimes sin reigns in 
this world. This occurs when man is so disposed that he follows at once the enticement of 
sin. "Let not sin reign in your mortal body,"[21] but let God reign in your heart; and this 
will be when thou art prepared to obey God and keep all His Commandments. Therefore, when 
we pray to God that His kingdom may come, we pray that God and not sin may reign in us.

<P>May we through this petition arrive at that happiness of which the Lord speaks: "Blessed 
are the meek!"[22] Now, according to what we have first explained above, viz., that man 
desires that God be the Lord of all things, then let him not avenge injuries that are done 
him, but let him leave that for the Lord. If you avenge yourself, you do not really desire 
that the kingdom of God may come. According to our second explanation (i.e., regarding the 
glory of paradise), if you await the coming of this kingdom which is the glory of paradise, 
you need not worry about losing earthly things. Likewise, if according to the third 
explanation, you pray that God may reign within you, then you must be humble, for He is 
Himself most humble: "Learn of Me because I am meek and humble of heart."[23]

<H3>THE THIRD PETITION: "Thy Will Be Done on Earth as It Is in Heaven."</H3>
<P>The third gift which the Holy Spirit works in us is called the gift of knowledge. The Holy 
Spirit not only gives us the gift of fear and the gift of piety (which is a sweet affection 
for God, as we have said); but He also makes man wise. It was this for which David prayed: 
"Teach me goodness and discipline and knowledge."[1] This knowledge which the Holy Spirit 
teaches us is that whereby man lives justly. Among all that goes to make up knowledge and 
wisdom in man, the principal wisdom is that man should not depend solely upon his own 
opinion: "Lean not upon thy own prudence."[2] Those who put all their trust in their own 
judgment so that they do not trust others, but only themselves, are always found to be 
stupid and are so adjudged by others: "Hast thou seen a man wise in his own conceit? There 
shall be more hope of a fool than of him."[3]

<P><B>THE WILL OF GOD</B>
<P>Out of humility one does not trust one's own knowledge: "Where humility is there is also 
wisdom."[4] The proud trust only themselves. Now, the Holy Spirit, through the gift of 
wisdom, teaches us that we do not our own will but the will of God. It is through this gift 
that we pray of God that His "will be done on earth as it is in heaven." And in this is 
seen the gift of knowledge. Thus, one says to God "let Thy will be done," in the same way 
as one who is sick desires something from the physician; and his will is not precisely his 
own, because it is the will of the physician. Otherwise, if his desire were purely from his 
own will, he would be indeed foolish. So we ought not to pray other than that in us God's 
will may be done; that is, that His will be accomplished in us. The heart of man is only 
right when it is in accord with the will of God. This did Christ: "Because I came down from 
heaven, not to do My own will but the will of Him that sent Me."[5] Christ, as God, has the 
same will with the Father; but as a Man He has a distinct will from the Father's, and it 
was according to this that He says He does not do His will but the Father's. Hence, He 
teaches us to pray and to ask: "Thy will be done."[6]

<P><B>WHAT DOES GOD WILL?</B>
<P>But what is this that is asked? Does not the Psalm say: "Whatsoever the Lord pleased [has 
willed], He hath done?"[7] Now, if He has done all that He has willed both in heaven and on 
earth, what then is the meaning of this: "Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven"? To 
understand this we must know that God wills of us three things, and we pray that these be 
accomplished. The first thing that God wills is that we may have eternal life. Whoever 
makes something for a certain purpose, has a will regarding it which is in accord with the 
purpose for which he made it. In like manner, God made man, but it was not for no purpose, 
as it is written: "Remember what my substance is; for hast Thou made all the children of 
men in vain?"[8]
<P>Hence, God made men for a purpose; but this purpose was not for their mere pleasures, for 
also the brutes have these, but it was that they might have eternal life. The Lord, 
therefore, wills that men have eternal life. Now, when that for which a thing is made is 
accomplished, it is said to be saved; and when this is not accomplished, it is said to be 
lost. So when man gains eternal life, he is said to be saved, and it is this that the Lord 
wills: "Now, this is the will of My Father that sent Me, that every one who seeth the Son 
and believeth in Him may have life everlasting."[9] This will of God is already fulfilled 
for the Angels and for the Saints in the Fatherland, for they see God and know and enjoy 
Him. We, however, desire that, as the will of God is done for the blessed who are in 
heaven, it likewise be done for us who are on earth. For this we pray when we say "Thy will 
be done" for us who are on earth, as it is for the Saints who are in heaven.


<P><B>THE COMMANDMENTS: GOD'S WILL</B>
<P>In the second place, the will of God for us is that we keep His Commandments. When a person 
desires something, he not only wills that which he desires, but also everything which will 
bring that about. Thus, in order to bring about a healthy condition which he desires, a 
physician also wills to put into effect diet, medicine, and other needs. We arrive at 
eternal life through observance of the Commandments, and, accordingly, God wills that we 
observe them: "But if thou wilt enter into life, keep the Commandments."[10] "Your 
reasonable service . . . that you may prove what is the good and the acceptable and the 
perfect will of God."[11] That is, good because it is profitable: "I am the Lord thy God 
that teach thee profitable things."[12] And acceptable, that is, pleasing: "Light is risen 
to the just; and joy to the right heart."[13] And perfect, because noble: "Be you therefore 
perfect, as your Heavenly Father is perfect."[14] When we say "Thy will be done," we pray 
that we may fulfill the Commandments of God. This will of God is done by the just, but it 
is not yet done by sinners. "In heaven" here signifies the just; while "on earth" refers to 
sinners. We, therefore, pray that the will of God may be done "on earth," that is, by 
sinners, "as it is in heaven," that is, by the just.[15]

<P><B>LET THY WILL BE DONE</B>
<P>It must be noted that the very words used in this petition teach us a lesson. It does not 
say "Do" or "Let us do," but it says, "[Let] Thy will be done," because two things are 
necessary for eternal life: the grace of God and the will of man. Although God has made man 
without man, He cannot save man without his cooperation. Thus, says St. Augustine: "Who 
created thee without thyself, cannot save thee without thyself,"[16] because God wills that 
man cooperate with Him or at least put no obstacle in His way: "Turn ye to Me, saith the 
Lord of hosts, and I will turn to you."[17] "By the grace of God, I am what I am. And His 
grace in me hath not been void."[18] Do not, therefore, presume on your own strength, but 
trust in God's grace; and be not negligent, but use the zeal you have. It does not say, 
therefore, "Let us do," lest it would seem that the grace of God were left out; nor does it 
say, "Do," lest it would appear that our will and our zeal do not matter. He does say "Let 
it be done" through the grace of God at the same time using our desire and our own efforts.
<P>Thirdly, the will of God in our regard is that men be restored to that state and dignity in 
which the first man was created. This was a condition in which the spirit and soul felt no 
resistance from sensuality and the flesh. As long as the soul was subject to God, the flesh 
was in such subjection to the spirit that no corruption of death, or weakness, or any of 
the passions were felt. When, however, the spirit and the soul, which were between God and 
the flesh, rebelled against God by sin, then the body rebelled against the soul. From that 
time death and weaknesses began to be felt together with continual rebellion of sensuality 
against the spirit: "I see another law in my members, fighting against the law of my 
mind."[19] "The flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh."[20]
<P>Thus, there is an endless strife between the flesh and the spirit, and man is continually 
being brought lower by sin. The will of God, therefore, is that man be restored to his 
primal state so that no more would the flesh rebel against the spirit: "For this is the 
will of God, your sanctification."[21] Now, this will of God cannot be fulfilled in this 
life, but it will be fulfilled in the resurrection of the just, when glorified bodies shall 
arise incorrupt and most perfect: "It is sown a natural body; it shall rise a spiritual 
body."[22] In the just the will of God is fulfilled relative to the spirit, which abides in 
justice and knowledge and perfect life. Therefore, when we say "Thy will be done," let us 
pray that His will also may be done regarding the flesh. Thus, the sense of "Thy will be 
done on earth" is that it may be done "for our flesh," and "as it is in heaven" means in 
our spirit. Thus, we take "in heaven" for our spirit, and "on earth" as our flesh.[23]
<P>By means of this petition we arrive at the happiness of those who mourn, as it is written: 
"Blessed are they that mourn; for they shall be comforted."[24] This can be applied to each 
of the threefold explanations we have given above. According to the first we desire eternal 
life. And in this very desire we are brought to a mourning of soul: "Woe is me, that my 
sojourning is prolonged."[25] This desire in the Saints is so vehement that because of it 
they wish for death, which in itself is something naturally to be avoided: "But we are 
confident and have a good will to be absent rather from the body and to be present with the 
Lord."[26] Likewise, according to our second explanation--viz., that we will to keep the 
Commandments --they who do so are in sorrow. For although such be sweet for the soul, it is 
bitter indeed for the flesh which is continually kept in discipline. "Going, they went and 
wept," which refers to the flesh, "But coming, they shall come with joyfulness," which 
pertains to the soul.[27] Again, from our third explanation (that is, concerning the 
struggle which is ever going on between the flesh and the spirit), we see that this too 
causes sorrow. For it cannot but happen that the soul be wounded by the venial faults of 
the flesh; and so in expiating for these the soul is in mourning. "Every night," that is, 
the darkness of sin, "I will wash my bed [that is, my conscience] with my tears."[28] Those 
who thus sorrow will arrive at the Fatherland, where may God bring us also!

<H3>THE FOURTH PETITION THE FOURTH PETITION "Give Us This Day Our Daily Bread."</H3>
<P>Sometimes it happens that one of great learning and wisdom becomes fearful and timid; and, 
therefore, it is necessary that he have fortitude of heart lest he lack necessities: "It is 
He that giveth strength to the weary, and increaseth force and might to them that are 
not."[1] The Holy Spirit gives this fortitude: "And the Spirit entered into me, . . . and 
He set me upon my feet."[2] This fortitude which is given by the Holy Ghost so strengthens 
the heart of man that he does not fear for the things that are necessary for him, but he 
trusts that God will provide for all his needs. The Holy Spirit who gives us this strength 
teaches us to pray to God: "Give us this day our daily bread." And thus He is called the 
Spirit of fortitude.


<P>It must be noted that in the first three petitions of this prayer only things spiritual are 
asked for--those which indeed begin to be in this world but are only brought to fruition in 
the life eternal. Thus, when we pray that the name of God be hallowed, we really ask that 
the name of God be known; when we pray that the kingdom of God may come, we ask that we may 
participate in God's kingdom; and when we pray that the will of God be done, we ask that 
His will be accomplished in us. All these things, however, although they have their 
beginning here on earth, cannot be had in their fullness except in heaven. Hence, it is 
necessary to pray for certain necessaries which can be completely had in this life. The 
Holy Spirit, then, taught us to ask for the requirements of this present life which are 
here obtainable in their fullness, and at the same time He shows that our temporal wants 
are provided us by God. It is this that is meant when we say: "Give us this day our daily 
bread."[3]
<P>In these very words the Holy Spirit teaches us to avoid five sins which are usually 
committed out of the desire for temporal things. The first sin is that man, because of an 
inordinate desire, seeks those things which go beyond his state and condition of life. He 
is not satisfied with what befits him. Thus, if he be a soldier and desires clothes, he 
will not have them suitable for a soldier, but rather for a knight; or if he be a cleric, 
clothes fit for a bishop. This vicious habit withdraws man from spiritual things, in that 
it makes his desires cleave to transitory things. The Lord taught us to avoid this vice by 
instructing us to ask for the temporal necessities of this present life as they are in 
accord with the position of each one of us. All this is understood under the name of 
"bread." And so He does not teach us to pray for that which is luxurious, nor for variety, 
nor for what is over-refined, but for bread which is common to all and without which man's 
life could not be sustained: "The chief thing for man's life is water and bread."[4] And: 
"Having food and wherewith to be covered, with these we are content."[5]
<P>The second sin is that some in acquiring temporal goods burden others and defraud them. 
This vicious practice is dangerous, because goods thus taken away can be restored only with 
difficulty. For, as St. Augustine says: "The sin is not forgiven until that which is taken 
away is restored."[6] "They eat the bread of wickedness."[7] The Lord teaches us to avoid 
this sin, and to pray for our own bread, not that of another. Robbers do not eat their own 
bread, but the bread of their neighbor.
<P>The third sin is unnecessary solicitude. There are some who are never content with what 
they have, but always want more. This is wholly immoderate, because one's desire must 
always be measured by his need: "Give me neither beggary nor riches, but give me only the 
necessaries of life."[8] We are taught to avoid this sin in the words, "our daily bread," 
that is, bread of one day or for one time.[9]

<P>The fourth sin is inordinate voracity. There are those who in one day would consume what 
would be enough for many days. Such pray not for bread for one day, but for ten days. And 
because they spend too much, it happens what they spend all their substance. "They that 
give themselves to drinking and that club together shall be consumed."[10] And: "A workman 
that is a drunkard shall not be rich."[11]

<P>The fifth sin is ingratitude. A person grows proud in his riches, and does not realize that 
what he has comes from God. This is a grave fault, for all things that we have, be they 
spiritual or temporal, are from God: "All things are Thine; and we have given Thee what we 
received of Thy hand."[12] Therefore, to take away this vice, the prayer has, "Give us" 
even "our daily bread," that we may know that all things come from God.

<P>From all this we draw one great lesson. Sometimes one who has great riches makes no use of 
them, but suffers spiritual and temporal harm; for some because of riches have perished. 
"There is also another evil which I have seen under the sun, and that frequent among men. A 
man to whom God hath given riches and substance and honor, and his soul wanteth nothing of 
all that he desireth; yet God doth not give him power to eat thereof, but a stranger shall 
eat it up."[13] And again: "Riches kept to the hurt of the owner."[14] We ought, therefore, 
pray that our riches will be of use to us; and it is this we seek for when we say, "Give us 
our bread," that is, make our riches be of use to us. "His bread in his belly shall be 
turned into the gall of asps within him. The riches which he hath swallowed, he shall vomit 
up; and God shall draw them out of his belly."[15]

<P>Another great vice is concerned with the things of this world, viz., excessive solicitude 
for them. For there are some who daily are anxious about temporal goods which are enough 
for them for an entire year; and they who are thus troubled will never have rest: "Be not 
solicitous therefore, saying: "What shall we eat, or What shall we drink, or Wherewith 
shall we be clothed?"[16] The Lord, therefore, teaches us to pray that to-day our bread 
will be given us, that is, those things which will be needful for us for the present time.

<P>One may also see in this bread another twofold meaning, viz., Sacramental Bread and the 
Bread of the Word of God. Thus, in the first meaning, we pray for our Sacramental Bread 
which is consecrated daily in the Church, so that we receive it in the Sacrament, and thus 
it profits us unto salvation: "I am the living bread which came down from heaven."[17] And: 
"He that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh judgment to himself."[18]

<P>In the second meaning this bread is the Word of God: "Not in bread alone doth man live, but 
in every word that proceedeth from the mouth of God."[19] We pray, therefore, that He give 
us bread, that is, His Word.[20] From this man derives that happiness which is a hunger for 
justice. For after spiritual things are considered, they are all the more desired; and this 
desire arouses a hunger, and from this hunger follows the fullness of life everlasting.

Thus, the word of God is the food of the soul" ("Roman Catechism," "loc. cit.," 18).
<H3>THE FIFTH PETITION: "And Forgive Us Our Trespasses As We Forgive Those Who Trespass Against 
Us."</H3>
<P>There are some men of great wisdom and fortitude who, because they trust too much in their 
own strength, do not wisely carry out what they attempt, and they do not bring to 
completion that which they have in mind. "Designs are strengthened by counsels."[1] It must 
be known that the Holy Ghost who gives fortitude also gives counsel. Every good counsel 
concerning the salvation of man is from the Holy Ghost. Thus, counsel is necessary for man 
when he is in difficulty, just as is the counsel of physicians when one is ill. When man 
falls into spiritual illness through sin, he must look for counsel in order to be healed. 
This necessity for counsel on the part of the sinner is shown in these words: "Wherefore, O 
king, let my counsel be acceptable to thee, and redeem thou thy sins with alms."[2] The 
best counsel, therefore, against sin is alms and mercy. Hence, the Holy Spirit teaches 
sinners to seek and to pray: "Forgive us our trespasses."[3]

<P>We owe God that which we have taken away from His sole right; and this right of God is that 
we do His will in preference to our own will. Now, we take away from God's right when we 
prefer our will to God's will, and this is a sin. Sins, therefore, are our trespasses.[4] 
And it is the counsel of the Holy Spirit that we ask God pardon for our sins, and so we 
say: "Forgive us our trespasses."

<P>We can consider these words in three ways: (1) Why do we make this petition? (2) How may it 
be fulfilled? (3) What is required on our part?

<P><B>WHY DO WE MAKE THIS PETITION?</B>
<P>It must be known that from this petition we can draw two things that are necessary for us 
in this life. One is that we be ever in a state of salutary fear and humility. There have 
been some, indeed, so presumptuous as to say that man could live in this world and by his 
own unaided strength avoid sin. But this condition has been given to no one except Christ, 
who had the Spirit beyond all measure, and to the Blessed Virgin, who was full of grace and 
in whom there was no sin. "And concerning whom," that is, the Virgin, "when it is a 
question of sin I wish to make no mention," says St. Augustine.[5] But for all the other 
Saints, it was never granted them that they should not incur at least venial sin: "If we 
say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us."[6] And, 
moreover, this very petition proves this; for it is evident that all Saints and all men say 
the "Our Father" in which is contained "Forgive us our trespasses." Hence, all admit and 
confess that they are sinners or trespassers. If, therefore, you are a sinner, you ought to 
fear and humble yourself.

<P>Another reason for this petition is that we should ever live in hope. Although we be 
sinners, nevertheless we must not give up hope, lest our despair drive us into greater and 
different kinds of sins. As the Apostle says: "Who despairing, have given themselves up to 
lasciviousness, unto the working of all uncleanness."[7] It is, therefore, of great help 
that we be ever hopeful; for in the measure that man is a sinner, he ought to hope that God 
will forgive him if he be perfectly sorry for sin and be converted. This hope is 
strengthened in us when we say: "Forgive us our trespasses."

<P>The Novatiani destroyed this hope, saying that one who has sinned but once after Baptism 
can never look for mercy. But this is not true, if Christ spoke truly when He said: "I 
forgave thee all the debt, because thou besoughtest Me."[8] In whatsoever day, therefore, 
you ask, you can receive mercy if with sorrow for sin you make your prayer. Both fear and 
hope arise from this petition. For all sinners who are contrite and confess their guilt, 
receive mercy. Hence, this petition is necessary.

<P><B>THE FULFILLMENT OF THIS PETITION</B>
<P>Concerning the second consideration of this petition (viz., how it may be fulfilled), it 
must be known that there are two factors in sin: the fault by which God is offended, and 
the punishment which is due because of this fault. But the sin is taken away in contrition 
which goes with the purpose to confess and make satisfaction: "I said: I will confess 
against myself my injustice to the Lord. And Thou hast forgiven the wickedness of my 
sin"[9] One has no need to fear then, because for the remission of a fault contrition with 
a purpose to confess is sufficient.[10]

<P>But one might say: "If sin is thus taken away when a man is contrite, of what necessity is 
the priest?" To this it must be said that God does forgive the sin in contrition, and 
eternal punishment is changed to temporal, but nevertheless the debt of temporal punishment 
remains. If one should die without confession, not out of contempt for it but prevented 
from it, one would go to purgatory, where the punishment, as St. Augustine says, is very 
great. When you confess, the priest absolves you of this punishment in virtue of the keys 
to which you subject yourself in confession.[11] When, therefore, one has confessed, 
something of this punishment is taken away; and similarly when he has again confessed, and 
it could be that after he has confessed many times, all would be remitted.

<P>The successors of the Apostles found another mode of remission of this punishment, namely, 
the good use of indulgences, which have their force for one living in the state of grace, 
to the extent that is claimed for them and as indicated by the grantor. That the Pope can 
bring this about, is sufficiently evident. Many holy men have accomplished much good, and 
they have not greatly sinned, at least not mortally; and these good deeds were done for the 
common use of the Church. Likewise the merits of Christ and the Blessed Virgin are, as it 
were, in a treasury; and from it the Supreme Pontiff and they who are by him permitted can 
dispense these merits where it is necessary. Thus, therefore, sins are taken away not only 
as regards their guilt by contrition,[12] but also as regards punishment for them in 
confession and through indulgences.[13]

<P><B>WHAT MUST WE DO?</B>
<P>Concerning the third consideration of this petition, it must be known that on our part we 
are required to forgive our neighbor the offenses which he commits against us. Thus, we 
say: "As we forgive those who trespass against us." Otherwise God would not forgive us: 
"Man to man reserveth anger: and doth he seek remedy of God?"[14] "Forgive and you shall be 
forgiven."[15] Therefore, only in this petition is there a condition when it says: "As we 
forgive those who trespass against us." If you do not forgive, you shall not be forgiven.

<P>But you may think, "I shall say what goes first in the petition, namely, 'forgive us,' but 
that 'As we forgive those who trespass against us,' I shall not say." Would you seek to 
deceive Christ? You certainly do not deceive Him. For Christ who made this prayer remembers 
it well, and cannot be deceived. If therefore, you say it with the lips, let the heart 
fulfill it.

<P>But one may ask whether he who does not intend to forgive his neighbor ought to say: "As we 
forgive those who trespass against us." It seems not, for such is a lie. But actually it 
must be said that he does not lie, because he prays not in his own person, but in that of 
the Church which is not deceived, and, therefore the petition itself is in the plural 
number.[16] And it must also be known that forgiveness is twofold. One applies to the 
perfect, where the one offended seeks out the offender: "Seek after peace."[17] The other 
is common to all, and to it all are equally bound, that one offended grant pardon to the 
one who seeks it: "Forgive thy neighbor if he hath hurt thee; and then shall thy sins be 
forgiven to thee when thou prayest."[18] And from this follows that other beatitude: 
"Blessed are the merciful." For mercy causes us to have pity on our neighbor.

the guilt of mortal sin is taken away and at the same time the guilt of eternal punishment; 
(2) the guilt of temporal punishment is more or less remitted according to the dispositions 
of the penitent "and the disposition can be such that in virtue of contrition the entire 
punishment is removed," says St. Thomas (IV Sent., Dist. xviii, art. 3, sol. 2, ad. 4). The 
Council of Trent (Session XIV, cap. 2) teaches that this entire remission of punishment, 
which is obtained through Baptism, is not obtained through the Sacrament of Penance 
"without much tears and labors" ("magnis nostris fletibus et laboribus"). For other effects 
of this Sacrament, such as the bestowal of sacramental grace and the revival of the merits

Church. In virtue of the Communion of Saints, by which we are united as members of one

<H3>THE SIXTH PETITION: "And Lead Us Not Into Temptation."</H3>
<P>There are those who have sinned and desire forgiveness for their sins. They confess their 
sins and repent. Yet, they do not strive as much as they should in order that they may not 
fall into sin again. In this indeed they are not consistent. For, on the one hand, they 
deplore their sins by being sorry for them; and, on the other hand, they sin again and 
again and have them again to deplore. Thus it is written: "Wash yourselves, be clean. Take 
away the evil of your devices from my eyes. Cease to do perversely."[1]

<P>We have seen in the petition above that Christ taught us to seek forgiveness for our sins. 
In this petition, He teaches us to pray that we might avoid sin--that is, that we may not 
be led into temptation, and thus fall into sin. "And lead us not into temptation."[2]
<P>Three questions are now considered: (1) What is temptation? (2) In what ways is one tempted 
and by whom? (3) How is one freed from temptation?

<P><B>WHAT IS TEMPTATION?</B>
<P>Regarding the first, it must be known that to tempt is nothing other than to test or to 
prove. To tempt a man is to test or try his virtue. This is done in two ways just as a 
man's virtue requires two things. One requirement is to do good, the other is to avoid 
evil: "Turn away from evil and do good."[3] Sometimes a man's virtue is tried in doing 
good, and sometimes it is tested in avoiding evil. Thus, regarding the first, a person is 
tried in his readiness to do good, for example, to fast and such like. Then is thy virtue 
great when thou art quick to do good. In this way does God sometimes try one's virtue, not, 
however, because such virtue is hidden from Him, but in order that all might know it and it 
would be an example to all. God tempted Abraham in this way, and Job also.[4] For this 
reason God frequently sends trials to the just, who in sustaining them with all patience 
make manifest their virtue and themselves increase in virtue: "The Lord your God trieth 
you, that it may appear whether you love Him with all your heart and with all your soul, or 
not."[5] Thus does God tempt man by inciting him to good deeds.
<P>As to the second, the virtue of man is tried by solicitation to evil. If he truly resists 
and does not give his consent, then his virtue is great. If, however, he falls before the 
temptation, he is devoid of virtue. God tempts no man in this way, for it is written: "God 
is not a tempter of evils, and He tempteth no man."[6]
<P><B>HOW IS ONE TEMPTED?</B>
<P>The Temptations of the Flesh.--Man is tempted by his own flesh, by the devil and by the 
world. He is tempted by the flesh in two ways. First, the flesh incites one to evil. It 
always seeks its own pleasures, namely, carnal pleasures, in which often is sin. He who 
indulges in carnal pleasures neglects spiritual things: "Every man is tempted by his own 
concupiscence."[7]
<P>Secondly, the flesh tempts man by enticing him away from good. For the spirit on its part 
would delight always in spiritual things, but the flesh asserting itself puts obstacles in 
the way of the spirit: "The corruptible body is a load upon the soul."[8] "For I am 
delighted with the law of God, according to the inward man. But I see another law in my 
members, fighting against the law of my mind, and captivating me in the law of sin, that is 
in my members."[9] This temptation which comes from the flesh is most severe, because our 
enemy, the flesh, is united to us; and as Boethius says: "There is no plague more dangerous 
than an enemy in the family circle." We must, therefore, be ever on our guard against this 
enemy: "Watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation."[10]
<P>The Temptations of the Devil.--The devil tempts us with extreme force. Even when the flesh 
is subdued, another tempter arises, namely, the devil against whom we have a heavy 
struggle. Of this the Apostle says: "Our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but 
against principalities and powers, against the rulers of the world of this darkness, 
against the spirits of wickedness in high places."[11] For this reason he is very aptly 
called the tempter: "Lest perhaps he that tempteth should have tempted you."[12]

<P>The devil proceeds most cunningly in tempting us. He operates like a skillful general when 
about to attack a fortified city. He looks for the weak places in the object of his 
assault, and in that part where a man is most weak, he tempts him. He tempts man in those 
sins to which, after subduing his flesh, he is most inclined. Such, for instance, are 
anger, pride and the other spiritual sins. "Your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, 
goeth about seeking whom he may devour."[13]
<P>How the Devil Tempts Us.--The devil does two things when he tempts us. Thus, he does not at 
once suggest something that appears to us as evil, but something that has a semblance of 
good. Thereby he would, at least in the beginning, turn a man from his chief purpose, and 
then afterwards it will be easier to induce him to sin, once he has been turned away ever 
so little. "Satan himself transformeth himself into an angel of light."[14] Then when he 
has once led man into sin, he so enchains him as to prevent his rising up out of his sin. 
The devil, therefore, does two things: he deceives a man first, and then after betraying 
him, enthralls him in his sin.
<P>Temptations of the World.--The world has two ways of tempting man. The first is excessive 
and intemperate desire for the goods of this life: "The desire of money is the root of all 
evil."[15] The second way is the fears engendered by persecutors and tyrants: "We are 
wrapped up in darkness."[16] "All that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer 
persecution."[17] And again: "Fear not those that slay the body."[18]
<P>How Is One Freed from Temptation?--Now we have seen what temptation is, and also in what 
way and by whom one is tempted. But how is one freed from temptation? In this we must 
notice that Christ teaches us to pray, not that we may not be tempted, but that we may not 
be led into temptation. For it is when one overcomes temptation that one deserves the 
reward. Thus it is said: "Count it all joy when you shall fall into divers 
temptations."[19] And again: "Son, when thou comest to the service of God, . . . prepare 
thy soul for temptation."[20] Again: "Blessed is the man that endureth temptation; for when 
he hath been proved, he shall receive the crown of life."[21] Our Lord, therefore, teaches 
us to pray that we be not led into temptation, by giving our consent to it: "Let no 
temptation take hold on you, but such as is human."[22] The reason is that it is human to 
be tempted, but to give consent is devilish.

<P>But does God lead one to evil, that he should pray: "Lead us not into temptation"? I reply 
that God is said to lead a person into evil by permitting him to the extent that, because 
of his many sins, He withdraws His grace from man, and as a result of this withdrawal man 
does fall into sin. Therefore, we sing in the Psalm: "When my strength shall fail, do not 
Thou forsake me."[23] God, however, directs man by the fervor of charity that he be not led 
into temptation. For charity even in its smallest degree is able to resist any kind of sin: 
"Many waters cannot quench charity."[24] He also guides man by the light of his intellect 
in which he teaches him what he should do. For as the Philosopher says: "Every one who sins 
is ignorant."[25] "I will give thee understanding and I will instruct thee."[26] It was for 
this last that David prayed, saying: "Enlighten my eyes that I never sleep in death; lest 
at any time my enemy say: I have prevailed against him."[27] We have this through the gift 
of understanding. Therefore, when we refuse to consent to temptation, we keep our hearts 
pure: "Blessed are the clean of heart, for they shall see God."[28] And it follows from 
this petition that we are led up to the sight of God, and to it may God lead us all!

<H3>SEVENTH PETITION: "But Deliver Us from Evil. Amen."</H3>
<P>The Lord has already taught us to pray for forgiveness of our sins, and how to avoid 
temptations. In this petition, He teaches us to pray to be preserved from evil, and indeed 
from all evil in general, such as sin, illness, affliction and all others, as St. Augustine 
explains it.[1] But since we have already mentioned sin and temptation, we now must 
consider other evils, such as adversity and all afflictions of this world. From these God 
preserves us in a fourfold manner.

<P>First, He preserves us from affliction itself; but this is very rare because it is the lot 
of the just in this world to suffer, for it is written: "All that will live godly in Christ 
Jesus shall suffer persecution."[2] Once in a while, however, God does prevent a man from 
being afflicted by some evil; this is when He knows such a one to be weak and unable to 
bear it. Just so a physician does not prescribe violent medicines to a weak patient. 
"Behold, I have given before thee a door opened, which no man can shut; because thou hast 
little strength."[3] In heaven this will be a general thing, for there no one shall be 
afflicted. "In six troubles," those, namely, of this present life which is divided into six 
periods, "He shall deliver thee, and in the seventh evil shall not touch thee."[4] "They 
shall no more hunger nor thirst."[5]
<P>Second, God delivers us from afflictions when He consoles us in them; for unless He console 
us, we could not long persevere: "We were pressed out of measure above our strength so that 
we were weary even of life."[6] "But God, who comforteth the humble, comforted us."[7] 
"According to the multitude of my sorrows in my heart, Thy comforts have given joy to my 
soul."[8]

<P>Third, God bestows so many good things upon those who are afflicted that their evils are 
forgotten: "After the storm Thou makest a calm."[9] The afflictions and trials of this 
world, therefore, are not to be feared, both because consolations accompany them and 
because they are of short duration: "For that which is at present momentary and light of 
our tribulation, worketh for us above measure exceedingly an eternal weight of glory."[10]
<P>Fourth, we are preserved from afflictions in this way that all temptations and trials are 
conducive to our own good. We do not pray, "Deliver us from tribulation," but "from evil." 
This is because tribulations bring a crown to the just, and for that reason the Saints 
rejoiced in their sufferings: "We glory also in tribulations, knowing that tribulation 
worketh patience."[11] "In time of tribulation Thou forgivest sins."[12]

<P><B>THE VALUE OF PATIENCE</B>

<P>God, therefore, delivers man from evil and from affliction by converting them to his good. 
This is a sign of supreme wisdom to divert evil to good. And patience in bearing trials is 
a result of this. The other virtues operate by good things, but patience operates in evil 
things, and, indeed, it is very necessary in evil things, namely, in adversity: "The 
learning of a man is known by his patience."[13]
<P>The Holy Spirit through the gift of wisdom has us use this prayer, and by it we arrive at 
supreme happiness which is the reward of peace. For it is by patience we obtain peace, 
whether in time of prosperity or of adversity. For this reason the peace-makers are called 
the children of God, because they are like to God in this, that nothing can hurt God and 
nothing can hurt them, whether it be prosperity or adversity: "Blessed are the 
peace-makers, for they shall be called the children of God."[14]
<P>"Amen." This is general ratification of all the petitions.[15]

<H3>A SHORT EXPLANATION OF THE WHOLE PRAYER</H3>
<P>By way of brief summary, it should be known that the Lord's Prayer contains all that we 
ought to desire and all that we ought to avoid. Now, of all desirable things, that must be 
most desired which is most loved, and that is God.

<P>Therefore, you seek, first of all, the glory of God when you say: "Hallowed be Thy name." 
You should desire three things from God, and they concern yourself. The first is that you 
may arrive at eternal life. And you pray for this when you say: "Thy kingdom come." The 
second is that you will do the will of God and His justice. You pray for this in the words: 
"Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven." The third is that you may have the 
necessaries of life. And thus you pray: "Give us this day our daily bread." Concerning all 
these things the Lord says: "Seek ye first the kingdom of God," which complies with the 
second, "and all these things shall be added unto you,"[16] as in accord with the third.

<P>We must avoid and flee from all things which are opposed to the good. For, as we have seen, 
good is above all things to be desired. This good is fourfold. First, there is the glory of 
God, and no evil is contrary to this: "If thou sin, what shalt thou hurt Him? And if thou 
do justly, what shall thou give Him?"[17] Whether it be the evil inasmuch as God punishes 
it, or whether it be the good in that God rewards it--all redound to His glory.

<P>The second good is eternal life, to which sin is contrary: because eternal life is lost by 
sin. And so to remove this evil we pray: "Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who 
trespass against us." The third good is justice and good works, and temptation is contrary 
to this, because temptation hinders us from doing good. We pray, therefore, to have this 
evil taken away in the words: "Lead us not into temptation." The fourth good is all the 
necessaries of life, and opposed to this are troubles and adversities. And we seek to 
remove them when we pray: "But deliver us from evil. Amen."
