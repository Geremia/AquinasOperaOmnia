        ARISTOTLE’S TEXT Chapter 1: 993a 30-993b 19
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify">
        144. Theoretical, i.e., speculative, knowledge of truth is in one sense
        difficult and in another, easy.
      </p>
      <p>
        145. An indication of this is found in the fact that, while no one can
        attain an adequate knowledge of it, all men together do not fail,
        because each one is able to say something true about nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        146. And while each one individually contributes nothing or very little
        to the truth, still as a result of the combined efforts of all a great
        amount of truth becomes known.
      </p>
      <p>
        147. Therefore, if the situation in the case of truth seems to be like
        the one which we speak of in the proverb “Who will miss a door?” then in
        this respect it will be easy to know the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        148. But the fact that we cannot simultaneously grasp a whole and its
        parts shows the difficulty involved.”
      </p>
      <p>
        149. However, since the difficulty is twofold, perhaps its cause is not
        in things but in us; for just as the eyes of owls are to the light of
        day, so is our soul’s intellective power to those things which are by
        nature the most evident of all.
      </p>
      <p>
        150. Now it is only right that we should be grateful not merely to those
        with whose views we agree but also to those who until now have spoken in
        a superficial way; for they too have made some contribution because they
        have made use of the habit which we now exercise. Thus if there had been
        no Timotheus, we would not have a great part of our music; and if there
        had been no Phrynis, there would have been no Timotheus. The same is
        true of those who have made statements about the truth; for we have
        accepted certain opinions from some of them, and others have been the
        cause of them attaining their knowledge as they have been the cause of
        us attaining ours.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        273. Having criticized the ancient philosophers’ opinions about the
        first principles of things, with which first philosophy is chiefly
        concerned, the Philosopher now begins to establish what is true.
      </p>
      <p>
        First philosophy considers
        <span style="font-weight: bold">truth</span> in a different way than the
        particular sciences do. Each of the particular sciences considers a
        particular truth out a definite class of beings; e.g., geometry deals
        with the continuous quantities of bodies, and arithmetic with numbers;
        whereas first philosophy considers what is universally true of things.
        Therefore, it pertains to this science to consider in what respects man
        is capable of knowing the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        274. First, he states what he intends to prove. He says that
        “theoretical knowledge,” i.e., the contemplative or speculative
        understanding of truth, is in one sense easy and in another, difficult.
      </p>
      <p>275. <b>An indication of this</b> (145).</p>
      <p>
        Second, he explains what he intends to prove: first, in what sense it is
        easy to know the truth; and second (278), in what sense it is difficult
        (“But the fact”). He shows in what sense it is
        <span style="font-weight: bold">easy</span> to know the truth, by giving
        three indications:
      </p>
      <p>
        The first is this: while no man can attain a complete knowledge of the
        truth, still no man is so completely devoid of truth that he knows
        nothing about it. This is shown by the fact that anyone can make a
        statement about the truth and the nature of things, which is a sign of
        intellectual reflection.
      </p>
      <p>276. <b>And while each one individually</b> (146).</p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the second indication. He says that, while the amount of
        truth that one man can discover or contribute to the knowledge of truth
        by his own study and talents is small compared with a complete knowledge
        of truth, nevertheless what is known as a result of “the combined
        efforts” of all, i.e., what is discovered and collected into one whole,
        becomes quite extensive. This can be seen in the case of the particular
        arts, which have developed in a marvelous manner as a result of the
        studies and talents of different men.
      </p>
      <p>277. <b>Therefore, if the situation</b> (147).</p>
      <p>
        Third, he shows that the same thing is true by citing a common proverb.
        He concludes from the foregoing that since anyone can attain some
        knowledge of the truth, even though it be little, the situation in the
        case of knowledge is like the one that we speak of in the proverb “Who
        will miss a door?” i.e., the outer door of a house. For it is difficult
        to know what the interior of a house is like, and a man is easily
        deceived in such matters; but just as no one is mistaken about the
        entrance of a house, which is evident to all and is the first thing that
        we perceive, so too this is the case with regard to the knowledge of
        truth; for those truths through which we enter into a knowledge of
        others are known to all, and no man is mistaken about them. Those first
        principles which are naturally apprehended are truths of this sort,
        e.g., “It is impossible both to affirm and deny something at the same
        time,” and “Every whole is greater than each of its parts,” and so on.
        On the other hand, there are many ways in which error may arise with
        respect to the conclusions into which we enter through such principles
        as through an outer door. Therefore, it is easy to know the truth if we
        consider that small amount of it which is comprised of self-evident
        principles, through which we enter into other truths, because this much
        is evident to all.
      </p>
      <p>278. <b>But the fact that we cannot</b> (148).</p>
      <p>
        Here he explains in what sense it is
        <span style="font-weight: bold">difficult</span> to know the truth. He
        says that our inability to grasp the whole truth and a part of it shows
        the difficulty involved in the search for truth. In support of this we
        must consider his statement that the truth through which we gain
        admission to other truths is known to all. Now there are two ways in
        which we attain knowledge of the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first is the method of
        <span style="font-weight: bold">analysis</span>, by which we go from
        what is complex to what is simple or from a whole to a part, as it is
        said in Book I of the <i>Physics</i> that the first objects of our
        knowledge are confused wholes. Now our knowledge of the truth is
        perfected by this method when we attain a distinct knowledge of the
        particular parts of a whole.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other method is that of
        <span style="font-weight: bold">synthesis</span>, by which we go from
        what is simple to what is complex; and we attain knowledge of truth by
        this method when we succeed in knowing a whole. Thus the fact that man
        is unable to know perfectly in things a whole and a part shows the
        difficulty involved in knowing the truth by both of these methods.
      </p>
      <p>279. <b>However, since the difficulty is twofold</b> (149).</p>
      <p>
        He gives the reason for this difficulty. Here too it must be noted that,
        in all cases in which there is a certain relationship between two
        things, an effect can fail to occur in two ways, i.e., because of either
        one of the things involved. For example, if wood does not burn, this may
        happen either because the fire is not strong enough or because the wood
        is not combustible enough. And in a similar way the eye may be prevented
        from seeing a visible object either because the eye is weak or because
        the visible object is in the dark. Therefore, in like manner, it may be
        difficult to know the truth about things either (1) because
        <span style="font-weight: bold">things</span> themselves are
        <span style="font-weight: bold">imperfect</span> in some way or (2)
        because of some <span style="font-weight: bold">weakness</span> on the
        part of our <span style="font-weight: bold">intellect</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        280. (1) Now it is evident that we experience difficulty in knowing the
        truth about some things because of the things themselves; for since each
        thing is knowable insofar as it is an actual being, as will be stated
        below in Book IX (1894) of this work, then those things which are
        deficient and imperfect in being are less knowable by their very nature;
        e.g., matter, motion, and time are less knowable because of the
        imperfect being which they have, as Boethius says in his book
        <i>The Two Natures</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        281. Now there were some philosophers who claimed that the difficulty
        experienced in knowing the truth is wholly attributable to things
        themselves, because they maintained that nothing is fixed and stable in
        nature but that everything is in a state of continual change, as will be
        stated in Book IV (683) of this work. But the Philosopher denies this,
        saying that even though the difficulty experienced in knowing the truth
        can perhaps be twofold because of different things, i.e., our intellect
        and things themselves, still the principal source of the difficulty is
        not things but our intellect.
      </p>
      <p>
        282. He proves this in the following way. If this difficulty were
        attributable principally to things, it would follow it we would know
        best those things which are most knowable by nature. But those things
        which are most knowable by nature are those which are most actual, i.e.,
        immaterial and unchangeable things, yet we know these least of all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Obviously, then, the difficulty experienced in knowing the truth is due
        principally to some weakness on the part of our intellect. From this it
        follows that our soul’s intellectual power is related to those
        immaterial beings, which are by nature the most knowable of all, as the
        eyes of owls are to the light of day, which they cannot see because
        their power of vision is weak, although they do see dimly lighted
        things.
      </p>
      <p>
        283. But it is evident that this simile is not adequate; for since a
        sense is a power of a bodily organ, it is made inoperative as a result
        of its sensible object being too intense. But the intellect is not a
        power of a bodily organ and is not made inoperative as a result of its
        intelligible object being too intelligible. Therefore, after
        understanding objects that are highly intelligible our ability to
        understand less intelligible objects is not decreased but increased, as
        is stated in Book III of <i>The Soul</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        284. Therefore it must be said that a sense is prevented from perceiving
        some sensible object for two reasons: first, (1) because a sensory organ
        is rendered inoperative as a result of its sensible object being too
        intense (this does not occur in the case of the intellect); second, (2)
        because of some deficiency in the ability of a sensory power to perceive
        its object; for the powers of the soul in all animals do not have the
        same efficacy. Thus, just as it is proper to man by nature to have the
        weakest sense of smell, in a similar way it is proper to an owl to have
        the weakest power of vision, because it is incapable of perceiving the
        light of day.
      </p>
      <p>
        285. Therefore, since the human soul occupies the lowest place in the
        order of intellective substances, it has the least intellective power.
        As a matter of fact, just as it is by nature the actuality of a body,
        although its intellective power is not the act of a bodily organ, in a
        similar way it has a natural capacity to know the truth about corporeal
        and sensible things. These are less knowable by nature because of their
        materiality, although they can be known by abstracting sensible forms
        from phantasms. And since this process of knowing truth befits the
        nature of the human soul insofar as it is the form of this kind of body
        (and whatever is natural always remains so), it is possible for the
        human soul, which is united to this kind of body, to know the truth
        about things only insofar as it can be elevated to the level of the
        things which it understands
        <span style="font-weight: bold">by abstracting from phantasms</span>.
        However, by this process it cannot be elevated to the level of knowing
        the quiddities of immaterial substances because these are not on the
        same level as sensible substances.
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >Therefore it is impossible for the human soul, which is united to
          this kind of body, to apprehend separate substances by knowing their
          quiddities</span
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        286. For this reason the statement which Averroes makes at this point in
        his <i>Commentary</i> is evidently false, i.e., that the Philosopher
        does not prove here that it is just as impossible for us to understand
        abstract substances as it is for a bat to see the sun. The argument that
        he gives is wholly ridiculous; for he adds that, if this were the case,
        nature would have acted in vain because it would have made something
        that is naturally knowable in itself to be incapable of being known by
        anything else. It would be the same as if it had made the sun incapable
        of being seen.
      </p>
      <p>
        This argument is not satisfactory for two reasons. First, the end of
        separate substances does not consist in being understood by our
        intellect, but rather the converse. Therefore, if separate substances
        are not known by us, it does not follow that they exist in vain; for
        only that exists in vain which fails to attain the end for which it
        exists. Second, even though the quiddities of separate substances are
        not understood by us, they are understood by other intellects. The same
        is true of the sun; for even though it is not seen by the eye of the
        owl, it is seen by the eye of the eagle.
      </p>
      <p>287. <b>Now it is only right</b> (150).</p>
      <p>
        He shows how men assist each other to know the truth; for one man
        assists another to consider the truth in two ways—directly and
        indirectly.
      </p>
      <p>
        One is assisted <span style="font-weight: bold">directly</span> by those
        who have discovered the truth; because, as has been pointed out, when
        each of our predecessors has discovered something about the truth, which
        is gathered together into one whole, he also introduces his followers to
        a more extensive knowledge of truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        One is assisted
        <span style="font-weight: bold">indirectly</span> insofar as those who
        have preceded us and who were wrong about the truth have bequeathed to
        their successors the occasion for exercising their mental powers, so
        that by diligent discussion the truth might be seen more clearly.
      </p>
      <p>
        288. Now it is only fitting that we should be grateful to those who have
        helped us attain so great a good as knowledge of the truth. Therefore he
        says that “It is only right that we should be grateful,” not merely to
        those whom we think have found the truth and with whose views we agree
        by following them, but also to those who, in the search for truth, have
        made only superficial statements, even though we do not follow their
        views; for these men too have given us something because they have shown
        us instances of actual attempts to discover the truth. By way of an
        example he mentions the founders of music; for if there “had been no
        Timotheus,” who discovered a great part of the art of music, we would
        not have many of the facts that we know about melodies. But if Timotheus
        had not been preceded by a wise man named “Phrynis,” he would not have
        been as well off in the subject of music. The same thing must be said of
        those philosophers who made statements of universal scope about the
        truth of things; for we accept from certain of our predecessors whatever
        views about the truth of things we think are true and disregard the
        rest. Again, those from whom we accept certain views had predecessors
        from whom they in turn accepted certain views and who were the source of
        their information.<br /></p

      <p>
        151. It is only right to call philosophy the science of truth. For the
        end of theoretical knowledge is truth, whereas that of practical
        knowledge is action; for even when practical men investigate the way in
        which something exists, they do not consider it in itself but in
        relation to some particular thing and to the present moment. But we know
        a truth only by knowing its cause. Now anything which is the basis of a
        univocal predication about other things has that attribute in the
        highest degree. Thus fire is hottest and is actually the cause of heat
        in other things. Therefore that is also true in the highest degree which
        is the cause of all subsequent things being true. For this reason the
        principles of things that always exist must be. true in the highest
        degree, because they are not sometimes true and sometimes not true. Nor
        is there any cause of their being, but they are the cause of the being
        of other things. Therefore insofar as each thing has being, to that
        extent it is true.

      <p style="text-align: center">Chapter 2</p>
      <p>
        152. Further, it is evident that there is a [first] principle, and that
        the causes of existing things are not infinite either in series or in
        species. For it is impossible that one thing should come from something
        else as from matter in an infinite regress, for example, flesh from
        earth, earth from air, air from fire, and so on to infinity. Nor can the
        causes from which motion originates proceed to infinity, as though man
        were moved by the air, the air by the sun, the sun by strife, and so on
        to infinity. Again, neither can there be an infinite regress in the case
        of the reason for which something is done, as though walking were for
        the sake of health, health for the sake of happiness, and happiness for
        the sake of something else, so that one thing is always being done for
        the sake of something else. The same is true in the case of the
        quiddity.

      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        289. Having shown how man is disposed for the study of truth, the
        Philosopher now shows that the knowledge of truth belongs pre-eminently
        to first philosophy. Regarding this he does two things... First (290),
        he shows that knowledge of the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">truth</span> belongs pre-eminently to
        <span style="font-weight: bold">first philosophy</span>. Second (290),
        that it belongs in the highest degree to this science (“But we know a
        truth”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He proves these two propositions from two things established above in
        the prologue of this book, i.e., that
        <span style="font-weight: bold">wisdom</span> is not a practical but a
        <span style="font-weight: bold">speculative</span> science (53), and
        that it knows first causes (48).
      </p>
      <p>
        290. He argues from the first of these to the first conclusion in this
        way. Theoretical, i.e., speculative, knowledge differs from practical
        knowledge by its end; for the end of speculative knowledge is truth,
        because it has knowledge of the truth as its objective. But the end of
        practical knowledge is action, because, even though “practical men,”
        i.e., men of action, attempt to understand the truth as it belongs to
        certain things, they do not seek this as an ultimate end; for they do
        not consider the cause of truth in and for itself as an end but in
        relation to action, either by applying it to some definite individual,
        or to some definite time. Therefore, if we add to the above the fact
        that wisdom or first philosophy is not practical but speculative, it
        follows that first philosophy is most fittingly called the science of
        truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        291. But since there are many speculative sciences, which consider the
        truth, such as geometry and arithmetic, therefore it was necessary to
        show that first philosophy considers truth in the highest degree
        inasmuch as it has been shown above that it considers
        <span style="font-weight: bold">first causes</span> (48). Hence he
        argues as follows. We have knowledge of truth only when we know a cause.
        This is apparent from the fact that the true things about which we have
        some knowledge have causes which are also true, because we cannot know
        what is true by knowing what is false, but only by knowing what is true.
        This is also the reason why demonstration, which causes science, begins
        with what is true, as is stated in Book I of the
        <i>Posterior Analytics</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        292. Then he adds the following universal proposition. When a univocal
        predicate is applied to several things, in each case that which
        constitutes the reason for the predication about other things has that
        attribute in the fullest sense. Thus fire is the cause of heat in
        compounds. Therefore, since heat is predicated univocally both of fire
        and of compound bodies, it follows that fire is hottest.
      </p>
      <p>
        293. Now he says “univocal” because sometimes it happens that an effect
        does not become like its cause, so as to have the same specific nature,
        because of the excellence of that cause; for example, the sun is the
        cause of heat in these lower bodies, but the form which these lower
        bodies receive cannot be of the same specific nature as that possessed
        by the sun or any of the celestial bodies, since they do not have a
        common matter. This is why we do not say that the sun is hottest, as we
        say fire is, but that it is something superior to the hottest.
      </p>
      <p>
        294. Now the term truth is not proper to one class of beings only, but
        is applied universally to all beings. Therefore, since the cause of
        truth is one having the same name. and intelligible structure as its
        effect, it follows that whatever causes subsequent things to be true is
        itself most true.
      </p>
      <p>
        295. From this he again concludes that the principles of things which
        always exist, i.e., the celestial bodies, must be most true. He does
        this for two reasons. First, they are not “sometimes true and sometimes
        not true,” and therefore surpass the truth of things subject to
        generation and corruption, which sometimes exist and sometimes do not.
        Second, these principles have no cause but are the cause of the being of
        other things. And for this reason they surpass the celestial bodies in
        truth and in being; and even though the latter are incorruptible, they
        have a cause not only of their motion, as some men thought, but also of
        their being, as the Philosopher clearly states in this place.
      </p>
      <p>
        296. Now this is necessary, because
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >everything that is composite in nature and participates in being must
          ultimately have as its causes those things which have existence by
          their very essence</span
        >. But all corporeal things are actual beings insofar as they
        participate in certain forms. Therefore a separate substance which is a
        form by its very essence must be the principle of corporeal substance.
      </p>
      <p>
        297. If we add to this conclusion the fact that first philosophy
        considers first causes, it then follows, as was said above (291), that
        first philosophy considers those things which are most true.
        Consequently this science is pre-eminently the science of truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        298. From these conclusions he draws a corollary: since those things
        which cause the being of other things are true in the highest degree, it
        follows that each thing is true insofar as it is a being; for things
        which do not always have being in the same way do not always have truth
        in the same way, and those which have a cause of their being also have a
        cause of their truth. The reason for this is that a thing’s being is the
        cause of any true judgment which the mind makes about a thing; for truth
        and falsity are not in things but in the mind, as will be said in Book
        VI (1230) of this work.
      </p>
      <p>
        299. He rejects a position that would render the above proof untenable;
        for this proof proceeded on the supposition that first philosophy
        considers first causes. But if there were an infinite regress in causes,
        this proof would be destroyed, for then there would be no first cause.
        So his aim here is to refute this position. Concerning this he does two
        things. First (152), he points out what he intends to prove. Second
        (300, he proceeds to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
        He says, first, that from what has been said it can clearly be shown
        that there is some [first] principle of the being and truth of things.
        He states that the causes of existing things are
        <span style="font-weight: bold">not infinite</span> in number because we
        cannot proceed to infinity in a series of causes belonging to one and
        the same class, e.g., the class of, efficient causes. Nor again are
        causes infinite in species, as though the classes of causes were
        infinite in number.
      </p>
      <p>
        300. Then he explains his statement about an infinite number of causes
        in a series. He does this, first, in regard to the class of
        <span style="font-weight: bold">material</span> causes. For it is
        impossible to have an infinite series in the sense that one thing always
        comes from something else as its matter, e.g., that flesh comes from
        earth, earth from air, and air from fire, and that this does not
        terminate in some first entity but goes on to infinity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, he gives an example of this in the class of
        <span style="font-weight: bold">efficient</span> cause. He says that it
        is impossible to have an infinite series in the class of cause which we
        define as the source of motion; e.g., when we say that a man is moved to
        put aside his clothing because the air becomes warm, the air having been
        heated in turn by the sun, the sun having been moved by something else,
        and so on to infinity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Third, he gives an example of this in the class of
        <span style="font-weight: bold">final</span> causes. He says that it is
        also impossible to proceed to infinity in the case of “the reason for
        which” something is done, i.e., the final cause; for example, if we were
        to say that a journey or a walk is undertaken for the sake of health,
        health for the sake of happiness, happiness for the sake of something
        else, and so on to infinity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, he mentions the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">formal</span> cause. He says that it is
        also impossible to proceed to infinity in the case of the “quiddity,”
        i.e., the formal cause, which the definition signifies. However, he
        omits examples because these are evident, and because it was shown in
        Book I of the <i>Posterior Analytics</i> that it is impossible to
        proceed to infinity in the matter of predication, as though animal were
        predicated quidditatively of man, living of animal, and so on to
        infinity.<br /></p

        153. For intermediate things in a series limited by some first and last
        thing must have as their cause the first member of the series, which
        they follow; because if we had to say which one of these three is the
        cause of the others, we would say that it is the first. What is last is
        not the cause, since what is last is not a cause of anything. Neither is
        the intermediate the cause, because it is the cause of only one; for it
        makes no difference whether one or several intermediates exist, or an
        infinite or finite number. Indeed, in series that are infinite in this
        way or in the infinite in general, all parts are intermediates to the
        same degree right down to the present one. Therefore, if there is
        nothing first in the whole series, nothing in the series is a cause.
      </p>
      <p>
        154. Neither is it possible to proceed to infinity in a downward
        direction, where there is a starting-point in an upward direction, so
        that water comes from fire, earth from water, and some other class of
        things always being generated in this way.
      </p>
      <p>
        155. Now there are two ways in which one thing comes from (<i>ex</i>)
        another. I do not mean from in the sense of after, as the Olympian games
        are said to come from the Isthmian, but either in the way in which a man
        comes from a boy as a result of a boy changing, or in the way in which
        air comes from water.
      </p>
      <p>
        156. We say, then, that a man comes from a boy in the sense that what
        has come into being comes from what is coming into being, or in the
        sense that what has been completed comes from what is being completed.
        For generation is always midway between being and non-being, and thus
        whatever is coming into being is midway between what is and what is not.
        Now a learner is one who is becoming learned, and this is the meaning of
        the statement that the man of science comes from the learner. But water
        comes from air in the sense that it comes into being when the latter
        ceases to be.
      </p>
      <p>
        157. This is why changes of the former kind are not reversible, and thus
        a boy does not come from a man. The reason is that the thing which comes
        into being does not come from generation but exists after generation.
        This is the way in which the day comes from the dawn, i.e., in the sense
        that it exists after the dawn; and this is why the dawn cannot come from
        the day. On the other hand, changes of the latter sort are reversible.
      </p>
      <p>
        158. Now in neither way is it possible to proceed to infinity; for
        existing intermediaries must have some end, and one thing may be changed
        into the other because the corruption of one is the generation of the
        other.
      </p>
      <p>
        159. At the same time it is impossible that an eternal first cause
        should be corrupted; for since generation is not infinite in an upward
        direction, then a first principle by whose corruption something else is
        produced could not be eternal.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        301. Having assumed above that the causes of beings are not infinite in
        number, the Philosopher now proves this. First (153:C 300, he proves
        that there are not an infinite number of causes in a series; and second
        (170:C 330), that the classes of causes are not infinite in number
        (“Again, if the classes of causes”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does four things. First, he proves his
        assumption in the case of efficient or moving causes; second (154:C
        305), in the case of material causes (“Neither is it possible”); third
        (160:C 316), in the case of final causes (“Again, that for the sake of
        which”); and fourth (164:C 320), in the case of formal causes (“Nor can
        the quiddity”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he proceeds as follows. First, he lays down this
        premise: in the case of all those things which lie between two extremes,
        one of which is last and the other first, the first is necessarily the
        cause of those which come after it, namely, what is intermediate and
        what is last.
      </p>
      <p>
        302. Then he proves this premise by a process of elimination. For if we
        had to say which of the three, i.e., the first, the intermediate, or the
        last, is the cause of the others, we would have to say that the first is
        the cause. We could not say that what is last is the cause of all the
        others, because it is not a cause of anything; for in other respects
        what is last is not a cause, since an effect follows a cause. Nor could
        we say that the intermediate is the cause of all the others, because it
        is the cause of only one of them, namely, what is last.
      </p>
      <p>
        303. And lest someone should think that an intermediate is followed by
        only one thing, i.e., what is last (for this occurs only when there is a
        single thing between two extremes), in order to exclude this
        interpretation he adds that it makes no difference to the premise given
        above whether there is only one intermediate or several, because all
        intermediates are taken together as one insofar as they have in common
        the character of an intermediate. Nor again does it make any difference
        whether there are a finite or infinite number of intermediates, because
        so long as they have the nature of an intermediate they cannot be the
        first cause of motion. Further, since there must be a first cause of
        motion prior to every secondary cause of motion, then there must be a
        first cause prior to every intermediate cause, which is not an
        intermediate in any sense, as though it had a cause prior to itself. But
        if we were to hold that there is an infinite series of moving causes in
        the above way, then all causes would be intermediate ones. Thus we would
        have to say without qualification that all parts of any infinite thing,
        whether of a series of causes or of continuous quantities, are
        intermediate ones; for if there were a part that was not an intermediate
        one, it would have to be either a first or a last; and both of these are
        opposed to the nature of the infinite, which excludes every limit,
        whether it be a starting-point or a terminus.
      </p>
      <p>
        304. Now there is another point that must be noted, i.e., that if there
        are several intermediate parts in any finite thing, not all parts are
        intermediate to the same degree; for some are closer to what is first,
        and some to what is last. But in the case of some infinite thing in
        which there is neither a first nor last part, no part can be closer to
        or farther away from either what is first or what is last. Therefore all
        parts are intermediates to the same degree right down to the one you
        designate now. Consequently, if the causes of motion proceed to infinity
        in this way, there will be no first cause. But a first cause is the
        cause of all things. Therefore it will follow that all causes are
        eliminated; for when a cause is removed the things of which it is the
        cause are also removed.
      </p>
      <p>
        305. <span style="font-weight: bold">Neither is it possible</span> (154)
      </p>
      <p>
        He shows that it is impossible to proceed to infinity in the case of
        material causes. First (154:C 300, he states what he intends to prove.
        Second (155:C 308), he proceeds with his proof (“Now there are two
        ways”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first it must be noted that a patient is subjected to
        the action of an agent. Therefore to pass from agent to agent is to
        proceed in an upward direction, whereas to pass from patient to patient
        is to proceed in a downward direction. Now just as action is attributed
        to the cause of motion, so is undergoing action attributed to matter.
        Therefore among the causes of motion the process is in an upward
        direction, whereas amon’,g material causes the process is in a downward
        direction. Consequently, since he showed among moving causes that it is
        impossible to proceed to infinity, as it were, in an upward direction,
        he adds that it is impossible to proceed to infinity in a downward
        direction, i.e., in the process of material causes, granted that there
        is a starting-point in an upward direction among the causes of motion.
      </p>
      <p>
        306. He illustrates this by way of the process of natural bodies, which
        proceeds in a downward direction, as if we were to say that water comes
        from fire, earth from water, and so on to infinity. He uses this example
        in accordance with the opinion of the ancient philosophers of nature,
        who held that one of these elements is the source of the others in a
        certain order.
      </p>
      <p>
        307. However, this can also be explained in another way, inasmuch as we
        understand that in the case of moving causes there are evident to the
        senses certain ultimate effects which do not move anything else.
        Therefore we do not ask if there is an infinite regress in the lower
        members of that class, but if there is an infinite regress in the higher
        ones. But in regard to the class of material causes, he assumes that
        there is one first cause which is the foundation and basis of the
        others; and he inquires whether there is an infinite regress in a
        downward direction in the process of those things which are generated
        from matter. The example which he gives illustrates this, because he
        does not say that fire comes from water and this in turn from something
        else, but the converse, i.e., that water comes from fire, and something
        else again from this. For this reason first matter is held to exist; and
        he asks whether the things that are generated from matter proceed to
        infinity.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">Now there are two ways in which</span>
        (155)
      </p>
      <p>
        He proves his original thesis. Concerning this he does four things.
        First (155:C 308), he distinguishes between the two ways in which one
        thing <i>comes from</i> something else. Second (156:C 31o), he shows
        that these two ways differ in two respects (“We say, then, that a man”).
        Third (158:C 312), he shows that it is impossible to proceed to infinity
        in either of these ways (“Now in neither way”). Fourth (159:C 314), he
        shows in which of these ways other things come from the first material
        principle (“At the same time”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He says, first, that one thing “comes from” another properly and
        essentially in two ways. He speaks thus in order to exclude that way in
        which something is said in an improper sense to
        <i>come from</i> something else only by reason of the fact that it
        <i>comes after it</i> as when it is said that certain feasts of the
        Greeks called the Olympian come from those called the Isthmian, or as we
        were to say that the feast of Epiphany comes from the the Nativity. But
        this is an improper use of the word, because the process of coming to be
        is a change, and in a change it is not only necessary that an order
        exist between the two limits of the change but also that both limits
        have the same subject. Now this is not the case in the above example,
        but we speak in this way insofar as we think of time as the subject of
        different feasts.
      </p>
      <p>
        309. Now properly speaking it is necessary to say that one thing comes
        from something else when some subject is changed from this into that.
        This occurs in two ways: first, as when we say that a man comes from a
        boy in the sense that a boy is changed from boyhood to manhood; second,
        as when we say that air comes from water as a result of substantial
        change.
      </p>
      <p>
        310.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">We say, then, that a man</span> (156).
      </p>
      <p>
        He explains the twofold sense in which these two ways differ. First, we
        say that a man comes from a boy in the sense that what has already come
        into being comes from what is coming into being, or in the sense that
        what has already been completed comes from what is being completed. For
        anything in a state of becoming and of being completed is midway between
        being and non-being, just as generation is midway between existence and
        nonexistence. Therefore, since we reach an extreme through an
        intermediate, we say that what has been generated comes from what is
        being generated, and that what has been completed comes from what is
        being completed. Now this is the sense in which we say that a man comes
        from a boy, or a man of science from a learner, because a learner is one
        who is becoming a man of science. But in the other sense, i.e., the one
        in which we say that water comes from fire, one of the limits of the
        change is not related to the other as a passage or intermediate, as
        generation is to being, but rather as the limit from which a thing
        starts in order to reach another limit. Therefore one comes from the
        other when the other is corrupted.
      </p>
      <p>
        311. <span style="font-weight: bold">This is why changes</span> (157)
      </p>
      <p>
        He infers another difference from the foregoing one. For since, in the
        first way, one thing is related to the other as generation is to being,
        and as an intermediate to a limit, it is evident that one is naturally
        ordained to the other. Therefore they are not reversible so that one
        comes from the other indifferently. Consequently we do not say that a
        boy comes from a man, but the reverse. The reason for this is that those
        two things, of which one is said to come from the other in this way, are
        not related to each other in the same way as the two limits of a change,
        but as two things one of which comes after the other in sequence. And
        this is what he means when he says that “what has come into being”
        (i.e., the terminus of generation or being) does not come from
        generation as though generation itself were changed into being, but is
        that which exists after generation, because it follows generation in a
        natural sequence; just as one’s destination comes after a journey, and
        as what is last comes after what is intermediate. Therefore, if we
        consider these two things, i.e., generation and being, the way in which
        they are related does not differ from the one we have excluded, in which
        sequence alone is considered, as when we say that the day comes from the
        dawn because it comes after the dawn. Moreover, this natural sequence
        prevents us from saying in an opposite way that the dawn comes “from the
        day,” i.e., after the day; and for the same reason a boy cannot come
        from a man. But in the other sense in which one thing comes from
        another, the process is reversible; for just as water is generated by
        reason of air being corrupted, in a similar way air is generated by
        reason of water being corrupted. The reason is that these two are not
        related to each other in a natural sequence, i.e., as an intermediate to
        a limit, but as two limits, either one of which can be first or last.
      </p>
      <p>
        312. <span style="font-weight: bold">Now in neither way</span> (158).
      </p>
      <p>
        He shows that it is impossible to proceed to infinity in either of these
        ways. First, in the way in which we say that a man comes from a boy; for
        the thing from which we say something else comes as a man comes from a
        boy has the position of an intermediary between two limits, i.e.,
        between being and non-being. But an infinite number of intermediates
        cannot exist when certain limits are held to exist, since limits are
        opposed to infinity. Therefore, it is impossible to have an infinite
        series in this way.
      </p>
      <p>
        313. In like manner it is impossible to have an infinite series in the
        other way; for in that way one limit is con; verted into the other,
        because the corruption of one is the generation of the other, as has
        been explained. Now wherever a reversible process exists there is a
        return to some first thing in the sense that what was av first a
        starting-point is afterwards a terminus. This cannot occur in the case
        of things that are infinite, in which there is neither a starting-point
        nor a terminus. Consequently, there is no way in which one thing can
        come from another in an infinite regress.
      </p>
      <p>
        314.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">At the same time it is impossible</span>
        (159).
      </p>
      <p>
        He shows in which of these ways something comes from first matter. Now
        it must be noted that in this place Aristotle uses two common
        suppositions accepted by all of the ancient philosophers: first, that
        there is a primary material principle, and therefore that in the process
        of generation there is no infinite regress on the part of the higher,
        i.e., of that from which a thing is generated; second, that matter is
        eternal. Therefore, from this second supposition he immediately
        concludes that nothing comes from first matter in the second way, i.e.,
        in the way in which water comes from air as a result of the latter’s
        corruption, because what is eternal cannot be corrupted.
      </p>
      <p>
        315. But since someone could say that the philosophers did not hold that
        the first material principle is eternal because it remains numerically
        one eternally but because it is eternal by succession (as if the human
        race were held to be eternal), he therefore excludes this from the first
        supposition. He says that since generation is not infinite in an upward
        direction but stops at a first material principle, then if there is a
        first material principle by reason of whose corruption other things come
        into being, it must not be the eternal principle of which the
        philosophers speak. The reason is that the first material principle
        cannot be eternal if other things are generated by reason of its
        corruption, and it in turn is generated by the corruption of something
        else. It is evident, then, that a thing comes from this first material
        principle as something imperfect and potential which is midway between
        pure nonbeing and actual being, but not as water comes from air by
        reason of the latter’s corruption.<br /></p

        Now such a thing is not for the sake of something else, but other things
        are for its sake. Therefore, if there is such a thing as an ultimate
        end, there will not be an infinite regress; but if there is no ultimate
        end, there will be no reason for which things come to be.

        165. For a prior definition is always more of a definition, whereas a

        does a later one.
      </p>
      <p>

        infinity.

        definition] does the infinite have?

        170. Again, if the classes of causes were infinite in number, it would
        also be impossible to know anything; for we think that we have
        scientific knowledge when we know the causes themselves of things; but
        what is infinite by addition cannot be traversed in a finite period of
        time.

        316. Having shown that there is no infinite regress either among the
        causes of motion or among material causes, the Philosopher now shows
        that the same thing is true of the final cause, which is called “that
        for the sake of which” something comes to be (160).
      </p>
      <p>
        He proves this by four arguments. The first is as follows. That for the
        sake of which something comes to be has the character of an end. But an
        end does not exist for the sake of other things, but others exist for
        its sake. Now such a thing either exists or not. If there is something
        of such a kind that all things exist for its sake and not it for the
        sake of something else, it will be the last thing in this order; and
        thus there will not be an infinite regress. However, if no such thing
        exists, no end will exist; and thus the class of cause called “that for
        the sake of which” will be eliminated.
      </p>
      <p>
        317.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Now those who posit infinity</span>
        (161).
      </p>
      <p>
        He gives the second argurgent, which is derived from the foregoing one;
        for from the first argument he concluded that those who posit an
        infinite regress in final causes do away with the final cause. Now when
        the final cause is removed, so also is the nature and notion of the
        good; because good and end have the same meaning, since the good is that
        which all desire, as is said in Book I of the <i>Ethics</i>. Therefore
        those who hold that there is an infinite regress in final causes do away
        completely with the nature of the good, although they do not realize
        this.
      </p>
      <p>
        318.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">But no one will attempt</span> (162).
      </p>
      <p>
        He gives the third argument, which is as follows. If there were an
        infinite number of final causes, no one could reach a last terminus,
        because there is no last terminus in an infinite series. But no one will
        attempt to do anything unless he thinks he is able to accomplish
        something as a final goal. Therefore, those who hold that final causes
        proceed to infinity do away with every attempt to operate and even with
        the activities of natural bodies; for a thing’s natural movement is only
        toward something which it is naturally disposed to attain.
      </p>
      <p>
        319. <span style="font-weight: bold">Nor will there be</span> (163).
      </p>
      <p>
        He states the fourth argument, which is as follows. One who posits an
        infinite number of final causes does away with a limit, and therefore
        with the end for the sake of which a cause acts. But every intelligent
        agent acts for the sake of some end. Therefore it would follow that
        there is no intellect among causes which are productive; and thus the
        practical intellect is eliminated. But since these things are absurd, we
        must reject the first position, from which they follow, i.e., that there
        is an infinite number of final causes.
      </p>
      <p>
        320. <span style="font-weight: bold">Nor can the quiddity</span> (164).
      </p>
      <p>
        He shows that there is not an infinite number of formal causes. In
        regard to this he does two things. First (164:C 320), he states what he
        intends to prove. Second (165:C 322), he proves it (“For a prior
        definition”).
      </p>
      <p>
        Regarding the first we must understand that each thing derives its
        particular species from its proper form, and this is why the definition
        of a species signifies chiefly a thing’s form. Therefore we must
        understand that a procession of forms is consequent upon a procession of
        definitions; for one part of a definition is prior to another just as
        genus is prior to difference and one difference is prior to another.
        Therefore an infinite regress in forms and in the parts of a definition
        is one and the same thing. Now since Aristotle wishes to show that it is
        impossible to proceed to infinity in the case of formal causes, he holds
        that it is impossible to proceed to infinity in the parts of a
        definition. Hence he says that it is impossible for a thing’s quiddity
        to be reduced to another definition, and so on to infinity, so that the
        defining notes are always increased in number. For example, one who
        defines man gives animal in his definition, and therefore the definition
        of man is reduced to that of animal, and this in turn to the definition
        of something else, thereby increasing the defining notes. But to proceed
        to infinity in this way is absurd.
      </p>
      <p>
        321. Now we do not mean by this that there are the same number of forms
        in each individual as there are genera and differences, so that in man
        there is one form by which he is man, another by which he is animal, and
        so on; but we mean that there must be as many grades of forms in reality
        as there are orders of genera and differences [in knowledge]. For we
        find in reality one form which is not the form of a body, another which
        is the form of a body but not of an animated body, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        322.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">For a prior definition</span> (165).
      </p>
      <p>
        He proves his premise by four arguments. The first is this. Wherever
        there are a number of forms or defining notes, a prior definition is
        always “more of a definition.” This does not mean that a prior form is
        more complete (for specific forms are complete), but that a prior form
        belongs to more things than a subsequent form, which is not found
        wherever a prior form is found; e.g., the definition of man is not found
        wherever that of animal is found. From this he argues that if the first
        note [of a series] does not fit the thing defined, “neither does a later
        one.” But if there were an infinite regress in definitions and forms,
        there would be no first definition or definitive form. Hence all
        subsequent definitions and forms would be eliminated.
      </p>
      <p>
        323.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Again, those who speak</span> (166).
      </p>
      <p>
        He gives the second argument, which is as follows. It is impossible to
        have scientific knowledge of anything until we come to what is
        undivided. Now in this place “undivided” cannot mean the singular,
        because there is no science of the singular. However, it can be
        understood in two other ways. First, it can mean the definition itself
        of the last species, which is not further divided by essential
        differences. In this sense his statement can mean that we do not have
        complete knowledge of a thing until we reach its last species; for one
        who knows the genus to which a thing belongs does not yet have a
        complete knowledge of that thing. According to this interpretation we
        must say that, just as the first argument concluded that it is
        impossible to have an infinite regress in an upward direction among
        formal causes, in a similar fashion this second argument concludes that
        it is impossible to have an infinite regress in a downward direction,
        otherwise it would be impossible to reach a last species. Therefore this
        position destroys any complete knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        324. Now a formal division exists not only when a genus is divided by
        differences (and when such division is no longer possible the last
        species can be said to be undivided), but also when the thing defined is
        divided into its definitive parts, as is evident in Book I of the
        <i>Physics</i>. Therefore in this place “undivided” can also mean a
        thing whose definition cannot be resolved into any definitive parts. Now
        according to this the supreme genus is undivided; and from this point of
        view his statement can mean that we cannot have scientific knowledge of
        a thing by definition unless we reach its supreme genera; because when
        these remain unknown it is impossible to know its subsequent genera. And
        according to this the second argument concludes, as the former one did,
        that it is impossible to proceed to infinity in an upward direction
        among formal causes.
      </p>
      <p>
        325. Or, in order to reach the same conclusion, “undivided” can be
        explained in another way, i.e., in the sense that an immediate
        proposition is undivided. For if it were possi ‘ hie to proceed to
        infinity in an upward direction in the case of definitions, there would
        be no immediate proposition, and thus science as such, which is about
        conclusions derived from immediate principles, would be destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
        326. <span style="font-weight: bold">Nor will knowledge</span> (167)
      </p>
      <p>
        He gives the third argument, which proceeds to [show that such an
        infinite regress would] destroy not only science but any kind of human
        knowing whatsoever. In regard to this argument he does two things. First
        (167:C 326), he gives his argument. Second (168:C 327), he refutes an
        objection raised against it (“This case is not like”).
      </p>
      <p>
        The argument is as follows. We know each thing by understanding its
        form. But if there were an infinite regress in forms, these forms could
        not be understood, because the intellect is incapable of understanding
        the infinite as infinite. Therefore this position destroys knowing in
        its entirety.
      </p>
      <p>
        327. <span style="font-weight: bold">This case is not like</span> (168).
      </p>
      <p>
        He disposes of an objection; for someone could say that a thing having
        an infinite number of forms can be understood in the same way as a line
        which is divided to infinity. But he denies this. He says that this case
        is not the same as that of a line, whose divisions do not stop but go on
        to infinity. For it is impossible to understand anything unless some
        limit is set to it. Therefore a line can be understood inasmuch as some
        actual limit is given to it by reason of its extremes. However, it
        cannot be understood insofar as its division does not terminate. Hence
        no one can count the divisions of a line insofar as they are infinite.
        But as applied to forms “infinite” means actually infinite, and not
        potentially infinite as it does when applied to the division of a line.
        Therefore, if there were an infinite number of forms, there would be no
        way in which a thing could be known either scientifically or in any way
        at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        328. <span style="font-weight: bold">But it is necessary</span> (169).
      </p>
      <p>
        He gives the fourth argument, which runs thus. Matter must be understood
        to exist in everything that is moved; for whatever is moved is in
        potentiality, and what is in potentiality is matter. But matter itself
        has the character of the infinite, and nothingness belongs to the
        infinite in the sense of matter, because matter taken in itself is
        understood without any of kind of form. And since nothingness belongs to
        the infinite, it follows contrariwise that the principle by which the
        infinite is a being is itself not infinite, and that it does not belong
        “to the infinite,” i.e., to matter, to be infinite in being. But things
        are by virtue of their form. Hence there is no infinite regress among
        forms.
      </p>
      <p>
        329. However, it must be noted that in this place Aristotle holds that
        the infinite involves the notion of nothingness, not because matter
        involves the notion of privation (as Plato claimed when he failed to
        distinguish between privation and matter), but because the infinite
        involves the notion of privation. For a potential being contains the
        notion of the infinite only insofar as it comes under the nature of
        privation, as is evident in Book III of the <i>Physics</i>.

        330. <span style="font-weight: bold">Again, if the classes</span> (170).
      </p>
      <p>
        He shows that the classes of causes are not infinite in number, and he
        uses the following argument. We think that we have scientific knowledge
        of each thing when we know all its causes. But if there were an infinite
        number of causes in the sense that one class of cause may be added to
        another continuously, it would be impossible to traverse this infinity
        in such a way that all causes could be known. Hence in this way too the
        knowing of things would be destroyed.<br /></p

        ARISTOTLE’S TEXT Chapter 3: 994b 32-995a 20
      </p>
      <p>
        171. The way in which people are affected by what they hear depends upon
        the things to which they are accustomed; for it is in terms of such
        things that we judge statements to be true, and anything over and above
        these does not seem similar but less intelligible and more remote. For
        it is the things to which we are accustomed that are better known.
      </p>
      <p>
        172. The great force which custom has is shown by the laws, in which
        legendary and childish elements prevail over our knowledge of them,
        because of custom.
      </p>
      <p>
        173. Now some men will not accept what a speaker says unless he speaks
        in mathematical terms; and others, unless he gives examples; while
        others expect him to quote a poet as an authority. Again, some want
        everything stated with certitude, while others find certitude annoying,
        either because they are incapable of comprehending anything, or because
        they consider exact inquiry to be quibbling; for there is some
        similarity. Hence it seems to some men that, just as liberality is
        lacking in the matter of a fee for a banquet, so also is it lacking in
        arguments.
      </p>
      <p>
        174. For this reason one must be trained how to meet every kind of
        argument; and it is absurd to search simultaneously for knowledge and
        for the method of acquiring it; for neither of these is easily attained.
      </p>
      <p>
        175. But the exactness of mathematics is not to be expected in all
        cases, but only in those which have no matter. This is why its method is
        not that of natural philosophy; for perhaps the whole of nature contains
        matter. Hence we must first investigate what nature is; for in this way
        it will become evident what the things are with which natural philosophy
        deals, and whether it belongs to one science or to several to consider
        the causes and principles of things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        331. Having shown that the study of truth is in one sense difficult and
        in another easy, and that it belongs preeminently to first philosophy,
        the Philosopher now exposes the proper
        <span style="font-weight: bold">method</span> of investigating the
        truth. In regard to this he does two things. First (171:C 331), he gives
        the different methods which men follow in the study of truth. Second
        (335), he shows which method is the proper one (“For this reason one
        must”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he shows how powerful
        <span style="font-weight: bold">custom</span> is in the study of truth.
        Second (172:C 333), he makes this clear by an example (“The great
        force”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He says, first, that the way in which people are affected by what they
        hear depends upon the things to which they are accustomed, because such
        things are more willingly heard and more easily understood. For things
        spoken of in a manner to which we are accustomed seem to us to be
        acceptable; and if any things are said to us over and above what we have
        been accustomed to hear, these do not seem to have the same degree of
        truth. As a matter of fact they seem less intelligible to us and further
        removed from reason just because we are not accustomed to them; for it
        is the things which we are accustomed to hear that we know best of all.
      </p>
      <p>
        332. Now the reason for this is that things which are customary become
        natural. Hence a <span style="font-weight: bold">habit</span>, which
        disposes us in a way similar to
        <span style="font-weight: bold">nature</span>, is also acquired by
        customary activity. And from the fact that someone has some special sort
        of nature or special kind of habit, he has a definite relationship to
        one thing or another. But in every kind of cognition there must be a
        definite relationship between the knower and the object of cognition.
        Therefore, to the extent that natures and habits differ, there are
        diverse kinds of cognition. For we see that there are innate first
        principles in men because of their human nature, and that what is proper
        to some special virtue appears good to one who has this habit of virtue;
        and, again, that something appears palatable to the sense of taste
        because of its disposition. Therefore, since custom produces a habit
        which is similar to nature, it follows that what is customary is better
        known.
      </p>
      <p>333. <b>The great force</b> (172)</p>
      <p>
        Here he makes his previous statement clear by giving a concrete case. He
        says that the <span style="font-weight: bold">laws</span> which men pass
        are positive evidence of the force of custom; for the legendary and
        childish elements in these laws are more effective in winning assent
        than is knowledge of the truth. Now the Philosopher is speaking here of
        the laws <span style="font-weight: bold">devised by men</span>, which
        have as their ultimate end the preservation of the political community.
        Therefore the men who have established these laws have handed down in
        them, in keeping with the diversity of peoples and nations involved,
        certain directives by which human souls might be drawn away from evil
        and persuaded to do good, although
        <span style="font-weight: bold">many</span> of them, which men had heard
        from childhood and of which they approved more readily than of what they
        knew to be true, were empty and
        <span style="font-weight: bold">foolish</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the law <span style="font-weight: bold">given by God</span> directs
        men to that true happiness to which everything false is opposed.
        Therefore there is nothing false in the divine law.
      </p>
      <p>334. <b>Now some men</b> (173).</p>
      <p>
        Here he shows how men as a result of custom use different methods in the
        study of truth. He says that some men listen to what is said to them
        only if it is mathematical in character; and this is acceptable to those
        who have been educated in mathematics because of the habits which they
        have. Now since custom is like nature, the same thing can also happen to
        certain men (1) because they are poorly disposed in some respect, e.g.,
        those who have a strong imagination but little intelligence. (2) Then
        there are others who do not wish to accept anything unless they are
        given a concrete example, either because they are accustomed to this or
        because their sensory powers dominate and their intellect is weak. (3)
        Again, there are some who think that nothing is convincing enough unless
        a poet or some authority is cited. This is also a result either of
        custom or of poor judgment, because they cannot decide for themselves
        whether the conclusion of an argument is certain; and therefore, having
        no faith in their own judgment, as it were, they require the judgment of
        some recognized authority. (4) Again there are others who want
        everything said to them with certitude, i.e., by way of careful rational
        investigation. This occurs because of the superior intelligence of the
        one making the judgment and the arguments of the one conducting the
        investigation, provided that one does not look for certitude where it
        cannot be had. (5) On the other hand there are some who are annoyed if
        some matter is investigated in an exact way by means of a careful
        discussion. This can occur for two reasons. (a) First, they lack the
        ability to comprehend anything; for since their reasoning power is poor
        they are unable to understand the order in which premises are related to
        conclusions. (b) Second, it occurs because of quibbling, i.e., reasoning
        about the smallest matters, which bears some resemblance to the search
        for certitude since it leaves nothing undiscussed down to the smallest
        detail. (c) Then there are some who think that, just as liberality is
        lacking when the smallest details are taken into account in estimating
        the fee for a banquet, in a similar way there is a lack of civility and
        liberality when a man also wishes to discuss the smallest details in the
        search for truth.
      </p>
      <p>335. <b>For this reason one must be trained</b> (174).</p>
      <p>
        He exposes the <span style="font-weight: bold">proper method</span> of
        investigating the truth. Concerning this he does two things. First
        (335), he shows how a man can discover the proper method of
        investigating the truth. Second (336), he explains that the method which
        is absolutely the best should not be demanded in all matters (“But the
        exactness of mathematics”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He says, first, that since different men use different methods in the
        search for truth, one must be trained in the method which the particular
        sciences must use to investigate their subject. And since it is not easy
        for a man to undertake two things at once (indeed, so long as he tries
        to do both he can succeed in neither), it is absurd for a man to try to
        acquire a science and at the same time to acquire the method proper to
        that science. This is why a man should learn
        <span style="font-weight: bold">logic</span> before any of the other
        sciences, because logic considers the general method of procedure in all
        the other sciences.
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >Moreover, the method appropriate to the particular sciences should be
          considered at the beginning of these sciences</span
        >.
      </p>
      <p>336. <b>But the exactness of mathematics</b> (175).</p>
      <p>
        He shows that the method which is absolutely the best should not be
        demanded in all the sciences. He says that the “exactness,” i.e., the
        careful and certain demonstrations, found in <i>mathematics</i> should
        not be demanded in the case of all things of which we have science, but
        only in the case of those things which have no matter; for things that
        have matter are subject to motion and change, and therefore in their
        case complete certitude cannot be had. For in the case of these things
        we do not look for what exists always and of necessity, but only for
        what exists in the majority of cases.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now <span style="font-weight: bold">immaterial</span> things are most
        certain by their very nature because they are unchangeable, although
        they are not certain to us because our intellectual power is weak, as
        was stated above (279). The separate substances are things of this kind.
        But while the things with which mathematics deals are abstracted from
        matter, they do not surpass our understanding; and therefore in their
        case most certain reasoning is demanded.
      </p>
      <p>
        Again, because the whole of nature involves matter, this method of most
        certain reasoning does not belong to <i>natural philosophy</i>. However,
        he says “perhaps” because of the celestial bodies, since they do not
        have matter in the same sense that lower bodies do.
      </p>
      <p>
        337. Now since this method of most certain reasoning is not the method
        proper to <i>natural science</i>, therefore in order to know which
        method is proper to that science we must investigate first what nature
        is; for in this way we will discover the things which natural philosophy
        studies. Further, we must investigate “whether it belongs to one
        science,” i.e., to natural philosophy, or to several sciences, to
        consider all causes and principles; for in this way we will be able to
        learn which method of demonstration is proper to natural philosophy. He
        deals with this method in Book II of the <i>Physics</i>, as is obvious
        to anyone who examines it carefully.
