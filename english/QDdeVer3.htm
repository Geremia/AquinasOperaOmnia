<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: bold">Ideas are the object of our inquiry,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: bold">and in the first article we ask:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">Are there ideas in God?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[Parallel readings: <i>S.T.</i>, I, 151 1; 44, 3; <i>I Sent.</i>, 36, 2, 1; <i>I Metaph.</i>, lect. 15, nn. 232-33.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">Difficulties</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">It seems that there are no ideas in Him, for</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1. God&#8217;s knowledge is most perfect. Now, knowledge had from the essence of a thing is more
perfect than knowledge had from its likeness. Consequently, God knows things, not by means
of their likenesses, but by means of their essences. Hence, those likenesses of things which are
called ideas do not exist in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">2. But it was said that God knows things more perfectly by knowing them through His essence,
which is a likeness of things, than He would if He knew them through their own essences.&#8212;On
the contrary, knowledge is an assimilation to the thing known. Hence, the more the medium of
knowing resembles and is united with the thing known, the more perfectly is the thing known by
means of that medium. But the essence of created things is more united with things than the
divine essence is. Consequently, God would know things more perfectly if He knew them by
means of their essences than He does by knowing them through His own essence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">3. But it was said that the perfection of knowledge consists in the union of the medium of
knowledge with the knower, not with the thing known.&#8212;On the contrary, the species of a thing,
which is in the intellect, is rendered individual by the act of existence it has in the intellect; but
in relation to the thing known it has the character of a universal, since it is a likeness of the thing
according to its common nature and not according to its particular conditions. Yet the knowledge
which is made possible by means of that species is not singular but universal. Hence, knowledge
follows the relation of the species to the thing known rather than its relation to the knower.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">4. The Philosopher criticizes Plato&#8217;s theory of ideas because the latter asserted that the forms of
material things existed without matter. Now, these forms would exist without matter to a much
greater extent were they in the divine intellect instead of being outside of it, because the divine
intellect is the acme of immateriality. Therefore, it is much more inconsistent to say that ideas
exist in the divine intellect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">5. The Philosopher criticizes Plato&#8217;s theory of ideas because the ideas he posited can neither
generate nor be generated, and hence are useless. But, if the ideas are said to be in the divine
mind, they also will not be generated&#8212;because whatever is generated is composite&#8212;nor will
they generate, for, since whatever is generated is composite and whatever generates resembles
what is generated, that which generates must also be composite. Hence, it would be inconsistent
to say that there are ideas in the divine mind.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">6. Dionysius says that God knows existing things by means of the non-existing, and that He does
not know them by means of ideas. But the only reason for affirming the existence of ideas in God
is so He can know things by their means. Hence, ideas do not exist in God&#8217;s mind.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">7. Whatever has been modeled upon an. archetype is proportionate to it. But there is no
proportion of a creature with God, just as there is no proportion between what is finite and what
is infinite. Therefore, in God there cannot be any archetypes of creatures; consequently, since
ideas are exemplary forms, it seems that ideas of things do not exist in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">8. Ideas are the rule of knowledge and action. But that which cannot err in its knowledge or
action does not need a rule for either; and, since God is this kind of being, it seems out of place
to say that there are ideas in him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">9. We read in the <i>Metaphysics </i>that just as being one in quantity causes equality, so being one in
quality causes resemblance. Now, because of the difference between God and a creature, a
creature can in no way be said to be equal to God, nor can God be said to be equal to a crcature.
Therefore, there is nothing in God that resembles a creature. Consequently, since <i>idea </i>means a
likeness of a thing, it seems that there are no ideas of things in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">10. If ideas are in God, they are there only for the production of creatures. But Anselm says: &#8220;It
is sufficiently clear that in the Word, through which all things have been made, likenesses of
things do not exist. Only the one simple essence is present.&#8221; Therefore, it seems that ideas, which
are called the likenesses of things, do not exist in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">11. God knows Himself in the same way in which He knows other things; otherwise, His
knowledge would be multiple and divisible. Now, God does not know Himself by means of an
idea. Therefore, He does not know other things by means of ideas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1. Augustine says: &#8220;Whoever denies that there are ideas is an infidel, since he denies the
existence of the Son.&#8221; Therefore.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">2. Every intellectual agent possesses within himself a plan of his work; otherwise, he would not
know what he was doing. But God acts through His intellect, and He is not ignorant of what He
is doing. Therefore, there exist within Him intelligible characters of things, and these are called
ideas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">3. As is said in the <i>Physics</i>: &#8220;The three causes, namely, the efficient, final, and formal causes, are
ultimately identical.&#8221;Now, God is the efficient and final cause of things. Hence, He is also their
formal cause &#8212;but as an exemplary cause, since He cannot be a form that is part of a creature.
We conclude as before.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">4. A particular effect is not produced by a universal cause unless the universal cause is proper or
appropriated. Now, all particular effects are from God, who is the universal cause of all things.
Hence, they should come from Him in so far as He is the proper or appropriated cause of each
and every one of them. But this would not be possible unless the intelligible characters of things
existed in Him. Hence, the intelligible characters of things, that is, ideas, must exist in Him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">5. Augustine says: &#8220;I regret that I said that there are two worlds, one the object of sense, the other
the object of intellect&#8212;not because this is not true, but because I said it as though it were an
original idea, when in fact it had been previously pointed out by philosophers, and because this
manner of speaking is not usual in Holy Scripture. Now, the intelligible world is nothing other
than the idea of the world. Hence, it is true that there are ideas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">6. Speaking to God, Boethius says: &#8220;You have drawn all things from the highest pattern, having
in your mind the glorious world&#8212;you, the most glorious of all.&#8221; Therefore, the pattern of the
world, and of all that is in the world, is in God; and our conclusion is the same as before.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">7. In the Gospel according to John (1:3-4), we read: &#8220;What was made in him was life...&#8221; This
means, as Augustine says,&#8221;, that all creatures are in the divine mind as a piece of furniture is in
the mind of a cabinetmaker. Now, a piece of furniture is in the mind of a cabinetmaker by means
of its idea and likeness. Therefore, ideas of all things are in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">8. A mirror does not lead us to the knowledge of things unless their likenesses are reflected in
it. Now, the uncreated Word is a mirror that leads to the knowledge of all creatures, because by
the Word the Father utters Himself and all other things. Therefore, likenesses of all things are in
the Word.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">9. Augustine says: &#8220;The Son is the Father&#8217;s art, containing the living forms of all things.&#8221; Now,
those forms are nothing other than ideas. Therefore, ideas exist in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">10. Augustine says that there are two ways of knowing things: through an essence and through
a likeness. Now, God does not know things by means of their essence, because only those things
which are present in the knower are known in this manner. Therefore, since He does know things,
as is clear from what has been said previously, He must know them by means of their likenesses.
Hence, our conclusion is the same as before.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">As Augustine says: &#8220;We can literally translate &#953;&#948;&#949;&#945;&#953; as <i>species </i>or <i>forms</i>. Now, the <i>form</i> of a
thing has three meanings. First, it can mean that <i>from which </i>a thing gets its form, as when we say
that the informing of an effect proceeds from the form of the agent. Now, an action does not
necessarily result in effects that attain the complete character of the form of the agent, for effects
often fall short of this, especially in the case of equivocal causes. Consequently, the form <i>from
which </i>something gets its form is not said to be its idea or form. Second, the form of a thing can
mean that <i>by which </i>a thing is informed, as when we say that the soul is the form of man, and the
shape of a statue is the form of the bronze. Now, although form, which is part of the composite,
is truly said to be the form of a thing, we do not usually call it its idea, because it seems that the
word <i>idea </i>signifies a form separate from that whose form it is. Third, the form of a thing can
mean that <i>according to which</i> a thing is informed. This is the exemplary form in imitation of
which a thing is made. It is in this meaning that <i>idea </i>is ordinarily used. Hence, the idea of a thing
is the form which a thing imitates.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Note, however, that a thing can imitate a form in two ways. It can imitate it because of the
agent&#8217;s intention, as an artist makes his painting imitate someone whose portrait he is making.
It happens at times, however, that such an imitation is not intentional, but happens by chance or
by accident. For example, painters frequently paint something resembling someone when they
have not intended to do so. Now, what imitates a form by chance is not said to be formed
according to that form, because <i>according to </i>seems to imply direction to an end. Hence, since
the exemplary form or idea is that according to which a thing is formed, the exemplary form or
idea should imitate something intentionally, not accidentally.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">We see also that a thing acts because of an end in two ways. The agent himself may determine
his end&#8212;and this is true of all intellectual agents&#8212;or the end of the agent may be determined by
another principal agent. For example, the flight of an arrow is toward a definite end, but this end
is determined by the archer. Similarly, an operation of a nature which is for a definite end
presupposes an intellect that has pre-established the end of the nature and ordered it to that end.
For this reason, every work of nature is said to be a work of intelligence. Consequently, if a thing
imitating something else comes into existence through an agent which has not itself determined
the end, the form imitated will not have the character of an exemplar or idea merely because of
what has happened. For example, we do not say that the form of the man who generates is the
idea or exemplar of the man who is generated; but we use these terms only when an agent acting
for an end has determined the end himself&#8212;whether the form imitated be within him or outside
of him. For we say that the form of art in the artist is the plan or idea of the artistic product, and
we also say that a form outside the artist is a plan if he imitates it when he makes a thing. This,
therefore, seems to constitute the character of an idea: It must be a form which something
imitates because of the intention of an agent who antecedently determines the end himself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Consequently, it is clear that those who say that all things happen by chance cannot admit the
existence of ideas. This opinion, however, is criticized by philosophers, because things which
happen by chance do not happen uniformly, but happen only in a few instances. We see,
however, that the course of nature always, or at least in most cases, proceeds in an uniform
manner.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Similarly, those who say that all things proceed from God by a necessity of nature and not by a
decision of will cannot admit ideas, because those who act impelled by the necessity of nature
do not determine the end for themselves. This cannot be the case here, however, because, if a
thing acts for an end but does not determine that end itself, it has its end determined for it by
something else superior to it; and thus there would be a cause superior to God. This, of course,
is impossible, since all those who speak of God understand Him to be the first cause of beings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">For these reasons, Plato affirmed the existence of ideas, avoiding the opinion of the Epicureans,
who asserted that everything happens by chance, and that of Empedocles and others who asserted
that everything happens because of a natural necessity. This reason for affirming ideas, namely,
on account of the previous planning of the works that are to be done, is suggested by Dionysius,
who says: &#8220;We say that exemplars in God are the intelligible characters of things that come to
be, the individually pre-existing causes of subsistent beings. These, theology calls
&#8216;predefinitions.&#8217; They predetermine and cause godly and good inclinations in creatures. It is
according to these that the super-substance predefines and produces all things. However, because
an exemplary form or idea has, in some sense, the nature of an end, and because an artist receives
the form by which he acts&#8212;if it is outside of him&#8212;we cannot say that the divine ideas are
outside of God. They can be only within the divine mind, for it is unreasonable to say that God
acts on account of an end other than Himself or that He receives that which enables Him to act
from a source other than Himself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1. The perfection of knowledge can be considered either with reference to the knower or with
reference to the thing known. When it is said, therefore, that knowledge by means of an essence
is more perfect than that had by means of a likeness, this is to be understood as referring to what
is known. For that which is knowable in itself is, in itself, known more than that which, not
knowable in itself, is known only in so far as it is in a knower by means of its likeness. In this
sense, it is not inconsistent to say that created things are less knowable than the divine essence,
which is knowable by its very nature.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">2. Two things are required for a species which is a medium of knowledge. First, it must represent
the thing known. This belongs to a species in so far as it approaches the nature of what is known.
Second, it must have a spiritual or immaterial act of existing. This belongs to a species in so far
as it has its act of existing in the knower. For this reason, a thing is known better by means of an
intellectual species than by means of the species in sense, since the former is more immaterial.
Similarly, a thing is known better by means of the species in the divine mind than it could be
known by means of its own essence&#8212;even granting that the essence of a thing could be the
medium of knowledge despite its materiality.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">3. Two elements of knowledge must be considered. First, we must consider its nature; and this
is determined by the relation of the species to the intellect in which it exists. Second, we must
consider the determinate character which the knowledge has with respect to its object; and this
follows the relation that the species has to the thing itself. Hence, the more similar the species
is as a representation to the thing known, the more determinate is the knowledge; and the more
it approaches immateriality, which belongs to the nature of the knower in so far as he knows, the
more efficacious it is in the production of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">4. It is contrary to the nature of natural forms that they should be immaterial in themselves; but
it is not inconsistent for them to acquire immateriality from the one in whom they exist.
Consequently, in our intellects, the forms of natural things are immaterial. Hence, while it would
be incorrect to assert that ideas of natural things have a separate subsistence, it would be correct
to say that they are in the divine mind.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">5. Strictly speaking, the ideas existing in the divine mind neither generate nor are generated, but
rather create or produce things. Hence, Augustine says: &#8220;Although they themselves neither begin
nor cease to be, nevertheless, whatever can begin or cease to be is said to be informed according
to them.&#8221; Nor is it necessary, when composite things are made, for the first efficient cause to
resemble what is generated: this is true only of the proximate efficient cause. Since Plato asserted
that the ideas are the proximate principle of generation, the argument mentioned in the difficulty
is directed against him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">6. Dionysius wished to say merely that God does not know by means of an idea received from
things or in such a manner that He would know a thing differently by means of an idea. For this
reason, another translation of this passage reads: &#8220;Nor does He by His vision come into contact
with individual things.&#8221; Hence, from this argument, it is not impossible for ideas to exist.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">7. Although there can be no proportion between God and a creature, there can be a
proportionality, as we have previously shown.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">8. Just as God does not need an essence other than His act of existence, because He cannot not
be, neither does He need a norm other than Himself, because He cannot know or act in a way that
would be faulty. The reason for this perfection is that He is His own norm, just as the reason for
the necessity of His existence is that His essence is His act of existence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">9. In God there is no dimensional quantity on whose basis an equality could be established. There
is in Him, however, quantity after the manner of intensive quantity. For example, whiteness is
said to be <i>great</i> when it attains the perfect fullness of its nature. The intensity of a form,
moreover, refers to the manner in which that form is possessed. Now, although that which is
divine may in some way be passed on to creatures, we can never grant that a creature possesses
it in the same way in which God possesses it. Hence, although we grant that there exists a
likeness between a creature and God in some way, we do not grant that they are equal in any way
whatsoever.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">10. As will be evident to one who carefully considers Anselm&#8217;s words, Anselm means to say
merely that in the Word there exists no likeness drawn from things themselves, but, instead, all
the forms of things are taken from the Word. Accordingly, he means that the Word is not a
likeness of things, but things are imitations of the Word. Consequently, this argument does not
dispense with the ideas, since an idea is a form which something imitates.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">11. The statement that God knows Himself in the same way in which He knows other things is
true if we are speaking about the way of knowing with reference to the knower. It is not true,
however, if we are speaking about the way of knowing with reference to the thing known,
because the creature which is known by God is not the same in the real order as the medium by
which God knows. But He Himself is really the same as it. Consequently, it does not follow that
there is multiplicity in His essence.</p>

<A NAME="2"><p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">ARTICLE II</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: bold">In the second article we ask:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">Are there many ideas?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[Parallel readings: <i>S.T.</i>, I, 15, 7; 44, 3; 47, 1, ad 2; <i>I Sent.</i>, 36, 2, 2; <i>III Sent.</i>, 14, 2, sol. 2; <i>C.G.</i>,
I, 54; <i>De pot.</i>, 3, 16, ad 12-14; <i>Quodl.</i>, IV, 1, 1.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">Difficulties</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">It seems not, for</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1. The things which are predicated essentially of God are not less true of Him than those which
are predicated personally of Him. Now, a plurality of personal properties involves a plurality of
persons, and for this reason God is said to be triune. Consequently, since ideas are essential
perfections because common to all three Persons, if the number of ideas is determined by the
number of things that there are, it follows that there are not only three Persons but an infinite
number of them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">2. It was said, however, that ideas are not essential properties, since they are the essence
itself.&#8212;On the contrary, God&#8217;s goodness, wisdom, and power are His essence, yet they are said
to be essential attributes. Therefore, even though they are His essence, ideas can be called His
essential properties.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">3. Whatever is attributed to God should be attributed to Him as existing in the most noble manner
possible. Now, God is the principle of all things; hence, whatever pertains to the nobility of a
principle should be said to exist in Him in the highest possible degree. However, unity is a
perfection of this sort, because, as is said in <i>The Causes</i>: &#8220;Every power is more infinite when it
has unity than when it is multiplied.&#8221; Hence, the highest unity is in God. He is, therefore, not only
one in reality, but also one in concept, because that which is one in both respects is more <i>one </i>than
that which is one merely in one respect. Consequently, many intelligible characters or ideas do
not exist in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">4. The Philosopher says: &#8220;What is entirely one cannot be separated either by intellect, time, place,
or concept&#8212;especially with regard to its substance.&#8221; Consequently, if God is one in the highest
degree because He is being in the highest degree, conceptual distinctions are not applicable to
Him; so, our original position stands.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">5. If there are many ideas, they must be unequal, because one idea will contain only the act of
existence, another, both existence and life, a third, both of these and intellection
besides&#8212;according as the thing, whose idea it is, resembles God in one or many respects. But,
since it is inconsistent to say that there is any inequality in God, it seems that there cannot be
many ideas in Him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">6. Material causes can be reduced to one first matter, and efficient and final causes can be
reduced in a similar manner. Consequently, formal causes can also be reduced to one first form.
The end-term of this reduction, however, will be ideas, because, as Augustine says: &#8220;these are
the principal forms or intelligible characters of things.&#8221; Hence, there is only one idea in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">7. But it was said that, although there is only one first form, ideas are nevertheless said to be
many because of the different relations this form has.&#8212;On the contrary, it cannot be said that
ideas are multiplied because of their relation to God in whom they exist, for He is one; nor can
they be multiplied because of their relation to what is made according to them and as these
creatures exist in the first cause, since, as Dionysius says, in the first cause creatures exist as one.
Finally, ideas cannot be multiplied because of their relation to what is made according to them
and as these things exist in their own natures, because creatures are temporal and ideas are
eternal. Hence, there is no possible way of saying that the ideas are many because of their relation
to the first form.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">8. The relation between God and creature does not exist in God; it exists only in the creature. But
an idea or exemplar implies a relation of God to a creature. Therefore, that relation is not in God
but only in the creature. Now, since the idea is in God, ideas cannot be multiplied by relations
of this sort.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">9. An intellect that knows by means of many species is composite and moves from one to
another. But this way of knowing is far from God&#8217;s way. Therefore, since ideas are the
intelligible characters of things by which God understands, it seems that there are not many ideas
in Him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1. The same thing under the same aspect can, of its very nature, produce only one and the same
reality. But God produces many and different things. Hence, God causes things, not according
to one concept, but according to many concepts. But the concepts by which God produces things
are ideas. Therefore, there are many ideas in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">2. Augustine says: &#8220;It remains, therefore, that all things are created by plan, but a man not by the
same plan as a horse. So to think would be absurd.&#8221; Each thing is therefore created according to
its own plan; hence, there are many ideas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">3. Augustine says&#8221; that it is just as wrong to say that the plan which God has of man in general
is the same as that of this man in particular as it is to say that the idea of an angle is the same as
that of a square. It seems, therefore, that there are many plans in God&#8217;s ideas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">4. The Epistle to the Hebrews (11:3) states: &#8220;By faith we understand that the world was framed
by the word of God; that from invisible things visible things might be made.&#8221; Note that he refers
to the ideal species as invisible <i>things </i>(plural). Hence, there are many ideas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">5. The saints call ideas art and the world, as is clear from the authorities cited. But <i>art </i>implies
plurality, for art is a collection of precepts converging toward one end. <i>World </i>has a similar
connotation, since it implies the collection of all creatures. Hence, we should affirm the existence
of many ideas in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">While admitting that God acts through His intellect and not under the compulsion of His nature,
some have said that He intends only one thing, namely, creature in general, and the distinction
between creatures is brought about by secondary causes. They declare that God first established
one intelligence that produced three things: a soul, the world, and another intelligence; and by
means of this procession a plurality of things issued forth from the one first principle. According
to this position, there would, indeed, be an idea in God, but only one common to all creation. The
proper idea of each individual thing would exist only in secondary causes. This opinion,
Dionysius says, was held by a certain philosopher named Clement, who maintained that higher
beings were the archetypes of lower.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">This opinion, however, cannot stand, because if the intention of an agent is directed toward one
thing only, whatever else that follows is apart from his intention and, as it were, a chance
happening, which happens accidentally in conjunction with that which he principally intended.
This would make the agent like someone who wants to produce something that is triangular, and
whether it is small or large is a matter of indifference to him. Now, to whatever is general
something special is indirectly connected. Hence, if an agent intends merely something general,
in whatever way it is determined by something special it is entirely apart from his intention. For
example, if nature intends to generate only an animal, it is apart from nature&#8217;s intention that what
is generated be a man or a horse. Consequently, if God&#8217;s intention when He acts regards only
creatures in general, then all distinction between creatures happens by chance. But it is hardly
correct to say that this difference between creatures is related only accidentally to the first cause
and essentially to second causes, since what is essential is previous to what is accidental, and the
relation of a thing to the first cause is previous to its relation to a second cause, as is clear from
<i>The Causes. </i>Consequently, it is impossible for the distinction between creatures to be related
only accidentally to the first cause and essentially to a second cause. The opposite, however, can
happen; for we see that those things that happen by chance as far as we are concerned are
foreknown by God and ordained by Him. Hence, we must say that all the distinction between
things is predefined by God. Consequently, we must affirm that intelligible characters proper to
individual things exist in God and that for this reason there are in Him many ideas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">From this the plurality of ideas can be understood. A form can exist in the intellect in two ways.
First, it can exist there so as to be a principle of the act of understanding, as is the form had by
a knower in so far as he understands. This is the likeness of what is understood, existing in him.
Second, the form can exist in the intellect so as to be the end-term of the act of understanding.
For example, by understanding an architect thinks out the form of a house; and since that form
has been thought out by means of an act of understanding and is, as it were, effected by that act,
it cannot be a principle of the act of understanding and thus the first means by which the
understanding takes place. It is, instead, <i>the understood, </i>by which the knower makes something.
Nevertheless, it is the second means by which understanding takes place, because it is by means
of the excogitated form that the architect understands what he is to make. Similarly, with respect
to the speculative intellect, we see that the species by which the intellect is informed so that it
can actually understand is the first means by which understanding takes place; and because the
intellect is brought into act by means of this form, it can now operate and form quiddities of
things, as well as compose and divide. Consequently, the quiddities formed in the intellect, or
even the affirmative and negative propositions, are, in a sense, products of the intellect, but
products of such a kind that through them the intellect arrives at the knowledge of an exterior
thing. Hence, this product is, in a fashion, a second means by which understanding takes place.
If, however, the intellect of an artist were to produce a work that resembled itself, then, indeed,
the very intellect of the artist would be an idea, not in so far as it is an intellect, but in so far as
it is understood.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Now, with respect to those things made in imitation of something else, we sometimes find that
they imitate their archetype perfectly. In such a case, the operative intellect when preconceiving
the form of what was made, possesses as an idea the very form of the thing imitated precisely as
the form of the thing imitated. At other times, however, we find that that which is made in
imitation of another is not a perfect imitation. In this case, the operative intellect would not take
as its idea or archetype the form of the archetype itself, absolutely and exactly as it is, but it takes
it with a definite proportion varying according to the degree of closeness with which the copy
imitates the original.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">I say, therefore, that God, who makes all things by means of His intellect, produces them all in
the likeness of His own essence. Hence, His essence is the idea of things&#8212;not, indeed, His
essence considered as an essence, but considered as it is known. Created things, however, do not
perfectly imitate the divine essence. Consequently, His essence as the idea of things is not
understood by the divine intellect unqualifiedly, but with the proportion to the divine essence had
by the creature to be produced, that is, according as the creature falls short of, or imitates, the
divine essence. Now, different things imitate the divine essence in different ways, each one
according to its own proper manner, since each has its own act of existence, distinct from that
of another. We can say, therefore, that the divine essence is the idea of each and every thing,
understanding, of course, the different proportions that things have to it. Hence, since there are
in things different proportions to- the divine essence, there must necessarily be many ideas. If we
consider the essence alone, however, there is but one idea for all things; but if we consider the
different proportions of creatures to the divine essence, then there can be said to be a plurality
of ideas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1. Personal properties introduce a distinction of persons in God because they are opposed to each
other by relative opposition. But properties that are not opposed, such as common spiration and
paternity, do not distinguish one person from another. Moreover, neither the ideas nor other
essential attributes are opposed by relative opposition. Hence, there is no similarity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">2. The same thing is not true of ideas and essential attributes. In their principal meaning, the
essential attributes do not signify anything more than the essence of the Creator. Hence, strictly
speaking, they are not plural, although God is compared to creatures with reference to them. For
example, with reference to His goodness, we say that creatures are good; with reference to His
wisdom, we say that they are wise. An idea, however, in its principal meaning signifies
something other than God&#8217;s essence, namely, the proportion a creature has to His essence; and
this completes the formal notion of an idea. Because of this there are said to be many ideas.
Nevertheless, the ideas may be called essential attributes inasmuch as they are related to the
essence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">3. A plurality of concepts is sometimes reduced to a diversity in the thing. For example, there is
a rational distinction between Socrates and Socrates sitting, and this is reduced to the difference
that there is between substance and accident. Similarly, man and animal differ rationally; and this
difference is reduced to the difference between form and matter, because genus is taken from
matter but the specific difference from form. Consequently, such a conceptual difference is
repugnant to the highest unity or simplicity. On the other hand, a conceptual difference
sometimes is reduced not to any diversity in the thing, but to its truth, which can be understood
in different ways. It is in this sense that we say that there is a plurality of intelligible characters
in God. Hence, this plurality is not repugnant to His highest unity or simplicity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">4. In this passage, the Philosopher speaks of intelligible characters as definitions. But we cannot
talk of there being many intelligible characters in God as though these were definitions, for none
of these comprehends the divine essence. Hence, this passage is not to the point.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">5. The form in the intellect has a double relationship. It is related not only to the thing whose
form it is, but also to the intellect in which it exists. On the basis of its first relation, the form is
not said to be <i>of a certain kind </i>but rather <i>of a certain thing, </i>for the intellectual form of material
things is not a material form, nor is the intellectual form of sensible things sensible. It is on the
basis of its second relationship that the intellectual form is said to be &#8220;of a certain kind,&#8221; because
its kind is determined by that in which it exists. Hence, from the fact that some of the things of
which ideas are had imitate the divine essence more perfectly than others, it does not follow that
the ideas are unequal, but that they are ideas of unequal things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">6. The one first form to which all things are reduced is the divine essence, considered in itself.
Reflecting upon this essence, the divine intellect devises&#8212;if I may use such an
expression&#8212;different ways in which it can be imitated. The plurality of ideas comes from these
different ways.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">7. The ideas are multiplied according to the different relations they have to things existing in their
own natures. It is not necessary that these relations be temporal even if the things are temporal,
because the action of the intellect&#8212;even of the human intellect&#8212;can extend to something even
when it does not exist, as, for example, when we know the past. Moreover, as is said in the
<i>Metaphysics</i>,<i> </i>a relation follows upon action; hence, even relations to temporal things are eternal
in the divine intellect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">8. The relation existing between God and creature is not a real relation in God. However, it is in
God according to our manner of understanding Him; similarly, it can be in Him according to His
own manner of understanding Himself, that is, in so far as He understands the relation things
have to His essence. Thus, these relations exist in God as known by Him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">9. An idea does not have the character of <i>that by which </i>a thing is first understood, but, rather, of
<i>that which is </i>understood and is existing in the intellect. Moreover, whether or not there is to be
but one form in the understanding is determined by the unity of <i>that by which </i>a thing is first
understood, just as the unity of an action is determined by the unity of the form of the agent
which is its principle. Hence, although the relations understood by God are many (and it is in
these relations that the plurality of ideas consists), nevertheless, because e understands all things
by means of His essence, His understanding is not multiple but one.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">Difficulties</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">It seems that they belong only to practical knowledge, for</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1. According to Augustine: &#8220;Ideas are the principal forms of things, according to which
everything is formed that has a beginning or an end.&#8221; But, since nothing is formed by reason of
speculative knowledge, ideas do not belong to this type of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">2. It was said, however, that ideas are related not only to those things which have a beginning or
an end, but also to those which <i>can </i>have a beginning or end, as Augustine says in the same
passage. Consequently, ideas are related to those things which do not exist, will not exist, and
never have existed, but nevertheless can exist. Of these, God has speculative knowledge.&#8212;On
the contrary, practical knowledge is said to be that knowledge according to which one knows
how a thing is done, even if he never intends to do it. This is why part of medical study is called
practical. Now, God knows how the things which He can make are to be made, even though He
does not intend to make them. Therefore, God has practical knowledge of them. Hence, in both
ways, ideas pertain to practical knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">3. An idea is nothing but the exemplary form. Now, one can speak of the exemplary form only
in connection with practical knowledge, because an exemplar is that upon which a thing else is
modeled. Therefore, ideas pertain only to practical knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">4. According to the Philosopher, the practical intellect pertains to those things whose principles
are within us. But the ideas existing in the divine intellect are principles of the things that are
modeled on the ideas. Therefore, they belong to the practical intellect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">5. All the forms in the intellect either are from things or have a relation to things. The latter type
of forms belongs to the practical intellect; the former, to the speculative. But no forms in the
divine intellect are from things, since it receives nothing from things. Therefore, the forms in the
divine intellect have a relation to things, and thus belong to the practical intellect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">6. If in God an idea of the practical intellect were other than an idea of the speculative intellect,
this diversity could not be based on something absolute in Him; for everything of this kind in
God is one and one only; nor could it be based on a relation of identity such as exists when a
thing is said to be identical with itself, because such a relation involves no plurality. Finally, it
could not be based on a relation of diversity, since a cause is not multiplied even when its effects
are multiple. Therefore, there is no possible way of distinguishing an idea of speculative
knowledge from an idea of practical knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">7. But it was said that these ideas are distinguished because a practical idea is a principle of
being, while a speculative idea is a principle of knowing.&#8212;On the contrary, principles of being
and of knowing are the same. Therefore, a speculative idea cannot be distinguished from a
practical idea on the basis suggested.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">8. God&#8217;s speculative knowledge seems to be the same as His simple knowledge. God&#8217;s simple
knowledge, however, is nothing other than bare knowledge. Now, since an idea adds a relation
to things, it seems that an idea does not belong to His speculative knowledge but only to His
practical knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">9. The end of the practical intellect is the good. Now, the reference of an idea can be determined
only to a good; for, if evil occurs, that is outside of God&#8217;s intention. Consequently, an idea
pertains only to the practical intellect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1. Practical knowledge extends only to those things which are to be made. But by His ideas God
knows not only what things are to be made, but also those things that are made and have been
made. Therefore, ideas are not restricted merely to practical knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">2. God knows creatures more perfectly than an artist knows the products of his craftsmanship.
But by means of the forms through which he acts, an artist, who is merely a creature, has
speculative knowledge of his handicraft. How much more must this be true of God!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">3. Speculative knowledge is that which considers the principles and causes of things, as well as
their properties. But by ideas God knows all that can be known of things. Therefore, the divine
ideas pertain not only to practical, but also to speculative knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">As is said in <i>The Soul</i>: &#8220;Practical knowledge differs from speculative knowledge in its end.&#8221; For
the end of speculative knowledge is simply truth, but the end of practical knowledge, as we read
in the <i>Metaphysics</i>, is action. Now, some knowledge is called practical because it is directed to
a work. This happens in two ways. In the first way, it is directed in act&#8212;that is, when it is
actually directed to a certain work, as the form is which an artist preconceives and intends to
introduce into matter. This is called actual practical knowledge and is the form by which
knowledge takes place. At other times, however, there is a type of knowledge that is capable of
being ordered to an act, but this ordering is not actual. For example, an artist thinks out a form
for his work, knows how it can be made, yet does not intend to make it. This is practical
knowledge, not actual, but habitual or virtual. At still other times, knowledge is utterly incapable
of being ordered to execution. Such knowledge is purely speculative. This also happens in two
ways. First, the knowledge is about those things whose natures are such that they cannot be
produced by the knowledge of the knower, as is true for example, when we think about natural
things. Second, it may happen that the thing known is something that is producible through
knowledge but is not considered as producible; for a thing is given existence through a
productive operation, and there are certain realities that can be separated in understanding
although they cannot exist separately. Therefore, when we consider a thing which is capable of
production through the intellect and distinguish from each other realities that cannot exist
separately, this knowledge is not practical knowledge, either actual or habitual, but only
speculative. This is the kind of knowledge a craftsman has when he thinks about a house by
reflecting only on its genus, differences, properties, and other things of this sort which have no
separate existence in the thing itseif. But a thing is considered as something capable of execution
when there are considered in its regard all the things that are simultaneously required for its
existence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">God&#8217;s knowledge is related to things in these four ways. Since His knowledge causes things, He
knows some things by ordaining by a decree of His will that they come into existence at a certain
time. Of these things He has actual practical knowledge. Moreover, He knows other things which
He never intends to make, for He knows those things which do not exist, have not existed, and
never will exist, as we said in the preceding question. Of these things He has actual knowledge,
not actually practical knowledge, however, but merely virtually practical. Again, since He knows
the things which He makes or is able to make, not only as they exist in their own act of existence,
but also according to all the notes which the human intellect can find in them by analysis, He
knows things that He can make even under an aspect in which they are incapable of execution.
Finally, He knows certain things of which His knowledge cannot be the cause&#8212;evils, for
example. Therefore, it is very true to say that there is both practical and speculative knowledge
in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Now we must see which of the preceding ways is proper to the ideas which must be attributed
to God&#8217;s knowledge. As Augustine says if we consider the proper meaning of the word itself, an
idea is <i>a form; </i>but if we consider what the thing itself is, then an idea is <i>an intelligible character
</i>or likeness of a thing. We find, moreover, in certain forms, a double relation: one relation to that
which is informed by these forms, and this is the kind of relation that knowledge has to the
knower; another to that which is outside, and this is the kind of a relation that knowledge has to
what is known. This latter relationship, however, is not common to all forms, as the first is.
Therefore, the word form implies only the first relation. This is why a form always has the nature
of a cause, for a form is, in a sense, the cause of that which it informs&#8212;whether this informing
takes place by inherence, as it does in the case of intrinsic forms, or by imitation, as it does in the
case of exemplary forms. But an intelligible character and a likeness also have the second
relationship, which does not give them the nature of a cause. If we speak, therefore, of an idea,
considering only the notion that is properly conveyed by that word, then an idea includes only
that kind of knowledge according to which a thing can be made. This is knowledge that is
actually practical, or merely virtually practical, which, in some way, is speculative. On the other
hand, if we call an idea an intelligible character or likeness in a wide sense, then an idea can also
pertain to purely speculative knowledge. Or, if we wish to speak more formally, we should say
that an idea belongs to knowledge that is practical, either actually or virtually; but an intelligible
character or likeness belongs to both practical and speculative knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1. Augustine is referring the formative action of ideas not only to those things which are made
but also to those which can be made. For, even if these latter never exist, they are, in a certain
sense, known, speculatively, as is clear from what has been said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">2. This argument refers only to knowledge which is practical virtually, not actually. Nothing
prevents us from calling this speculative in some sense in so far as it falls short of actual
execution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">3. Although an exemplar implies a relation to something outside, it is related as a cause to that
extrinsic thing. Therefore, properly speaking, it belongs to knowledge that is practical, either
habitually or virtually. But an exemplar is not necessarily restricted to that which is actually
practical, because a thing can be called an exemplar merely if something else can be made in
imitation of it&#8212;even though this other thing is never made. The same is true of ideas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">4. The practical intellect pertains to those things whose principles are within us not in any manner
whatsoever, but as being capable of being executed by us, Hence, as is evident from what we
have said, we can also have speculative knowledge of those things whose causes are within us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">5. The speculative intellect is not differentiated from the practical because one has its forms from
things, and the other, forms related to things, because our practical intellect, at times, also
receives its forms from things, as happens, for example, when an artist, having seen some work
of art, conceives a form according to which he intends to make something. Therefore, it is not
necessary, either, that all the forms which pertain to the speculative intellect be received from
things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">6. God&#8217;s practical and speculative ideas should not be distinguished as though they were two
kinds of ideas. They are distinguished because, according to our way of understanding, to the
speculative idea the practical adds a relation to an operation. It is just as we say that <i>man </i>adds
rational to <i>animal, </i>even though man and animal are not two things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">7. Principles of being and principles of knowing are said to be the same, because whatever is a
principle of being is also a principle of knowing. The opposite, however, is not true, since effects
are not infrequently principles of knowing causes. Consequently, there is no reason why the
forms of the speculative intellect should not be merely principles of knowing, while the forms
of the practical intellect are principles both of knowing and of being.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">8. We speak of God&#8217;s simple knowledge, not to exclude the relation which His knowledge has
to what He knows, for such a relation is inseparably joined to all knowledge, but to exclude from
it things that are outside the genus of knowledge. Such things are the existence of things (which
is added by His knowledge of vision) and the relation of His will to the things that He knows and
will produce (which is added by His knowledge of approval). It is just as we call fire a simple
body, not to deny that it has essential parts, but rather to exclude foreign elements from its
definition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">9. The true and the good include each other, since the true is a good and every good is true.
Therefore, the good can be considered speculatively when only its truth is considered. For
example, we can define the good and show what its nature is. But the good can also be
considered practically if it is considered as a good, that is, as an end of a motion or operation.
Consequently, it clearly does not follow that the ideas or likenesses or intelligible characters in
the divine intellect belong only to practical knowledge simply because they have a relation
terminating in a good.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Contrary Difficulties</span><i></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1. Time has no ebb or flow in God, because His eternity, which is entirely simultaneous, includes
all time. Hence, He knows the past, present, and future in the same way. This is precisely what
Sirach (2 3:2 9) says: &#8220;For all things were known to the Lord God, before they were created: so
also after they were perfected he beholdeth all things.&#8221; Hence, it is not necessary that an idea
properly so called should exceed the limits of practical knowledge merely because the past is
known by means of it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">2. If the knowledge of his handicraft which an artist, who is a creature, has by means of forms
referred to action is a knowledge of his work as it can be produced, although he does not intend
to produce it, then that knowledge is not speculative in all respects but is habitually practical. But
that knowledge by which the artist knows, works, not, however, as he can produce them, is purely
speculative. It does not contain ideas corresponding to the work, although it might possibly
contain likenesses or intelligible characters of it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">3. Both speculative and practical knowledge are had by means of principles and causes.
Consequently, this argument cannot prove that a science is speculative or that it is practical.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[Parallel readings: <i>De ver.</i>, 2, 15; <i>S.T.</i>, I, 14, 10; 15, 3, ad 1; <i>I Sent., </i>36, 1, 2; <i>C.G.</i>, I, 7 1; Quodl.,

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">Difficulties</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">It seems that there is, for</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1. God knows evil things in His science of simple knowledge. But the ideas belong to His science
of simple knowledge in some way if <i>idea</i> is taken in its broader meaning of a likeness or
intelligible character. Therefore, there is an idea of evil in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">2. There is no reason why evil cannot be in a good not opposed to it. Now, the likeness of evil
is not opposed to the good, just as the likeness of black is not opposed to white, because the
species of contraries in the soul are not contrary. Therefore, there is no reason why there cannot
be an idea or likeness of evil in God, even though He is the highest good.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">3. Wherever there is any community, there is likeness. Now, from the fact that a thing is a
privation of being, being can be predicated of it; hence it is said in the <i>Metaphysics </i>that negations
and privations are called beings. Therefore, from the fact that evil is the privation of good, some
likeness of it exists in God, who is the highest good.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">4. Whatever is known in itself has its idea in God. But the false, like the true, is known in itself;
for, just as first principles are known in themselves in their truth, so also are the opposites of
these principles known in themselves in their falsity. Hence, the false has its idea in God. Now,
the false is a kind of evil, just as the true is the good of the intellect, as we read in the <i>Ethics.
</i>Therefore, evil has an idea in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">5. Whatever has a nature has an idea in God. Now, since vice is the contrary of virtue, it has a
nature which belongs to the genus of quality. Therefore, it has an idea in God. But because it is
vice, it is evil. Therefore, evil has an idea in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">6. If evil has no idea, the only reason for this is that evil is non-being. But the forms by which one
knows can have non-beings as their objects. There is nothing to prevent us, for example, from
imagining golden mountains or chimeras. Therefore, there is no reason why evil cannot have an
idea in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">7. If a thing has no mark upon it and exists among other things that are marked, the very lack of
a mark becomes its mark, as is clear in sheep which are marked. Now, an idea is, in a way, a sign
of that of which it is an idea. Therefore, since all good things have an idea in God, and evil does
not, evil itself should be said to be modeled upon or formed in the likeness of an idea.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">8. Whatever comes from God has its idea in Him. But evil, that is, the evil of punishment, comes
from God. Therefore, it has an idea in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1. All effects of an idea have an act of existence determined by that idea. But evil does not have
a determined act of existence, since it does not have any existence, and is, instead, a privation
of being. Therefore, evil does not have an idea in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">21. According to Dionysius,3 the divine exemplar or idea is a pre-definition of the divine will.
But the divine will is related only to what is good. Therefore, evil has no exemplar in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">3. &#8220;Evil,&#8221; according to Augustine, &#8220;is the privation of form, measure, and order.&#8221; Now, Plato says
that ideas themselves are beautiful. Consequently, evil can have no idea.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">As pointed out previously, an idea, according to its proper nature, implies a form that is the
principle of informing a thing. Consequently, since there is nothing in God that can be a principle
of evil, evil cannot have an idea in God if <i>idea </i>is taken in its proper sense. This is likewise true
if it is taken in its broad sense as meaning a likeness or intelligible character, because, as
Augustine says, evil gets its name from the fact that it lacks form. Hence, since a likeness is
considered as a form that is in some way shared by others, evil can have no likeness in God,
because a thing is called evil for the very reason that it falls short of any participation in divinity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1. God&#8217;s science of simple knowledge has as its object, not only evil, but also certain good things
that do not exist, will not exist, and never did exist. It is with respect to these non-existing things
that there is an idea in God&#8217;s simple knowledge, but there is no idea in it of evil things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">2.We deny that evil has an exemplar in God, not just because of its opposition, but because evil
has no nature through which it could in some way participate in something that is in God and
which could, therefore, be called a likeness of it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">3. That community by which something is predicated both of being and of non-being is a
community merely of reason, because negations and privations are merely beings of reason. Such
a community is not enough for the likeness of which we are now speaking.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">4. That this principle, &#8220;No whole is greater than its part,&#8221; is false is a truth. Therefore, to know
that it is false is to know something true. However, the falsity of this principle is known only by
its privation of truth, just as blindness is known by its being a privation of sight.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">5. Just as evil actions are good in so far as they have existence and come from God, so also in
this sense are the habits good which are the principles or effects of these actions. Therefore, the
fact that they are bad does not posit any nature but only a privation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">6. A thing is called a non-being for two reasons. First, because nonexistence is included in its
definition; and this is why blindness is called a non-being. It is impossible to conceive, either in
our imagination or in our intellect, any form for such non-beings; and evil is a non-being of this
type. Second, because the non-being is not found in the realm of nature, even though the
privation of existence is not included in its definition. Here, however, there is no reason why we
cannot imagine such non-beings and conceive their forms.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">7. Because evil has no idea in God, God knows it by means of the idea of the good opposed to
it. In this way, evil is related to His knowledge as though it had an idea-not that the privation of
an idea stands in the place of an idea, however, because there can be no privation in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">8. The evil of punishment proceeds from God as part of His order of justice. Hence, it is good
and has an idea in Him.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1. According to Augustine: &#8220;An idea is a form.&#8221;&#8217; But matter has no form. Therefore, in God there
is no idea corresponding to matter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">2. Matter is merely a being in potency. Now, if an idea has to correspond to its effect, if matter
has an idea, the idea of matter will be merely in potency. There is, however, no potentiality in
God. Therefore, first matter has no idea in Him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">3. As they exist in God, the ideas are of those things which are or can be. But first matter does
not exist separately, that is, by itself, nor can it so exist. Therefore, it has no idea in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">4. An idea is that according to which a thing is informed. But first matter can never be informed
so that a form would belong to its essence. Therefore, if it did have an idea, that idea would be
useless in God. This, however, is absurd.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1. Whatever derives its act of existence from God has an idea in God. Matter belongs to this class
of beings. Therefore, it has an idea in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">2. Every essence is derived from the divine essence. Therefore whatever has an essence has an
exemplar in God. Matter belongs to this class of beings. Therefore.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Plato, who was the first to speak about ideas, did not posit any idea for first matter, because he
asserted that the ideas were the causes of the things modeled upon them, and first matter is not
caused by an idea but, instead, is its co-cause. For he said that there are two principles to be
found in matter, &#8220;the great&#8221; and &#8220;the small,&#8221; but only on principle to be found in form, namely,
the idea. We, however, assert that matter is caused by God. Hence, it is necessary to affirm that
it exemplar in some way exists in God, since He possesses a likeness o whatever He causes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">On the other hand, if we take <i>idea </i>in its strict sense, we cannot say that first matter of itself has
an idea in God that is distinct from th idea of the form or of the composite. For an idea, properly
speaking is related to a thing in so far as it can be brought into existence; an matter cannot come
into existence without a form, nor can a form come into existence without matter. Hence,
properly speaking, there is no idea corresponding merely to matter or merely to form; but one
idea corresponds to the entire composite&#8212;an idea that causes th whole, both its form and its
matter. On the other hand, if we take <i>idea </i>in its broader sense as meaning an intelligible character
or like ness, then both matter and form of themselves can be said to have an idea by which they
can be known distinctly, even though they cannot exist separately. In this sense, there is no
reason why there cannot be an idea of first matter, even taken in itself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span><i></i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1. Although first matter has no form, there is in it an imitation of the first form; for, even though
its act of existence may be very feeble, it is an imitation of the first being. For this reason, its
likeness can be in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">2. The idea and its copy need not be similar according to a conformity in nature. It is enough that
one represent the other. For this reason, the idea of even composite things is simple, and,
similarly, the idea of a potential being is actual.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">3, Even though matter cannot exist by itself, it can be considered in itself. Thus, it can, in itself,
have a likeness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">4. That argument refers to the idea inasmuch as it is actually or virtually practical, and is related
to a thing in so far as it can be brought into being. First matter does not have an idea of this kind.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1. Nothing has an idea in God unless it has a determined act of existence. But that which does
not exist, never has existed, and never will exist has no determinate act of existence at all.
Therefore, neither does it have an idea in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">2. But it was said that, even though it does not have a determinate act of existence in itself, it has,
nevertheless, such a determinate act in God.&#8212;On the contrary, a thing is determinate in so far
as it is distinguished from another. But all things as they exist in God are one and are not distinct
from each other. Therefore, even in God it does not have a determinate act of existence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">3. According to Dionysius, exemplars are those good acts of the divine will which cause and
predetermine things. But the things which are not, have not been, nor will be were never
predetermined by the divine will. Therefore, they do not have an idea or exemplar in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">4. An idea is ordained to the production of a thing. If there is, therefore, an idea of something
which will never be given existence, it seems that such an idea is useless. But this would be
absurd. Therefore.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1. God knows things by means of ideas. But as we said above.  He knows those things which are
not, have not been, nor will be. Therefore, there is an idea in God of all that does not exist, has
not existed and never will exist.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">2. A cause does not depend on its effect. Now, an idea is a cause o the existence of things.
Therefore, it does not depend in any way on their existence. Consequently, there can be ideas of
those things which do not exist, have not existed, and never will exist.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Properly speaking, an idea belongs to practical knowledge that is not only actually but also
habitually practical. Therefore, since God has virtually practical knowledge of those things which
He could make, even though He never makes them or never will make them, there must be ideas
of those things which are not, have not been, nor will be. But these ideas will not be the same as
those of the things which are, have been, or will be, because the divine will determines to pro
duce the things that are, have been, and will be, but not to produce those which neither are, have
been, nor will be. The latter, therefore have, in a certain sense, indeterminate ideas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1. Even though that which never existed, does not exist, and will no exist lacks a determined act

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">2. It is One thing to be in God, another to be in His knowledge. Evil is not in God; it is, however,
contained in His knowledge. Now, a,, thing is said to be in God&#8217;s knowledge if God knows it;
and because God knows all things distinctly, as we said in the previous question, things are
distinct in His knowledge even though in Him they are one,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">3. Even though God may never will to bring into existence things of this class, whose ideas He
possesses, He wills that He be able to produce them and that He possess the knowledge necessary
for producing them. Consequently, Dionysius is saying that the nature of an exemplar demands,
not a will that is predefining and effecting, but merely a will that can define and effect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">4. Those ideas are not directed by God&#8217;s knowledge to the production of something in their

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">Are there in God ideas of accidents?</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">Difficulties</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">It seems not, for</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1. An idea is for knowing and causing things. But an accident is known by means of its
substance, and is caused by the principles of the substance. Hence, it need not have an idea in
God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">2. But it was stated that the existence, not the essence, of an accident is known by means of its
subject.&#8212;On the contrary, the definition of a thing signifies what it is, especially by giving its
genus. But, in the definitions of accidents, as is said in the <i>Metaphysics</i>, are placed substance and
the subject, in the sense in which subject is used instead of the genus, as the Commentator notes.
For example, we say: &#8220;Snub means a curved nose.&#8221; Consequently, we know the essence of an
accident by knowing the substance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">3. Whatever has an idea participates in it. But accidents do not participate in anything, because
participation is proper only to substances since they alone can receive something. Accidents,
therefore, do not have ideas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">4. In regard to those things that are predicated as prior and subsequent, in Plato&#8217;s opinion an idea
should not be taken as common, e.g., as applied to numbers and geometrical figures. This is clear
from the <i>Metaphysics </i>and <i>Ethics. </i>The reason for this is that the first is, as it were, the exemplar
of the second. Now, being is predicated of substance and accident as prior and subsequent.
Therefore, an accident does not have an idea, but has substance in the place of an idea.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1. Whatever is caused by God has its idea in God. Now, God causes not only substances but
accidents as well. Therefore, accidents have ;in idea in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">2. Every inferior of a genus should be reduced to the first of that gentis, just as everything that
is hot is reduced to the heat of fire. Now, as Augustine says: &#8220;Ideas are principal forms.&#8221;
Consequently, since accidents are forms, it seems that they have ideas in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">As the Philosopher says, Plato, who first introduced the notion of ideas, posited ideas, not for
accidents, but only for substances. The reason for this was that Plato thought that the ideas were
the proximate causes of things. Hence, when he found a proximate cause other than an idea for
a thing, he held that the thing did not have an idea. This also is the reason why he said that there
is no common idea for those things that are predicated as being prior and subsequent, but that the
first is the idea of the second. Dionysius also mentions this opinion, attributing it to a certain
Clement the Philosopher, who said that superior beings were the exemplars for inferior. Using
this argument, namely, that accidents are caused directly by substances, Plato did not posit ideas
of accidents.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">On the other hand, since we affirm that God is the direct cause of each and every thing because
He works in all secondary causes and since all secondary effects are results of His pre-definition,
we posit ideas in Him not only of first beings but also of second beings, and, consequently, both
of substances and of accidents, but of different accidents in different ways.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">First, there are proper accidents, which are caused by the principles of their subjects and never
have existence apart from their subjects. These accidents are brought into existence together with
their subject by one operation. Consequently, since an idea, properly speaking, is a form of
something that can be made, considered precisely under this aspect, there will not be distinct
ideas of such accidents. There will be only one idea, that of the subject with all its
accidents&#8212;just as an architect has one form of a house and of all the accidents that pertain to a
house as such, and by means of this one form brings into being the house and all its accidents,
such as its square shape and the like.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">There are other accidents, however, that are not inseparable from their subject and do not depend
on its principles. These are brought into existence by an operation other than that by which the
subject is produced. For example, it does not follow from the fact that a man is made a man that
he is a grammarian; this is the result of another operation. Now, the ideas in God of such
accidents are distinct from the idea of the subject, just as the form of a picture of a house, which
an artist conceives, is distinct from the form he conceives of the house itself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">If we take <i>idea </i>in its broader sense, however, as meaning a likeness, then we can say that both
types of accidents have distinct ideas in God, because He can know each one in itself distinctly.
This is why the Philosopher says that, with respect to their manner of being known, accidents
should, like substances, have ideas; but with respect to the other reasons why Plato posited
exemplars, namely, to be the causes of generation and of being, it seems that only substances
have ideas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1. As we said above, there is in God an idea not only of first effects but also of second effects.
Hence, even though accidents have their act of existence by means of substances, this does not
prevent their having ideas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">2. An accident can bg taken in two ways. First, it can be taken in the abstract. In this way, it is
considered according to its proper nature, a genus and species are given it, and its subject is not
placed in its definition as a genus but rather as a specific difference. In this sense we say:
&#8220;Snubness is a curvature of the nose.&#8221; On the other hand, an accident can be taken in the
concrete. In this way, it is considered according as it has an accidental unity with its subject.
Hence, neither a genus nor a species is assigned to it. Here it is true that the subject is put in the
place of the genus in the definition of an accident.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">3. Although an accident is not that which participates, it is, however, a participation. Hence, it
is clear that in God there is an idea or likeness corresponding to it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">4. The response to this difficulty is clear from what has been said.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">It seems not, for</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1. Singulars are potentially infinite in number. Now, in God there is an idea, not merely of what
exists, but also of what can exist. If, therefore, there were ideas of singulars in God, there would
be an infinite number of ideas in Him. This seems absurd, since they could not be actually
infinite.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">2. If singulars have ideas in God, either there is one idea for the individual and the species, or
there are distinct ideas for them. If there were distinct ideas, then there would be many ideas in
God for one thing, because the idea of the species is also that of the individual. On the other
hand, if there is but one and the same idea for the individual and the species, then, since all the
individuals of the same species have the same idea, there would be only one idea for all, and,
consequently, singulars would not have distinct ideas in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">3. Many singulars happen by chance. Now, such beings are not predefined. Since, as is evident
from what has been said previously, namely, that an idea postulates pre-definition, it seems that
not all singulars have an idea in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">4. Certain singulars are combinations of two species. For example, a mule is a combination of
a horse and an ass. Now, if such things had ideas in God, it would seem that there would be two
ideas for each one. This seems absurd, since it is unreasonable to affirm multiplicity in the cause
and unity in the effect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1. Ideas are in God for the purpose of knowing and making. But God is one who knows and
makes singulars. Therefore, there are in God ideas of singulars.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">2. Ideas are directed to the existence of things. But singulars have acts of existence more truly
than universals do, because the latter subsist only in singulars. Therefore, it is more necessary for
singulars to have exemplars than it is for universals.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Plato did not posit ideas of singulars but only of species. There were two reasons for this. First,
according to him, ideas did not cause the matter but only the forms of things here below. Now,
the principle of individuation is matter, and it is because of the form that each singular is placed
under a species. Consequently, his ideas did not correspond to a singular in so far as it is singular
but only by reason of its species. His second reason may have been this: An idea is related only
to those things that are intended directly, as is clear from what was said. But the intention of
nature is principally to preserve the species. Consequently, even though generation terminates
in this or in that man, the intention of nature is simply to generate man. For this reason, the
Philosopher also says that final causes should be assigned for the accidents common to a species,
but not for the accidents found in singulars. For the latter, only efficient and material causes can
be assigned; consequently, an idea does not correspond to a singular but to a species. Using the
same argument, moreover, Plato did not posit-&#8216; ideas for genera, alleging that nature does not
intend to produce the form of a genus but only that of a species. We, however, assert that God
is the cause of singulars, both of their form and of their matter. We also assert that all individual
things are determined by His divine providence. Hence, we must also posit ideas for all singulars.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">1. Ideas are multiplied only in so far as they have different relations to things. As Avicenna says,
however, it is not contradictory to multiply conceptual relations infinitely.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">2. If we speak of idea in the proper sense, namely, inasmuch as it is the idea of a thing in so far
as that thing is capable of being produced, then there is but one idea for the singular, the species,
the genus, and for whatever is individuated in that singular, because Socrates the man and
Socrates the animal do not have separate acts of existence. If, however, we are speaking of idea
in its broader sense of a likeness or intelligible character, then, since the considerations of
Socrates as Socrates, as a man, and as an animal all differ, a number of ideas or likenesses will
correspond to him in this respect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">3. Although some things may happen by chance with respect to their proximate agent, nothing
happens by chance with respect to the agent who knows all things beforehand.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">4. The mule has a separate species, halfway between that of a horse and that of an ass. Therefore,
the mule is not in two species but in one. This fact is due to the mixture of seeds, because the
generative powers of the male cannot bring the material provided by the female to the perfection
of his own species, since the material is outside his own species; so, instead, the male brings it
to a term that is close to his species. For this reason, a separate idea is assigned to the mule and
to the horse.</p>
