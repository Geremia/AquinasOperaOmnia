      the order of the election of Levi, declaring that John the son of
      Zachariah was sent forth by the voice of an angel, and saying, �The

      Now from both we must understand one Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, and of
      man. And fitly the first Evangelist names Him �Son of man,� the second,
      �Son of [p. 6] God,� that from less things our sense may by degrees mount
      up to greater, and by faith and the sacraments of the human nature

      Fitly also did He, who was about to describe His human generation, begin
      with a son of man, namely, David or Abraham. Fitly again, he who was
      beginning his book with the first preaching of the Gospel, chose rather to
      call Jesus Christ, �the Son of God;� for it belonged to the human nature
      to take upon Him the reality of our flesh, of the race of the patriarchs,
      and it was the work of Divine power to preach the Gospel to the world.

      testimonies of the Prophets, that he might notify to all, that what he
      should write was to be received without scruple of doubt, in that he
      shewed that these things were beforehand foretold by the Prophets. At
      once, by one and the same beginning of his Gospel, he prepared the Jews,
      who had received the Law and the Prophets, for receiving the grace of the
      Gospel, and those sacraments, which their own prophecies had foretold; and
      he also calls upon the Gentiles, who came to the Lord by publishing of the
      Gospel, to receive and venerate the authority of the Law and the Prophets;
      whence he says, �As it is written in the prophet Isaiah, Behold, &amp;c.�

      one, two prophecies delivered in different places by two prophets; for in
      the prophet Isaiah it is written after the story of Hezekiah, �The voice

      The Evangelist therefore, taking parts of two prophecies, has put them

      Lastly, after the words of Malachi, he immediately subjoins, �The voice of

      prophet, belonging as they do to one meaning, under the person of the
      elder prophet.

      >: Or otherwise, we must understand, that although these words are not
      found in Isaiah, still the sense of them is found in many other places,
      and most clearly in this which he has subjoined, �The voice of one crying
      in the wilderness.� For that which Malachi has called, the angel to be
      sent before the face of the Lord, to prepare His way, is the same thing as
      Isaiah has said is to be heard, �the voice of one crying in the
      wilderness, saying, Prepare ye the way of the Lord.�

      But in each sentence alike, the way of the Lord to be prepared is
      proclaimed. It may be, too, that Isaiah occurred to the mind of Mark, in
      writing his Gospel, instead of Malachi, as often happens; which he would,
      however, without doubt correct, at least when reminded by other persons,
      who might read his work whilst he was yet in the flesh; unless he though
      that, since his memory was then ruled by the Holy Spirit, it was not
      without a purpose that the name of one prophet had occurred to him instead
      of another. For thus whatsoever things the Holy Spirit spoke by the
      prophets are implied each to have belonged to all, and all to each.

      Baptist was an angel, quoting this text. (in Joan, ii, 25.) v Huet, Orig.
      II, qu. 5, No. 14, 24, 25], but by the dignity [p. 8] of his office; for
      angel in Greek is in Latin, nuntius (note: messenger), by which name that
      man is rightly called, who was sent by God, that he might bear witness of
      the light, and announce to the world the Lord, coming in the flesh; since
      it is evident that all who are priests may be their office of preaching
      the Gospel be called angels, as the prophet Malachi says, �The lips of the
      priest keep knowledge, and they seek the law at his mouth, because he is
      the Angel of the Lord of hosts.� [Mal 2:7]

      the sweetness of the barren Gentiles, he ate wild honey. In that He in His
      own person partly converted the Jews, He received locusts for His food,

      up when they promised to fulfil the precepts of the Lord; but they fell to

      walk. For he used a dress more austere than was usual, because he did not
      encourage the life of sinners by flattery, but chid them by the vigour of
      his rough rebuke; he had a girdle of skin round his loins, for he was one,
      �who crucified his flesh with the affections and lusts.� [Gal 5:24] He
      used to eat locusts and wild honey, because his preaching had some
      sweetness for the multitude, whilst the people debated whether he was the
      Christ himself or not; but this soon came to an end, when his hearers
      understood that he was not the Christ, but the forerunner and prophet of

      others, sons of Zebedee,) when Luke says that James and John were called
      to help Peter and Andrew, and that it was to Peter only that Christ said,
      �Fear not, from this time thou shalt catch men;� [Luke 5:!0] he also says,

      We must therefore understand that the transaction which Luke intimates
      happened first, and afterwards that they, as their custom was, had
      returned to their fishing. So that what Mark here relates happened
      afterwards; for in this case they followed the Lord, without drawing their
      boats ashore, (which they would have done had they meant to return,) and
      followed Him, as one calling them, and ordering them to follow.

      conveyed that Jesus is not manifested to those who are enslaved to the
      love of praise in the broad highway, and to their own wills, but to those

      for refreshing His people; that is, those who quit the pleasures of the

      For in another place, the Jews said of the Lord, that He had a devil [John

      explains his meaning by going on to say, that as the Devil was proved by
      the words of the Jews to be the author of division, so the Holy Ghost was
      the author of unity, so that one form of blasphemy of the Holy Ghost was
      rending the unity of the Church, without which there is no remission. St.

      road, or thorny ground, cannot become fertile. But in spiritual things it
      is not so; for there it is possible that stony ground may become fertile;
      and that the road should not be trodden down, and that the thorns may be
      destroyed, for if this could not take place, he would not have sown there.
      By this, therefore, He gives to us hope of repentance.

      Matthew indeed relates that the chief of the synagogue reported that his
      daughter was dead, but Mark says that she was very sick, and that
      afterwards it was told to the ruler of the synagogue, when our Lord was
      about to go with him, that she was dead. The fact then, which Matthew
      implies, is the same, namely, that He raised her from the dead; and it is
      for the sake of brevity, that he says that she was dead, which was evident
      from her being raised.

      touched My clothes?� The virtues indeed of the Saviour do not go out of
      Him locally or corporally, nor in any respect pass away from Him. For
      being incorporeal, they go forth to others and are given to others; they
      are not however separated from Him, from whom they are said to go forth,

      it, as its faithlessness deserved, it lies dead as it were, amongst
      persons weeping and wailing. Again, our Lord raised the damsel by taking
      hold of her hand, because the hands of the Jews, which are full of blood,
      must first be cleansed, else the synagogue, which is dead, cannot rise
      again. But in the woman with the bloody flux, and the raising of the

      the Lord, that first some from Judaea, then the fulness of the Gentiles,
      might come in, and so all Israel might be saved. Again, the damsel was
      twelve years old, and the woman had suffered for twelve years, because the
      sinning of unbelievers was contemporary with the beginning of the faith of
      believers.

      immediately subjoined, �The workman is worthy of his meat,� [Matt 10:19]
      which sufficiently proves why He forbade their carrying or possessing such
      things; not because they were not necessary, but because He sent them in
      such a way as to shew, that they were due to them from the faithful, to

      From this it is evident that the Lord did not mean by this precept that
      the Evangelists ought to live only on the gifts of those to whom they
      preach the Gospel, else the Apostle transgressed this precept when he
      procured his livelihood by the labour of his own hands, but He meant that
      He had given them a power, in virtue of which, they might be assured these
      things were due to them.

      It is also often asked, how it comes that Matthew and Luke have related
      that the Lord commanded His disciples not to carry even a staff, whilst
      Mark says, �And He commanded them that they should take nothing for their
      journey, save a staff only.� Which question is solved, by supposing that
      the word �staff� has a meaning in [p. 110] Mark, who says that it ought to
      be carried, different from that which it bears in Matthew and Luke, who
      affirm the contrary. For in a concise way one might say, Take none of the
      necessaries of life with you, nay, not a staff, save a staff only; so that
      the saying, nay not a staff, may mean, nay not the smallest thing; but
      that which is added, �save a staff only,� may mean that, through the power
      received by them from the Lord, of which a rod is the ensign, nothing,
      even of those things which they do not carry, will be wanting to them.

      The Lord, therefore, said both, but because one Evangelist has not given
      both, men suppose, that he who has said that the staff, in one sense,
      should be taken, is contrary to him who again has declared, that, in
      another sense, it should be left behind: now however that a reason has
      been given, let no one think so.

      So also when Matthew declares that shoes are not to be worn on the
      journey, he forbids anxiety about them, for the reason why men are anxious
      about carrying them, is that they may not be without them. This is also to
      be understood of the two coats, that no man should be troubled about
      having only that with which he is clad from anxiety lest he should need
      another, when he could always obtain one from the power given by the Lord.

      In like manner Mark, by saying that they are to be shod with sandals or
      soles, warns us that this mode of protecting the feet has a mystical
      signification, that the foot should neither be covered above nor be naked
      on the ground, that is, that the Gospel should neither be hid, nor rest
      upon earthly comforts; and in that He forbids their possessing or taking
      with them, or more expressly their wearing, two coats, He bids them walk
      simply, not with duplicity. But whosoever thinks that the Lord could not
      in the same discourse say some things figuratively, others in a literal
      sense, let him look into His other discourses, and he shall see, how rash
      and ignorant is his judgment.

      We must, however, suppose that after this hesitation he had confirmed in
      his own mind what others had said, for he says to his children, as Matthew
      relates, �This is John the Baptist, he has risen from the dead.� [Matt
      14:2] Or else these words are to be spoken, so as to indicate that he is
      still hesitating, particularly as Mark who had said above that others had
      declared that John had risen from the dead, afterwards however is not
      silent as to Herod�s plainly saying, �It is John, whom I beheaded: he is
      risen from the dead.� Which words also may be spoken in two ways, either

      a sin even in his eating, whose food was only locusts, and wild honey? How
      could he offend in his conversation, who never quitted the wilderness? How
      is it that Almighty God so despises in this life those whom He has so
      sublimely chosen before all ages, if it be not for the reason, which is
      plain to the piety of the faithful, that He thus sinks them into the
      lowest place, because He sees how He is rewarding them in the highest, and
      outwardly He throws them down amongst things despised, because inwardly He
      draws them up even to incomprehensible things. Let each then infer from

      Twelve baskets of fragments remained over and above, that each of the
      Apostles, carrying a basket on his shoulder, might recognise the
      unspeakable wonder of the miracle. For it was a proof of overflowing power
      not only to feed so many men, but also to leave such a superabundance of
      fragments. Even though Moses gave manna, yet what was given to each was
      measured by his necessity, and what was over and above was overrun with
      worms. Elias also fed the woman, but gave her just what was enough for
      her; but Jesus, being the Lord, makes His gifts with superabundant
      profusion.

      the Phantasiasts, a sect of the Monophysites. The denial of the human body
      to our Lord, was a natural consequence of denying Him a human soul, for
      how could a human body inclose, so to speak, His Divinity? Theodoras was
      Bishop of Pharan, in Arabia, and was condemned as the author of the
      Monothelite heresy in the Lateran Council under Pope Martin I, AD 649. The
      passage from Dionysius is quoted in Actio 3 of the Council, and occurs de
      Div. Nom, c. 1] But Theodorus, who was Bishop of Phanara, wrote that the
      Lord had no bodily weight in His flesh, and walked on the sea without
      weight; but the Catholic faith declares that He had weight according to
      the flesh. For Dionysius says, We know not how without plunging in His
      feet, which had bodily weight and the gravity of matter, He could walk on
      the wet and unstable substance.

      tempest and the contrary wind were there as well, to make the miracle
      greater. For the Apostles, not understanding from the miracle of the five

      But mystically, the toil of the disciples in rowing, and the contrary
      wind, mark out the labours of the Holy Church, who amidst the beating
      waves of the world, and the blasts of unclean spirits, strives to reach
      the repose of her celestial country. And well is it said that the ship was
      in the midst of the sea, and He alone on land, for sometimes the Church is
      afflicted by a pressure from the [p. 128] Gentiles so overwhelming, that
      her Redeemer seems to have entirely deserted her. But the Lord sees His
      own, toiling on the sea, for, lest they faint in tribulations, He
      strengthens them by the look of His love, and sometimes frees them by a
      visible assistance. Further, in the fourth watch He came to them as
      daylight approached, for when man lifts up his mind to the light of
      guidance from on high, the Lord will be with him, and the dangers of
      temptations will be laid asleep.

      house when the woman came, asking about her daughter. When, however,
      Matthew says that His disciples had suggested to Him, [p. 140] �Send her
      away, for she crieth after us,� [Matt 15:23] He appears to imply nothing
      less than that the woman uttered supplicating cries after the Lord, as He

      gathering it from Mark, who says that she came in to Jesus, after having
      before said that He was in the house? But Matthew in that he says, �He

      that Christ sends no one away fasting, for He wishes all to be nourished

      he has saved his soul, who has shunned the perils [p. 162] of the cross;
      for when a man, at the cost of his soul, that is, his life, gains the
      whole world, what has he besides, now that his soul is perishing? Has he
      another soul to give for his soul? For a man can give the price of his
      house in exchange for the house; but in losing his soul, he has not
      another soul to give. And it is with a purpose that He says, �Or what
      shall a man give in exchange for his soul?� for God, in exchange for our
      salvation, has given the precious blood of Jesus Christ.

      But if he had already believed, saying, �I believe,� how is it that he
      adds, �help thou mine unbelief?� We must say then that faith is manifold,
      that one sort of faith is elementary, another perfect; but this man, being
      but a beginner in believing, prayed the Saviour to add to his virtue what
      was wanting.

      man begins with the least things that he may reach the great; for the
      beginning of virtue is different from the progress and the perfection of
      it. Because then faith mounts up through the secret inspiration of grace,
      by the steps of its own merits, [ed. note: This sentence of
      <span style="font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: " times="" new=""

      may be considered to be an exposition of our Lord�s words: �for he that
      hath not from him shall be taken even that which he hath.� The connection
      between grace and merit, as used by the Fathers, may be illustrated from
      St. Thomas, their faithful disciple. He defines a meritorious operation to
      be one the reward of which is beyond the nature of the worker; so that
      merit implies the infusion of a supernatural habit, that is, of grace, not
      only as its efficient, but as its formal cause. Summa 1 Q62, Art 4] he who
      had not yet believed perfectly was at once a believer and an unbeliever.

      bring Him into difficulty, and to confuse Him by their questions. For they
      proposed to Him a question, which had on either side a precipice, so that
      whether He said that it was lawful for a man to put away his wife, or that
      it was not lawful, they might accuse Him, and contradict what He said, out
      of the doctrines of Moses. Christ, therefore, being Very Wisdom, in

      They put forward indeed this that Moses had said either on account of the
      question of our Saviour, or wishing to excite against Him a multitude of
      men. For divorce was an indifferent thing among the Jews, and all
      practised it, as though it were permitted by the law.

      >, de Con. Evan., ii, 62: It makes nothing, however, to the truth of the
      fact, whether, as Matthew says, they themselves addressed to the Lord the
      question concerning the bill of divorcement, allowed to them by Moses, on
      our Lord�s forbidding the separation, and confirming His sentence from the
      law, or whether it was in answer to a question of His, that they said this
      concerning the command of Moses, as Mark here says. For His wish was to
      give them no reason why Moses permitted it, before they themselves had
      mentioned the fact; since then the wish of the parties speaking, which is
      what the words ought to express, is in either way shewn, there is no
      discrepancy, though there be a difference in the way of relating it. It
      may also be meant that, as Mark expresses it, the question put to them by
      the Lord, What did Moses command?, was in answer to those who had
      previously asked His opinion concerning the putting away of a wife. And
      when they had replied that Moses permitted them to write a bill of
      divorcement, and to put her away, His answer was concerning that same law,
      given by Moses, how God instituted the marriage of a male, and a female,
      saying those things which Matthew relates [Matt 19:4]; on hearing which
      they again rejoined what they had replied to Him when He first asked them,
      namely - Why then did Moses command?

      his wife, for he interposed this delay, that a person whose mind was bent
      on separation, might be deterred by the writing of the bill, and desist;
      particularly, since, as is related, among the Hebrews, no one was allowed
      to write Hebrew characters but the scribes. The [p. 195] law therefore
      wished to send him, whom it ordered to give a bill of divorcement, before
      he dismissed his wife, to them, who ought to be wise interpreters of the
      law, and just opponents of quarrel. For a bill could only be written for
      him by men, who by their good advice might overrule him, since his
      circumstances and necessity had put him into their hands, and so by
      treating between him and his wife they might persuade them to love and
      concord.

      But if a hatred so great had arisen that it could not be extinguished and
      corrected, then indeed a bill was to be written, that he might not lightly
      put away her who was the object of his hate, in such a way as to prevent
      his being recalled to the love, which he owed her by marriage, through the
      persuasion of the wise. For this reason it is added, �For the hardness of
      your heart, he wrote this precept�; for great was the hardness of heart
      which could not be melted or bent to the taking back and recalling the
      love of marriage, even by the interposition of a bill in a way which gave
      room for the just and wise to dissuade them.

      Origin, in Matt., XV, 7: If any of those who profess to hold the office of
      teaching in the Church should see a person bringing to them some of the
      foolish of this world, and low born, and weak, who for this reason are
      called children and infants, let him not forbid the man who offers such an
      one to the Saviour, as though he were acting without judgment. After this
      He exhorts those of His disciples who are already grown to full stature to
      condescend to be useful to children, that they may become to children as
      children, that they may gain children [1 Cor 9:22]; for He Himself, when
      He was in the form of God, humbled Himself, and became a child.

      observed the things of the law from his youth, so in the end, though he

      See also how this is [p. 207] the case with the Apostles; for many women
      busied themselves about their food and their clothing, and ministered unto
      them. In like manner the Apostles had many fathers and mothers, that is,
      persons who loved them; as Peter, for instance, leaving one house, had
      afterwards the houses of all the disciples. And what is more wonderful,
      they are to be persecuted and oppressed, for it is �with persecutions�
      that the Saints are to possess all things, for which reason there follows,
      �But many that are first shall be last, and the last first.� For the
      Pharisees who were first became the last; but those who left all and
      followed Christ were last in this world through tribulation and

      which is reckoned by changing from the left to the right hand, although it
      has the same appearance in the bending of the fingers as the ten had on
      the left, nevertheless is increased to a much greater quantity. This
      means, that all who have despised temporal things for the sake of the
      kingdom of heaven through undoubting faith, taste the joy of the same
      kingdom in this life which is full of persecutions, and in the expectation
      of the heavenly country, which is signified by the right hand, have a
      share in the happiness of all the elect. But because all do not accomplish
      a virtuous course of life with the same ardour as they began it, it is
      presently added, �But many that are first shall be last, and the last
      first�; for we daily see many persons who, remaining in a lay habit, are
      eminent for their meritorious life; but others, who from their youth have
      been ardent in a spiritual profession, at last wither away in the sloth of
      ease, and with a lazy folly finish in the flesh, what they had begun in
      the Spirit.

      answers the thoughts of those who asked Him, condescending to their
      meaning; for they did not know that lofty throne and seat, which is on the
      right hand of the Father, but sought one thing alone, that is, to possess
      the chief place, and to be set over others. And since they had heard it
      said of the Apostles, that they were to sit on twelve [p. 212] thrones,
      they begged for a place higher than all the rest, not knowing what was
      said. To the second question we must say, that such a gift does not
      transcend the power of the Son of God, but what is said by Matthew, �it is
      prepared by My Father,� [Matt. 20:23] is the same as if it were said, �by
      Me,� wherefore also Mark did not say here, by My Father.

      Therefore, as the Lord was departing with His disciples and a great
      multitude from Jericho, the blind man was sitting, begging by the
      way-side; that is, when the Lord ascended into heaven, and many of the
      faithful followed Him, yea when all the elect from the beginning of the
      world entered together with Him the gate of heaven [ed. note: This refers
      to the opinion that by the descent of our Lord into hell, the Patriarchs
      were freed from the limbus Patrum, where they had been confined, and were
      carried by Him into a place of happiness; see authorities quoted in
      Pearson on the Creed, Art. 5], presently the Gentile people began to have
      hope of its own illumination; for it now sits begging by the wayside,
      because it has not entered upon and reached the path of truth.

      of Christ, sought to be made a partaker of Him, but many spoke against
      Him, first the Jews, then also the Gentiles, lest the world which was to
      be enlightened should call upon Christ. The fury of those who attacked
      Him, however, could not deprive of salvation those who were fore-ordained
      to life. And He heard the blind man�s cry as He was passing, but stood
      when He restored his sight, because by His Humanity He pitied him, who by
      the power of His Divinity has driven away the darkness from our mind; for
      in that Jesus was born and suffered for our sakes, He as it were passed
      by, because this action is temporal; but when God is said to stand, it
      means, that, [p. 218] Himself without change, He sets in order all
      changeable things. But the Lord calls the blind man, who cries to Him,
      when He sends the word of faith to the people of the Gentiles by
      preachers; and they call on the blind man to be of good cheer and to rise,
      and bid him come to the Lord, when by preaching to the simple, they bid
      them have hope of salvation, and rise from the sloth of vice, and gird
      themselves for a life of virtue.

      He therefore curses the fig tree for His disciples� sake, that they might
      have faith in Him. For He everywhere distributed blessings, and punished
      no one, yet at the same time, it was right to give them a proof of His
      chastising power, that they might learn that He could even cause the
      persecuting Jews to wither away; He was however unwilling to give this
      proof on men, wherefore He shewed them on a plant a sign of His power of
      punishing. This proves that He came to the fig tree principally for this
      reason, and not on account of His hunger, for who is so silly as to
      suppose that in the morning He felt so greatly the pains of hunger, or
      what prevented the Lord from eating before He left Bethany? Nor can it be
      said that the sight of the figs excited His appetite to hunger, for it was
      not the season of figs; and if He were hungry, why did He not seek food
      elsewhere, rather than from a fig-tree which could not yield fruit before
      its time? What punishment also did a fig tree deserve for not having fruit
      before its time? From all this then we may infer, that He wished to shew
      His power, that their minds might not be broken by His Passion.

      Jerusalem; and Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that
      sold and bought in the temple.� Nevertheless, it is probable that He found
      them buying and selling in the temple things which were necessary for its
      ministry. If then the Lord forbids men to carry on in the temple worldly
      matters, which they might freely do any where else, how much more do they
      deserve a greater portion of the anger of Heaven, who carry on in the
      temple consecrated to Him those things, which are unlawful wherever they
      may be done.

      treasury, point out the Jews puffed up with the righteousness of the law;
      the poor widow is the simplicity of the Church: poor indeed, because she
      has cast away the spirit of pride and of the desires of worldly things;
      and a widow, because Jesus her husband has suffered death for her. She
      casts two mites into the treasury, because she brings the love of God and
      of her neighbour, or the gifts of faith and prayer; which are looked upon
      as mites in their own insignificance, but measured by the merit of a
      devout intention are superior to all the proud works of the Jews. The Jew
      sends of his abundance into the treasury, because he presumes on his own
      righteousness; but the Church sends her whole living into God�s treasury,
      because she understands that even her very living is not of her own
      desert, but of Divine grace.

      through Antichrist in all his power, wonderfully indeed, but falsely. But
      a doubt is often raised whether the Apostle said �signs and lying
      wonders,� because he is to deceive mortal sense, by phantoms, so as to
      appear to do what he does not, or because those wonders themselves, even
      though true, are to turn men aside to lies, because they will not believe
      that any power but a Divine power could do them, being ignorant of the
      power of Satan, especially when he shall have received such power as he
      never had before. But for whichever reason it is said, they shall be
      deceived by those signs and wonders who deserve to be deceived.

      is implied; that if they are elect, it is not possible; and if it is
      possible, they are not elect. This doubt therefore in our Lord�s discourse
      expresses the trembling in the mind of the elect. And He calls them elect,
      because He sees that they will persevere in faith and good works; for

      Church, except those places where that last coming is so promised, as if

      But if there are in Him all the treasures of knowledge, He is not ignorant

      we do if we knew it? We should keep on our wickedness even unto the end.
      Let us therefore attend to His words; for the end comes at even, when a
      man dies in old age; a midnight, when he dies in the midst of his youth;
      and at cockcrow, when our reason is perfect within us; for when a child

      him, rousing him from the sleep of sense; but the age of childhood is the

      was slain in the evening, that is, the fourteenth moon of the first month,
      was called Passover. But on the fifteenth moon, when they came out of
      Egypt, the feast of unleavened bread came on, which solemn time was
      appointed for seven days, that is, up to the twenty-first day of the same
      month in the evening. But the Evangelists indifferently use the day of

      unleavened bread. Wherefore Mark also here says, �After two days was the
      feast of the Passover, and of unleavened bread,� because the day of the
      Passover was also ordered to be celebrated on the days of unleavened

      Jesus; another described by the other three Evangelists. Nay, if you
      examine, you will find three; [p. 276] for one is described by John,
      another by Luke, a third by the other two. For that one described by Luke
      is said to be a sinner and to have come to Jesus during the time of His

      for the first time with humility and tears she merited the remission of
      her sins. For John also relates this, when he began to speak of the
      raising of Lazarus before He came to Bethany, saying, �It was that Mary

      But what she again did at Bethany is another act, unrecorded by Luke, but
      mentioned in the same way by the other three Evangelists. In that
      therefore Matthew and Mark say that the head of the Lord was anointed by
      the woman, whilst John says the feet, we must understand that both the
      head and the feet were anointed by the woman. Unless because Mark has said
      that she broke the box in order to anoint His head, any one is so fond of
      cavilling as to deny that, because the box was broken, any could remain to
      anoint the feet of the Lord. But a man of a more pious spirit will contend
      that it was not broken so as to pour out the whole, or else that the feet
      were anointed before it was broken, so that there remained in the unbroken
      box enough to anoint the head.

      is often hollowed out for boxes of ointment, because it keeps things of
      that nature most uncorrupt. Nard is an aromatic shrub of a large and thick
      root, but short, black and brittle; though unctuous, it smells like
      cypress, and has a sharp taste, and small and dense leaves. Its tops
      spread themselves out like ears of corn, therefore, its gift being double,
      perfumers make much of the spikes and the leaves of the nard. And this is
      what is meant by Mark, when he says �spikenard very precious�, that is,
      the ointment which Mary brought for the Lord was not made of the root of
      nard, but even, what made it more precious, by the addition of the spikes
      and the leaves, the gratefulness of its smell and virtue was augmented.

      bread and given thanks. He therefore gave thanks, Who took upon Him the
      stripes of other men�s wickedness; He Who did nothing worthy of smiting,
      humbly gives a blessing in His Passion, to shew us, what each should do
      when beaten for his own sins, since He Himself bore calmly the stripes due
      to the sin of others; furthermore to shew us, what we who are the subjects
      of the Father should do under correction, when He Who is His equal gave
      thanks under the lash.

      to be a difference between, �Whom will ye that I release unto you?
      Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?� as Matthew has it; and, �Will
      ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?� as is here said. But
      since they gave to kings the name of Christs, he who said this man or that
      must have asked whether they wished the King of the Jews to be released
      unto them, that is, Christ. It makes no difference to the sense that Mark
      has said nothing of Barabbas, wishing only to mention what belonged to the
      Lord, since by their answer he sufficiently shewed whom they wished to
      have released to them.

      Matthew, they �put of Him a scarlet robe,� Mark expresses by �clothed Him
      in purple�; for that scarlet robe was used by them in derision for the
      royal purple, and there is a sort of red purple, very like scarlet. It may
      also be that Mark mentions some purple which the robe had about it, though
      it was of a scarlet colour.

      John relates, how could He be crucified at the third hour, as many persons
      have thought from not understanding the words of Mark. First then let us
      see at what hour He might have been crucified, then we shall see why Mark
      said that He was crucified at the third hour. It was about the sixth hour
      when He was given up to be crucified by Pilate sitting on his judgment
      seat, as has been said, for it was not yet fully the sixth hour, but about
      the sixth, that is, the [p. 320] fifth was over, and some of the sixth had
      begun, so that those things which are related to the crucifixion of our
      Lord took place after the finishing of the fifth, and at the commencement
      of the sixth, until, when the sixth was completed and He was hanging on
      the cross, the darkness which is spoken of took place.

      Let us now consider, why Mark has said, �It was the third hour.� He had
      already said positively, �And when they had crucified Him, they parted His
      garments;� as also the others declare, that when He was crucified His
      garments were divided. Now if Mark had wished to fix the time of what was
      done, it would have been enough to say, �And it was the third hour,� why
      did He add, �and they crucified Him,� unless it was that he wished to
      point to something which had gone before, and which if enquired into would
      be explained, since that same Scripture was to be read at a time, when it
      was known to the whole Church at what hour our Lord was crucified, by
      which means any error might be taken away, and any falsehood be refuted.
      But because he knew that the Lord was fixed to the cross not by the Jews
      but by the soldiers, as John very plainly shews, he wished to intimate
      that the Jews had crucified Him, since they cried out, �Crucify Him,�
      rather than those who executed the orders of their chief according to
      their duty. It is therefore implied, that it took place at the third hour
      when the Jews cried out, �Crucify Him,� and it is most truly shewn that
      they crucified Him, when they so cried out.

      But in the attempt of Pilate to save the Lord, and the tumultuous
      opposition of the Jews, we understand that a space of two hours was
      consumed, and that the sixth hour had begun, before the end of which,
      those things occurred which are related to have taken place from the time
      when Pilate gave up the Lord, and the darkness overspread the earth. Now
      he who will apply himself to these things, without the hard-heartedness of
      impiety, will see that Mark has fitly placed it at the third hour, in the
      same place as the deed of the soldiers who were the executors of it is
      related.

      Therefore lest any one should transfer in his thoughts so great a crime
      from the Jews to the soldiers, he says �it was the third hour, and they
      crucified Him,� that the fault might rather by a careful enquirer be
      charged to them, who, as he would find, had at the third hour cried out
      for His crucifixion, [p. 321] whilst at the same time it would be seen
      that what was done by the soldiers was done at the sixth hour. [ed. note:

      the Jews who passed sentence concerning the crucifixion of Christ at the
      third hour; for every condemned person is considered as dead, from the
      moment that sentence is passed upon him. Mark therefore shewed that our
      Saviour was not crucified by the sentence of the judge, because it is
      difficult to prove the innocence of a man so condemned.

      >: Still there are not wanting persons who assert that the preparation,
      mentioned by John, �Now it was the preparation about the sixth hour,� was
      really the third hour of the day. For they say that on that day before the
      sabbath day, there was a preparation of the passover of the Jews, because
      on that sabbath, they began the unleavened bread; but however that the
      true passover, which is now celebrated on the day of our Lord�s Passion,
      that is, the Christian not the Jewish passover, began to be prepared, or
      to have its �parasceue�, from that sixth hour of the night, when His death
      began to be prepared by the Jews; for �parasceue� means preparation.
      Between that hour therefore of the night and His crucifixion occurs the
      sixth hour of preparation, according to John, and the third hour of the
      day, according to Mark. What Christian would not give in to this solution
      of the question, provided that we could find some circumstance, from which
      we might gather that this preparation of our Passover, that is, of the
      death of Christ, began at the ninth hour of the night? For if we say that
      it began when our Lord was taken by the Jews, it was still early in the
      night, but if when our Lord was carried away to the house of the father in
      law of Caiaphas, where also He was heard by the chief priests, the cock
      had not crowed; but if when He was given up to Pilate, it is very plain
      that it was morning. It remains therefore that we must understand the
      preparation of our Lord�s death to have commenced when all the Chief
      Priests pronounced, �He is guilty of death.� For there is nothing absurd
      in supposing that was the ninth hour of the night, so that we may
      understand that Peter�s denial is put out of its order after it really
      happened.

      Nor need you wonder at the lowliness of His words, at the complaints as of
      one forsaken, when you look on the offense of the cross, knowing the form
      of a servant. For as hunger, and thirst, and fatigue were not things
      proper to the Divinity, but bodily afflictions; so His saying, �Why hast
      Thou forsaken me?� was proper to a bodily voice, for the body is never
      naturally wont to wish to be separated from the life which is joined to
      it. For although our Saviour Himself said this, He really shewed the
      weakness of His body; He spoke therefore as man, bearing about with Him my

      the salvation of man is coming forth with a happy closeness, to be

      the Angel; but Matthew does not mention any place at all, where the
      disciples saw the Lord after He arose, except Galilee, according to the
      Angel�s prophecy. But since it is not set down when this happened, whether
      first, before He was seen any where else, and since the very place where
      Matthew says that He went into Galilee to the mountain, does not explain
      the day, or the order of the narration, Matthew does not oppose the

      any of the Angels themselves, that is, to answer the words which they had
      spoken to them; or else to the guards whom they saw lying there; for that

      therefore which Mark here mentions must have been amongst those words,
      which Luke and John say, that the Lord at that time spoke to the
      disciples. But another question is raised, how Mark says that He appeared
      when the eleven sat at meat, if the time was the first part of the night
      on the Lord�s day, when John plainly says that Thomas was not with them,
      who, we believe, had gone out, before the Lord came in to them, after
      those two had returned from the village, and spoken with the eleven, as we
      find in Luke�s Gospel. But Luke in his relation leaves room for supposing
      that Thomas went out first, while they spoke these things, and that the
      Lord entered afterwards; Mark however from his saying, �for the last time
      He appeared to the eleven as they sat at meat,� forces us to believe that
      he was there, unless indeed, though one of them was absent, he chose to
      call them, the eleven, because the company of the Apostles was then called
      by this number, before Matthias was chosen into the place of Judas.

      Or if this be a harsh way of understanding it, let us understand that it
      means that after many appearances, He shewed Himself for the last time,
      that is, on the fortieth day, to the Apostles, as they sat at meat, and
      that since He was about to ascend from them, He rather wished on that day
      to reprove them for not having believed those who had seen Him risen
      before seeing Him themselves, because after His ascension even the
      Gentiles on their preaching were to believe a Gospel, which they had not

      And so the same Mark immediately after that rebuke says, �And He said unto
      them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature.�
      And lower down, �He that believeth not shall be condemned.� Since then
      they were to preach this, were not they themselves to be first rebuked,
      because before they saw the Lord they had not believed those to whom He
      had first appeared? [p. 345]

      >, Epist., CXCIX [199], 12: But how was this preaching fulfilled by the
      Apostles, [Acts 1:8] since there are many nations in which it has just
      begun, and others in which it has not yet begun to be fulfilled? Truly
      then this precept was not so laid upon the Apostles by our Lord, as though
      they alone to whom He then spoke were to fulfil so great a charge; in the
      same way as He says, �Behold, I am with you always, even unto the end of
      the world,� apparently to them alone; but who does not understand that the
      promise is made to the Catholic Church, which though some are dying,
      others are born, shall be here unto the end of the world?

      >: But we must also know from this that words are confirmed by deeds as
      then, in the Apostles, works confirmed their words, for signs followed.
      Grant then, O [p. 349] Christ, that the good words which we speak may be
      confirmed by works and deeds, so that at the last, Thou working with us in
      word and in deed, we may be perfect, for Thine as is fitting is the glory
      both of word and deed.
