    <p>
      The purpose of logic is to provide an analytic guide to the discovery of
      demonstrated truth and all its various approximations throughout the
      philosophical sciences. In the words of St. Albert the Great, logic
      “teaches the principles by which one can arrive at the knowledge of things
      unknown through that which is known” (<i>De Praedicab.</i>, tr. I, c. 5,
      ed. Borgnet 1, 8b). St. Thomas defines logic as an art “directive of the
      acts of reason themselves so that man may proceed orderly, easily and
      without error in the very act of reason itself” (Foreword). Logic is thus
      a construct based on the natural processes of the mind invented for a very
      specific use, namely, scientific reasoning. Because it is a construct,
      logic is said to deal with “second intentions,” that is, deliberate
      constructs of the mind, existing solely in the mind, of ideas based upon
      the way human beings know reality (“first intentions”), such as
      predicables, subject, predicate, major premise, minor premise, middle term
      and conclusion. The analysis and construction of this guide is the
      scientific, or theoretical, aspect of logic. Under this consideration,
      logic is itself a science and it is this aspect that modem logicians seem
      to be interested in. Nevertheless the purpose of this construct is that it
      be used by thinkers who want to get on with the discovery of truth in the
      various sciences. In this way the whole of logic is a methodology, solidly
      established by analysis, to guide the mind in its quest for answers to
      problems raised in scientific inquiry. The general name given to all of
      Aristotle’s logical treatises is Organon, the instrument. For this reason
      Boethius, the 6th century translator of most of Aristotle’s Organon, says
      that logic is “not so much a science as an instrument of science” (<i
        >Comm. super Porphyry</i
      >, ed. 2a, 1, c. 3; see St. Thomas, <i>In Boeth. de Trin.</i>, q. 5, a. I
      ad 2; St. Albert, <i>Post Anal.</i> I, tr. I, c. 1, ed. Borgnet II, 2b).
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be noted, however, that logic is only a general methodology common
      to all scientific knowledge (See J.A. Weisheipl, “The Evolution of
      Scientific Method,” <i>The Logic of Science</i>, ed. V.E. Smith—New York:
      St. John’s Univ. 1964—59-86). There is over and above this a particular
      logic peculiar to each field of knowledge. That is to say, the proper
      method of natural philosophy is not at all identical with that of
      mathematics, metaphysics or moral philosophy. Logic, or general
      methodology, must be understood before any of the particular sciences are
      investigated and organized systematically. This, at least, was the common
      view accepted by all scholastic thinkers, even though this was not the
      actual procedure followed in medieval universities (see J.A. Weisheipl,
      “Classification of the Sciences in Medieval Thought,”
      <i>Mediaeval Studies</i>, 27 (1965)89).
    </p>
    <p>
      In studying methodology, or the common logic of all the sciences,
      Aristotle and those after him followed a logical order which considered
      problems arising from each step of logical thinking. The scholastics
      thought they had found this order in the various books of logic. Thus
      according to St. Thomas (Foreword) the predicables (in the
      <i>Isagogy</i> of Porphyry) and the categories (in the
      <i>De praedicamentis</i> of Aristotle) deal with universals that are
      begotten by the first act of the mind. Propositions, or enunciations (in
      the <i>Peri hermeneias</i> of Aristotle) deal with constructs of various
      types of judgement in the second act of the mind. These two areas of
      logical investigation are prior to the analysis of reasoning itself, the
      third act of the mind. St. Thomas recognized that there are two types of
      analysis, or resolution, to be considered: the formal structure of
      reasoning, which Aristotle discusses in the <i>Prior Analytics</i>, and
      the material structure of the premises, which can be of three kinds,
      namely necessary and scientific (considered in the
      <i>Posterior Analytics</i>), probable and dialectical (considered in the
      <i>Topics</i>), and erroneous and false (considered in the
      <i>Sophistici Elenchi</i>). Of all these branches of logic, the most
      important is the <i>Posterior Analytics</i>, the only logical book
      commented upon in full by St. Thomas Aquinas. St. Albert clearly states
      that the Posterior Analytics is the apex, the most perfect and only
      absolutely desirable (<i>simpliciter desiderabile</i>) study among the
      logical works of Aristotle (<i>Post. Anal.</i>, 1, tr. 1, cap. 1, ed.
      Borgnet II, 2b). And the Leonine editors of the works of St. Thomas state
      that “the posterior analytics deal with demonstration and thus are the
      ultimate goal of the whole science of logic” (Praef. ed. Leon., 1, p.
      131).
    </p>
    <p>
      No one has ever doubted that the <i>Posterior Analytics</i> is an
      extremely difficult work to understand. Even Themistius, paraphrasing the
      Greek text, found much to complain about (<i>Paraphrasis in lib. Post.</i
      >, praef.). According to John of Salisbury, after the text was translated
      into Latin, there was scarcely a master willing to expound it because of
      its extreme subtlety and obscurity; “there are almost as many stumbling
      blocks as there are chapters” (<i>Metalogicon</i> IV, c. 6, ed. Webb 171).
      However, John blames most of this on the bungling mistakes of scribes and
      he proceeds to give the Latin West the first paraphrase of Aristotle’s
      difficult work. Part of the difficulty seems to be that this is an early
      work of Aristotle, for the terminology is not yet fixed and especially in
      the First Book, Aristotle seems to approach the same point from many
      directions, giving the reader the impression that many different points
      are being made. The best guides for understanding Aristotle are St. Thomas
      Aquinas, St. Albert the Great, Averroes and Robert Grosseteste.
    </p>
    <p>
      When reading St. Thomas’ commentary one must not only read the text of
      Aristotle first, but one should have a pencil and sufficient paper to
      outline the text as understood by St. Thomas. Division of the text was
      always one of the basic tools of the scholastic method. Therefore it is
      important to keep in mind this outline in order to understand the point
      about to be made and to appreciate it in the context of the work as a
      whole. Clearly Aristotle himself wrote according to a systematic order,
      and it is up to the reader to appreciate this order.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since St. Thomas did not know Greek, he had to rely on one of the many
      Latin translations of the Posterior Analytics available to him. At the
      time St. Thomas wrote his commentary, around 1270, there were four Latin
      translations from the Greek and two from the Arabic. Even though it seems
      that Boethius himself translated the work, the
      <i>Posterior Analytics</i> had to come into the Latin West anew in the
      12th century as part of the <i>logica nova</i>. The common text in the
      Middle Ages was the version made by James of Venice before 1159; it was
      the “vulgate text” (<i>Arist. Lat.</i>, IV.2) in use during the second
      half of the 12th century and the earlier part of the 13th century. A very
      influential version from the Arabic was made by the translator, probably
      Michael Scott, of the works of Averroes together with the Commentator’s
      views between 1220 and 1240. St. Thomas was undoubtedly familiar with
      these two translations, but he most likely relied on the revised version
      made by William of Moerbeke in the second half of the 13th century (<i
        >Arist. Lat.</i
      >, IV. 4; cf. De Rubeis, Diss. XXIII, c. 1-2, ed. Leon., 1, cclix-cclxii).
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Posterior Analytics</i> of Aristotle possesses a remarkable unity
      from beginning to end. The first chapter of Book I is a propaedeutic to
      the entire work; it poses the fundamental problem concerning the
      possibility of learning, that is, of demonstrative knowledge. Its point of
      departure is the problem posed by Plato in the <i>Meno</i> (80 D-86) where
      Socrates attempts to inquire into the nature of virtue, a subject about
      which he admittedly does not have full knowledge. Meno, intervenes and
      objects that all inquiry is impossible, for “a man cannot inquire either
      about that which he knows, or about that which he does not know; for if he
      knows, he has no need to inquire; and if not, he cannot, for he does not
      know the very subject about which he is to inquire.” Either we already
      know what we seek to learn, and this is not learning, or we do not know
      what we are seeking, and hence cannot know when we have found it. Plato
      solves this dilemma by his doctrine of remembering ideas already innate in
      the mind. The Sophists and nominalists, of the Academy took an opposite
      view and claimed that all learning is simply an aggregation of individual
      observations. In other words, the Sophists maintained that there can be no
      demonstrations, but only the acquisition of a totally new fact. Aristotle
      took a middle course between these two extremes that would have all
      knowledge in act or no knowledge in act by his ingenious doctrine of
      potentiality. Instead of saying that all knowledge is actually in the mind
      or actually not in the mind, Aristotle insists that all knowledge is
      potentially in the mind and the business of learning is to draw this
      potentiality into actuality. Basically it is the same solution Aristotle
      offers in the <i>Physics</i> to explain the possibility of real change.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the very question posed for inquiry there is already some knowledge in
      the mind from which inquiry begins. The all important starting point for
      inquiry is the question or problem posed. Already we have some idea, if
      only tentative, of the subject of inquiry, and some knowledge of the
      predicate; otherwise the question would never have arisen. The purpose of
      inquiry is to find the definitive medium or middle term that will provide
      an answer to the question raised. This middle term must be one or all of
      the physical causes in reality; the mind will not rest until it has found
      a causal reason for the conclusion. However there are many different kinds
      of scientific questions that can be raised: whether something exists (<i
        >an sit</i
      >), what is it (<i>quid sit</i>), does it have this or that property (<i
        >quia sit</i
      >), and why is this so (<i>propter quid</i>). For Aristotle and for St.
      Thomas only a true, objective, invariable cause can produce demonstrations
      worthy of the name scientific. This cause or middle term cannot be found
      outside the area in question, for this would give only a probable view. In
      other words, if a question is raised concerning the physical world, then
      only an answer found within natural philosophy will do. One cannot, in
      this case, appeal to harmony, morals or metaphysics for the right answer.
      The cause must be found within the context of the question. The answer is
      not found despite the question or problem, but because of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could be farther from the truth than to think of all demonstrative
      knowledge as “deductive.” This is only rarely the case. Most scientific
      inquiry requires the reverse process of analysis or breaking down. Once a
      middle term, a true medium of demonstration, has been found in whole or in
      part, the result may be expressed in the form of a syllogism that can be
      tested according to all the rules described in the
      <i>Prior Analytics</i> and <i>Sophistici Elenchi</i>. Thus the syllogism
      is not a means of discovery, but rather a means of exposition of the truth
      acquired by analysis. In fact the syllogism itself can be expressed in a
      definition that explicitly states the reason. Aristotle calls such a
      definition a statement “which differs from the syllogism only in
      position.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the <i>Posterior Analytics</i> is a scientific work that can be
      studied and understood in its own right, it cannot be fully understood
      until one can see this kind of process at work in the various Aristotelian
      sciences. The scholastics themselves did not grasp the significance of
      this work until they could see it at work in the other writings of
      Aristotle. The <i>Physics</i> and <i>Ethics</i> of Aristotle in particular
      helped to instruct the scholastic in its use. Only then could Albert the
      Great and St. Thomas apply this methodology to such new branches as
      theology. St. Thomas’ <i>Summa theologiae</i> is the crowning glory of the
      use that can be made by applying the methodology to a new realm of
      knowledge. The very first question of the <i>Summa</i> is a masterpiece of
      Aristotelian methodology.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the present English translation of St. Thomas’ commentary may
      seem to many to be excessively literal, it has the merit of following the
      procedure of William of Moerbeke, who rendered, apparently at the request
      of St. Thomas, a literal translation from the Greek lest any nuance be
      lost. It is hoped that those who are able will also consult the Latin text
      in difficult passages.

      <span style="font-weight: bold">FOREWORD OF ST. THOMAS AQUINAS</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      As the Philosopher says in <i>Metaphysics</i> I (980b26), “the human race
      lives by art and reasonings.” In this statement the Philosopher seems to
      touch upon that property whereby man differs from the other animals. For
      the other animals are prompted to their acts by a natural impulse, but man
      is directed in his actions by a judgment of reason. And this is the reason
      why there are various arts devoted to the ready and orderly performance of
      human acts. For an art seems to be nothing more than a definite and fixed
      procedure established by reason, whereby human acts reach their due end
      through appropriate means.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now reason is not only able to direct the acts of the lower powers but is
      also director of its own act: for what is peculiar to the intellective
      part of man is its ability to reflect upon itself. For the intellect knows
      itself. In like manner reason is able to reason about its own act.
      Therefore just as the art of building or carpentering, through which man
      is enabled to perform manual acts in an easy and orderly manner, arose
      from the fact that reason reasoned about manual acts, so in like manner an
      art is needed to direct the act of reasoning, so that by it a man when
      performing the act of reasoning might proceed in an orderly and easy
      manner and without error. And this art is logic, i.e., the science of
      reason. And it concerns reason not only because it is according to reason,
      for that is common to all arts, but also because it is concerned with the
      very act of reasoning as with its proper matter. Therefore it seems to be
      the art of the arts, because it directs us in the act of reasoning, from
      which all arts proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consequently one should view the parts of logic according to the diversity
      among the acts of reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now there are three acts of the reason, the first two of which belong to
      reason regarded as an intellect. One action of the intellect is the
      understanding of indivisible or uncomplex things, and according to this
      action it conceives <i>what</i> a thing is. And this operation is called
      by some the informing of the intellect, or representing by means of the
      intellect. To this
    </p>
    <p>
      operation of the reason is ordained the doctrine which Aristotle hands
      down in the book of <i>Predicaments</i>, [i.e., <i>Categories</i> ]. The
      second operation of the intellect is its act of combining or dividing, in
      which the true or the false are for the first time present. And this act
      of reason is the subject of the doctrine which Aristotle hands down in the
      book entitled <i>On Interpretation</i>. But the third act of the reason is
      concerned with that which is peculiar to reason, namely, to advance from
      one thing to another in such a way that through that which is known a man
      comes to a knowledge of the unknown. And this act is considered in the
      remaining books of logic.
    </p>
    <p>
      It should be noted that the acts of reason are in a certain sense not
      unlike the acts of nature: hence so far as it can, art imitates nature.
      Now in the acts of nature we observe a threefold diversity. For in some of
      them nature acts from necessity, i.e., in such a way that it cannot fail;
      in others, nature acts so as to succeed for the most part, although now
      and then it fails in its act. Hence in this latter case there must be a
      twofold act: one which succeeds in the majority of cases, as when from
      seed is generated a perfect animal; the other when nature fails in regard
      to what is appropriate to it, as when from seed something monstrous is
      generated owing to a defect in some principle.
    </p>
    <p>
      These three are found also in the acts of the reason. For there is one
      process of reason which induces necessity, where it is not possible to
      fall short of the truth; and by such a process of reasoning the certainty
      of science is acquired. Again, there is a process of reason in which
      something true in most cases is concluded but without producing necessity.
      But the third process of reason is that in which reason fails to reach a
      truth because some principle which should have been observed in reasoning
      was defective.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the part of logic which is devoted to the first process is called the
      <i>judicative</i> part, because it leads to judgments possessed of the
      certitude of science. And because a certain and sure judgment touching
      effects cannot be obtained except by analyzing them into their first
      principles, this part is called <i>analytical</i>, i.e., resolvent.
      Furthermore, the certitude obtained by such an analysis of a judgment is
      derived either from the mere form of the syllogism—and to this is ordained
      the book of the <i>Prior Ana1ytics</i> which treats of the syllogism as
      such—or from the matter along with the form, because the propositions
      employed are <i>per se</i> and necessary [cf. infra, Lectures 10, 13]—and
      to this is ordained the book of the <i>Posterior Analytics</i> which is
      concerned with the demonstrative syllogism.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the second process of reason another part of logic called
      <i>investigative</i> is devoted. For investigation is not always
      accompanied by certitude. Hence in order to have certitude a judgment must
      be formed, bearing on that which has been investigated. But just as in the
      works of nature which succeed in the majority of cases certain levels are
      achieved—because the stronger the power of nature the more rarely does it
      fail to achieve its effect—so too in that process of reason which is not
      accompanied by complete certitude certain levels are found accordingly as
      one approaches more or less to complete certitude. For although science is
      not obtained by this process of reason, nevertheless belief or opinion is
      sometimes achieved (on account of the provability of the propositions one
      starts with), because reason leans completely to one side of a
      contradiction but with fear concerning the other side. The
      <i>Topics</i> or dialectics is devoted to this. For the dialectical
      syllogism which Aristotle treats in the book of <i>Topics</i> proceeds
      from premises which are provable.
    </p>
    <p>
      At times, however, belief or opinion is not altogether achieved, but
      suspicion is, because reason does not lean to one side of a contradiction
      unreservedly, although it is inclined more to one side than to the other.
      To this the <i>Rhetoric</i> is devoted. At other times a mere fancy
      inclines one to one side of a contradiction because of some
      representation, much as a man turns in disgust from certain food if it is
      described to him in terms of something disgusting. And to this is ordained
      the <i>Poetics</i>. For the poet’s task is to lead us to something
      virtuous by some excellent description. And all these pertain to the
      philosophy of the reason, for it belongs to reason to pass from one thing
      to another.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third process of reasoning is served by that part of logic which is
    </p>
    <p>
      called <i>sophistry</i>, which Aristotle treats in the book
      <i>On Sophistical Refutations</i>.<br /></p

    <p>
      Leaving aside the other parts of logic, we shall fix our attention on the
      judicative part as it is presented in the book of
      <i>Posterior Analytics</i> which is divided into two parts. In the first
      he shows the need for the demonstrative syllogism, with which this book is
      concerned. In the second part he comes to a decision concerning that
      syllogism (71b8) [Lect. 4).
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the need for anything directed to an end is caused by that end. But
      the end of the demonstrative syllogism is the attainment of science. Hence
      if science could not be achieved by syllogizing or arguing, there would be
      no need for the demonstrative syllogism. Plato, as a matter of fact, held
      that science in us is not the result of a syllogism but of an impression
      upon our minds of ideal forms from which, he said, are also derived the
      natural forms in natural things, which he supposed were participations of
      forms separated from matter. From this it followed that natural agents
      were not the causes of forms in natural things but merely prepared the
      matter for participating in the separated forms. In like fashion he
      postulated that science in us is not caused by study and exercise, but
      only that obstacles are removed and man is brought to recall things which
      he naturally understands in virtue of an imprint of separated forms.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Aristotle’s view is opposed to this on two counts. For he maintains
      that natural forms are made actual by forms present in matter, i.e., by
      the forms of natural agents. He further maintains that science is made
      actual in us by other knowledge already existing in us. This means that it
      is formed in us through a syllogism or some type of argument. For in
      arguing we proceed from one thing into another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, in order to show the need for demonstrative syllogism Aristotle
      begins by stating that some of our knowledge is acquired from knowledge
      already existing. Hence he does two things. First, he states his thesis.
      Secondly, he explains the character of prior knowledge (71a11) [Lect. 2].
      Concerning the first he does two things.
    </p>
    <p>
      First (71a1), he asserts a universal proposition containing his thesis,
      namely, that the production of knowledge in us is caused from knowledge
      already existing; hence he says, “Every doctrine and every discipline...”
      He does not say, “all knowledge,” because not all knowledge depends on
      previous knowledge, for that would involve an infinite process: but the
      acquisition of every discipline comes from knowledge already possessed.
      For the names “doctrine” and “discipline” pertain to the learning process,
      doctrine being the action exerted by the one who makes us know, and
      discipline the reception of knowledge from another. Furthermore,
      “doctrine” and “discipline” are not taken here as pertaining only to the
      acquisition of scientific knowledge but to the acquiring of any knowledge.
      That this is so is evidenced by the fact that he explains the proposition
      even in regard to dialectical and rhetorical disputations, neither of
      which engenders science. Hence this is another reason why he did not say,
      “from pre-existent science or intuition,” but “knowledge” universally.
      However he does add, “intellectual,” in order to preclude knowledge
      acquired by sense or imagination. For reason alone proceeds from one thing
      into another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then (71a3) he employs induction to prove his thesis; and first of all in
      regard to those demonstrations in which scientific knowledge is acquired.
      Of these the best are the mathematical sciences because of their most
      certain manner of demonstrating. After them come the other arts, because
      some manner of demonstrating is found in all of them; otherwise they would
      not be sciences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly (71a4), he proves the same thing in regard to disputative, i.e.,
      dialectical, arguments, because they employ syllogism and induction, in
      each of which the process starts from something already known. For in a
      syllogism the knowledge of some universal conclusion is obtained from
      other universals already known; in induction, however, a universal is
      concluded from singulars made known in sense-perception.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirdly (71a8), he manifests the same thing in rhetorical arguments, in
      which persuasion is produced through an enthymeme or example but not
      through a syllogism or complete induction because of the uncertainty
      attending the matters discussed, namely, the individual acts of men in
      which universal propositions cannot be truthfully assumed. Therefore, in
      place of a syllogism in which there must be something universal, an
      enthymeme is employed in which it is not necessary to have something
      universal. Similarly, in place of induction in which a universal is
      concluded, an example is employed in which one goes from the singular not
      to the universal but to the singular. Hence it is clear that just as the
      enthymeme is an abridged syllogism, so an example is an incomplete
      induction. Therefore, if in the case of the syllogism and induction one
      proceeds from knowledge already existing, the same must be granted in the
      case of the enthymeme and example.<br /></p

        EXTENT AND ORDER OF THE PRE-EXISTENT KNOWLEDGE REQUIRED FOR OBTAINING
        SCIENCE</span
      >
    </p>

    <p>71a11. The pre-existent knowledge— a16. Recognition of a truth</p>
    <p>
      After showing that every discipline is developed from knowledge already
      existing, the Philosopher shows what is the extent of this preexisting
      knowledge. Concerning this he does two things. First, he determines the
      extent of pre-existing knowledge in regard to the things that must be
      known in order to attain knowledge of the conclusion, of which scientific
      knowledge is sought. Secondly, he determines the extent of pre-existing
      knowledge of the conclusion, of which scientific knowledge is sought
      through demonstration (71a24) [L.3]. Now two things are included in
      pre-existing knowledge, namely, the knowledge and the order of the
      knowledge. First, therefore, he determines the extent of pre-existing
      knowledge so far as the knowledge itself is concerned. Secondly, so far as
      the order of the knowledge is concerned (71a16).
    </p>
    <p>
      In regard to the first it should be noted that the object of which
      scientific knowledge is sought through demonstration is some conclusion in
      which a proper attribute is predicated of some subject, which conclusion
      is inferred from the principles. And because the knowledge of simple
      things precedes the knowledge of compound things, it is necessary -that
      the subject and the proper attribute be somehow known before knowledge of
      the conclusion is obtained. In like manner it is required thatthe
      principle be known from which the conclusion is inferred, for the
      conclusion is made known from a knowledge of the principle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the extent of pre-existent knowledge of these three items, i.e., of
      the principle, of the subject, and of the proper attribute, is limited to
      knowing two things about them, namely, <i>that</i> each is and
      <i>what</i> each is. But, as stated in <i>Metaphysics</i> VII, complex
      things are not defined. For there is no definition of “white man,” much
      less of an enunciation [proposition]. Hence since a principle is an
      enunciation, there cannot be preexisting knowledge of
      <i>what it is</i> but only of the fact <i>that it is true</i>. But in
      regard to the proper attribute, it is possible to know <i>what it is</i>,
      because, as is pointed out in the same book, accidents do have some sort
      of definition. Now the being of a proper attribute and of any accident is
      being in a subject; and this fact is concluded by the demonstration.
      Consequently, it is not known beforehand <i>that</i> the proper attribute
      exists, but only <i>what</i> it is. The subject, too, has a definition;
      moreover, its being does not depend on the proper attribute—rather its own
      being is known before one knows the proper attribute to be in it.
      Consequently, it is necessary to know both <i>what</i> the subject is and
      <i>that</i> it is, especially since the medium of demonstration is taken
      from the definition of the subject of the proper attribute.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, therefore, is why the Philosopher says (71a11) that it is necessary
      to know beforehand in two ways; because two items are known beforehand
      concerning things of which we have pre-existing knowledge, namely,
      <i>that</i> it is and <i>what</i> it is. [Then he goes on to say] that
      there are some things concerning which it is necessary first to know
      <i>that</i> they are, such as principles, concerning which he then gives
      examples, citing as one example the first of all principles, namely,
      “There is true affirmation or negation about everything.” Again, there are
      other things, namely, proper attributes, concerning which it is necessary
      to know <i>what is said to be predicated</i>, i.e., what is signified by
      their name. And he does not say unqualifiedly, “what it is,” but “what is
      said to be predicated,” because one cannot properly know of something
      <i>what</i> it is before it is known <i>that</i> it is. For there are no
      definitions of non-beings. Hence the question, <i>whether it is</i>,
      precedes the question, <i>what it is</i>. But “whether a thing is” cannot
      be shown unless it is known beforehand what is signified by its name. On
      this account the Philosopher teaches in <i>Metaphysics</i> IV that in
      disputing against those who deny principles one must begin with the
      meanings of names. An example of this is “triangle,” concerning which one
      must know beforehand that its name signifies such and such, namely what is
      contained in its definition.
    </p>
    <p>
      But since accidents are referred to their subjects in a definite order, it
      is not impossible for something which is an accident in relation to one
      thing to be a subject in relation to something else: for example, a
      surface is an accident in relation to a bodily substance, but in relation
      to color it is the first subject. However, that which is a subject in such
      a way as never to be an accident of anything else is a substance. Hence in
      those sciences whose subject is a substance, that which is the subject can
      never be a proper attribute, as in first philosophy and in natural
      science, which treats of mobile being.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in those sciences which bear upon accidents, nothing prevents a same
      thing from being taken as a subject in reference to one proper attribute,
      and as an attribute in reference to a more basic subject. Nevertheless,
      this must not develop into an infinite process, for one must arrive at
      something which is first in that science and which is taken as a subject
      in such a way that it is never taken as a proper attribute, as is clear in
      the mathematical sciences, which treat of continuous or discrete quantity.
      For in these sciences those things are postulated which are first in the
      genus of quantity; for example, unit and line and surface and the like.
      Once these are postulated, certain other things are sought through
      demonstration, such as the equilateral triangle and the square and so on
      in geometry. In these cases the demonstrations are said to be, as it were,
      operational, as when it is required to construct an equilateral triangle
      on a given straight line. But once it has been constructed, certain proper
      attributes are proved about it; for example, that its angles are equal, or
      something of that sort. It is clear, therefore, that in the first type of
      demonstration “triangle” behaves as a proper attribute, and in the second
      type as a subject. Hence the Philosopher is using “triangle” as a proper
      attribute and not as a subject when he says by way of example, “We must
      assume that triangle means so and so” (71a14).
    </p>
    <p>
      He says, ‘furthermore, that there are certain things about which we must
      know beforehand both what each is and whether it is. And he uses the
      example of “one,” which is the principle in every genus of quantity. For
      although it is somehow an accident in reference to substance, yet in the
      mathematical sciences, which treat of quantity, it cannot be taken as a
      proper attribute but only as a subject, since in this genus [quantity] it
      has nothing prior to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason for this difference is shown by the fact that the manner in
      which the aforesaid, namely, principle, proper attribute and subject, are
      manifested is not the same. For the way in which they are known is not the
      same: for principles are known through the act of composing and dividing,
      but subject and proper attribute by the act of apprehending the essence.
      And this, too, does not belong in similar fashion to a subject and to a
      proper attribute, since a subject is defined absolutely, for nothing
      outside its essence is mentioned in its definition; but a proper attribute
      is defined with dependence on the subject which is mentioned in its
      definition. Therefore, since they are not known in the same way, it is not
      surprising if they are not foreknown in the same way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then (7a16) he determines the extent of foreknowledge on the part of the
      order which foreknowing implies. For something is prior to another both in
      the order of time and in the order of nature. And this twofold order must
      be considered in regard to pre-existent knowing. For something is known
      before something else in the sense of being known prior in time.
      Concerning such things he says that someone could know certain things by
      knowing them prior to the time when he knows the things to which they are
      said to be foreknown. But certain others are known at one and the same
      time, although one is prior by nature to the other. Concerning these he
      says that one acquires a knowledge of some of these foreknown things at
      the same time that knowledge of the things to which they are foreknown is
      acquired. He indicates what these are when he adds that they are the
      things contained under certain universals of which we have knowledge,
      i.e., of which it is known that they are contained under such universals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he clarifies this with an example. For since two propositions are
      needed for inferring a conclusion, namely, a major and a minor; when the
      major proposition is known, the conclusion is not yet known. Therefore,
      the major proposition is known before the conclusion not only in nature
      but in time. Further, if in the minor proposition something is introduced
      or employed which is contained under the universal proposition which is
      the major, but it is not evident that it is contained under this
      universal, then a knowledge of the conclusion is not yet possessed,
      because the truth of the minor proposition will not yet be certain. But if
      in the minor proposition a term is taken about which it is clear that it
      is contained under the universal in the major proposition, the truth of
      the minor proposition is clear, because that which is taken under the
      universal shares in the same knowledge, and so the knowledge of the
      conclusion is had at once. Thus, suppose that someone should begin to
      demonstrate by stating that every triangle has three angles equal to two
      right angles. When this is known, the knowledge of the conclusion is not
      yet known. But when it is later assumed that this figure inscribed in a
      semicircle is a triangle, he knows at once that it has three angles equal
      to two right angles. However, if it were not clear that this figure
      inscribed in the semicircle is a triangle, the conclusion would not be
      known as soon as the minor was stated; rather, it would be necessary to
      search for a middle through which to demonstrate that this figure is a
      triangle.
    </p>
    <p>
      In giving this example of things which are known at a time prior to the
      conclusion the Philosopher says that a person obtaining a knowledge of the
      conclusion through demonstration foreknew this proposition even according
      to time, namely, that every triangle has three angles equal to two right
      angles. But inducing this assumption, namely, that this figure in the
      semicircle is a triangle, he knew the conclusion at the same time, because
      this induction shares in the evidence of the universal under which it is
      contained, so that there is no need to search for another middle. He adds,
      therefore, that “some things are only learnt in this way” (71a23), i.e.,
      learnt in virtue of themselves, so that it is not necessary to learn them
      through some other middle which is the ultimate reached by analysis in
      which the mediate is reduced to the immediate. Or it can be read in such a
      way that the “ultimate,” i.e., the extreme, which is subsumed under the
      universal middle does not need a further middle to show that it i
      contained under that universal. And he manifests what those things are
      which always share the knowledge of their universal, saying that they are
      the singulars, which are not predicated of any subject, since no middle
      can be found between singulars and their species.<br /></p

    </p>
    <p>
      Having shown the manner in which certain other things must be known before
      knowledge of the conclusion is obtained, the Philosopher now wishes to
      show how we know even the conclusion beforehand, i.e., before knowledge of
      it is obtained through a syllogism or induction. Concerning this he does
      two things:
    </p>
    <p>
      First (71a24), he establishes the truth of the fact, saying that before an
      induction or syllogism is formed to beget knowledge of a conclusion, that
      conclusion is somehow known and somehow not known: for, absolutely
      speaking, it is not known; but in a qualified sense, it is known. Thus, if
      the conclusion that a triangle has three angles equal to two right angles
      has to be proved, the one who obtains science of this fact through
      demonstration already knew it in some way before it was demonstrated;
      although absolutely speaking, he did not know it. Hence in one sense he
      already knew it, but in the full sense he did not. And the reason is that,
      as has been pointed out, the principles of the conclusion must be known
      beforehand. Now the principles in demonstrative matters are to the
      conclusion as efficient causes in natural things are to their effects;
      hence in <i>Physics</i> II the propositions of a syllogism are set in the
      genus of efficient cause. But an effect, before it is actually produced,
      pre-exists virtually in its efficient causes but not actually, which is to
      exist absolutely. In like manner, before it is drawn out of its
      demonstrative principles, the conclusion is pre-known virtually, although
      not actually, in its self-evident principles. For that is the way it
      pre-exists in them. And so it is clear that it is not pre-known in the
      full sense, but in some sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly (71a28), in virtue of this established fact, he settles a doubt
      which Plato maintained in the book, <i>Meno</i>, which gets its title from
      the name of his disciple. The doubt is presented in the following manner:
      A person utterly ignorant of the art of geometry is questioned in an
      orderly Way concerning the <i>per se</i> known principles from which a
      geometric conclusion is concluded. By starting with principles that are
      <i>per se</i> known, to each of which this person ignorant of geometry
      gives a true answer, Aid leading him thus by questions to the conclusion,
      he gives the true Answer step by step. From this, therefore, he would have
      it that even those who seem to be ignorant of certain arts really have a
      knowledge of them before being instructed in them. And so it follows that
      either a man learns nothing or he learns what he already knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      In dealing with this problem he [Aristotle] does four things. First, he
      suggests that it cannot be settled unless we grant the truth established
      above, namely, that the conclusion which a person learns through
      demonstration or induction was already known, not absolutely, but as it
      was virtually known in its principles concerning which a person ignorant
      of a science can give true answers. However, according to Plato’s theory
      the conclusion was pre-known absolutely, so that no one learns afresh but
      is led to recall by some rational process of deduction. This is similar to
      Anaxagoras’ position on natural forms, namely, that before they are
      generated, they already pre-existed in the matter absolutely, whereas
      Aristotle says that they pre-exist in potency and not absolutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly (7100), he shows that the way some have answered Plato’s problem
      is false, namely, by saying that a conclusion is not in any sense known
      before it is demonstrated or learned by some method or other. For they
      might face the following objection based on Plato’s problem: If an
      unlearned person were asked by someone, “Do you know that every duo (pair)
      is an even number?” and, if upon answering that he does know this, he were
      presented with a duo which the person interrogated did not know existed,
      for example, the duo which is one third of six, the conclusion would be
      that he knew one third of six to be an even number, a fact which had not
      been known by him but which he learned through the demonstration proposed
      to him. And so it seems to follow that he either did not freshly learn
      this or that he learned what he already knew. To avoid this dilemma, they
      would answer that the person who was questioned and who answered that he
      knew every duo to be an equal number did not say that he knew every duo
      absolutely, but those he knew to be duo’s. Hence, since that duo which was
      proposed was utterly unknown to him, he did not in any sense know that
      this duo was an even number. And so it follows that when one knows the
      principles, the conclusion is not in any sense pre-known, either
      absolutely or in a qualified sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirdly (71bl), he refutes this solution in the following way: That is
      known, concerning which a demonstration is had, or concerning which a
      demonstration is for the first time received. And this is said on account
      of those learners who begin to know scientifically. But learners do not
      obtain a demonstration touching every duo they happen to know but every
      duo absolutely; and the same applies to every number or every triangle.
      Therefore, it is not true that he knows something about every number which
      he knows to be a number, or of every duo which he knows to be a duo, but
      he knows it about every one absolutely. And that he knows it not only of
      every number he happens to know is a number, but of every number
      absolutely, is proved at (71b5) on the ground that the conclusion agrees
      with the premises in its terms. For the subject and predicate of the
      conclusion are the major and minor extremes in the premises. But in the
      premises no proposition concerning number or straight line is stated with
      the addition, “which you know,” but it is stated of all without
      qualification. Neither, therefore, is the conclusion of the demonstration
      asserted with the aforesaid qualification, but it is asserted of all
      without reservation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fourthly (71b5), he presents the true solution of the problem under
      discussion in terms of the truth already established, saying that there is
      nothing to prevent a person from somehow knowing and somehow not knowing a
      fact before he learns it. For it is not a paradox if one somehow already
      knows what he learns, but it would be, if he already knew it in the same
      way that he knows it when he has learned it. For learning is, properly
      speaking, the generation of science in someone. But that which is
      generated was not, prior to its generation, a being absolutely, but
      somehow a being and somehow non-being: for it was a being in potency,
      although actually non-being. And this is what being generated consists in,
      namely, in being converted from potency to act. In like fashion, that
      which a person learns was not previously known absolutely, as Plato
      preferred; but neither was it absolutely unknown, as they maintained whose
      answer was refuted above. Rather it was known in potency, i.e., virtually,
      in the pre-known universal principles; however, it was not actually known
      in the sense of specific knowledge. And this is what learning consists in,
      namely, in being brought from potential or virtual or universal knowledge
      to specific and actual knowledge.<br /></p

    </p>
    <p>
      After indicating the need for the demonstrative syllogism, the Philosopher
      now begins to settle questions concerning the demonstrative syllogism
      itself. And his treatment is divided into two parts. In the first he
      determines concerning the demonstrative syllogism. In the second he
      determines concerning the middle from which the demonstrative syllogism
      proceeds (89b21) [Book II]. The first is divided into two parts. In the
      first he determines concerning the demonstrative syllogism in itself. In
      the second he compares demonstration to demonstration (85a12) [L. 37]. The
      first is divided into two parts. In the first he determines concerning the
      demonstrative syllogism. In the second he shows that one does not proceed
      to infinity in demonstrations (81b10) [L. 31] The first is divided into
      two parts. In the first he determines concerning the demonstrative
      syllogism through which we acquire science. In the second he shows how we
      also acquire ignorance through a syllogism (79b23) [L. 27]. Concerning the
      first he does three things. First, he determines concerning the
      demonstrative syllogism by showing what it is. Secondly, he determines
      concerning the matter of the demonstrative syllogism, pointing out the
      nature and character of the matter out of which it is formed (73a21) [L.
      9]. Thirdly, he determines concerning the form of the syllogism, pointing
      out the figure in which it is chiefly presented (79a17) [L. 26].
      Concerning the first he does three things. First, he shows what the
      demonstrative syllogism is. Secondly, he clarifies certain terms that
      appear in the definition of the demonstrative syllogism (72a8) [L. 5].
      Thirdly, he excludes certain errors that could arise from his doctrine on
      the nature of demonstration (755) [L. 7].
    </p>
    <p>
      In regard to the first it should be noted that in all things which exist
      for an end, the definition which employs a final cause is both the
      explanation of the definition which expresses the material cause, and is
      the middle which proves the latter. For the reason why a house should made
      of stone and wood is that it is a structure protecting us from the cold
      and heat. Along these lines, therefore, he gives two definitions
      demonstration, one of which is expressed in terms of the end of
      demonstration, which is to know in a scientific manner. And from this one
      is concluded the other, which is drawn from the matter of a demonstration.
      Hence he does three things in regard to this. First, he defines what it is
      to know in a scientific manner. Secondly, he defines demonstration in
      terms of its end, which is to know in a scientific manner (71b18).
      Thirdly, from these two definitions he concludes to that definition of
      demonstration which is expressed in terms of the matter of demonstration
      (71b19).
    </p>
    <p>
      Concerning the first he does five things. First (71b8), he determines what
      the scientific knowing, which he intends to define, bears upon. And in
      regard to this it should be recognized that we are said to know something
      in a scientific manner absolutely, when we know it in itself. On the other
      hand, we are said to know something in a scientific manner qualifiedly,
      when we know it in something else in which it exists either as a part in a
      whole (as we are said to know a wall through knowing the house), or as an
      accident in its subject (as in knowing Coriscus we are said to know who is
      coming toward us), or as an effect in its cause (as in the example given
      earlier, we know the conclusion in the principles), or indeed in any
      fashion similar to these. To know in these ways is to know incidentally,
      because we are said to know that which is somehow accidental to what is
      known of itself. However, what the Philosopher intends to define here is
      scientific knowing in the strict sense and not according to an accident.
      For this form of knowing is sophistical, since Sophists use a form of
      argument typified by the following: “I know Coriscus; Coriscus is coming
      toward me: therefore, I know the person coming toward me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Then (71b10) he presents the definition of scientific knowing in the
      strict sense. Apropos of this it should be noted that to know something
      scientifically is to know it completely, which means to apprehend its
      truth perfectly. For the principles of a thing’s being are the same as
      those of its truth, as is stated in <i>Metaphysics</i> II. Therefore, the
      scientific knower, if he is to know perfectly, must know the cause of the
      thing known; hence he says, “when we think that we know the cause”
      (71b10). But if he were to know the cause by itself, he would not yet know
      the effect actually—which would be to know it absolutely—but only
      virtually, which is the same as knowing in a qualified sense and
      incidentally. Consequently, one who knows scientifically in the full sense
      must know the application of the cause to the effect; hence he adds, “as
      the cause of that fact” (71b11). Again, because science is also sure and
      certain knowledge of a thing, whereas a thing that could be otherwise
      cannot be known with certainty, it is further required that what is
      scientifically known could not be otherwise. To repeat: because science is
      perfect knowledge, lie says, “Men we think that we know the cause”; but
      because the knowledge through which we know scientifically in the full
      sense is actual, he adds, “as the cause of that fact.” Finally, because it
      is certain knowledge, he adds, “and that the fact could not be other than
      it is (71b11).”
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirdly (71b12), he explains the definition he laid down, appealing to the
      fact that both those who know scientifically and those who do not know in
      that way but believe that they do, take scientific knowing to be as above
      described. For those who do not know in a scientific manner but believe
      that they do, are convinced that they know in the manner described,
      whereas those who know in a scientific manner do know in the manner
      described. Furthermore, this is the proper way to manifest a definition.
      For a definition is the notion which a name signifies, as it is stated in
      <i>Metaphysics</i> IV. But the signification of a name must be based on
      what is generally meant by those who employ the name. Hence it is stated
      in <i>Topics</i> II that names must be used as the majority of people use
      them. Again, careful consideration would indicate that this explanation
      seems rather to show what the name signifies than to signify something
      directly. For he does not explain science, concerning which a definition
      could, properly speaking, be formed, since it is a species of some genus;
      rather he explains scientific knowing. Hence at the very beginning he
      said, “We suppose ourselves to possess unqualified scientific knowledge”
      (71b8) and not that scientific knowledge is such and such.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fourthly (71b14), he draws a corollary from the definition, namely, that
      that of which there is unqualified scientific knowledge must be something
      necessary, i.e., which cannot be otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fifthly (71b16), he answers a tacit question, namely, whether there is
      another way of knowing scientifically in addition to the way described
      here. And he promises to discuss this later. For it is possible to know
      scientifically through an effect, as will be explained below (cf. L. 23).
      Furthermore, there is a sense in which we are said to know scientifically
      the indemonstrable principles to which no cause is ascribed. But the
      proper and perfect manner of knowing scientifically is the one we have
      described.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then (71b17) he defines the demonstrative syllogism in terms of its end,
      which is to know in a scientific manner. In regard to this he does three
      things. First, he asserts that scientific knowing is the end of a
      demonstrative syllogism or is its effect, since to know scientifically
      seems to b nothing less than to understand the truth of a conclusion
      through demonstration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly (71b18), he defines demonstration in terms of the end, saying
      that a demonstration is a sciential syllogism, i.e., producing scientific
      knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirdly (71b18), he explains, “sciential,” saying that a sciential
      syllogism is one according to which we know scientifically insofar as we
      understand it, and not in the sense of a syllogism yielding knowledge to
      be put to use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then (71b19) he concludes from the foregoing a definition of the
      demonstrative syllogism that is based on its matter. Concerning this he
      does two things. First, he concludes it. Secondly, he clarifies it
      (71b24).
    </p>
    <p>
      Concerning the first he does three things. First (71b20), he sets forth
      the consequent in which the material definition of demonstration is
      concluded from the premises laid down above. And he says that if
      scientific knowing is what we have stated it to be, namely, knowing the
      cause of a thing, etc., then it is necessary that demonstrative science,
      i.e., science acquired through demonstration, proceed from propositions
      which are true, first, and immediate, i.e., not demonstrated by some other
      mid but clear in virtue of themselves (they are called “immediate,”
      inasmuch as they do not have a middle demonstrating them, but “first,” in
      relation to other propositions which are proved through them); and which,
      furthermore, are better known than, prior to, and causes of, the
      conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly (71b22), he justifies himself for not adding another element
      which, it might seem, should be added, namely, that demonstration proceeds
      from <i>proper</i> principles. But he says that this is understood in
      virtue of the elements he did state. For since the propositions of a
      demonstration are causes of the conclusion, they must be its proper
      principles. For effects require proportionate causes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirdly (71b23), he manifests the necessity of the aforesaid consequence,
      saying that although a syllogism does not require these conditions in the
      premises from which it concludes, a demonstration does require them, for
      otherwise it would not produce science.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then (71b24) he explains this definition as well as the subsequent
      statement that unless these conditions are fulfilled in a demonstration it
      cannot beget science. First, therefore, he shows that a demonstration must
      proceed from true principles in order to beget science, because there
      cannot be scientific knowledge of that which does not exist, for example,
      that the diagonal is symmetrical, i.e., commensurable with the side of the
      square. For those quantities are said to be incommensurable which lack a
      common measuring unit. These are quantities whose ratio to one another
      cannot be expressed in terms of one number to another number. That this is
      the case with the diagonal of a square and its side is plain from Euclid’s
      sixteenth proposition. Now what is not true does not exist, for
      <i>to be</i> and <i>to be true</i> are convertible. Therefore, anything
      scientifically known must be true. Consequently, the conclusion of a
      demonstration which does beget scientific knowing must be true, and
      <i>a fortiori</i> its premises. For the true cannot be known in a
      scientific way from the false, although something true can follow as a
      conclusion from something false, as he will show later (cf. Lecture 13).
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly (71b27), he shows that the demonstration is composed of first and
      immediate or indemonstrable principles. For no one can possess scientific
      knowledge unless he possesses the demonstration of things that can be
      demonstrated—“and I am speaking <i>per se</i> and not
      <i>per accidens</i>.” He says this because it would be possible to know
      some conclusion without having a demonstration of the premises, even were
      they demonstrable; because one would know it through other principles, and
      this would be accidental.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose, therefore, that a demonstrator syllogizes from demonstrable,
      i.e., mediate, premises. Now he either possesses a demonstration of those
      premises or he does not. If he does not, then he does not know the
      premises in a scientific way; nor consequently, the conclusion because of
      the premises. But if he does possess their demonstration, then, since one
      may not proceed to infinity in demonstrations, principles immediate and
      indemonstrable must be reached. And so it is required that demonstration
      proceed from principles that are immediate either straightway or through
      middles. Hence it is stated in <i>Topics</i> I that demonstration is
      composed of first and true statements or of statements made credible by
      these.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirdly (71b29), he proves that the propositions of a demonstration are
      the causes of the conclusion, because we know in a scientific manner when
      we know the causes. And in virtue of this he shows that they are prior and
      better known, because every cause is by nature prior and better known than
      its effect. However, the cause of a demonstrated conclusion must be better
      known not only with respect to the knowledge of what it is, but also with
      respect to the knowledge that it is. For in order to demonstrate that
      there is an eclipse of the sun, it is not enough to know, that the moon is
      interposed; in addition it is necessary to know that the moon is
      interposed between the sun and the earth. Again, because prior i and
      better known are taken in two ways, namely, in reference to us and
      according to nature, he says that the things from which a demonstration,
      proceeds are prior and better known absolutely and according to nature,
      and not in reference to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      To elucidate this he says that “those things are prior and better known
      absolutely,” which are farthest from sense, as are universals; but “the
      prior and better known in reference to us” are nearest to sense, namely,
      the singulars, which are opposed to universals in the way that the prior
      and the later are opposite, or in the way that the nearest and the
      farthest are opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, it seems that the contrary of this is found in <i>Physics</i> I
      where it is stated that universals are prior in reference to us and later
      according to nature. But it should be said that there [in the
      <i>Posterior Analytics</i> ] he is speaking of the order of singular to
      universal absolutely; and this order must be taken according to the order
      of sensitive and intellectual knowledge in us. Now in us sensitive
      knowledge is prior to intellectual, because intellectual knowledge in us
      proceeds from sense. For this reason the singular is prior and better
      known in relation to us than the universal. But in <i>Physics</i> I he is
      not speaking of the order of the universal to the singular absolutely but
      of the order of the <i>more</i> universal to the <i>less</i> universal,
      for example of animal to man. In this case the more universal is prior and
      better known in reference to us. For in every instance of generation, that
      which is in potency is prior in time but is later according to nature;
      whereas that which is complete in act is prior by nature but later in
      time. Now one’s knowledge of a genus is, as it were, potential in
      comparison to one’s knowledge of the species in which all the essentials
      of a thing are actually known. Hence, too, in the generation of our
      science, knowledge of the more common precedes knowledge of the less
      common.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, in the <i>Physics</i> it is stated that it is natural for us to
      proceed from what is better known to us. Therefore, it seems that a
      demonstration is composed not of things that are prior absolutely but in
      reference to But it must be said that here he is speaking according to the
      fact that what is in the sense is better known in reference to us than
      what is in the intellect; but there he was speaking according to the fact
      that what is better known in reference to us is also in the intellect. But
      demonstrations do not proceed from singulars which are in the sense but
      only from universals, which are in the intellect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or it might be said that in every demonstration one must proceed from
      things better known to us, provided they are not singulars but universals.
      For something is made known to us only by that which is more known to us.
      But sometimes that which is more known in reference to us is also more
      known absolutely and according to nature, as happens in mathematics where
      on account of abstraction from matter the demonstrations proceed from
      formal principles alone. In this case the demonstrations proceed from
      things which are more known absolutely. But sometimes that which is more
      known in reference to us is not more known absolutely, as happens in
      natural sciences where the essences and powers of things are hidden,
      because they are in matter, but are disclosed to us through the things
      which appear outwardly. Hence in these sciences the demonstrations are for
      the most part made through effects which are better known in reference to
      us but not absolutely. But he is not now speaking of this form of
      demonstration, but of the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, because in his explanation he neglected to point out that
      demonstration should proceed from proper principles, he hastens to add
      that this fact is easily ascertainable from what he did say. For from the
      fact that he stated that demonstration is from things which are first, it
      follows that it is from proper principles, as he stated above. For “first”
      and “principle” seem to be the same: for that which is first and highest
      in each genus is the cause of all the things that are after it, as it is
      stated in <i>Metaphysics</i> II.

    </p>
    <p>
      Because the Philosopher had stated above that demonstration is from “first
      and immediate principles,” but had not yet identified them, he now sets
      out to identify them. And this is divided into three parts. In the first
      part he shows what an immediate proposition is. In the second part he
      shows that such propositions must be better known than the conclusion
      (72a25) [L. 6]. In the third part he excludes certain errors which arose
      from the foregoing (72b5) [L. 7]. Concerning the first he does two things.
      First, he shows what an immediate principle is. Secondly, h divides them
      (72a15).
    </p>
    <p>
      With respect to the first he proceeds this way. First (72a8), he recall,
      what has been said above, namely, that a principle of demonstration I, an
      immediate proposition, for he had also stated above that a demonstration
      is composed of things which are first and immediate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly (<i>ibid.</i>), he defines the immediate proposition and says
      that a immediate proposition is one which has no other one prior to it.
      the reason underlying this description is clear from what has been said.
      For it has been said above that demonstration is composed of things that,
      are prior. Accordingly, whenever a proposition is mediate, i.e., has a
      middle through which the predicate is demonstrated of its subject, it is
      required that there be prior propositions by which this one is
      demonstrated. For the predicate of a conclusion is present in the middle
      previously to being present in the subject; in which, however, the middle
      is present before the predicate is. Therefore, it follows that that
      proposition which does not have some other one prior to it is immediate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirdly (720), he shows what is the nature of the proposition which is
      mentioned in the definition of an immediate proposition. Concerning this
      he does three things:
    </p>
    <p>
      First, he defines absolutely what a proposition is, saying that it is one
      or the other part of an enunciation in which one thing is predicated of
      one thing. For the enunciation has two parts, namely, affirmation and
      negation. For anyone who syllogizes must propose one or the other of these
      parts but not both, for this latter procedure is characteristic of one who
      first raises a question. (Hence it is on this basis that proposition is
      distinguished from a problem). For just as one and only one thing is
      concluded in one syllogism, so the proposition which is a principle of the
      syllogism should be one—and it is one if one thing is stated of one thing.
      Hence in asserting that it is “one of one,” he distinguishes the
      proposition from the enunciation which is said to be “of several,” whether
      sundry things are said of one thing or of one thing sundry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly (72a10), he lays down the difference between the dialectical and
      the demonstrative proposition, saying that whereas the demonstrative
      proposition takes one definite side of a question, the dialectical takes
      either side indifferently. For since dialectic begins with the probable,
      it can lead to each side of a contradiction. Hence when it lays down its
      propositions, it employs both parts of a contradiction and presents them
      in the form of a question [Is an animal that walks on its feet a man, or
      not?]. But a demonstrative proposition takes one side definitively,
      because a demonstrator never has any other alternative but to demonstrate
      the truth. Hence in forming its propositions he always assumes the true
      side of a contradiction [An animal which walks on two feet is a man, is it
      not?]. On this account he does not ask but posits something as known in
      the demonstration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirdly (72a11), he defines the term, “enunciation,” which appeared in the
      definition of a proposition, saying that an enunciation embraces both
      sides of a contradiction, as is clear from what has been said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he shows what contradiction is, saying that contradiction is a form
      of opposition between whose parts there is of itself no middle. For
      although between privation and possession and between immediate contraries
      there is no middle in a given subject, nevertheless, absolutely speaking,
      there is one; for a stone is neither blind nor seeing, and something white
      is neither even nor odd. Furthermore, whatever immediacy they have in
      relation to a definite subject is traced to their participation in
      contradiction, for privation is negation in a definite subject; and of two
      things that are immediately contrary, one has some of the marks of
      privation. But contradiction in the full sense lacks a middle in all
      cases. And this belongs to it of its very nature and not in virtue of
      something else. Hence he says that of itself it has no medium.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then explains what the parts of a contradiction are. For contradiction
      is an opposition of affirmation and negation; hence one of its parts is
      affirmation, which asserts something of something, and the other is
      negation, which denies something of something.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then (72a15) he divides immediate principle. Concerning this he does two
      things. First, he divides. Secondly, he subdivides (72a19).
    </p>
    <p>
      He says therefore first (7205), that there are two types of immediate
      principles of a syllogism: the first is called a “position” [thesis] and
      is said to be immediate because one does not demonstrate (neither is it
      required that the student, i.e., the one being instructed in the
      demonstrative science, have it, i.e., advert to it or assent to it); the
      other is called a “dignity” or “maxim,” which anyone who is to be
      instructed must have in his mind and assent to. That there are such
      principles is clear from <i>Metaphysics</i> IV, where it is proved that
      one such is the principle that “affirmation and negation are not
      simultaneously true,” for no one can believe the contrary of this in his
      mind ‘ even though he should state it orally. To such principles we give
      the aforesaid name of “dignity” or “maxim” on account of their certainty
      in manifesting other things.
    </p>
    <p>
      To clarify this division it should be noted that any proposition whose
      predicate is included within the notion of its subject is immediate and
      known in virtue of itself as it stands. However, in the case of some of
      these propositions the terms are such that they are understood by
      everyone, as <i>being</i> and <i>one</i> and those other notions that are
      characteristic of being precisely as being: for <i>being</i> is the first
      concept in the intellect. Hence it is necessary that propositions of this
      kind be held as known in virtue of themselves not only as they stand but
      also in reference to us. Examples of these are the propositions that “It
      does not occur that the same thing is and is not” and that “The whole is
      greater than its part,” and others like these. Hence all the sciences take
      principles of this kind from metaphysics whose task it is to consider
      being absolutely and the characteristics of being.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, there are some immediate propositions whose terms are
      not known by everyone. Hence, although their predicate may be included in
      the very notion of their subject, yet because the definition of the
      subject is not known to everyone, it is not necessary that such
      propositions be conceded by everyone. (Thus the proposition, “All right
      angles are equal,” is in itself a proposition which is immediate and known
      in virtue of itself, because equality appears in the definition of a right
      angle. For a right angle is one which a straight line form when it meets
      another straight line in such a way that the angles on each side are
      equal). Therefore, such principles are received as being posited or laid
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is yet another way, and according to it certain propositions are
      called “suppositions.” For there are some propositions which can be proved
      only by the principles of some other science; therefore, they must be
      supposed in the one science, although they are proved by the principles of
      the other science. Thus the geometer supposes that he can draw one
      straight line from one point to another, but the philosopher of nature
      proves it by showing that there is one straight line between any two
      points.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then (72a19) he subdivides a member of the original division, namely,
      “position,” and says that there is one type of position which takes one
      side of an enunciation, namely, either affirmation or negation. He refers
      to this type when he says, “i.e., asserts either the existence or
      non-existence of a subject.” Such a position is called a “supposition” or
      “hypothesis,” because it is accepted as having truth. Another type of
      position is the one which does not signify existence or non-existence: in
      this way a definition is a position. For the definition of “one” is laid
      down in arithmetic as a principle, namely, that “one is the quantitatively
      indivisible.” Nevertheless a definition is not called a supposition, for a
      supposition, strictly speaking, is a statement which signifies the true or
      the false. Consequently, he adds that “the definition of ‘one,”’ inasmuch
      as it signifies neither the true nor the false, “is not the same as ‘to be
      one,”’ which does signify the true or the false.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it might be asked how it is that definition is set down as a member of
      the subdivision of immediate proposition, if a definition is not a
      proposition signifying either existence or non-existence. One might answer
      that in this subdivision he was not subdividing immediate proposition but,
      immediate principle. Or one might answer that although a definition as
      such is not an actual proposition, it is one virtually, because once a
      definition is known, it becomes clear that it is truly predicated of the
      subject.

    </p>
    <p>
      After showing what immediate principles are, the Philosopher now
      determines concerning our knowledge of them. Apropos of this he does two
      things. First, he shows that immediate principles are better known than
      the conclusion. Secondly, that the falsity of their contraries ought to be
      most evident (72a38).
    </p>
    <p>
      Concerning the first he does three things. First (72a25), he states his
      proposition and says that because we give our assent to a thing which has
      been concluded and we know it scientifically precisely because we have a
      demonstrative syllogism (and this insofar as we know the demonstrative
      syllogism in a scientific way), it is necessary not only to know the first
      principles of the conclusion beforehand, but also to know them better than
      we know the conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      He adds, “either all or some,” because some principles require proof in
      order to be known; so that before they are proved, they are not better
      known than the conclusion. Thus the fact that an exterior angle of a
      triangle is equal to its two opposite interior angles is, until proved, as
      unknown as the fact that a triangle has three angles equal to two right
      angles. But there are other principles which, once they are posited, are
      better known than the conclusion. Or, in another way, there are some
      conclusions which are most evident; for example, those based on sense
      perception, as that the sun is eclipsed. Hence the principle through which
      this is proved is not better known absolutely—the principle being that the
      moon is between the sun and the earth—although it is better known within
      the reasoning process that goes from cause to effect. Or, in another way,
      he says this because he had said above that in the order of time certain
      principles are known before the conclusion, but others are known along
      with the conclusion at the same moment of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly (72a28), he proves his proposition in two ways: first, with an
      ostensive argument, thus: That in virtue of which something is so, is
      itself more so; for example, if we love someone because of someone else,
      as a master because of his disciple, we love the disciple more. But we
      know conclusions and give our assent to them because of the principles.
      Therefore, we know the principles with more conviction and give them
      stronger assent than the conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apropos of this reason it should be noted that a cause is always more
      noble than its effect. When, therefore, cause and effect have the same
      name, that name is said principally of the cause rather than of the
      effect; thus fire is primarily called hot rather than things heated by
      fire. But sometimes the name of the effect is not attributed to the cause.
      In that case, although the name the effect has does not belong to the
      cause, nevertheless, something more noble belongs to it. For example,
      although the sun does not possess heat, nevertheless, there is in it a
      certain power which is the principle of heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then (72a33) he proves the same thing with a principle which leads to an
      impossibility. He reasons thus: Principles are known prior to the
      conclusion, as has been shown above; consequently, when the principles are
      known, the conclusion is not yet known. If, therefore, the principles were
      not more known than the conclusion, it would follow that a man would know
      things he does not know either as well as or better than the things he
      does know. But this is impossible. Therefore, it is also impossible that
      the principles not be better known than the conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phrase by phrase this is explained in the following manner: “A man who
      knows scientifically or even one who knows in a way superior to this, if
      such there be,” (he says this, having in mind the person who has the
      intuition of principles, a state he has not yet explained), “cannot give
      more credence to things he does not know than to things he does know. But
      this will be the case if one who assents to a conclusion obtained through
      demonstration did not foreknow,” i.e., did not know the principles better.
      In Greek it is stated more clearly: “But no one, whether he has scientific
      knowledge or that form of knowledge which is better than the scientific
      (if there be such), can believe anything more firmly than the things he
      knows.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirdly (7206), he clarifies what he had said, saying that his statement
      to the effect that it is more necessary to believe the principles (either
      all or some) than the conclusion should be understood as referring to a
      person who is to acquire a discipline through demonstration. For if the
      conclusion were more known through some other source, such as
      sense-perception, nothing would preclude the principles not being better
      known than the conclusion in that case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then (72a38) he shows that it is not only necessary to know the principles
      more than the demonstrative conclusion, but nothing should be more certain
      than the fact that the opposites of the principles are false. And this
      because the scientific knower must not disbelieve the principles, but
      assent to them most firmly. But anyone who doubts the falseness of one of
      two opposites cannot assent firmly to the other, because he will always
      fear that the opposite one might be true.

    </p>
    <p>
      After determining about the knowledge of the principles of demonstration,
      the Philosopher now excludes the errors which have arisen from these
      determinations. Concerning this he does three things. First, he states the
      errors. Secondly, the reasons they erred (72b8). Thirdly, he removes the
      roots of these reasons (72b 18).
    </p>
    <p>
      He says therefore first (72b5), that two contrary errors have arisen from
      one of the truths established above. For it has been established above
      that the principles of demonstration must be known and must be even better
      known. But the first of these is sufficient for our purpose. For some,
      basing themselves on this first statement, have come to believe that there
      is no science of anything, whereas others believe that there is science,
      even to the extent of believing that there is science of everything
      through demonstration. But neither of these positions is true and neither
      follows necessarily from their reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then (72b8) he presents the reasons why they have fallen into these
      errors. And first of all he presents the reason given by those who say
      that there is no science, and it is this: The principles of demonstration
      either proceed to infinity or there is a halt somewhere. But if there is a
      process to infinity, nothing in that process can be taken as being first,
      because one cannot exhaust an infinite series and reach what is first.
      Consequently, it is not possible to know what is first. (They are correct
      in thus arguing, for the later things cannot be known unless the prior
      ones are known).
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, if there is a halt in the principles, then even so, the
      first things are still not known, if the only way to know scientifically
      is through demonstration. For first things do not have prior principles
      through which they are demonstrated. But if the first things are not
      known, it follows again that the later things are not known in the strict
      and proper sense, but only on condition that there are principles. For it
      is not possible for something to be known in virtue of something not
      known, except on condition that that unknown be a principle. So in either
      case, whether the principles stop or go on to infinity, it follows that
      there is no science of anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly (72b15), he presents the reasoning of those who say that there is
      science of everything through demonstration, because to their there is
      science of everything through demonstration, because to their basic
      premise-the only way to know scientifically is by demonstration—they added
      another, namely, that one may demonstrate circularly. From these premises
      it followed that even if a limit is reached in the series of the
      principles of demonstration, the first principles are still known through
      demonstration, because, they said, those principles were demonstrated by
      previous ones. For a circular demonstration is one which is reciprocal,
      i.e., something which was first a principle is later a conclusion, and
      vice versa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then (72b18) he cuts away the false bases of these arguments. First, their
      supposition that the only way to know scientifically is by demonstration.
      Secondly, their statement that it is legitimate to demonstrate circularly
      (72b25).
    </p>
    <p>
      He says therefore first (72b18), that not all scientific knowledge is
      demonstrative, i.e., obtained through demonstration, but the scientific
      knowledge of immediate principles is indemonstrable, i.e., not obtained by
      demonstration. However, it should be noted that Aristotle is here taking
      <i>science</i> in a wide sense to include any knowledge that is certain,
      and not in the sense in which science is set off against understanding,
      according to the dictum that science deals with conclusions and
      understanding [intuition] with principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that it is necessary for some things to be held as certain without
      demonstration he proves in the following way: It is necessary that the
      prior things from which a demonstration proceeds be known in a scientific
      way. Furthermore, these must be ultimately reduced to something immediate;
      otherwise one would be forced to admit that there is an actual infinitude
      of middles between two extremes—in this case between the subject and
      predicate. Again, one would have to admit that no two extremes could be
      found between which there would not be an infinitude of middles. But as it
      is, the middles are such that it is possible to find two things which are
      immediate. But immediate principles, being prior, must be indemonstrable.
      Thus it is clear that it is necessary for some things to be scientifically
      known without demonstration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, if someone were to ask how the science of immediate principles
      is possessed, the answer would be that not only are they known in a
      scientific manner, but knowledge of them is the source of an science. For
      one passes from the knowledge of principles to a demonstration of
      conclusion on which science, properly speaking, bears. But those immediate
      principles are not made known through an additional middle but through an
      understanding of their own terms. For as soon as it is known what a whole
      is and what a part is, it is known that every whole is greater than its
      part, because in such a proposition, as has been stated above, the
      predicate is included in the very notion of the subject. And therefore it
      is reasonable that the knowledge of these principles is the cause of the
      knowledge of conclusions, because always, that which exists in virtue of
      itself is the cause of that which exists in virtue of something else.<br /></p

        THE SECOND ERROR IS EXCLUDED BY SHOWING THAT CIRCULAR DEMONSTRATION IS

    </p>
    <p>
      After excluding one false basis by showing that not all science depends on
      demonstration, the Philosopher now excludes another by showing that it is
      not possible to demonstrate circularly.
    </p>
    <p>
      To understand this it should be noted that a demonstration is circular
      when the conclusion and one of the premises (in converted form) of a
      syllogism are used to prove the other premise. For example, we might form
      the following syllogism:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dd>Every rational mortal animal is risible;</dd>
      <dd>Every man is a rational mortal animal:</dd>
      <dd>
        Therefore, every man is risible.
        <p>
          Now if the conclusion were to be used as one principle and the minor
          in converted form as the other, we would get:
          <dd>Every man is risible;</dd>
          <dd>Every rational mortal animal is a man:</dd>
          <dd>
            Therefore, every rational mortal animal is risible—which was the
            major of the first syllogism.
            <p>
              Accordingly, he. presents three arguments to show that it is not
              possible to demonstrate circularly. The first of these (72b25) is
              this: In a circular syllogism the same thing is at once a
              conclusion and a principle. But a principle of a demonstration is
              prior to and better known than the conclusion, as has been shown
              above. Therefore, it follows that a same thing is both prior to
              and subsequent to one same thing, and also more known and less
              known. But this is impossible. Therefore, it is impossible to
              demonstrate circularly.
            </p>
            <p>
              But someone might say that a same thing can be both prior and
              subsequent, although not in the same way. For example, this might
              be prior in reference to us, but that prior absolutely. Thus
              singulars are prior in reference to us and subsequent absolutely:
              and conversely for universals. Again, induction makes something
              known in one way and demonstration in another way. For
              demonstration proceeds from things that are prior absolutely, but
              induction from things that are prior in reference to us.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now if a circular demonstration were so constructed that something
              is first concluded from things that are absolutely prior, and then
              from things that are prior in reference to us, it would follow
              that our doctrine on scientific knowing was not well established.
              For we stated that to know scientifically is to know the cause of
              a thing. From this it followed that a demonstration which causes
              scientific knowledge must proceed from the absolutely prior. But
              if demonstration were at one time to proceed from the absolutely
              prior and at another time from things which are prior in reference
              to us, we would be forced to admit that scientific knowing is not
              confined to knowing the cause of a thing, but that there is
              another, namely, that form of knowing which proceeds from what is
              later. Therefore, one must either admit both or admit that the
              second form, namely, the demonstration which proceeds from what is
              better known to us is not a demonstration in the absolute sense.
            </p>
            <p>
              The aforesaid also reveals why a dialectical syllogism can be
              circular. For it proceeds from things which are probable. But
              things are said to be probable if they are better known to the
              wise or to a great number of persons. Consequently, a dialectical
              syllogism proceeds from things that are better known to us.
              However, it happens that a same thing is better known to some and
              less known to others. Consequently, there is nothing to hinder a
              dialectical syllogism from being circular. But a demonstration is
              formed from things that are absolutely prior. Therefore, as we
              have already stated, there cannot be circular demonstration.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then he sets forth the second argument (72b33) and it is this: If
              there were circular demonstration, it would follow that a same
              thing is demonstrated by the same thing, as if I were to say: If
              it is this, it is this. In this way it is easy for anyone to
              demonstrate everything, for anyone, wis(or ignorant, will be able
              to do this. Accordingly, science is not acquired through
              demonstration. But this is against the definition of
              demonstration. Therefore, there cannot be circular demonstration.
            </p>
            <p>
              He proves the truth of the first consequence in the following way:
              It is obvious, first of all, that with a circular demonstration
              the same thing is proved by a same thing, as has been stated
              above, i.e., if only three terms are employed; although it makes
              no difference whether the reflexion be made with fewer terms or
              more. (By <i>reflexion</i> he means the process whereby one goes
              from principle to conclusion in a demonstration, and then from
              conclusion to principle). In such a reflexion it makes no
              difference, so far as the force of the argument is concerned,
              whether it involves several or fewer terms or even two. For an
              argument has the same force if one proceeds thus: “If it is A, it
              is B, and if it is B, it is C, and if it is C, it is D,” and then
              by reflecting continues, “If it is D, it is C, and if it is C, it
              is B, and if it is B, it is A”; or if he proceeds by reflecting at
              the very start, saying: “If it is A, it is B, and if it is B, it
              is A.” (Although he spoke above of three terms, he restricted
              himself to two terms in this example, because in the deduction he
              is about to make he will use a third term, which is the same as
              the first).
            </p>
            <p>
              Then (72b38) he gives the form of the argument in three terms,
              namely: “If it is A, it is B, and if it is B, it is C; therefore,
              if it is A, it is of necessity C.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Then (73a1) he shows by the aforesaid form of arguing that in a
              circular demonstration a same thing is proved by a same thing,
              using only two terms. For it consists in saying, “If it is A, it
              is B,” and then reflecting, “If it is B, it is A”—which is a
              circular demonstration. Now according to the above given form it
              follows from these two, that “if it is A, it is A.”
            </p>
            <p>
              That it does follow is obvious: for just as in the first deduction
              which involved three terms’ C followed from B, so in the reflex
              deduction of two terms, A followed from B. Let us suppose, then,
              that the A of the second deduction, i.e., the reflex, signifies
              the same thing that C signified in the first, i.e., in the direct
              deduction which was composed of three terms. Therefore, to state
              in the second deduction that “if it is B it is A” is to state the
              same thing as was stated in the first deduction, namely, that “if
              it is B, it is C.” But when it was stated in the first deduction
              that “if it is B, it is C,” it followed that “if it is A, it is
              C.” Therefore, in the circular deduction it follows that “if it is
              A, it is A,” since C is assumed to be the same as A. In this way,
              it will be easy to demonstrate all things, as has been said.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then he presents the third argument (73a6) which is this: Those
              who suppose that everything can be known through demonstration on
              the ground that demonstration is circular, must grant that
              anything can be demonstrated by a circular demonstration and, as a
              consequence, grant that in a circular demonstration each of the
              premises can be concluded from the conclusion. However, the only
              cases in which this can be done are those in which mutual
              conversion is possible, i.e., in things that are convertible, as
              properties. But not all things are so related. Therefore, it is
              ridiculous to say that everything can be demonstrated on the
              ground that there are such things as circular demonstrations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now the reason is obvious why in a circular demonstration all the
              propositions must be convertible. For it has been shown in the
              book of <i>Prior Analytics</i> that if one thing is laid down,
              another does not follow of necessity, whether the thing laid down
              be one term or one proposition. For every syllogism must start
              with three terms and two propositions as a minimum. Therefore, in
              a circular demonstration three terms which are convertible must be
              taken, namely, A, B, C, such that A is in every B and in every C,
              and these, namely, B and C, must inhere in each other, so that
              every B is C and every C is B, and also inhere in A so that every
              A is B and every A is C. And so, the terms being thus related, it
              is possible, when using the first figure, to derive any one from
              any two circularly, i.e., the conclusion from two premises and
              each premise from the conclusion and the remaining premise, as we
              pointed out in the <i>Prior Analytics</i>, where we treated the
              syllogism formally.
            </p>
            <p>
              The way it is done is this: take the three convertible terms,
              “risible,” “rational mortal animal” and “man,” and form the
              syllogism:
              <dd>Every rational mortal animal is risible;</dd>
              <dd>Every man is a rational mortal animal:</dd>
              <dd>
                Therefore, every man is risible.
                <p>
                  Then from the conclusion it is possible to conclude both the
                  major and the minor; the major thus:
                  <dd>Every man is risible;</dd>
                  <dd>But every rational mortal animal is a man:</dd>
                  <dd>
                    Therefore, every rational mortal animal is risible
                    <p>
                      and the minor thus:
                      <dd>Every risible is a rational mortal animal;</dd>
                      <dd>But every man is risible:</dd>
                    </p>
                  </dd>
                </p>
              </dd>
            </p>
          </dd>
        </p>
      </dd>
    </dl></a

  <dl>
    <dd>
      <a name="8" id="8"
        >Therefore, every man is a rational mortal animal.
        <p>
          However, it has also been proved in the <i>Prior Analytics</i> that in
          figures other than the first, namely, in the second and third, one
          cannot form a circular syllogism, i.e., one through which each of the
          premises can be syllogized from the conclusion; or if one is formed,
          it is done not by using the premises already used but by using
          propositions other than those which appear in the first syllogism.
        </p>
        <p>
          That this is so is obvious. For the second figure always yields a
          negative conclusion. Consequently, one premise must be affirmative and
          the other negative. However, it is true that if both are negative,
          nothing can be concluded; and if both are affirmative, a negative
          conclusion cannot follow. Therefore, it is not possible to use the
          negative conclusion and the negative premise to obtain the affirmative
          premise as a conclusion. Hence, if this affirmative is to be proved,
          it must be proved through propositions other than the ones originally
          used. Again, in the third figure the only conclusion ever obtained is
          particular. However, at least one premise must be universal;
          furthermore, if either premise is particular, a universal cannot be
          concluded. Hence it cannot occur that in the third figure each of the
          premises can be syllogized from the conclusion and the remaining
          premise.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the same reasons it is obvious that such a circular syllogism
          (through which each premise could be concluded) cannot be formed in
          the first figure except in the first mode, which is the only one that
          concludes to a universal affirmative. Furthermore, even in this mode
          the only case in which a circular syllogism could be formed such that
          each of the premises could be concluded, is when the three terms
          employed are equal, i.e., convertible. The proof is this: The premise
          must be concluded from the conclusion and the converse of the other
          premise, as has been stated. But such a conversion of each premise is
          impossible (for each is universal), except when the terms happen to be
          equal.<br /></p

          After showing what a demonstrative syllogism is, the Philosopher in
          this section begins to show the nature and characteristics of the
          things that comprise a demonstration. Concerning this he does three
          things. First, he connects this with what has already been
          established. Secondly, he explains certain matters that must be
          understood first (73a25). Thirdly, he establishes what he had in mind,
          namely, to show what and of what sort are the things that constitute a
          syllogism (74b5) [L. 12].
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (73a21), that since the definition of
          scientific knowledge given above spoke of that which cannot be
          otherwise, that which is scientifically known through demonstration
          will be necessary. Then he explains what it is to know something in a
          scientific way through demonstration, saying that demonstrative
          science is “what we possess in having a demonstration,” i.e., what we
          acquire through demonstration. Consequently, it follows that the
          conclusion of a demonstration is necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now although the necessary could be syllogized from the contingent, it
          is not possible through a contingent middle to obtain scientific
          knowledge of the necessary, as will be proved later. Furthermore,
          because the conclusion. of a demonstration is not only necessary, but,
          as has been said, is known through demonstration, it follows that a
          demonstrative syllogism proceeds from necessary things. Consequently,
          we must establish from what and from what sort of necessary things a
          demonstration proceeds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (73a25) he interjects certain things that must be understood as
          preliminaries to the matters to be discussed. Apropos of these he does
          two things:
        </p>
        <p>
          First, he states his intention (73a25), saying that before determining
          specifically the nature and characteristics of the things that form a
          demonstrative syllogism, we must indicate what is meant when we say,
          “of all,” and “ <i>per se</i>,” i.e., in virtue of itself, and
          “commensurately universal.” For if we are to understand the nature of
          the things that form a demonstration, we must know what these terms
          mean, because they describe things that must be observed in
          demonstrations. For in the propositions of a demonstration it is
          required that something be predicated universally~ which he signifies
          by the term “said of all”—and “ <i>per se</i>,” i.e., in virtue of
          itself, and “first”—which he signifies by the words, “commensurately
          universal.” But these three things are related by adding something to
          the previous one. For whatever is predicated <i>per se</i> is
          predicated universally [i.e., of all], but not vice versa. Again,
          whatever is predicated first is predicated <i>per se</i>, but not vice
          versa. This, therefore, shows why they are arranged as they are.
        </p>
        <p>
          But why there are three and wherein they differ are explained by the
          fact that something is said to be predicated “of all” or universally
          in relation to things contained under the subject. For, as it is
          stated in <i>Prior Analytics</i>, something is said “of all,” when
          there is nothing under the extension of,the subject that does not
          receive the given predicate. But it is in relation to the subject that
          something is said to be predicated <i>per se</i>, because the subject
          is mentioned when this predicate is defined, or vice versa, as will be
          explained below. Finally, something is said to be predicated of
          another thing “first” in relation to items that are prior to the,
          subject and embrace or include it, as the more universal includes the
          less. Thus to have three angles equal to two right angles is not
          predicated “first” of isosceles, because it is previously predicated
          of something prior to isosceles, namely, of triangle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly (73a28), he establishes his proposition. And his treatment is
          divided into three parts. First, he shows what is meant by “said of
          all.” Secondly, what is meant by “said <i>per se</i>,” i.e., in virtue
          of itself (73a34) [L. 10]. Thirdly, what is meant by “commensurately
          universal” (73b27) [L. II].
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerning the first he does two things. First (73a28), he states what
          it is to be “said of all.” And it should be noted that the phrase,
          “said of all,” is taken here in a sense somewhat different from the
          sense it has in <i>Prior Analytics</i>, where it is taken in a very
          general sense so as to accommodate both the dialectician and the
          demonstrator. Therefore, no more is mentioned in its definition than
          that the predicate be found in each of the things included under its
          subject. But that might be verified only at a given moment—which is
          the sense in which the dialectician sometimes uses it; or it might be
          verified absolutely and at all times—which is the sense to which the
          demonstrator must always limit himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Accordingly, two things are mentioned in the definition of “said of
          all”: one is that there is nothing within the extension of the subject
          that the predicate does not apply to. And he indicates this when he
          says, “not of one to the exclusion of others”; the other is that there
          is no time in which the predicate does not belong. And this he
          indicates when he says, “not at this or that time only.” And he gives
          the example of “man” and “animal,” saying that “animal” is predicated
          of every man; and of anything of which it is true to say that it is a
          man, it is true to say that it is an animal, and whenever it is a man,
          it is an animal. The same is true between line and point: for a point
          is in every line and always in every line.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly (73a32), he explains this definition, using as evidence the
          techniques employed in rebuttals. For a universal proposition is not
          rebutted unless one or other of things it states is not verified. For
          when we are asked whether something is said “of all” in a
          demonstration, we can say, “No,” for two reasons, i.e., either because
          it is not true of each instance of the subject, or because now and
          then it is not true. Hence it is clear that “being said of all”
          signifies each of these.<br /></p

        <p>
          After determining about “said of all,” the Philosopher now determines
          about “said <i>per se</i> ” [i.e., said in virtue of itself] and does
          three things. First, he shows the number of ways something is said
          <i>per se</i>. Secondly, how the demonstrator makes use of these ways
          (73b16). Thirdly, he summarizes (73b25).
        </p>
        <p>
          In regard to the first it should be noted that this preposition
          <i>per</i> [“in virtue of” or “by”] denotes a causal relationship,
          although sometimes it also signifies a state, as when someone is said
          to be <i>per se</i>, i.e., by himself, when he is alone. But when it
          designates a relationship to a cause, sometimes the cause is formal,
          as when it is stated that the body lives in virtue of the soul;
          sometimes the relationship is to a material cause, as when it is
          stated that a body is colored in virtue of its surface, i.e., because
          the surface is the subject of color; again, it might even designate a
          relationship to an extrinsic cause, particularly an efficient cause,
          as when it is said that water is made hot in virtue of fire. But just
          as this preposition per designates a relationship to a cause, when
          something extrinsic is the cause of that which is attributed to the
          subject, so also when the subject or something pertaining to the
          subject is the cause of that which is attributed to the subject. This
          latter is what <i>per se</i>, i.e., in virtue of itself, signifies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, the first way of saying something <i>per se</i> (73a34) is
          when that which is attributed to a subject pertains to its form. And
          because the form and essence of a thing are signified by its
          definition, the first mode of that which is <i>per se</i> is when the
          definition itself or something expressed in the definition is
          predicated of the thing defined. This is what he means when he says,
          “Essential attributes are such as belong to their subject as elements
          in its essential nature,” i.e., included in the definition which
          indicates <i>what</i> it is, whether those elements are stated in the
          nominative case or in one of the oblique cases. Thus, “line” is stated
          in the definition of triangle. Hence “line” is in triangle
          <i>per se</i>. Again, in the definition of line, “point” is mentioned;
          hence “point” is <i>per se</i> in line. And the reason why they are
          mentioned in the definition is stated when he says, “for the very
          being or substance” [i.e., the essence, which the definition
          signifies] “of triangle and line is composed of these elements,”
          namely, of lines and points. However, this does not mean that a line
          is formed out of points, but that “point” is involved in the very
          notion of line, just as “line” is involved in the very notion of
          triangle. And he asserts this in order to exclude things which are
          part of a thing’s matter and not of its species: thus, “semicircle” is
          not mentioned in the definition of circle, or “finger” in the
          definition of man, as it is stated in <i>Metaphysics</i> VII.
        </p>
        <p>
          He states further that all those items which are found universally in
          the definition expressing what a thing is are attributed to it
          <i>per se</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second mode of saying <i>per se</i> is when this preposition
          <i>per</i> implies a relationship of material cause, in the sense that
          that to which something, is attributed is its proper matter and
          subject. For it is required, when defining an accident, to mention its
          proper subject in one of the oblique, cases: thus when an accident is
          defined abstractly, we say that “aquilinity” is a curvature of a
          nose,” but when it is defined concretely, the subject is put in the
          nominative case, so that we say that “the aquiline is a curved nose.”
          Now the reason for this is that since the being of an accident depends
          on its subject, its definition—which signifies its being—must mention
          that subject. Hence it is the second mode of saying <i>per se</i>,
          when the subject is mentioned in the definition of a predicate which
          is a proper accident of the subject.
        </p>
        <p>
          And this is what he means when he states (73a38), “essential
          attributes are those such that while they belong to certain subjects,”
          i.e., to subjects of accidents, “the subjects to which they belong are
          contained in the attribute’s own defining formula,” i.e., in the
          expression which describes what the accident is, i.e., in the
          definition of the accident. “Thus straight and curved belong to line
          <i>per se</i>.” For “line” is mentioned in their definition. For the
          same reason “odd” and “even” belong <i>per se</i> to number, because
          “number” is mentioned in their definition. Again, prime and
        </p>
        <p>
          compound are predicated <i>per se</i> of number, and “number” is
          mentioned in their definition. (For a prime number, for example,
          seven, is one which is exactly divisible by no other number but “1”;
          but a compound number, for example, nine, is one which is exactly
          divisible by some number greater than “1.” Again, “isoplural,” i.e.,
          equilateral, and scalene, i.e., having three unequal sides, belong
          <i>per se</i> to triangle, and “triangle” is mentioned in their
          definition. Accordingly, he adds that their respective subjects belong
          to each of the aforesaid accidents and are mentioned in the expression
          which states what each is, i.e., in the definition: thus “line”
          belongs to some of them, and “number” to others.
        </p>
        <p>
          In each of these subjects that have been mentioned, I say that its
          accident is in it <i>per se</i>. But those predicates which are
          neutral, i.e., of such a nature as not to be mentioned in the
          definition of their subjects, nor the subjects in their definition,
          are accidents, i.e., are predicated <i>per accidens</i>: for example,
          “musical” and “white” are predicated <i>per accidens</i> of animal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (73b5) he sets down another mode of that which is <i>per se</i>,
          i.e., the sense in which it signifies something in isolation. Thus
          something which is a singular in the genus of substance and which is
          not predicated of any subject is said to be <i>per se</i>. The reason
          for this is that when I say, “walking” or “white,” I do not signify
          either of them as something isolated or apart, since something else
          which is walking or white is understood. But this is not the case with
          terms which signify a “this something,” i.e., with terms that signify
          first substance. For when I say, “Socrates” or “Plato,” it is not to
          be supposed that there is something else, over and above what they
          really are, which would be their subject. Therefore, things which are
          thus not predicated of any subject are <i>per se</i>, but things which
          are predicated of a subject, as being in the subject, are accidents.
          However, not all things predicated of a subject, as universals of
          their inferiors, are accidents.
        </p>
        <p>
          It should be noted, however, that this mode is not a mode of
          predicating, but a mode of existing; hence at the very start he said
          that they exist <i>per se</i> and not that they are said
          <i>per se</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (73b10) he gives the fourth mode, according to which the
          preposition per designates a relationship of efficient cause or of any
          other. Consequently, he says that whatever is attributed to a thing
          because of itself, is said of it <i>per se</i>; but whatever is not so
          attributed is said <i>per accidens</i>, as when I say, “While he was
          walking, it lightened.” For it is not the fact that he walks that
          causes lightning, but this is said by coincidence. Butt if the
          predicate is in the subject because of itself, it is <i>per se</i>, as
          when we say, “Slaughtered, it died.” For it is obvious that because
          something was slaughtered, it died, and it is not a mere coincidence
          that something slaughtered should die.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (73b16) he shows how the demonstrator uses the aforesaid modes.
          But first it should be noted that, since science bears on conclusions,
          and understanding [intuition] bears on principles, the scientifically
          knowable are, properly speaking, the conclusions of a demonstration
          wherein proper attributes are predicated of their appropriate
          subjects. Now the appropriate subjects are not only placed in the
          definition of attributes, but they are also their causes. Hence the
          conclusions of demonstrations involve two modes of predicating
          <i>per se</i>, namely, the second and the fourth.
        </p>
        <p>
          And this is what he means when he says that the predications “in the
          scientifically knowable in the strict sense,” i.e., in the conclusions
          of demonstrations are <i>per se</i> in the sense of something
          contained in the predicates, i.e., in the way that subjects are
          contained in the definition of accidents which are predicated of the
          former; or are present on account of them, i.e., in the way that
          predicates are in a subject by reason of the subject itself, which is
          the cause of the predicate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then he shows that such scientifically knowable things are necessary,
          because it is impossible for a proper accident not to be predicated of
          its subject. But this can occur in two ways: sometimes it is absolute,
          as when the accident is convertible with its subject, as “having three
          angles equal to two right angles” is convertible with triangle, and
          “risible” with man. At other times, two opposites stated disjunctively
          are of necessity in the subject, as “straight or oblique” in line,
          and.”odd or even” in number. He shows that the reason for this is the
          fact that contrariety, privation and contradiction are in the same
          genus. For privation is nothing more, than a negation in a determinate
          subject. Again, a contrary is equivalent to a negation in some genus,
          as in the genus of numbers, odd is the same as “not even” by way of
          consequence. Therefore, just as it is necessary, either to affirm or
          deny, so it is necessary that one of two things that belong
          <i>per se</i>, be in its proper subject.
        </p>
        <p>Then (73b25) he summarizes, and the text is clear.<br /></p

        </p>
        <p>
          After determining about “said of all” and “said <i>per se</i>,” the
          Philosopher here determines concerning the “universal.” This treatment
          falls into two parts. In the first he shows what the universal is.
          Secondly, how error occurs in our understanding of it (74a4) [L. 12].
          Concerning the first he does two things. First, he shows what the
          universal is. Secondly, how the demonstrator uses the universal
          (74a1). Concerning the first he does two things. First, he shows that
          the universal contains within itself the attributes of “being said of
          all” and of “being said <i>per se</i>.” Secondly, he shows what the
          universal adds to them (73b33).
        </p>
        <p>
          To understand what is being said here it should be noted that
          “universal” is not to be taken here in the sense that anything
          predicated of several is a universal, as when Porphyry treats of the
          five universals; rather “universal” is taken here according to a
          certain correspondence or commensurateness of the subject with the
          predicate, so that the predicate is not found outside the subject nor
          is the subject without the predicate.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this in mind, it should be noted that he does three things with
          respect to the first point. First (73b27), he says that the universal,
          namely, the predicate, is both verified of all, i.e., is predicated
          universally of its subject, and is said <i>per se</i>, i.e., is in and
          belongs to the subject according to the essential nature of the
          subject. For many things are said universally of certain things to
          which they do not belong <i>per se</i> and as such. Thus, every stone
          is colored, but not precisely as stone, but as it has a surface.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly (73b28), he draws a corollary from this and says that since
          the universal is something which is <i>per se</i> in a thing, and
          since it has been shown that whatever things are in something
          <i>per se</i> are in it of necessity,
        </p>
        <p>
          it is obvious that universal predicates, as they are being taken here,
          are necessarily present in the things of which they are predicated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly (73b29), lest anyone suppose that “ <i>per se</i> ” and
          “precisely as such,” both of which were mentioned in the definition of
          the universal, are different, he shows that they are the same. Thus,
          “point” is <i>per se</i> in line in the first way, and “straight” in
          the second way. For each is in line precisely as it is a line. In like
          manner, “two right angles” belongs to triangle precisely as triangle,
          i.e., its angles are equal to two right angles, which is
          <i>per se</i> in triangle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (73b33) he shows what “universal” adds to the notions, “being
          said of all” and “being said <i>per se</i>.” In regard to this he does
          two things:
        </p>
        <p>
          First, he says that a predicate is “universal,” when it is not only in
          each thing of which it is asserted, but it is demonstrated to be first
          or primarily in the thing which receives that predicate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly (73b34), he clarifies this with an example and says that
          “having three angles equal to two right angles” is not found in just
          any figure in general, although this could be demonstrated of some
          figure, because it is demonstrated of triangle, which is a figure; yet
          it is not found in any random figure, nor is just any figure used when
          it is demonstrated. For a rhombus is a figure, but it does not have
          three angles equal to two right angles. But an isosceles, i.e., a
          triangle with two equal sides, always has its three angles equal to
          two right angles. Nevertheless, isosceles is not the primary thing to
          which this belongs, for it belongs basically to triangle, and belongs
          to isosceles precisely as it is a triangle. Therefore, whatever is
          demonstrated basically to have its three angles equal to two right
          angles (or whatever else be thus demonstrated), the universal
          predicate is present in it primarily, as in triangle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (74a1) he shows how a demonstrator uses the “universal,” saying
          that demonstration is concerned <i>per se</i> with such a universal,
          but with other things qualifiedly and not <i>per se</i>. For a
          demonstrator demonstrates a proper attribute of its proper subject;
          and if he demonstrates it of anything else, he does so only insofar as
          it pertains to that subject. Thus, he proves that some property of
          triangle belongs to a figure and to an isosceles precisely as some
          figure is a triangle, and as the isosceles is a triangle. But the
          reason why “having three” is not in isosceles primarily is not because
          it is not predicated of it universally, but because it is found more
          frequently, i.e., in more things than in isosceles, since this is
          common to every triangle.<br /></p

        <p>
          After specifying what the universal is, the Philosopher here shows how
          one might err in understanding the universal. In regard to this he
          does three things. First, he says that sometimes one might err in this
          matter. Secondly, he tells in how many ways (74a6). Thirdly, he gives
          the criterion for knowing whether the universal is being employed
          correctly (74a35).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (74a4), that in order to avoid mistakes in
          demonstrating, one should be aware of the fact that quite often
          something universal seems to be demonstrated, which is not being
          demonstrated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly (74a6), he indicates the ways in which this mistake can
          occur. And in regard to this he does two things.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, he enumerates these ways and says that there are three possible
          errors in understanding a universal. The first is likely to occur when
          under some common genus there is nothing else to take as the thing to
          which the universal initially applies than this singular, to which it
          is incorrectly applied. For example, if man were the only animal
          existing, and “sensible,” which is initially and <i>per se</i> in
          animal, were to be assigned as a primary universal to man. (It should
          be noted that singular is being used here in a wide sense for any
          inferior, in the way that a species might be called a singular
          contained under a genus). Or we might say that it is not possible to
          find a genus with only one species: for a genus is divided into
          species through opposing differences. But if one contrary is found in
          nature, so must the other, as the Philosopher explains in
          <i>On the Heavens</i> II. Therefore, if one species is found, another
          will be found. However, one species is divided into distinct
          individuals by the division of matter. But it sometimes happens that
          all the matter proportionate to a given species is comprehended under
          one individual, so that in that case there is only one individual
          under one species. Hence it is significant that he did say,
          “singular.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The second way is when it is possible to take several inferiors under
          something common which is verified in things that differ in species,
          but that common item has no name. For example, if “animality” had no
          name, and “sensibility,” which is proper to animal, were to be
          assigned to the inferiors of animal (either collectively or
          distributively) as their primary universal.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third way is when that of which something is demonstrated to be
          its primary universal is related to what is demonstrated of it, as a
          whole is related to a part. For example, if the power to see were
          assigned as a primary universal to animal: for not every animal can
          see. In this case the demonstration, i.e., what should have been
          demonstrated, is “in those things which are in part,” i.e., in some
          but not all of the things included under the subject; furthermore, it
          will be a demonstration “of all,” but not of all that the
          demonstration mentions. For the power to see can indeed be
          demonstrated universally of something, but not of animal universally,
          as of that to which it belongs primarily. And he explains why he says,
          “primarily,” namely, because a demonstration bears on what is both
          universal and first.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly (74a13), he gives examples of each of these ways. First, of
          the third way, saying that if someone were to demonstrate of two
          straight lines that they do not intersect, i.e., that they do not
          meet, it might seem that we have a demonstration of this sort, i.e.,
          one that bears on a primary universal, on the ground that “not to
          meet” is true of certain straight lines, and not that this happens
          only because the straight lines are equal, i.e., equally distant. But
          if the lines should be equal, i.e., equidistant, then “not to meet”
          belongs to any and all of them, because it is universally true that
          lines which are straight and equally distant, even should they be
          lengthened <i>ad infinitum</i>, will not meet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly (74a17), he gives an example of the first way, saying that if
          there were no triangle but the isosceles which is a triangle having
          two equal sides, it might seem that what is true of triangle as
          triangle should be true of isosceles as isosceles. But this would not
          be so.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly (74a18), he gives an example of the second way. Now it seems
          that he saved this for last because he wished to spend more time on
          it. Concerning it he does three things. First, he gives the example.
          Secondly, he draws a corollary from what he has said (74a25). Thirdly,
          he gives a reason for the aforesaid (74a33).
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerning the first it should be noted that a ratio is a relation of
          one quantity to another, as 6 is related to 3 in the ratio of 2 to 1.
          The com. paring of one ratio to another is a proportion, which, if it
          is disjoint, has four terms: for example, as 4 is to 2, so 6 is to 3.
          But if it is joint, it has three terms, one of which is used twice:
          for example, as 8 is to 4, so 4 is to 2.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now it is obvious that in a proportion two terms are antecedents and
          two are consequents. For example, in the proportion that 6 is to 3 as
          4 is to 2, 6 and 4 are the antecedents, 3 and 2 the consequents.
          Again, a proportion is alternated by bringing the antecedents together
          and the consequents together. For example, when I say: As 4 is to 2,
          so 6 is to 3; therefore, as 4 is to 6, so 2 is to 3.
        </p>
        <p>
          What he is saying, therefore, is that alternate proportion is verified
          in lines, numbers, solids, (i.e., bodies), and times. But just as this
          is established separately for each of them, namely, for numbers in
          arithmetic, for lines and solids in geometry, and for times in natural
          philosophy or astronomy, so it is possible to prove it of all of them
          in a single demonstration. But the reason why a separate demonstration
          was employed to prove alternation for each was that the one feature
          they had in common was unnamed. For although quantity is a feature
          common to all of them, quantity includes other things besides them;
          for example, speech and other things that are accidentally
          quantitative.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or, better still, it was because alternate proportion does not belong
          to quantity precisely as quantity, but as compared to another quantity
          according to a fixed ratio. That is why at the very start he spoke of
          alternate proportion. But there is no general name for the aforesaid
          things precisely as they are proportional. Furthermore, when alternate
          proportion is demonstrated separately for each of them, it is not a
          universal that is being demonstrated. For “to be alternately
          proportional” is not in numbers and lines according to what each of
          them is, but according to something common. Besides, those who
          demonstrate alternate proportion of lines look upon this attribute as
          a universal predicate of line precisely as it is a line, or of number
          precisely as it is number.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (74a25), he draws a corollary from the above and says that for
          the same reason that something universal is not being demonstrated
          when a common unnamed attribute is proved to be a universal predicate
          of each species, so too when something is demonstrated this way of a
          common attribute which does have a name. For example, if someone uses
          the same demonstration for each species of triangle and proves that
          each has three angles equal to two right angles, or if he uses
          different demonstrations, say one for isosceles and another for
          scalene, even then he does not on that account know that a triangle
          has three angles equal to two right angles except in a sophistical
          way, i.e., <i>per accidens</i>: for he does not know it of triangle as
          triangle, but as equilateral or as having two equal sides or as having
          three unequal sides.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, one who demonstrates in this way does not know the
          universal of triangle, i.e., he does not have a knowledge of triangle
          in a universal way (even if there happens to be no other triangle
          besides those of which he knew this: and this because he had not the
          knowledge of triangle as triangle but under the aspect of its various
          species). Again, strictly speaking, he did not know every triangle:
          for although he knew every triangle according to number (if there was
          none he did not know), yet according to species he did not know each
          one. For something is known universally according to species, when it
          is known according to the notion of the species, but according to
          number and not universally, when it is known according to the
          multifarious things contained under the species. And in this matter
          there is no difference whether we compare species to individuals or
          genera to species. For triangle is the genus of equilateral and
          isosceles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (74a33) he assigns the reason for the aforesaid, first asking
          when does one know universally and absolutely, if one who knew in the
          aforesaid way did not know universally. And he answers that obviously
          if the essence of triangle in general and of each of its species (each
          taken sepai-ately or all taken together) were the same, then one would
          know universally and absolutely about triangle, when he knew about any
          one species of it separately or about all of them together. But if the
          essence is not the same, then it will not be the same but something
          different to know triangle and to know its several species. And by
          knowing something of the species one does not know it of triangle
          precisely as triangle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (74a35) he gives the rule on how the universal can be properly
          understood, saying that whether something belongs to triangle
          precisely as triangle or to isosceles precisely as isosceles, and when
          it is that what is demonstrated is first and universal in the given
          subject precisely as this, i.e., precisely according to the
          subject—all this will be clear from what I shall say.
        </p>
        <p>
          For whenever some item is removed from the subject and the original
          universal still applies to what remains, then it is not the first
          universal of that subject. For example, upon the removal of isosceles
          or of brazen there still remains the triangle which has three angles
          equal to two right angles; hence the possession of three angles equal
          to two right angles is not a first universal of isosceles or of brazen
          triangle. But if the item “figure” be removed, nothing which has three
          angles equal to two right angles remains, nor again if you remove
          “bounded” which is more universal than figure, since a figure is
          something enclosed by a bound or bounds. Nevertheless, the attribute
          in question [namely, having three angles equal to two right angles]
          does not belong first to figure or to bounded, because it does not
          belong to either of them universally.
        </p>
        <p>
          To what then will it be first? Obviously to triangle, because it
          belongs to the others (both superiors and inferiors) precisely as they
          are triangles For it belongs to figure to have three angles equal to
          two right angles only because a triangle is some figure, and similarly
          to isosceles, only because it is a triangle, and it is of triangle
          that “having three...” is demonstrated. Hence, it is to triangle that
          it belongs as a first universal<br /></p

          Having finished his treatment of that which is said “of all” and “
          <i>per se</i> ” and “universally,” all of which we use in
          demonstration, the Philosopher now begins to discuss the items from
          which demonstration proceeds. And there are two parts. In the first he
          shows what demonstration of the reasoned fact [demonstration
          <i>propter quid</i> ] proceeds from. In the second what demonstration
          of the fact [demonstration <i>quia</i> ] proceeds from (78a22) [L.
          23]. The first is divided into two parts. In the first he shows the
          sort of things from which a demonstration proceeds. In the second,
          what the principles of demonstration are (76a26) [L. 18]. The first is
          divided into three parts. In the first he shows that demonstration
          issues from necessary things. In the second that it issues from things
          that are <i>per se</i> (76a26) [L. 14]. In the third that it proceeds
          from proper principles (75a38) [L. 15]. Concerning the first he does
          two things. First, he shows that demonstration should proceed from
          necessary things. Secondly, he proves certain things he had
          presupposed (74b27). In regard to the first he does three things.
          First, he makes a connection with what went before. Secondly, he
          proves his proposition (74b6). Thirdly, he draws a conclusion from the
          aforesaid (74b22).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (74b5), as an inference from what has already
          been established, that if there be demonstrative science, i.e., if
          science is acquired through demonstration, it must issue from
          necessary principles. The necessity of this inference is clear,
          because that which is known scientifically cannot be otherwise than it
          is, as was pointed out in the definition of scientific knowing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (74b6) he shows that demonstration issues from necessary things.
          First, with a reason. Secondly, with a sign (74b19).
        </p>
        <p>
          With respect to the first he gives two reasons. The first (74b6) is
          this: Things predicated <i>per se</i> are in a thing necessarily. (And
          he manifests this in two of the modes of predicating <i>per se</i>: in
          the first mode, because the things predicated <i>per se</i> are “in
          that which is what,” i.e., in the definition of the subject. But
          whatever is put in the definition of anything is predicated of it
          necessarily. In the second mode, because certain subjects are put in
          “that which is the what of things predicated of them,” i.e., in the
          definition of their predicates. And if these are opposites, one or
          other of them is necessarily in the subject: thus, either “odd” or
          “even” is in number, as we showed above). Now it is clear that it is
          from principles of this kind, namely, <i>per se</i>, that a
          demonstrative syllogism proceeds. (And this is proved by the fact that
          whatever is predicated, is predicated either <i>per se</i> or
          <i>per accidens</i>, and that things predicated
          <i>per accidens</i> are not necessary). Therefore, since it is not a
          demonstration but rather a sophistic syllogism that issues from things
          that are <i>per accidens</i>, it follows that demonstration proceeds
          from necessary things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, it should be noted that, since in a demonstration a
          proper attribute is proved of a subject through a middle which is the
          definition, it is required that the first proposition (whose predicate
          is the proper attribute, and whose subject is the definition which
          contains the principles of the proper attribute) be <i>per se</i> in
          the fourth mode, and that the second proposition (whose subject is the
          subject itself and the predicate its definition) must be in the first
          mode. But the conclusion, in which the proper attribute is predicated
          of the subject, must be <i>per se</i> in the second mode.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (74b14) he sets forth the second reason and it is this:
          “Demonstration is concerned with the necessary and the demonstrated,”
          i.e., the conclusion of the demonstration cannot be other than it is.
          This statement is to be taken as the principle proving our proposition
          that demonstration proceeds from necessary things. And from what has
          been said, the truth of this principle is obvious. From this principle
          one argues thus: a necessary conclusion cannot be scientifically known
          save from necessary principles; but a demonstration makes a necessary
          conclusion scientifically known: therefore, it must proceed from
          necessary principles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Herein lies the difference between a demonstration and other
          syllogisms. For in the latter it is enough if one syllogizes from true
          principles. Nor is there any other type of syllogism in which it is
          required to proceed from the necessary: in a demonstration alone must
          this be observed. And this is proper to a demonstration, i.e., to
          proceed from the necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (74b18) he proves the same thing in the following way, using a
          sign: Suit is brought against an argument solely on the ground that
          something is wanting that should have been observed in that argument.
          But against one who believes that he has demonstrated, we bring the
          charge that the things from which he proceeded are not necessarily
          true, whether we are convinced that they could be otherwise than
          stated, or whether we bring a charge of reason, i.e., for the sake of
          disputing. Therefore, demonstration should proceed from necessary
          things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (74b22) he draws a conclusion from the foregoing, saying that
          “this,” namely, the fact that a demonstration must conclude from
          necessary things, “shows” that they are obtuse who assumed that they
          rightly chose the principles of demonstration, if the proposition they
          chose was probable or true, as the Sophists do, i.e., those who appear
          wise but are not. For scientific knowing consists in nothing less than
          having science, namely, from demonstration. But when something is
          probable or improbable, it is not certain whether it is first or not
          first, whereas that on which a demonstration bears must be first in
          some genus and be true. This does not mean that a demonstrator may
          take anything that is first: it must be first in that genus with
          respect to which he is demonstrating. Thus, arithmetic does not choose
          what is first in regard to magnitude, in regard to number.
        </p>
        <p>
          It should be noted that Sophists are not taken here as they are in the
          book of <i>Sophistical Refutations</i>, i.e., who proceed from things
          that seem probable but are not, or seem to syllogize but do not. For
          just as some are called Sophists, i.e., seeming to be wise but not
          really so, inasmuch as they appear by their arguments to be scientific
          knowers but are not, so dialectical arguments, if they seem to prove
          demonstratively but do not, are sophistic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (74b27) he proves something he had presupposed. And concerning
          this he does two things. First, he shows that a necessary conclusion
          cannot be scientifically known from non-necessary principles.
          Secondly, that although the necessary cannot be scientifically known
          from the nonnecessary, it can nevertheless be syllogized (75al).
        </p>
        <p>
          He proves the first with two reasons, one of which (74b27) is this: If
          one does not have an argument which shows the cause why [i.e.,
          <i>propter quid</i> ], he does not know scientifically, even though a
          syllogism be had; because to know scientifically is to know the cause
          of a thing, as we stated above. But an argument which infers a
          necessary conclusion from nonnecessary principles does not show the
          cause why.
        </p>
        <p>
          To clarify this he gives an example, using general terms. Assume that
          the conclusion, “Every C is A,” is necessary, and that it is
          demonstrated by a middle, B, which is not a necessary middle but a
          contingent one, so that, for example, one of the propositions, “Every
          B is A,” and “Every C is B,” or both, are contingent. Now it is
          obvious that through this contingent middle, namely, B, one cannot
          obtain scientific knowledge <i>propter quid</i> of the necessary
          conclusion, “Every C is A.” For if the cause on which something
          depends is removed, the effect must be removed. But this middle, being
          contingent, can be withdrawn, whereas the conclusion, since it is
          necessary, cannot be withdrawn. It follows, therefore, that a
          necessary conclusion cannot be scientifically known through a
          contingent middle.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second reason (74b32) is this: “If a man is without scientific
          knowledge now, then even though he possesses the same argument he had
          up to now, and he has been kept sound,” i.e., has not ceased to be,
          “and the thing known has not changed; and if he has not forgotten,
          then obviously he has not known scientifically.” In this passage the
          Philosopher mentions four ways in which a person loses the science he
          once had: one way is when there slips from his mind the argument
          through which he formerly knew scientifically. Another is through the
          destruction of the knower. A third is by a change occurring in the
          thing known: thus if, while you are sitting, I know that you are
          sitting, this knowledge perishes when you are not sitting. The fourth
          way is by forgetting. Hence if none of these ways has occurred, then,
          if a person does not know a thing scientifically now, he never did
          know it. Now one who holds a necessary (onclusion in virtue of a
          contingent middle, no longer knows it scientifically when the middle
          ceases to be, for the middle no longer exists, cven though he retains
          the same argument and the fact remains the same,;tnd he has not
          forgotten anything. Therefore, even when the middle had not ceased to
          be, he did not know scientifically.
        </p>
        <p>
          But that a contingent middle is liable to perish he proves by the fact
          that whatever is not necessary must at some time perish. And even
          though the middle has not perished, nevertheless, because it is not
          necessary, it is obvious that it is liable to perish. Now when
          something contingent is put forward, its result is not impossible but
          possible and contingent. But what followed in our case was impossible,
          namely, that one should have had science of something and later not
          have had it, all the conditions described above prevailing. And this
          follows from the fact that a contingent middle has perished, which,
          although it may not be true [that it has], is nevertheless liable to,
          as has been said.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (75a1) he shows that although a necessary conclusion cannot be
          scientifically known through a contingent middle, nevertheless a
          necessary conclusion can be syllogized from a non-necessary middle.
          Hence he says that nothing hinders a necessary conclusion from being
          obtained through a non-necessary middle, as witness the case in which
          something is syllogized with a dialectical syllogism, although not
          with a demonstrative syllogism which causes science. For the necessary
          happens to be syllogized from the non-necessary, just as the true
          happens to be syllogized from the untrue—although the converse does
          not occur. For when the middle is necessary, the conclusion too will
          be necessary; similarly, from true premises something true is
          concluded.
        </p>
        <p>
          But that the necessary is always concluded from necessary premises he
          proves thus: “Let A be necessary of B,” i.e., let this proposition,
          “Every B is A,” be necessary, “and the latter of C,” i.e., let “Every
          C is B” also be necessary. Now from these two necessary things follows
          a third necessary thing, namely, the conclusion, “Every C is A.” For
          it has been proved in the <i>Prior Analytics</i> that “from two
          propositions of necessity follows a’ conclusion of necessity.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Then by way of consequence he shows that if the conclusion were not
          necessary, the middle could not be necessary. For example, suppose
          that this conclusion, “Every C is A,” is not necessary, but that the
          two premises are necessary. According to our previous doctrine it
          follows that the conclusion is necessary—which is contrary to the
          supposition in our example, namely, that the conclusion not be
          necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (75a13) he infers from the aforesaid the conclusion originally
          intended, saying that since a thing must be necessary if it is made
          known by way of demonstration, it is clear from the foregoing that a
          demonstration must rest on a necessary middle. For otherwise it would
          not be scientifically known that the conclusion is necessary, neither
          <i>propter quid</i> nor <i>quia</i>, since the necessary cannot be
          known through the non-necessary, as we have shown. But if someone
          rests on an argument based on a non-necessary middle, he will be in
          one of two states. For since he does not actually know in a scientific
          way, he will either believe that he does know in a scientific way, if
          he assumes a non-necessary middle as necessary, or he will not presume
          that he knows in a scientific way, i.e., if he believes that he does
          not have a necessary middle. And this is to be universally understood
          both of scientific knowledge <i>quia</i>, in which something is known
          through mediate principles, and of science <i>propter quid</i>, in
          which something is known through immediate principles. The difference
          between these two will be explained later.<br /></p

          >
        </p>
        <p>
          After showing that demonstration proceeds from necessary things, the
          Philosopher then shows that it is concerned with things that are
          <i>per se</i> and proceeds from things that are <i>per se</i>. In
          regard to this he does three things. First, he shows that
          demonstration is concerned with things that are <i>per se</i>, i.e.,
          that the conclusions of demonstrations are <i>per se</i>. Secondly, he
          raises a problem (75a21). Thirdly, he shows that demonstration
          proceeds from things that are <i>per se</i>, i.e., that the principles
          of demonstrations must be <i>per se</i> (75a28).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (75a18) that demonstrative science cannot bear
          on accidents that are not <i>per se</i> in the way that
          <i>per se</i> was explained above, namely, that a
          <i>per se</i> accident is one in whose definition the subject is
          mentioned, as “even” or “odd” is a <i>per se</i> accident of number.
          But “white” is not a <i>per se</i> accident of animal, because animal
          is not mentioned in its definition.
        </p>
        <p>
          That there cannot be demonstration bearing on accidents that are not
          <i>per se</i> he proves in the following way: An accident which is not
          <i>per se</i> might happen not to be present (and this is the accident
          under discussion). Therefore, if a demonstration were to bear on an
          accident which is not <i>per se</i>, it would follow that the
          conclusion of the demonstration would not be necessary: which is
          contrary to what has been established.
        </p>
        <p>
          That an accident which is not <i>per se</i> does not inhere
          necessarily can be obtained from the following: If an accident inheres
          necessarily and always in a subject, it must have its cause in the
          subject—in which case the accident cannot but inhere. Now this can
          occur in two ways: in one way, when it is caused from the principles
          of the species, and such an accident is called a
          <i>per se</i> attribute or property; in another way, when it is caused
          from the principles of the individual, and this is called an
          inseparable accident. In either case every accident which is caused
          from the principles of the subject must, if it is defined, be defined
          in such a way as to mention the subject in its definition: for a thing
          is defined in terms of its proper principles. Thus it is clear that an
          accident which necessarily inheres in its subject must be a
          <i>per se</i> accident. Therefore, those that are not <i>per se</i> do
          not inhere of necessity.
        </p>
        <p>
          It seems, however, that Aristotle is using the circular demonstration,
          which he previously repudiated. For he had proved earlier that a
          demonstration is concerned with necessary things, because it is
          concerned with, things which are <i>per se</i>; but now he shows that
          demonstration is con-: 1, cerned with things which are <i>per se</i>,
          because it is concerned with things which are necessary. The answer is
          that above Aristotle proved that demonstration is concerned with
          necessary things not only because it is concerned with things which
          are <i>per se</i> but also because of the definition of scientific
          knowing—and this was a true way to demonstrate. But the proof that
          demonstration is concerned with necessary things because it is
          concerned with things which are <i>per se</i>, is not a demonstration
          but an indication directed to a person who already knows that
          demonstration is concerned with things which are <i>per se</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (75a21) he raises a problem in regard to which he does two
          things. First, he states the problem, saying that someone may perhaps,
          object that if the conclusion which follows from contingent things or
          things which are <i>per accidens</i> is not necessary, why are
          inquiries made concerning contingent things or things which are
          <i>per accidens</i>, so that from such data one may reach a
          conclusion, since it is required of the’ syllogism that the conclusion
          follow of necessity. That inquiries touching contingent things or
          things which are <i>per accidens</i> do occur is evident from his next
          statement, namely, that it makes no difference whether one inquires
          into contingent things and then gives his conclusion. As if to say: A
          conclusion can be drawn from contingent things that have been
          investigated and verified, just as from necessary things. For each
          employs the same syllogistic form.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly (75a24), he solves the difficulty and says that questions
          solved by contingent premises are not of such a nature that the
          conclusion is necessary absolutely, on the basis of the things
          investigated, i.e., in virtue of the contingent premises, but because
          it is necessary for the one who admits the premises to admit the
          conclusion and to admit truth in the conclusion, if the things
          premised are true. It is as though he were saying that although a
          conclusion which is necessary with absolute necessity does not follow
          from contingent premises, yet it follows with the necessity of
          consequence according to which the conclusion follows from premises.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (75a28) he shows that demonstration proceeds from things which
          are <i>per se</i>, using the following argument: Demonstration
          proceeds from necessary things and bears on necessary things—and this
          because it is scientific, i.e., makes one know scientifically. But
          things which are not <i>per se</i> are not necessary, for they are
          <i>per accidens</i> and, being such, are not necessary, as has been
          stated above. On the other hand, those things bear with necessity on a
          genus which are <i>per se</i> and belong to it according to what it
          is. It follows, therefore, that demonstration cannot be from anything
          or of anything but what is <i>per se</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          He further shows that even if the premises were always both necessary
          and true but not <i>per se</i>, one would not know the cause why [
          <i>propter quid</i> ] of the conclusion. This is clear in syllogisms
          which prove through signs, for although the conclusion be
          <i>per se</i>, one does not know it <i>per se</i> nor
          <i>propter quid</i>. For example, if someone were to prove that every
          element
        </p>
        <p>
          corruptible on the ground that it is seen to grow old. This would be a
          proof through a sign but neither <i>per se</i> nor
          <i>propter quid</i>, because to know <i>propter quid</i> one must know
          through the cause. Therefore, the middle must be the cause of that
          which is concluded in the demonstration. And this is obvious from the
          premises: for the middle must inhere in the third causatively, i.e.,
          <i>per se</i>, and likewise the first in the middle. Here he calls the
          two extremes the first and the third.<br /></p

          After showing that demonstration is from things that are
          <i>per se</i>, the Philosopher here concludes that demonstration is
          from principles which are proper and not from extraneous or common
          principles. His treatment falls into two parts. In the first he shows
          that demonstration proceeds from proper principles. In the second he
          establishes which principles are proper and which common (76a26) [L.
          18]. The first is divided into two parts. In the first he shows that
          demonstration does not proceed from extraneous principles. In the
          second that it does not proceed from common principles (75b37) [L.
          17]. The first is divided into two parts. In the first, from the
          preceding, he shows that demonstration is not from extraneous
          principles. In the second, also from the preceding, he shows that
          demonstrations do not bear on corruptible things but on eternal
          (75b2I) [L. 16]. Concerning the first he does three things. First, he
          states his proposition. Secondly, he proves it (75a39). Thirdly, he
          concludes to what he intended (75b13).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (75a38) that inasmuch as demonstration is from
          things that are <i>per se</i>, it is plain that demonstration does not
          consist in descending or skipping from one genus to another, as
          geometry, demonstrating from its own principles, does not descend to
          something in arithmetic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (75a39) he proves this proposition and does three things. First,
          he lays down the things that are necessary for a demonstration, saying
          that “three things are necessary in demonstrations. One is that which
          is demonstrated,” namely, the conclusion which, as a matter of fact,
          contains within itself that which inheres in its genus <i>per se</i>.
          For through demonstration a proper attribute is concluded of its
          proper subject. Another is the dignities [maxims or axioms] from which
          demonstration proceeds. The third is the generic subject whose proper
          attributes and <i>per se</i> accidents demonstration reveals.

        <p>
          Secondly (75b3), he shows which of the three aforesaid can be common
          to various sciences and which cannot, saying that one of the three,
          namely, the dignities, from which demonstration proceeds, happens to
          be the same in diverse demonstrations and even in diverse sciences.
          But in those sciences whose respective generic subject is diverse, as
          in arithmetic which is concerned with numbers, and in geometry which
          is concerned with magnitudes, it does not occur that a demonstration
          which starts with the principles of one science, say, of arithmetic,
          descends to the subjects of another science, say to magnitudes, which
          pertain to geometry; unless perchancp the subject of one science
          should be contained under the sub., ject of the other, for example, if
          magnitudes should be contained under, numbers. (How this occurs,
          namely, how the subject of one science may be contained under the
          subject of another, will be discussed later). For magnitudes are not
          contained under numbers except perhaps in the sense that magnitudes
          are numbered. In any case, the subjects of diverse demonstrations or
          sciences are diverse. For an arithmetical demonstration always has its
          proper genus in respect to which it demonstrates, and so do the other
          sciences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly (75b8), he proves his proposition and does two things. First
          he brings in the main intent after the manner of a conclusion on the
          ground that it can be obtained from the aforesaid, saying: Hence it is
          clear that it is necessary either that the genus with which the
          principles and conclusions deal be absolutely the same (in which case
          there is no descent or skipping from one genus to another); or if the
          demonstration is to descend from one genus to another, the two must be
          one thus, i.e., somehow. For otherwise it is impossible for a
          conclusion to be demonstrated from principles, since there is not the
          same genus either absolutely or in a qualified sense. However, it
          should be noted that a genus absolutely the same is being taken when
          on the part of the subject no determinate difference is admitted which
          is alien to the nature of that genus: for example, if someone using
          principles verified of triangle should proceed to demonstrate
          something about isosceles or about any other species of triangle. But
          a genus is one in a qualified sense when a difference alien to the
          nature of the genus is admitted of the subject, as “visual” is alien
          to the genus of line, and “sound” to the genus of number. Therefore,
          number absolutely, which is the generic subject of arithmetic, and
          sonant number, which is the generic subject of music, are not one
          genus absolutely speaking. The same goes for line absolutely, which
          geometry considers, and the visual line considered in optics. Hence it
          is clear that when matters pertaining absolutely to the line are
          applied to the visual line, a descent is being made to another
          genus—which is not the case when matters pertaining to triangle are
          applied to isosceles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly (75b10), he manifests the proposition in this way. In
          demonstration the middles and the extremes must belong to the same
          genus. Now the extremes are contained in the conclusion: for the major
          extreme in the conclusion is its predicate, and the minor its subject.
          But the middle is contained in the premises. It is required,
          therefore, that the principles and conclusion be taken with respect to
          the same genus. When we add to this the fact that diverse sciences are
          of necessity concerned with subjects generically diverse, it follows
          that from the principles of one science, something in another science
          not under it may not be concluded.
        </p>
        <p>
          That the middles and extremes in a demonstration must be of one genus
          he proves thus: Suppose that a middle belongs to a genus other than
          that of the extremes which might be, for example, “triangle” and “have
          three angles equal to two right angles.” Now a proper attribute
          concluded of triangle is in it <i>per se</i> but is not in “brazen”
          <i>per se</i>; or, conversely, if the proper attribute is
          <i>per se</i> in “brazen,” say, “high-sounding” or the like, it is
          obviously in triangle <i>per accidens</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This example makes it plain that if the subject of the conclusion and
          the middle are in entirely different genera, then the proper attribute
          is either not in the middle <i>per se</i> or else not in the subject
          <i>per se</i>. Consequently, it is in one of them <i>per accidens</i>.
          If it is in the middle <i>per accidens</i>, something will be in the
          premises <i>per accidens</i>. But if it is in the subject
          <i>per accidens</i>, something will be <i>per accidens</i> in the
          conclusion: and this on the part of a proper attribute. But either way
          something will be <i>per accidens</i> in the premises, inasmuch as the
          subject is subsumed under the middle, for example, triangle under
          brazen, or vice versa. However, it has been previously established
          that in a demonstration both the conclusion and the premises are
          <i>per se</i> and not <i>per accidens</i>. It is required, therefore,
          in demonstrations that the middle and the extremes be of the same
          genus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (75b13) he infers two conclusions from the foregoing. The first
          conclusion is that no science demonstrates anything about the subject
          of another science, when this other science is more common than o
          entirely disparate from the first. Thus, geometry does not demonstrate
          that one and the same science deals with the both of two contraries:
          for contraries pertain to the common science, namely, to first
          philosophy or to dialectics. In like manner, geometry does not
          demonstrate that “two cubes are one cube,” i.e., that the product of
          one cube and another cube is a cube. “Cube” here means the number
          which results from multiply., ing a number by itself twice: for
          example, 8 is a cube, for it is the result 11of multiplying 2 by
          itself twice, for 2 times 2 times 2 are 8. Similarly,, 27 is a cube,
          whose root is 3, because 3 times 3 times 3 make 27. Now if 8 be
          multiplied by 27 the product is 216, which is a cube whose root is 6,
          because 6 times 6 times 6 make 216. Therefore, arithmetic, not,
          geometry has: the power to prove this. Similarly, that which pertains
          to one science cannot be proved by another science unless the one
          happens~, to be under the other, as optics is under geometry, and
          consonance or harmony, i.e., music, is under arithmetic.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second conclusion (75b17) states that a science cannot prove just
          any random accident of its subject, but the accidents proper to its
          genus Thus, if something belongs to lines not as lines or not
          according to th proper principles of lines, geometry does not
          demonstrate it of lines: for example, that a straight line is the most
          beautiful of lines, or whether straight line is contrary or not to the
          curved. For these matters are outside the proper genus of line and
          belong to something more general. For beauty and contrary transcend
          the genus of line.<br /></p

          >
        </p>
        <p>
          After concluding from the above that demonstration does not conclude
          from extraneous principles, the Philosopher intends to conclude
          something else from the above, namely, that demonstration is not of
          destructible things. Concerning this he does two things. First, he
          shows that demonstration is of eternal and not of destructible things.
          Secondly, he shows how it is of things that occur now and then
          (75b32). Concerning the first he does two things. First, he shows that
          demonstration is not of perishable but of eternal things. Secondly, he
          shows that the same is true of definition (75b30). In regard to the
          first he does two things. First, he proposes the intended conclusion.
          Secondly, he sets down the reason proving it (75b24).
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore first (75b21), he sets down two conclusions, one of which
          follows from the other. The first is that the conclusion of this
          demonstration which we are now discussing and which we can call
          demonstration in the full sense must be eternal: which, of course,
          follows from what has been stated so far, namely, that the
          propositions of a syllogism should be universal: which he signified by
          “said of all.” The second conclusion is that neither demonstration nor
          science is of destructible things, i.e., absolutely speaking, but only
          accidentally.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (75b24) he presents an argument to prove the proposed
          conclusions. It is this: It is not the character of a destructible
          non-eternal conclusion to contain what is universally so, but what is
          so for a time and in certain instances. For it has been established
          above that “said of all” contains two things, namely, that it is not
          such as to be so in one case and not in another, or so at one time and
          not at another. But in destructible things we find that at one time
          something is so and at another not so. Hence it is clear that “said of
          all” or “said universally” are not found in destructible things. But
          where a conclusion is not universal, at least one of the premises is
          not universal. Therefore, a destructible conclusion must have followed
          from premises, one of which is not universal. Accordingly, when we add
          to this the fact that demonstration absolutely must be from what is
          universal, it follows that a demonstration cannot have a destructible
          conclusion, but must have an eternal one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (75b30) he shows that definition, too, is not of destructible but
          of eternal things. The reason for this is that demonstration, both as
          to its principles and conclusions, is of eternal and not of
          destructible things. But a definition is either a principle of a
          demonstration, a conclusion of a demonstration, or a demonstration
          with a different ordering of its terms. Therefore, a definition is not
          of destructible, but of eternal things.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a better understanding of this passage it should be noted that it
          is possible to give different definitions of the same thing, depending
          on the different causes mentioned. But causes are arranged in a
          definite order to one another: for the reason of one is derived from
          another. Thus the reason of matter is derived from the form, for the
          matter must be such as the form requires. Again, the agent is the
          reason for the form: for since an agent produces something like unto
          itself, the mode of the form which results from the action must be
          according to the mode of the agent. Finally, it is from the end that
          the reason of the agent is derived, for every agent acts because of an
          end. Consequently, a definition which is formulated from the end is
          the reason and cause proving the other definitions which are
          formulated from the other causes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, let us lay down two definitions, one of which is formulated
          from the material cause, for example, that a house is a shelter
          composed of stones, cement and wood; the other being formulated from
          the final cause, namely, that a house is a shelter protecting us from
          the rain and heat and cold. Now the first definition can be
          demonstrated from the second in the following way: Every shelter
          protecting us from rain, heat and cold should be composed of wood,
          cement and stones; but a house is such a thing: therefore...
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus it is clear that the definition formulated from the end is the
          principle of the demonstration, whereas the one formulated from the
          matter is the conclusion of the demonstration. However, the two can be
          combined in the following way to form one definition: A house is a
          shelter composed of the aforesaid, protecting us from rain, cold and
          heat. But such a definition contains all the elements of a
          demonstration, namely, a middle and a conclusion. Accordingly, such a
          definition is a demonstration differing merely in the arrangement of
          its terms, because the only way it differs from the demonstration is
          that it is not arranged in a syllogistic mode and figure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here we might remark that because demonstration, as well as
          definition, is not of destructible but of eternal things, Plato was
          led to posit “Ideas.” For since sensible things are destructible, it
          appeared that there could be neither demonstration nor definition of
          them. As a consequence it seemed necessary to postulate certain
          indestructible substances concerning which demonstrations and
          definitions could be given. These eternal substances are what he calls
          “Forms” or “Ideas.”
        </p>
        <p>
          However, Aristotle opposed this opinion above, when he said that
          demonstration is not of destructible things except
          <i>per accidens</i>. For although those sensible things are
          destructible as individuals, nevertheless in the universal they have a
          certain everlasting status. Therefore, since demonstration beais on
          those sensible things universally and not individually, it follows
          that demonstration is not of destructible things except
          <i>per accidens</i>, but of eternal things <i>per se</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (75b32) he shows how there can be demonstration of things that
          occur now and then, saying “that there are science and demonstrations
          of things that occur frequently, as the eclipse of the moon,” which is
          not always. For the moon is not always being eclipsed, but only now
          and then. Now things that occur frequently, so far as they are such,
          i.e., so far as demonstrations are given concerning them, are always;
          but they are particular, so far as they are not always. But
          demonstration cannot be of particulars, as we have shown, but only of
          universals. Hence it is clear that these things, insofar as there is
          demonstration of them, are always. And as in the case of the eclipse
          of the moon, so in all kindred matters.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, there are certain differences to be noted among them. For
          some are not always with respect to time, but they are always in
          respect to their cause, because it never fails that under given
          conditions the effect follows, as in the eclipse of the moon. For the
          moon never fails to be eclipsed when the earth is diametrically
          interposed between sun and moon. But others happen not to be always
          even in respect to their causes, i.e., in those cases where the causes
          can be impeded. For it is not always that from a human seed a man with
          two hands is generated, but now and then a failure occurs, owing to a
          defect in the efficient cause or material cause. However, in both
          cases the demonstration must be so set up that a universal conclusion
          may be inferred from universal propositions by ruling out whatever can
          be an exception either on the part of time alone, or also of some
          cause.<br /></p

        </p>
        <p>
          Above the Philosopher showed that demonstration does not proceed from
          extraneous principles; here he shows that it does not proceed from
          common principles. Concerning this he does two things. First, he
          states his proposition. Secondly, he draws a conclusion from what he
          has said (76a17).
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerning the first he does two things. First (75b37), he states his
          intention, saying that since it is clear that it is not just through
          anything at random that something is demonstrated, but it is required
          that demonstration be from one or another of a thing’s principles in
          such a way that what is demonstrated be in line with what the thing as
          such is, i.e., it is required that the principles of the demonstration
          belong <i>per se</i> to that which is demonstrated; if, I say, this is
          so, then in order that something be scientifically known, it is not
          enough that it be demonstrated from true and immediate principles, but
          it is further required that it be demonstrated from proper principles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly (75b40), he proves his proposition, namely, that it is not
          enough to demonstrate something from true and immediate principles,
          because then something could be demonstrated in the way that Bryson
          proved squaring, i.e., the squaring of a circle. For he showed that
          some square is equal to a circle, using common principles in the
          following way: In any matter in which it is possible to have something
          greater and something less than something else, one can find something
          equal to it. Bu in the genus of squares it is possible to find one
          which is less than a given circle, namely, one inscribed in the
          circle, and another which is greater, namely, one circumscribed about
          the circle. Therefore, one can be found which is equal to the circle.
        </p>
        <p>
          But this proof is according to something common: for equal and greater
          and less transcend the genus of square and circle. Hence such
          characteristics demonstrate according to something common, because the
          middle is present in other things besides the one with which the
          demonstration is concerned. Therefore, such characteristics, since
          they belong to other things as well, do not belong to the things of
          which they are said as to proximate subjects. Consequently, one who
          knows through such characteristics does not know according to what the
          thing is as such, i.e., <i>per se</i>, but only <i>per accidens</i>.
          For if it were based on what the thing is according to itself, the
          demonstration would not apply to something of another genus. For we
          know a thing according to what it accidentally is, when we do not know
          it according to what it is in virtue of its own principles, i.e.,
          according to what comes <i>per se</i> from its principles, as “having
          three angles equal to two right angles” belongs <i>per se</i> to
          triangle, i.e., according to what it is in virtue of its principles.
          Consequently, if the middle which one used belonged <i>per se</i> to
          the conclusion, it would necessarily have to be in the same proximity,
          i.e., proximate according to genus, to the conclusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly (760), he excludes a doubt. For it sometimes happens that the
          middle of a demonstration is not in the same genus as the conclusion.
          How this can happen he shows when he suggests that if the middle is
          not in the same proximate genus as the conclusion, but is present in
          the way that theorems in harmonics, (i.e., in music), are demonstrable
          by arithmetic, it is nevertheless true that such things are also
          demonstrated. For in a lower science there is demonstration through
          the principles of a higher science, as we have established, just as in
          the higher science there is demonstration through the principles of
          that higher science.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there is this difference: on the part of the other science,
          namely, the lower one, there is only knowledge <i>quia</i> [i.e.,
          knowledge of the fact], for the generic subject of the lower science
          is different from the generic subject of the higher science, from
          which the principles are borrowed. But knowledge
          <i>propter quid</i> [i.e., of the cause why] is proper to the higher
          science to which those proper attributes belong <i>per se</i>. For
          since it is in virtue of the middle that a proper attribute is in a
          subject, that science will consider the <i>propter quid</i> to which
          pertains the middle in which the proper attribute being demonstrated
          inheres <i>per se</i>. But if the subject belongs to another science,
          it will not pertain to that science to know <i>propter quid</i> but
          only <i>quia</i>. Nor will the proper attribute demonstrated of such a
          subject belong <i>per se</i> to it, but it will be through an alien
          middle. However, if the middle and the subject pertain to the same
          science, then it will be characteristic of that science to know
          <i>quia</i> and <i>propter quid</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having settled this doubt, he draws the conclusion chiefly intended,
          saying that in the light of the foregoing it is clear that one should
          not demonstrate haphazardly, i.e., in any random way, but in such a
          way that a demonstration is made from the principles proper to each
          thing. But even the principles proper to the particular sciences have
          something common prior to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (76a17) he draws a conclusion that follows from the aforesaid.
          And in regard to this he does three things. First, he draws the
          conclusion that if demonstrations in the particular sciences do not
          proceed from common principles, and if the principles of those
          sciences have something prior to them which is common, then it is
          clear that it is not the business of each science to prove its proper
          principles. For those prior principles through which the proper
          principles of the particular sciences can be proved are principles
          common to all; and the science which considers such common principles
          is proper to all, i.e., is related to things which are common to all,
          as those other particular sciences are related to things respectively
          proper to each. For example, since the subject of arithmetic is
          number, arithmetic considers things proper to number. In like manner,
          first philosophy, which considers all principles, has for its subject
          “being,” which is common to all. Therefore, it considers the things
          proper to being (which are common to all) as proper to itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly (76a19), he shows the pre-eminence of this science which
          considers common principles, namely, first philosophy, over the
          others. For that through which something is proved must always be
          scientifically more known or at least more known. For one whose
          science of something proceeds from higher causes must understand those
          causes even better, because his science proceeded from the absolutely
          prior, since it is not through something caused that he knows these
          causes. For when one’s knowledge of causes proceeds from caused
          things, he does not derive his knowledge from the absolutely prior and
          better known, but from what is prior and better known in reference to
          us. But when the principles of a lower science are proved by the
          principles of a higher science, the process is not from caused things
          to causes, but conversely. Therefore, such a process must go from the
          absolutely prior and from the absolutely more known. Thus, those items
          of a higher science that are used in proving matters of a lower
          science must be more known. Furthermore, that by which all other
          things are proved and which is itself not proved by anything prior
          must be the most known. Consequently, a higher science will be science
          in a fuller sense than a lower; and the highest science, namely, first
          philosophy, will be science in the fullest sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly (7643), he returns to the principal conclusion and says that
          demonstration does not cross over into another genus except, as
          already mentioned, when a demonstration from geometry is applied to
          certain subordinate sciences, as the mechanical arts, which employ
          measurements, or the perspective arts, such as the sciences which deal
          with vision, as optics which deals with the visual. The same applies
          to arithmetic in relation to harmonics, i.e., music.<br /></p

        <p>
          After showing that demonstration does not proceed from common but from
          proper principles, the Philosopher, to elucidate this point, decides
          questions concerning proper and common principles. With respect to
          this he does two things.
        </p>
        <p>
          First (76a26), he shows the need for such a determination, saying that
          it is difficult to discern whether we know from proper principles,
          which alone is truly scientific knowing, or do not know from proper
          principles. For many believe that they know scientifically if they
          possess a syllogism composed of things true and first. But this is not
          so; indeed, to know in a scientific manner it is required that the
          principles be proximate to the things to be demonstrated—here they are
          called “first,” just as above they were called “extremes”—or proximate
          to the first indemonstrable principles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly (76a3l), he determines concerning proper and common
          principles. And in regard to this he does two things. First he
          determines concerning common and proper principles. Secondly, he shows
          how the demonstrative sciences are related to such principles (77a10)
          [L. 20]. Concerning the first he does two things. First, he
          distinguishes principles from non-principles. Secondly, he
          distinguishes the principles from each other(76a37).
        </p>
        <p>
          In regard to the first he does two things. First (76a3l), he shows
          what the principles are and says that the principles in any genus are
          those which, since they are true, happen not to be demonstrated,
          either not at all, if they are first principles, or at least not in
          that science in which they are accepted as principles. And he says,
          “the existence of which,” (i.e., whose truth), “cannot be proved,” to
          distinguish from the false which are not demonstrated in any science.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly (76a32), he shows the points of agreement and of difference
          between principles and non-principles. For principles agree with
          non-principles in the fact that with respect to each, i.e., with
          respect both to the first, namely, the principles, and to the things
          that proceed from them, i.e., things assumed from the principles, one
          must accept the supposition signify, because the
          <i>quod quid est</i> [that which the definition of what they
          signifies] of a thing pertains properly to the science concerned with
          substance, i.e., to first philosophy, from which all other sciences
          accept this.
        </p>
        <p>
          But they are unlike in the fact that in regard to the principles one
          must accept the supposition that they are, whereas in regard to things
          from principles one is required to demonstrate that they are. Thus in
          mathematics one accepts by supposing both what unity is (which is a
          principle) and what straight and triangle are (which are not
          principles but proper attributes): but the fact that unity is or that
          magnitude is, the mathematician accepts as principles; but the other
          things, namely, things that are from principles, he demonstrates. For
          he demonstrates that a triangle is equilateral, or that an angle is
          right, or even that this line is straight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (76a37) he distinguishes principles from one another. First, the
          proper from the common. Secondly, the common, one from the other
          (76b23) [L. 19]. The first is divided into two parts. First, he
          divides proper and common principles. Secondly, he settles something
          which might be doubtful (76b16).
        </p>
        <p>
          In regard to the first he does three things. First (76a37), he lays
          down a division, saying that “of the principles which we use in
          demonstrative sciences, some are proper to each single science but
          others common.” Then, because this statement might seem contrary to
          what he established above, namely, that demonstrative sciences do not
          proceed from common principles, he hastens to add that “the common
          principles are taken in each demonstrative science according to an
          analogy,” i.e., as proportionate to that science. And this is what he
          means when by way of explanation he further states that “it is useful”
          to accept such principles in the sciences insofar as they pertain to
          the genus of the subject which is investigated in that science.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly (76a40), he gives examples of each, saying that proper
          principles are, for example, that a line or a right angle is such and
          such. For in the sciences the definitions, both of the subject and of
          the proper attribute, are held as principles. But common principles
          are, for example, that if equals be subtracted from equals, the
          remainders are equal, and other common conceptions in the mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly (76a42), he shows how the demonstrative sciences use the
          aforesaid principles. First, in regard to the common principles, he
          says that “it suffices to accept each of those common ones,” so far as
          it pertains to the generic subject with which the science is
          concerned. For geometry does this if it takes the above-mentioned
          common principle not in its generality but only in regard to
          magnitudes, and arithmetic in regard to numbers. For the geometer will
          then be able to reach his conclusion by saying that if equal
          magnitudes be taken from equal magnitudes, the remaining magnitudes
          are equal, just as if he were to say that if equals are taken from
          equals, the remainders are equal. The same must also be said for
          numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly (76b2), he shows how the demonstrative sciences employ proper
          principles. And he says that proper principles are things supposed in
          the sciences as existing, namely, the subjects, whose proper
          attributes are investigated in the sciences. In this way arithmetic
          considers unities, and geometry considers “signs,” i.e., points, and
          lines. For they suppose these things to be and to be this, i.e., they
          suppose of them <i>that they are</i> and <i>what they are</i>. But in
          regard to the proper attributes they suppose what each signifies. Thus
          arithmetic supposes <i>what</i> “even” is and <i>what</i> “odd” is and
          what a “square or cubic number” is. Similarly, geometry supposes
          <i>what</i> is rational in lines. (For a rational line is one about
          which we can reason, the line being given. For example, a rational
          line is any line commensurable with the given lines; but one which is
          incommensurable with it is called irrational and surd). In like
          manner, geometry supposes <i>what</i> a reflex or <i>what</i> a curved
          line are. However, these sciences demonstrate concerning all the
          above-mentioned proper attributes that they are, and they do so
          through common principles and principles demonstrated from the common
          principles. And what has been said 6f geometry and arithmetic should
          also be understood of astronomy.
        </p>
        <p>
          For every demonstrative science is concerned with three things: one is
          the generic subject whose <i>per se</i> attributes are investigated;
          another is the common (axioms) dignities from which, as from basic
          truths, it demonstrates; the third are the proper attributes
          concerning which each science supposes <i>what</i> their names
          signify.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (76b16) he clarifies something about which there might be doubt.
          For since he had said that the sciences suppose concerning the
          principles <i>that</i> they are and concerning the proper attributes
          <i>what</i> they are, but concerning the subject both <i>that</i> it
          is and <i>what</i> it is, someone might believe that he should have
          made special mention of all these. Hence he removes this by saying
          that nothing hinders certain sciences from neglecting some of the
          aforesaid, i.e., from making express mention of them, as for example,
          not mentioning that it takes the existence of its generic subject for
          granted, if it is already obvious that it does exist. For we not have
          the same evidence in all cases that they do exist, as we do in the
          case of number and in the case of hot and cold, the one being close to
          reason and the other to sense. Again, certain sciences do not suppose
          what the proper attributes signify in the sense of making express
          mention of them, just as they do not think it necessary always to make
          express mention of the common principles, because they are known. Be
          that as it may, the three above-mentioned items are naturally to be
          supposed in each science.<br /></p

        <p>
          After dividing common principles from proper principles, Aristotle now
          distinguishes among the common principles.
        </p>
        <p>
          His treatment f Is into three parts. In the first he lays down a
          distinction among the common principles. In the second he shows the
          difference between a definition and a certain genus of common
          principles (76b35). In the third he excludes an error (77a5).
          Concerning the first he does two things. First, he distinguishes the
          common conceptions in the mind from postulates or suppositions.
          Secondly, he distinguishes among the latter (76b27).
        </p>
        <p>
          With respect to the first (76b23) it should be noted that the common.
          conceptions in the mind have something in common with the other
          principles of demonstration and something proper: something common,
          because both they and the others must be true in virtue of themselves.
          But what is proper to the former is that it is necessary not only that
          they be true of themselves but that they be seen to be such. For no
          one can think their contraries. He says, therefore, that that
          principle of which it is not only required that it be in virtue of
          itself but further required that it be seen, namely, a common
          conception in the mind or a dignity, is neither a postulate nor a
          supposition.
        </p>
        <p>
          He proves this in the following way: A postulate and a supposition can
          be confirmed by a reason from without, i.e., by some argumentation;
          but a common conception in the mind does not bear on a reason from
          without (because it cannot be proved by any argument), but bears on
          that reason which is in the soul, because it is made known at once by
          the natural light of reason. That it does not bear on any reason from
          without is shown by the fact that a syllogism is not formed to prove
          such common conceptions of the mind. Furthermore, that these are not
          made known by an outward reason but by the inward he proves by the
          fact that it is possible to contest an outward reason, either truly or
          apparently, but it is not always possible to do so with the inward
          reason. This is so because nothing is so true that it cannot be denied
          orally. (For even this most evident principle that the same thing
          cannot be and not be has been orally denied by some). On the other
          hand, some things are so true that their opposites cannot be conceived
          by the intellect. Therefore, they cannot be challenged in the inward
          reason but only by an outward reason which is by the voice. Such are
          the common conceptions in the mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (76b27) he distinguishes suppositions and postulates from one
          another. Here, too, it should be noted that they have something in
          common and something in which they differ. What is common to them is
          that although they can be demonstrated, the demonstrator assumes them
          without demonstrating, chiefly because they are not demonstrable by
          his own science but by another, as explained above. Hence they are
          reckoned among the immediate principles because the demonstrator uses
          them without a middle, since they do not have a middle in that
          science.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet they do differ, because if such a proposition is accepted as
          reasonable by the pupil to whom a demonstration is being made, it is
          called a “Supposition.” In that case it is not called a supposition
          absolutely, but relative to him. But if the pupil has no reason for or
          against the proposition, the demonstrator must request him to admit it
          as reasonable, and then it is called a “postulate.” However, if the
          pupil has a contrary opinion, then it will be a “question,” which must
          be settled between them. At any rate, what is common to all of them is
          that the demonstrator uses each of thein without demonstrating,
          although they are demonstrable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (76b35) he distinguishes definitions from suppositions with two
          reasons, the second of which begins at (77a3). In regard to the first
          he does two things.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, he presents this reason: Every postulate or supposition
          declares something to be or not to be; but terms, i.e., definitions,
          do not declare that something is or is not. Terms, therefore, taken by
          themselves, are neither postulates nor suppositions. But when they are
          employed in propositions they are suppositions, as in the statement,
          “Man is a rational mortal animal.” But terms taken by themselves are
          only understood; and understanding is not supposing, any more than
          hearing is. Rather supposition bears on things that exist such that a
          conclusion Js made from them in regard to what they are, i.e., in
          virtue of the premises.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly (76b39), he excludes a doubt. For there were some who said
          that a geometer uses a false supposition when he says that a line not
          one foot long is one foot long, or that a line traced in the sand is
          straight when it really is not. But he says that a geometer does not
          on this account suppose something false. For since the geometer
          demonstrates nothing of singulars but of universals, as explained
          above, and these lines are singulars, it is obvious that he is not
          demonstrating anything about these lines or from these lines; rather
          he is using them as examples of the universals (which are understood
          by examples) from which and about which he demonstrates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (77a3) he presents the second reason which is this: Every
          supposition or postulate is in whole or in part, i.e., is either a
          universal proposition or a particular. But definitions are neither of
          these, because nothing is placed or predicated in them universally or
          particularly. Therefore...
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (77a5) he shows from the foregoing that it is not necessary to
          posit “Ideas,” as Plato did. For it was shown above that
          demonstrations are concerned with universals and in that sense with
          eternal things. Therefore, it is not necessary for the validity of
          demonstration that there be “Forms,” i.e., “Ideas,” or a “one outside
          the many,” as Plato posited separated mathematical beings along with
          Ideas in order that thereby demonstrations might bear on eternal
          things. What is required is that there be “one in many and about
          many,” if there is to be demonstration, because it will not be
          universal unless it is “one about many.” And if it is not universal,
          there will not be a middle of demonstration and, consequently, no
          demonstration.
        </p>
        <p>
          That the middle of a demonstration must be universal is plain from the
          fact that the middle of a demonstration must be some one same thing
          predicated of many not equivocally but according to the same aspect,
          which is a universal aspect. But if it should happen to be equivocal,
          a defect in reasoning would occur.<br /></p

        <p>
          After determining about proper and common principles, the Philosopher
          now shows how the demonstrative sciences behave in regard to the
          common and to the proper principles. His treatment falls into two
          parts. In the first he shows how the demonstrative sciences are
          related to common principles. In the second he shows how they are
          related to proper principles (77a36) [L. 21]. Concerning the first he
          does two things. First, he shows how the demonstrative sciences are
          related to the first of the common principles. Secondly, how they are
          related generally to all the common principles (77a29). Concerning the
          first he does two things. First, he shows how the demonstrative
          sciences behave relative to the principle that one should not affirm
          and deny the same thing. Secondly, how they behave relative to the
          principle that there is either true affirmation or true negation of
          each thing, for, as is proved in <i>Metaphysics</i> IV, these two
          principles are the first of all principles (77a22).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (77a10) that no demonstration makes use of the
          principle that one does not affirm and deny at one and the same time.
          For if a demonstration were to use it to show some conclusion, it
          would have to use it in such a way as to assert that the first, i.e.,
          the major, extreme is affirmed of the middle and not denied; because
          if it were to admit affirmation and negation on the part of the
          middle, it would make no difference whether it was this way or that.
          And the same reasoning holds for the third, i.e., minor, extreme in
          relation to the middle. For example, take “animal” as the first, “man”
          as the middle’ and “Callias” as the third. If someone wished to use
          this principle in a demonstration, he would have to argue in the
          following way:
        </p></a
      >
    </dd>

    <dd>
      <a name="20" id="20">Every man is an animal and is not a non-animal;</a>
    </dd>

    <dd>
      <a name="20" id="20">But Callias is a man:</a>
    </dd>

    <dd>
      <a name="20" id="20"
        >Therefore, Callias is an animal and is not a non-animal.
        <p>
          For when we say that every man is an animal, it matters not whether it
          is also true that a non-man is an animal, or whether it is not true.
          Similarly, in the conclusion it matters not, Callias being an animal,
          whether nonCallias is an animal or not.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the reason for this is that the first is not limited to being said
          only *of the middle but can also be said of something else diverse
          from the middle and described by a negation of the riliddle (since the
          first is sometimes said of things other than the middle, as “animal”
          is said of things other than man; for it is said of horse, which is
          not man). Hence if the middle is taken the same and not the same,
          i.e., if an affirmative and a negative middle be taken, as when I say,
          “man” and “non-man” are animals, it contributes nothing to the
          conclusion. However, if the affirmation and negation are taken on the
          part of the major extreme, it does make a difference both as to the
          conclusion and as to the truth of the premises. For if man were not an
          animal, it would not be true that man is an animal, nor would it
          follow that Callias is an animal. Yet nothing more is verified by
          stating that man is an animal and is not a non-animal than by merely
          stating that man is an animal, for the same thing is conveyed by each.
          And thus it is clear that demonstrations do not use the principle that
          affirmation and negation are not simultaneously true, either on the
          part of the predicate or on the part of the subject.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (77a22) he shows how demonstrative sciences use the principle
          that “of anything there is either true affirmation or negation.” And
          he says that this principle is utilized in a demonstration leading to
          the impossible. For in this demonstration something is proved to be
          true by the fact that its opposite is false. (This of course would
          never happen, if it were possible for the two opposites to be false).
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless such a demonstration does not always employ this
          principle, for sometimes that opposite which is shown to be false is
          not a negation but an immediate contrary. For example, if a number
          were shown to be even on the ground that its opposite, namely, “it is
          odd,” is false, and this were done by leading to the impossible.
          Neither does it use this principle universally, i.e., in its
          universality, namely, under the terms “being” and “non-being,” but
          only so far as is sufficient for a genus or so far as it is narrowed
          to a generic subject. And I mean the first genus involved in the
          demonstration. For example, in leading to the impossible in geometry
          the terms would be “straight” and “non-straight” in the case where it
          is shown that some line is straight on the ground that it is false to
          state that it is not straight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (77a26) he shows how the sciences as a community function
          relative to all common principles. In regard to this he does two
          things. First, he says that all the sciences share alike in the common
          principles in the sense that they all use them as items from which
          they demonstrate-which is to use them as principles. But they do not
          use them as things about which they demonstrate something, i.e., as
          subjects, or as things which they demonstrate, i.e., as conclusions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly (77a29), he shows that certain sciences employ the common
          principles in a manner other than has been described. For dialectics
          is concerned with common things, and a certain other science is
          concerned with common things, namely, first philosophy, whose subject
          is being and which considers the things which follow upon being as the
          proper attributes of being. Yet it should be noted that dialectics is
          concerned with common things under an aspect different from logic and
          first philosophy. For first philosophy is concerned with common things
          because its consideration is focused on those common things, namely,
          on being and on the parts and attributes of being. But because reason
          occupies itself with all things that are, and logic studies the
          operations of reason, logic will also be concerned with matters common
          to all things, i.e., with reason’s intentionalities which bear on all
          things, but not in such a way that logic has these common things as
          its subject-for logic considers as its subject the syllogism,
          enunciation, predication, and things of that type.
        </p>
        <p>
          But although the part of logic which is demonstrative is engaged in
          teaching about common intentionalities, the use of a demonstrative
          science does not consist in proceeding from common intentionalities to
          show anything about the things which are the subjects of the other
          sciences. But dialectics does this, for it goes from common intentions
          and argues to things that pertain to other sciences, whether they be
          proper or common things, but mainly common things. Thus, it argues
          that hatred is in the concupiscible appetite, because love is, on the
          ground that contraries are concerned with a same thing. Consequently,
          dialectics is concerned with common things not only because it treats
          concerning the common intentionalities of reason, which is common to
          all logic, but also because it argues about common characteristics of
          things. But any science that argues about the common characteristics
          of things must argue about the common principles, because the truth of
          the common principles is made manifest from the knowledge of common
          terms, as “being” and “non-being,” “whole” and “part” and the like.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is significant that he says, “and any science which might attempt,”
          because first philosophy does not demonstrate the common principles,
          since they are absolutely indemonstrable, although some have
          unwittingly attempted to demonstrate them, as is stated in
          <i>Metaphysics</i> IV. Or else, because even though they cannot,
          strictly speaking, be demonstrated, the first philosopher attempts to
          uphold them in a way that is possible, namely, by contradicting those
          who deny them, appealing to things that must be conceded by them,
          though not to things which are more known.
        </p>
        <p>
          It should also be noted that the first philosopher demonstrates them
          not only in this way, but also shows something about them as about
          subjects: for example, that “it is impossible for the mind to think
          their opposites,” as is clear from <i>Metaphysics</i> IV. Therefore’
          although both the first philosopher and the dialectician debate about
          these first principles, yet one does so in one way and the other in
          another way. For the dialectician neither proceeds from demonstrative
          principles nor takes only one side of a contradiction but is open to
          both. For each side might happen to be probable or be upheld by
          probable statements, which the dialectician utilizes: and that is why
          he asks [his questions in terms of two alternatives]. But the
          demonstrator does not ask [in that way], because he is not open to
          opposites. And this is the difference between the two, as was laid
          down in the treatment of the syllogism, namely, in the beginning of
          the <i>Prior Analytics</i>. Therefore, first philosophy in treating
          common principles proceeds after the manner of a demonstration and not
          after the manner of a dialectical disputation.<br /></p

        <p>
          After showing how demonstrative sciences function in relation to
          common principles, the Philosopher now shows how they employ proper
          principles. And his treatment falls into two parts. In the first he
          shows that in each science there are questions, responses and
          disputations peculiar to each. In the second he shows how in each
          science there are deceptions, peculiar to each (77b16) [L. 22].
          Concerning the first he does two things. First, he, shows that in each
          science there are its own questions. Secondly, that each science
          employs the responses and disputations proper to it (77b6). Concerning
          the first he does two things. First, he shows that in each science
          there are questions peculiar to each. Secondly, what these are
          (77a42).
        </p>
        <p>
          He shows the first (77a36) in the following way: A syllogistic
          question and a proposition which takes one definite side of a
          contradiction are the same as to content, but they have not the same
          function. For the answer which one gives to the question is made to
          serve as a proposition in some syllogism. But in each of the sciences,
          the propositions from which a syllogism is formed, are peculiar to it,
          for it has been shown that every science proceeds from things proper
          to it. Therefore, in each science there are questions peculiar to it.
          Hence not any random question is pertinent to geometry or to medicine
          or to some one of the other sciences.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, it should be noted that questioning occurs one way in
          demonstrative sciences and another way in dialectics. For in
          dialectics not only the conclusion but also the premises are open to
          question; but in demonstrative sciences the demonstrator takes
          premises as <i>per se</i> known or proved by such principles. Hence,
          he asks only about the conclusion. And when he has demonstrated it, he
          uses it as a proposition to demonstrate some other conclusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (77a42) he explains which questions are peculiar to each science.
          First, insofar as they are taken as propositions from which the
          demonstrator proceeds. Secondly, when taken as conclusions (77b2).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (77a42) that geometric questions are ones from
          which something is demonstrated pertaining to matters of geometry or
          pertaining to matters demonstrated from the principles of geometry—for
          example, the ones from which something is demonstrated in optical
          science, i.e., perspective, which proceeds from the principles of
          geometry. And what is said of geometry applies to other sciences,
          namely, that a proposition or question is peculiar to a science, if it
          is one from which a demonstration in that science or in a subalternate
          science proceeds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (77b2) he analyzes geometric questions insofar as they are
          conclusions, saying that solutions to geometric questions must be
          proved by demonstrating their truth from geometric principles and from
          conclusions already demonstrated by those principles. (For sometimes
          the proofs of certain geometric demonstrations are not drawn from the
          first principles of geometry, but from matters concluded from those
          first principles). Hence when it is a matter of questions which are
          always conclusions in demonstrative sciences, the proof can be
          obtained in the science itself, but the proof of the principles cannot
          be drawn from geometry qua geometry. The same also applies to other
          sciences. For no science proves its own principles, as we have
          explained above. And he says, “from geometry qua geometry,” because it
          may happen that a science proves its own principles, insofar as that
          science assumes the principles of another science, as a geometer
          proves his own principles insofar as he assumes the role of first
          philosopher, i.e., of metaphysician.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (77b6) he shows that each has its own responses and disputations.
          First, that each has its own responses. Secondly, its own disputations
          (77b8).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore (77b6) that from the foregoing it is clear that each
          scientific knower does not ask just any question whatever. Hence it is
          also clear that he will not answer just any random question but only
          those which conform to his own science on the ground that a question
          and its answer pertain to the same science.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (77b8) because disputations are concerned with a question and its
          answer, he shows that there are disputations - peculiar to each
          science, saying that if geometer disputes with geometer precisely as
          geometer, i.e., in matters pertaining to geometry, then obviously the
          disputation goes well so long as the disputation not only concerns a
          point of geometry but proceeds from the principles of geometry. But it
          does not go well, if the disputation in geometry does not proceed
          along these lines. For if someone disputes with a geometer in matters
          alien to geometry, he does not argue, i.e., does not convince, except
          accidentally: for example, if the dispute concerns music, and the
          geometer accidentally happens to be a musician. Hence it is clear that
          one should not dispute in geometry about matters not geometric,
          because it will not be possible to judge by the principles of that
          science whether the dispute went favorably or unfavorably: and the
          same holds for other sciences.<br /></p

          >
        </p>
        <p>
          After showing that each science has its own questions, responses and
          disputations, the Philosopher shows that each science has its own
          deceptions and errors. And his treatment is divided into two parts. In
          the first he raises certain questions. In the second he solves them
          (77b21).
        </p>
        <p>
          Accordingly, he poses three questions, the first of which (77b16) is
          this: Since there are geometric questions, as we have shown, are there
          not also non-geometric ones? And what is asked of geometry can be
          asked of every other science.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (77b17) he poses the second question, namely: May questions which
          arise from ignorance bearing on some particular science be called
          geometric; and likewise for questions proper to any other science?
          (Questions arising from ignorance bearing on some science are those
          which ask about matters contrary to the truths of that science).
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (77b19) he poses the third question, namely: In each science it
          is possible to be deceived by a syllogism which he calls “according to
          ignorance.” But deception through a syllogism can occur in two ways:
          in one way when it fails as to form, not observing the correct form
          and mode of a syllogism. In another way, when it fails in matter,
          proceeding from the false. Now there is a difference between these two
          ways, because one that fails in matter is still a syllogism, since
          everything is observed that pertains to the form of a syllogism. But
          one that fails in form is not even a syllogism, but a paralogism,
          i.e., an apparent syllogism. In dialectics, deception can occur in
          both these ways. Hence in <i>Topics</i> I Aristotle speaks of the
          contentious, which is a syllogism, and of the one defective in form
          which is not a syllogism but an apparent one. Hence the question is
          this: Whether or not a syllogism of ignorance which is used in the
          demonstrative sciences is a syllogism based on matters opposed to the
          science, i.e., one that proceeds from false premises, or a paralogism,
          namely, one that fails in form, which is not a syllogism, but an
          apparent one?
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (77b21) he solves these questions. First, he solves the first
          Secondly, the second (77b23). Thirdly, the third (77b27).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (77b21) that a completely non-geometric
          question is one which is formed entirely from another art, say, music.
          For example, if one asks in geometry whether a tone could be divided
          into two equal semi-tones, such a question would be entirely
          non-geometric, because it concerns matters which do not pertain at all
          to geometry.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (77b23) he solves the second question, saying that a question
          about geometry, i.e., about matters pertinent to geometry, when a
          person is asked about something which is against the truth of geometry
          (for example, if the questions concerned parallels meeting, i.e.,
          equidistant lines coming together), would be geometric in one sense
          and non-geometric in another. For just as <i>arrythmon</i>, i.e.,
          without rhythm or sound, can be taken in two senses: in one sense for
          that which has no sound at all, as wool, and in another sense for that
          which does not give a good sound, as a poorly-sounding bell, so a
          question is called non-geometric in two ways. In one way, because it
          is completely alien to geometry, as a question about music. In another
          way, because it mistakenly holds something in the field of geometry,
          namely, because it holds something contrary to geometric truth.
          Therefore, the question about the convergence of parallel lines is
          non-geometric not in the first way, since it touches on a point of
          geometry, but in the second way, because it is mistaken about some
          point of geometry. Such ignorance, namely, which consists in wrongly
          using the principles of geometry is contrary to the truth of geometry.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (77b27) he solves the third question. And he does two things.
          First, he shows that in demonstrative sciences there is no paralogism
          in language. Secondly, nor apart from language (77b34).
        </p>
        <p>
          Now although paralogism. in language occurs in any of six sophistical
          ways, he takes one of them, namely, the paralogism which proceeds by
          way of equivocation, and shows that such,a paralogism cannot occur in
          demonstrative sciences, being easier to detect. He says, therefore,
          that “formal paralogism,” i.e., a syllogism defective in form, as in
          dialectics, “does not occur in the disciplines.” For in a
          demonstrative syllogism the middle must always be the same in two
          ways, i.e., the same middle must be compared to the two extremes: for
          the major extreme is predicated universally of the middle, and the
          middle is predicated universally of the minor extreme, even though
          when it is predicated, we do not say “every,” i.e., the sign of
          universality is not applied to the predicate.
        </p>
        <p>
          But in the fallacy of equivocation the middle is the same according to
          vocal sound but not according to reality. Consequently, it escapes
          notice when it is proposed orally; but if it is demonstrated to the
          senses, the deception cannot succeed. For example, the name “circle”
          is said equivocally of a figure and a poem. Therefore, in reasons,
          i.e., in argumentations, the ambiguity may go unnoticed, i.e.,
          deception is possible, as for example, if one were to say: “Every
          circle is a figure; Homer’s poem is a circle: therefore, Homer’s poem
          is a figure.” But if a circle is drawn for someone to look at, there
          cannot be deception. For it will be obvious that songs are not
          circles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now just as in this case the deception is prevented by presenting the
          middle to the senses, so in demonstrative syllogisms, deception is
          prevented by the fact that the middle is shown to the intellect. For
          when something is defined, it is as plain to the intellect as
          something sensibly drawn is plain to the sight. Hence he says that in
          demonstrative syllogisms “these,” i.e., things defined, “are seen by
          the intellect.” But in demonstrations one always proceeds from
          definitions. Hence, deception through equivocation has no place there,
          much less through any of the other fallacies of language.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (77b34) he shows that in demonstrative syllogisms paralogism
          according to fallacy outside of language cannot occur. And because a
          paralogism of this kind is frequently challenged by citing an
          objection, through which the defect in the form of syllogizing is
          shown: therefore: First, he shows how an objection should be presented
          in demonstrative matters. Secondly, he shows that in demonstrative
          matters there cannot be paralogism according to fallacy outside the
          language (77b40).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (77b34) that “one should not bring an
          objection against it,” i.e., against a paralogism. by citing an
          inductive, i.e., particular, proposition. (For an induction proceeds
          from particulars as a syllogism proceeds from universals). The reason
          for this is that in demonstrative matters no proposition is admitted
          unless it is verified in the greater number of cases, for if it is not
          verified in the greater number it will not be in all. But a
          demonstrative syllogism must proceed from universals. Therefore, it is
          obvious that in demonstrative matters an objection must be universal,
          because the propositions and the objections must be the same. For in
          dialectical and in demonstrative matters that which is taken as an
          objection is later used as a proposition to syllogize against the one
          who proposed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (77b40) he shows that in demonstrative matters deception through
          paralogisms outside of language does not occur. And just as above he
          showed that there was no paralogism in language in demonstrative
          matters by showing it for one, namely, for the paralogism which
          employs the fallacy of equivocation, so now he shows that in
          demonstrative matters there is not paralogism outside of language by
          showing it of the one which relies on fallacy of consequent. For it is
          obvious that paralogism. in demonstrative matters cannot occur
          according to the other fallacies outside of language: not the fallacy
          according to accident, because demonstration proceeds from things that
          are <i>per se</i>; nor according to qualified and absolute, because
          the statements used in demonstrations are taken universally and
          always, and without qualification.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, he does two things in regard to his thesis. First, he shows
          how paralogism according to fallacy of consequent works. Secondly,
          that deception does not take place in this manner in demonstrative
          matters (78a5).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (77b40) that “illogical arguments do sometimes
          occur,” i.e., do not observe syllogistic form, “because they admit
          both inherences,” i.e., they accept a middle predicated affirmatively
          of each extreme, which is the same as syllogizing in the second figure
          but employing two affirmative propositions, thus committing the
          fallacy of consequent. This is what the philosopher Caeneus did in
          order to show that “fire is in multiple proportion,” i.e., that fire
          is generated in greater quantity than was the body from which it is
          generated, on the ground that fire, being the most rarified of bodies,
          is generated from other bodies through rarefaction. Hence it is
          required that the matter of the previous body be spread out under
          larger dimensions when assuming the form of fire. To prove this he
          used the following syllogism: “Whatever is generated in multiplied
          proportion is generated quickly; but fire is generated quickly:
          therefore, fire is generated in multiplied proportion.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (78a5) he shows that deception arising from this form of
          reasoning does not occur in demonstrative sciences. In regard to this
          he does two things. First, he makes it clear that this form of
          syllogizing does not always end in deception, saying that according to
          this form of arguing there are cases when one cannot syllogize from
          the premises, namely, when the terms are not convertible-for it does
          not follow, if every man is an animal, that every animal is a man. But
          now and then there are cases when one can syllogize, namely, when the
          terms are convertible. For just as it follows that if a thing is a
          man, it is a rational mortal animal, so conversely, if a thing is a
          rational mortal animal, it is a man. However, it does not seem to
          follow syllogistically, because the due form of a syllogism is not
          observed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly (78a7), he shows that it is possible to syllogize in the
          abovementioned manner without deception. And he shows this in three
          ways, the first of which is this: According to the above-mentioned
          manner of syllogizing, deception occurs because the consequence which
          was assumed convertible is not converted. But in this situation
          deception would not occur, if to the extent that the conclusion is
          true, so are the premises true: for there will then be no deception in
          converting. For if it is stated of Socrates that he is a man,
          therefore he is an animal; no deception or falsity follows: but it
          does if it is argued conversely that he is an animal, therefore he is
          a man.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if the premise is true and the conclusion false, then deception
          occurs in converting. For example, if I were to say: “If an ass is a
          man, it is an animal; therefore, if it is an animal, it is a man.”
          Consequently, if it were impossible to deduce the true from the false,
          and it were always necessary to deduce the true from the true, then it
          would be easy to analyze a conclusion into its principles without
          deception, because there would be no falsity if either of the premises
          were to be inferred from the conclusion. On this supposition the
          conclusion and premises would be converted of necessity as to truth.
          For just as the conclusion is true if the premise is true, so vice
          versa. For suppose that A is, and granting this, suppose that the same
          things follow as are known by me to be true, say B. Hence since both
          are true, I can then also infer A from B. And so, one reason why
          deception through fallacy of consequent does not occur in
          demonstrative sciences is that it is impossible in demonstrative
          sciences for the true to be syllogized from the false, as we have
          explained above.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (78a10) he gives the second reason. For in cases of convertible
          terms, deception through fallacy of consequent does not occur, because
          in those cases the consequent is converted. Now the things which are
          used in mathematical, i.e., in demonstrative sciences, are for the
          most part convertible, because these sciences do not admit as a middle
          anything predicated <i>per accidens</i>, but only definitions which
          are principles of demonstration, as we have explained. And this is
          their point of difference from the statements in dialogues, i.e., in
          dialectical syllogisms, in which accidens are frequently admitted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (78a13) he gives the third reason and it is this: In
          demonstrative sciences there are determinate principles from which one
          proceeds to the conclusions. Hence it is possible to return from the
          conclusions to the principles as from something determinate to
          something determinate. That demonstrations do proceed from determinate
          principles he shows by the fact that “demonstrations are not increased
          by middles,” i.e., in demonstrations one does not use a series of
          different middle terms to demonstrate one conclusion. (This, of
          course, is to be understood of demonstrations <i>propter quid</i>, of
          which he is speaking). For of one effect there can be but one sole
          cause why it is.
        </p>
        <p>
          But although demonstrations are not increased by using several middles
          of demonstration, nevertheless they are increased in two ways: in one
          way, “by assuming one after another,” i.e., subsuming one middle under
          another, say B under A, C under B, D under C, and so on. For example,
          when “having three angles equal to two right angles” is proved of
          triangle on the ground that it is a figure having an external angle
          equal to the two opposite interior angles, and is then proved of
          isosceles on the ground that it is a triangle. Another way they are
          increased is laterally, as when A is proved of C and of E. For
          example, “Every quantified number is either finite or infinite.” Let A
          be this predicate, i.e., “to be finite or infinite.” But an odd number
          is a quantified number. Let B represent “quantified number,” and C,
          “odd number.” It follows therefore, that A (to be finite or infinite)
          is predicated of C (odd number), i.e., that an odd number is either a
          finite or an infinite number. And he says that it is possible along
          the same lines to conclude concerning even number, and this through
          the same middle.
        </p>
        <p>
          The passage (78aI3), which begins, “A science expands,” can be
          introduced in another way. Since he had just said that in
          demonstrative matters, definitions are used for middles, and since
          there is one sole definition of one thing, it follows that it is not
          through middles that, demonstrations are increased.<br /></p

          >
        </p>
        <p>
          After determining about demonstration <i>propter quid</i>, the
          Philosopher here shows the difference between demonstration
          <i>quia</i> and demonstration <i>propter quid</i>. And he does two
          things about this. First, he shows how they differ in the same
          science. Secondly, in diverse sciences (78b33) [L. 25]. Concerning the
          first he does two things. First, he states the twofold difference
          between the two in the same science. Secondly, he clarifies this with
          examples (78a30).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (78a22) that, as said above, demonstration is
          a syllogism causing scientific knowledge and proceeds from the causes
          both first and immediate of a thing. Now this is to be understood as
          referring to demonstration <i>propter quid</i>. But there is a
          difference between knowing that a thing is so and why it is so.
          Therefore, since demonstration is a syllogism causing scientific
          knowledge, as has been said, it is necessary that a demonstration
          <i>quia</i> which makes one know that a thing is so should differ from
          the demonstration <i>propter quid</i> which makes one know why.
          Consequently, this difference must be considered first in the same
          science and later in sciences that are diverse.
        </p>
        <p>
          In one and the same science each of the above is said to differ in
          regard to the two things required for demonstration in the strict
          sense—which causes knowledge of the why—namely, that it be from causes
          and from immediate causes. Hence one way that scientific knowledge
          <i>quia</i> differn from <i>propter quid</i> is that it is the former
          if the syllogism is not through, immediate principles but through
          mediate ones. For in that case the first cause will not be employed,
          whereas science <i>propter quid</i> is according to the first cause;
          consequently, the former will not be science <i>propter quid</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          It differs in another way, because it is science <i>quia</i> when the
          syllogism, although not through middles, i.e., mediate, but through
          immediate things, is not through the cause but through “convertence,”
          i.e., through effects convertible and immediate. Hence a demonstration
          of this kind is through the better known, namely, to us; otherwise it
          would not effect scientific knowledge. For we do not reach a knowledge
          of the unknown except through something better known. However in the
          case of two things equally predicable, i.e., convertible, one of which
          is the cause and the other the effect, there is nothing to preclude
          that now and then the better known will not be the cause but the
          effect. For sometimes the effect is better known than the cause both
          in respect to us and according to sense-perception, although
          absolutely and according to nature the cause is the better known.
          Consequently, through an effect better known than the cause there can
          be demonstration which does not engender <i>propter quid</i> knowledge
          but only <i>quia</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (78a30) he clarifies these differences by examples. And this is
          divided into two parts. In the first he develops an example of the
          demonstration <i>quia</i> which is through an effect. In the second of
          demonstration <i>quia</i> which is through a mediate cause (78b13) [L.
          24]. The first is divided into two parts. In the first he gives an
          example of a syllogism which is through a convertible effect. In the
          second of a syllogism through a nonconvertible effect (78b10). The
          first is divided into two parts according to the two examples he
          gives, the second of which begins at (78b3). Concerning the first he
          does two things. First, he gives an example of demonstration
          <i>quia</i> which is through an effect. Secondly, he states when it
          can be converted into a demonstration <i>propter quid</i> (78a39).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (78a30) that demonstration <i>quia</i> is
          through an effect if one concludes for example that the planets are
          near because they do not twinkle. For non-twinkling is not the cause
          why the planets are near, but vice versa: for the planets do not
          twinkle because they are near. For the fixed stars twinkle because in
          gazing at them the sight is beclouded on account of the distance.
          Therefore, the syllogism might be formed in the following way:
          “Whatever does not twinkle is near; but the planets do not twinkle:
          therefore, they are near.” Here we let C be the planets, i.e., let
          “planets” be the minor extreme, and let B consist in not twinkling,
          and A “to be near” be the major extreme. Then the proposition, “Every
          C is B,” is true, namely, the planets do not twinkle. Also it is true
          that “Every B is A,” i.e., every star that does not twinkle is near.
          Rowever, the truth of such a proposition must be obtained through
          induction or through sense perception, because the effect here is
          better known than the cause. And so, the conclusion, “Every C is A,”
          follows. In this way, then, it has been demonstrated that the planets,
          i.e., the wandering stars, are near. Consequently, this syllogism is
          not <i>propter quid</i> but <i>quia</i>. For it is not because they do
          not twinkle that planets are iiear but rather, because they are near,
          they do not twinkle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (78a39) he teaches how a demonstration <i>quia</i> is changed to
          a demonstration <i>propter quid</i>. And he says that “it is possible
          to demonstrate the one through the other,” i.e., to demonstrate that
          they do not twinkle, because they are near. Then the demonstration
          will be <i>propter quid</i>. Thus let C be the wanderers, i.e., let
          “wandering star” be the minor extreme; let B consist in being near,
          i.e., let “to be near,” which was the major extreme above, be the
          middle term; and let A consist in not twinkling, i.e., let “not to
          twinkle,” which above was the middle term, now be the major term.
          Therefore, B is in C, i.e., “Every planet is near”; and A is in B,
          i.e., “Any planet which is near does not twinkle.” Wherefore, it
          follows that A is in C, i.e., “A planet does not twinkle.” In this way
          we have a syllogism <i>propter quid</i>, since it rests on the first
          and immediate cause.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (78b3) he presents another example of this, saying that “in this
          way” (i.e., by means of a demonstration <i>quia</i>), “one
          demonstrates that the moon is round because of its phases,” according
          to which it waxes and wanes every month. They argue thus: “Everything
          which waxes thus circularly is circular; but the moon waxes thus:
          therefore, it is circular.” “Put in this form it is a syllogism
          demonstrating <i>quia</i>. But if the middle be interchanged,” i.e.,
          if “circular” be made the middle term and “waxes” the major term, “it
          becomes a demonstration <i>propter quid</i>.” For the moon is not
          circular because it waxes in that way, but because it is circular it
          undergoes such phases. Therefore, let C be “the moon,” i.e., the minor
          extreme; let “waxing” be A, i.e., the major extreme, and let
          “circular” be B, the middle term. This will be the situation in the
          syllogism <i>propter quid</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (78b10) he shows that a demonstration through a non-convertible
          effect is quid. He says, therefore, that even in those syllogisms in
          which the middles are not converted with the extremes, and in which an
          effect rather than a cause is taken as the middle better known in
          reference to us, even in those cases the demonstration is
          <i>quia</i> and not <i>propter quid</i>. If the middle be such that it
          can be converted with the major extreme and it exceeds the minor, then
          obviously it is a fitting syllogism; for example, if one proves that
          Venus is near because it does not twinkle. On the other hand, if the
          minor exceeded the middle, it would not be a fitting syllogism: for
          one cannot conclude universally of stars that they are near because
          they do not twinkle. Quite the contrary is true in comparison to the
          major term: for if the middle is in less things than is the major
          term, the syllogism is fitting, as when it is proved that someone has
          a sensible soul on the ground that he is capable of progressive local
          motion. But if it is in more, than the syllogism is not fitting, for
          from an effect which can proceed from several causes, one of them
          cannot be concluded. Thus, one cannot conclude from a rapid pulse that
          he has a fever.<br /></p

          >
        </p>
        <p>
          After clarifying with examples how there is demonstration
          <i>quia</i> through effect, the Philosopher here shows how there is
          demonstration <i>quia</i> through things not immediately connected.
          First, he amplifies his proposition. Secondly, he shows how the
          middles relate themselves to the conclusions in this type of
          demonstration (78b27). Concerning the first he does three things.
          First, he states his intention. Secondly, he clarifies it with
          examples (78b14). Thirdly, he puts it in syllogistic form (78b24).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (78b13) that there is demonstration
          <i>quia</i> and not <i>propter quid</i> not only in those matters that
          are proved through an effect but also “in matters in which the middle
          is set outside.” Now a middle is said to be set outside when it is
          diverse from the major term, as in negative syllogisms; or a middle is
          said to be set outside when it is outside the genus as being something
          more common and not convertible with the major term. That something
          cannot be demonstrated <i>propter quid</i> through such a middle he
          proves on the ground that demonstration <i>propter quid</i> is through
          a cause. But the middle in question is not, properly speaking, a
          cause.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (78b14) he clarifies what he had said with an example, saying
          that if someone attempted to prove that a wall does not breathe
          because it is not an animal, he would not be demonstrating
          <i>propter quid</i> or giving the cause. Because if the fact of not
          being an animal were the cause of not breathing, it would be required
          that being an animal would be the cause of breathing-which is false.
          For there are many animals which do not breathe. For it is required,
          if a negation is the cause of a negation, that the affirmation be the
          cause of the affirmation, as the fact of not being warm and cold in
          due measure is the cause of someone’s not getting well, and the fact
          of being warm and cold in due measure is the cause of someone’s
          getting well. The converse is also true, namely, that if an
          affirmation is the cause of an affirmation, the negation is the cause
          of the negation. But this does not occur in the case at hand, because
          the affirmation is not the cause of an affirmation, since not every
          animal breathes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (78b24) he arranges the aforesaid example in syllogistic form and
          says that it should be arranged in the second figure. And this is so
          because in the first figure there cannot be a negative conclusion such
          that the major would be affirmative, as our example requires. For “to
          breathe,” which is the major extreme, must be joined with “animal,”
          which is the middle term, according to affirmation. But “wall,” which
          is the minor extreme, must be joined with “animal,” which is the
          middle, according to negation. Consequently, the major will be
          affirmative and the minor negative. But such a thing never occurs in
          the first figure, but only in the second.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let “animal,” then, be A, i.e., the middle term, “breathe” be B, i.e.,
          the major extreme, and “wall” be C, i.e., the minor extreme. it
          therefore follows that A is in every B, because everything that
          breathes is an animal; but A is in no C, because no wall is an animal.
          Hence it follows that B, too, is in no C, i.e., that no wall breathes.
          Furthermore, if the most proximate middle were used, it would be
          demonstration <i>propter quid</i>: for example, if it were shown that
          a wall does not breathe because it does not have lungs. For whatever
          has lungs breathes, and conversely.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (78b27) he shows how these middles are related to the conclusion,
          saying that such far-away causes are compared to what they explain as
          being too remote, because they go beyond the pale of the conclusion to
          be proved. Furthermore, a middle of this sort happens to assign what
          is far-fetched, as in Anacharsis’ proof that there are no flutists
          among the Scythians because there are no vines there. For this is
          quite a far-fetched middle. A nearer one would be that they have no
          wine, and nearer still, that they do not drink wine, from which
          follows a merry heart which moves one to sing-if fluting is taken to
          mean singing. Or it might be better to say that fluting is not taken
          for just any singing but for the song of the grape harvesters, called
          “celeuma.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (78b32) he summarizes what he had said and declares that these
          are the differences between the syllogism <i>quia</i> and the
          syllogism <i>propter quid</i> in the same science, “and according to
          the position of the same,” i.e., of those that have the same order.
          This he says to exclude what he will discuss later, namely, that one
          science is under another.<br /></p

            HOW DEMONSTRATION “ <i>QUIA</i> ” DIFFERS FROM DEMONSTRATION

          >
        </p>
        <p>
          After showing how demonstration <i>quia</i> differs from demonstration
          <i>propter quid</i> in the same science, the Philosopher shows how
          they differ in sciences that are diverse. And he does two things:
        </p>
        <p>
          First, he states his proposition, saying (78b34) that in a way other
          than the above the <i>propter quid</i> differs from the
          <i>quia</i> due to the fact that they are considered in diverse
          sciences, i.e., that the <i>propter quid</i> pertains to one science
          and the <i>quia</i> to another.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly (78b34) he elucidates his proposition. First, he elucidates
          it in sciences one of which is under the other. Secondly, in sciences
          one of which is not under the other (79a13). Concerning the first he
          does two things. First, he shows how those sciences are related, one
          of which is under the other and to one of which pertains the
          <i>quia</i> and to the other the <i>propter quid</i>. Secondly, he
          shows how in these sciences the <i>quia</i> pertains to one and the
          <i>propter quid</i> to the other (790). Concerning the first he does
          two things. First, he shows how such sciences relate to one another as
          to order. Secondly, how they relate to one another as to agreement
          (79a1).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (78b35) that these sciences (i.e., to one of
          which pertains <i>quia</i> and to the other <i>propter quid</i>) are
          the ones so related that one is under the other. But this occurs in
          two ways: in one way, when the subject of one science is a species of
          the subject of the higher science, as animal is a species of natural
          body—consequently, the science of animals is under natural science; in
          another way, when the subject of the lower science is not a species of
          the subject of the higher science but is compared to the latter as
          material to formal. An example of this latter way of one science being
          under another is the way “specular,” i.e., optics, is under geometry.
          For geometry is concerned with lines and other magnitudes, whereas
          optics is concerned with a line determined to matter, i.e., the visual
          line. Now the visual line is not, strictly speaking, a species of line
          any more than wooden triangle is a species of triangle: for wooden is
          not a difference in respect to triangle. In like manner mechanical
          engineering, i.e., the science of making machines, is related to
          stereometry, i.e., the science of measuring bodies. This science is
          said to be under the other as applying the formal to the material. For
          the measures of bodies’ absolutely are compared to the measures of
          wood and other material required for machines as the application of
          the formal to the material. In like manner, harmonics, i.e., music, is
          related to arithmetic: for music applies formal number, which
          arithmetic considers, to matter, i.e., to sounds. And the same is true
          of “appearance,” i.e., nautical science (which considers the signs
          indicative of calm or storm), as compared to astronomy, which
          considers the motions and positions of the stars.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (79a1) he shows how the aforesaid sciences relate to one another
          in point of agreement. And he says that these sciences are almost
          mutually univocal. And he says, “almost,” because they agree in the
          name of their genus and not in the name of their species. Thus, all
          the sciences mentioned above are called mathematical: some, indeed,
          because they are concerned with a subject which is abstracted from
          matter, as geometry and arithmetic, which are absolutely mathematical;
          but others are so through applying mathematical principles to material
          things, as astronomy is called mathematical and as nautical science
          is. Similarly, harmonics, i.e., music, is called mathematical and so
          is acoustics, i.e., practical music, which knows sounds through
          experience based on hearing. Or it might be said that they are
          univocal because they also agree in the name of their species, for we
          speak of nautical astronomy as astronomy and of practical music as
          music. But because this is not so in all but only in some, he says
          “almost.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (79a3) he shows how in these sciences the <i>quia</i> pertains to
          the one science and the <i>propter quid</i> to the other. In regard to
          this there are two points. First, he shows how those sciences which
          contain others under them state the <i>propter quid</i>. Secondly, how
          sciences which are contained under another one state the
          <i>propter quid</i> of some others (79a10).
        </p>
        <p>
          One should note, therefore, with respect to the first point that in
          all the above-mentioned sciences, the ones which are contained under
          others apply mathematical principles to sensible things, while the
          ones which contain others under them are more mathematical.
          Accordingly, the Philosopher first of all says (79a3) that to know the
          <i>quia</i> pertains to the sensible, i.e., to the lower sciences,
          which make application to sensible things; but to know the
          <i>propter quid</i> pertains to the mathematical, i.e., to those
          sciences whose principles are not applied to sensible things. For
          these latter sciences are concerned with demonstrating matters which
          are accepted as causes in the lower sciences.
        </p>
        <p>
          But because someone might suppose that whoever knows the
          <i>propter quid</i> also necessarily knows the <i>quia</i>, he
          dismisses this, saying that very frequently those who know the
          <i>propter quid</i> do not know the <i>quia</i>. And he gives as an
          example of this those who, when considering the universal often take
          no account of the singulars precisely because their speculation does
          not consider them: thus, one who knows that every mule is sterile,
          does not know this of the one he does not consider. In like manner, a
          mathematician who demonstrates <i>propter quid</i>, now and then does
          not know the <i>quia</i>, because he does not apply the principles of
          the higher sciences to matters demonstrated in the lower science.
        </p>
        <p>
          And because he had said that it belongs to mathematics to know the
          <i>propter quid</i>, he proposes to indicate which genus of cause is
          used by mathematics. Hence he says that those sciences which receive
          the <i>propter quid</i> from mathematics “are something else,” i.e.,
          they differ from the mathematical according to subject, i.e., insofar
          as they make application to matter. Hence these latter “use forms’ “
          i.e., formal principles, which they receive from mathematics: “for the
          mathematical sciences concern forms.” For their considerations do not
          bear on the subject, i.e., on matter, because although the items which
          geometry considers exist in matter, for example, the line, plane and
          so on, nevertheless geometry does not consider them precisely as they
          are in matter, but as abstracted. For those things that are in matter
          according to existence, geometry abstracts from matter according to
          consideration. Conversely, the sciences subalternated to it accept
          those things which were considered in the abstract by geometry and
          apply them to matter. Hence it is plain that it is according to the
          formal cause that geometry states the <i>propter quid</i> in those
          sciences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (79a10) he shows that even the subalternated sciences state the
          <i>propter quid</i>, not of its subalternating science but of some
          other science. Thus, optics is subalternated to geometry, so that if
          we compare the one with the other, optics states the <i>quia</i> and
          geometry the <i>propter quid</i>. But just as optics is subalternated
          to geometry, so the science of the rainbow is subalternated to optics,
          for it applies to a determinate matter the principles which optics
          hands down absolutely. Hence it belongs to the naturalist who treats
          of the rainbow to know the <i>quia</i>, but to the expert in optics to
          know the <i>propter quid</i>. For the naturalist says that the cause
          of the rainbow is the convergence of a visual line at a cloud arranged
          in some relation to the sun; but the <i>propter quid</i> he takes from
          optics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (79a13) he shows how <i>quia</i> and <i>propter quid</i> differ
          among sciences that are diverse but not subalternate. And he says that
          many sciences which are not subalternate are nevertheless related,
          i.e., in such a way that one states the <i>quia</i> and the other the
          <i>propter quid</i>. This is true of medicine and geometry. For the
          subject of medicine is not subsumed under the subject of geometry as
          the subject of optics is. Nevertheless, the principles of geometry are
          applicable to certain conclusions reached in medicine: for example, it
          belongs to the man of medicine who observes it to know
          <i>quia</i> that circular wounds heal rather slowly; but to know the
          <i>propter quid</i> belongs to the geometer, whose business it is to
          know that a circle is a figure without corners. Hence the edges of a
          circular wound are not close enough to each other to allow them to be
          easily joined. It should also be noted that this difference of
          <i>quia</i> and <i>propter quid</i> between sciences that are diverse
          is contained under one of the modes previously discussed, namely, when
          the demonstration is made through a remote cause.<br /></p

          >
        </p>
        <p>
          After determining about the material of the syllogism, the Philosopher
          here determines about its form, showing in which figure chiefly the,
          demonstrative syllogism is formed. His treatment is divided into two
          parts. In the first he shows that the demonstrative syllogism is
          formed first and foremost in the first figure. In the second, because
          it is possible in the first figure to proceed from negatives and
          because a demonstration must proceed from things immediate, he shows
          how a negative proposition happens to be immediate (79a33).
        </p>
        <p>
          He shows the first with three reasons, the first of which (79a17) is
          this: In whatever figure the <i>propter quid</i> syllogism is best
          made, that figure is the best for causing scientific knowledge and for
          that reason is most suitable for demonstrations, since demonstration
          is a syllogism which causes scientific knowledge. But a syllogism
          <i>propter quid</i> is best made in the first figure, and this is
          evidenced by the fact that the mathematical sciences of arithmetic and
          geometry and all other sciences which demonstrate
          <i>propter quid</i> employ the first figure in most cases. Therefore,
          the first figure is the one which first and foremost causes scientific
          knowledge and is most suitable for demonstrations.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the reason why demonstration <i>propter quid</i> is best made in
          the first figure is this: in the first figure the middle term is both
          subjected, to the major extreme, which is the predicate of the
          conclusion, an(I predicated of the minor extreme, which is the subject
          of the conclusion. Now in demonstrations <i>propter quid</i> the
          middle must be the cause of the proper attribute which is predicated
          of the subject in the conclusion. Furthermore, one of the modes of
          “saying <i>per se</i> ” is when the subject is the cause of the
          predicate, as “being butchered, he died,” as has been explained above;
          and this is verified in the first figure in which the middle is
          subject to the major extreme, as has been said.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second reason (79a23) is this: the <i>quod quid est</i> [i.e., the
          definition as signifying the essence] plays a most important role in
          demonstrative sciences because, as has been said, a definition is
          either the principle of a demonstration or the conclusion or a
          demonstration differing in the position of its terms. Now when it is a
          question of formulating a definition the first figure alone is
          suitable. For that is the only figure in which a universal affirmative
          is concluded, which alone produces science of the
          <i>quod quid est</i>. For the <i>quod quid est</i> is known through an
          affirmation. Furthermore, the definition is predicated affirmatively
          and universally of the defined: for it is not some man that is a
          two-legged animal, but every man. Therefore, the first figure is
          foremost in causing scientific knowledge and is best accommodated to
          demonstrations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (79a30) he gives the third reason which is this: For purposes of
          I demonstration the other figures need the first, but the first does
          not need them. Therefore, the first figure is better equipped for
          causing scientific knowledge than the others. That the others need the
          first is evidenced by the fact that if complete scientific knowledge
          is to be had, the mediate propositions present in demonstrations must
          be reduced to immediate ones. But this reduction is made in two ways,
          namely, by condensing middles [i.e., by inserting fresh middles, the
          movement proceeding from the extremes toward the middle first
          employed] and by expanding outwards [i.e., by going from the middle
          toward the remote extreme].
        </p>
        <p>
          It is done by condensing when the middle actually employed is joined
          mediately to each of the extremes or only to the minor extreme. Hence
          when other middles are introduced between the first middle and the
          extremes, the middles, as it were, close in. Thus, if someone first
          says, “Every E is C,” [minor], “Every C is A,” [major], and then a
          middle, say D, is introduced between C and E, and a middle B between C
          and A. It is done by expanding when the middle is immediate to the
          minor extreme and mediate to the major: for then it is necessary to
          introduce several other middles more general than the middle first
          taken. Thus, if one says, “Every E is D,” “Every D is A,” and the
          later other middles more general than D are introduced [between D and
          A].
        </p>
        <p>
          Now these processes of condensing and expanding can be performed only
          in the first figure, both because the first figure is the only one
          which yields a universal affirmative conclusion, and because it is
          only in the first figure that the middle lies between both extremes.
          For in the second figure the middle lies outside the extremes, as
          being predicated of them; in the third figure [the middle] is below
          each of the extremes, as being subjected to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (79a33) he teaches how a negative proposition can be immediate.
          In regard to this he does two things.
        </p>
        <p>
          First (79a33), he states his intention, saying that “just as it is
          possible for every A to be in B atomically,” i.e., immediately, “so
          too not to be,” i.e., so too it is possible for a proposition
          signifying that A is not in B to be immediate. Then he goes on to
          explain what it is to be or not to be atomically, namely, when the
          affirmation or negation does not have middle through which it might be
          proved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly (79a36), he elucidates his proposition. In regard to this he
          does two things. First, he shows when a negative proposition is
          mediate. Secondly, when immediate (79b12). Concerning the first he
          does two things. First, he clarifies his proposition. Secondly, he
          proves something he had presupposed (79b5).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (79a36), that when A, i.e., the major term, or
          B, i.e., the minor term, is in some whole as a species in its genus,
          or both are under diverse genera or predicaments, it does not occur
          that A is not in B first, i.e., it does not occur that this
          proposition, “No B is A,” is immediate. First, then, he manifests this
          when A is in some whole, say in Q and B is in no whole. For example,
          if A is “man,” C is “substance,” and B is “quantity,” it is possible
          to form a syllogism to prove that A is in no B on the ground that C is
          in every A and in no B. Thus we get a syllogism in the second figure:
        </p></a
      >
    </dd>

    <dd>
      <a name="26" id="26">Every man is a substance;</a>
    </dd>

    <dd>
      <a name="26" id="26">No quantity is a substance:</a>
    </dd>

    <dd>
      <a name="26" id="26"
        >Therefore, no quantity is a man.
        <p>
          In like manner, if B, i.e., the minor term, is in some whole, say D,
          but A is not in that whole, it is possible to syllogize that A is in
          no B. For example if A is “substance,” B “line,” and D “quantity,” we
          get a syllogism in the first figure:
        </p></a
      >
    </dd>

    <dd>
      <a name="26" id="26">No quantity is a substance;</a>
    </dd>

    <dd>
      <a name="26" id="26">Every line is a quantity;</a>
    </dd>

    <dd>
      <a name="26" id="26"
        >Therefore, no line is a substance.
        <p>
          In the same way, a negative conclusion could be demonstrated if either
          is in some whole. For example, if A is “line,” C “quantity,” B
          “whitenem” and D “quality,” it is possible to form a syllogism in the
          first and in the second figure. In the second figure thus:
        </p></a
      >
    </dd>

    <dd>
      <a name="26" id="26">Every line is a quantity;</a>
    </dd>

    <dd>
      <a name="26" id="26">No whiteness is a quantity:</a>
    </dd>

    <dd>
      <a name="26" id="26"
        >Therefore, no whiteness is a line.
        <p>And in the first figure thus:</p></a
      >
    </dd>

    <dd>
      <a name="26" id="26">No quality is a line;</a>
    </dd>

    <dd>
      <a name="26" id="26">Every whiteness is a quality:</a>
    </dd>

    <dd>
      <a name="26" id="26"
        >Therefore, no whiteness is a line.
        <p>
          We should understand, however, that a negative proposition is mediate,
          when both terms exist in some whole which is not the same but
          different for each. For if they are in the same whole, the proposition
          will be immediate, as “No rational being is irrational,” or “No biped
          is a quadruped.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (79b5) he explains something he had presupposed, namely, “on
          condition that one of the extremes exist in some whole and that the
          other be not in the same,” saying that it is “clear from the
          ‘orderings’ of the various predicaments, which are” not mutually
          interchangeable. In other words, because that which is in one
          predicament is not in another, it is plain that B happens not to be in
          the whole in which A is, or vice versa, because one of the terms
          happens to be taken from one predicament in which the other is not
          found. Thus, let one ordering of the predicaments be ACD, say the
          predicament of substance, and another ordering be BEF, say the
          predicament of quantity. Then if none of those in the ordering ACD be
          predicated of none in the ordering BEF, while A is in P as in that
          most general item which is the principle of the whole first ering, it
          is plain that B is not in P, because then the orderings, i.e., the
          predicaments, would be interchanged. Similarly, if B is in some whole,
          say in E, it is plain that A is not in E.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (79b12) he indicates how a negative proposition may be immediate,
          saying that “if neither is in some whole,” i.e., neither A nor B, and
          A is not in B, it is necessary that this proposition, “No B is A,” be
          immediate. Because if a middle were taken to syllogize it, then one of
          them would have to be in some whole, for the syllogism would have to
          be made either in the first figure or in the second, since in the
          third figure a universal negative cannot be concluded, as is required
          for an immediate proposition. However, if it is made in the first, B
          would have to be in some whole, because B is the minor extreme, and in
          the first figure the minor proposition must always be affirmative. For
          a syllogism with the major affirmative and the minor negative cannot
          be formed in the first figure.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if it be in the second figure, either may, i.e., A or B, may be in
          a whole, because in the second figure the first proposition may be
          negative in some moods and the minor in other moods. Of course it is
          never permitted, neither in the first nor the second, to have both
          propositions negative. And so it is required that when either
          proposition is affirmative, one of the extremes must be in some whole.
          Thus it is clear that a negative proposition is immediate, when
          neither of its terms is in some whole. This does not mean, however,
          that although neither is in some whole, a middle could be found to
          conclude it, namely, if one were to take a convertible middle, because
          it is necessary that such a middle be prior and better known. And this
          is either the genus itself or the definition, which is not without a
          genus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (79b21) he concludes and summarizes what has been said. Here the
          text is sufficiently clear.<br /></p

        <p>
          After determining about the demonstrative syllogism through which
          science is acquired, the Philosopher here determines concerning the
          syllogism through which ignorance or deception is produced in us. In
          regard to this he does two things. First, he shows what sort of
          ignorance can be induced by a syllogism. Secondly, he shows the mode
          in which such a syllogism proceeds (79b28).
        </p>
        <p>
          He distinguishes therefore first (79b23) a twofold ignorance, one of
          which is negative and the other a positive state. There is ignorance
          in a negative way, when a man has no scientific knowledge at all about
          a thing. This ignorance consists in not attaining, as the Philosopher
          says in <i>Metaphysics</i> IX, and is exemplified in a peasant who
          knows absolutely nothing about whether a triangle has three angles
          equal to two right angles. But ignorance is present as a positive
          state, when one does have a definite opinion but it is unsound. For
          example, when he falsely thinks something about a thing, either
          because he thinks something to be which is not, or something not to be
          which is. And this ignorance is the same as error.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the first ignorance is not produced by a syllogism, but the second
          can be, and then it is called deception. Such ignorance or deception
          can concern two things: first, those things which are first and
          immediate principles, namely, when a person opines things opposed to
          the principles. And although he cannot so opine inwardly in the mind,
          as has been stated above, because these things do not fall under
          apprehension, nevertheless he can contradict them orally and according
          to a false imagination, as is said in <i>Metaphysics</i> IV of some
          who deny the principles. Secondly, it might be concerned with
          conclusions which are not first and immediate. Furthermore, the first
          of these ignorances or deceptions is opposed to the knowledge which is
          understanding, and the second to the knowledge which is science.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each of these states of ignorance, whether concerned with things that
          are first or things not first, can befall a man in two ways: first,
          straightway, when independently of any process of reasoning he thinks
          a falsehood by affirming or denying. In another way, when he is
          brought to his opinion through some syllogized reason. Hence the
          Philosopher says in <i>Metaphysics</i> IV that some contradict the
          principles as though persuaded by reasons; but others, not as though
          persuaded by reasons, but through lack of erudition or through
          wilfullness which demands to have a demonstration in all matters.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (79b28) he shows how these ignorances are caused. First, how the
          ignorance produced by a syllogism is caused. Secondly, how ignorance
          befalls a man without syllogizing (81a38) [L. 30]. Concerning the
          first he does two things. First, he states how ignorance in regard to
          first and immediate principles is engendered by a syllogism. Secondly,
          how it is caused in regard to things not first and immediate (80b17)
          [L. 29]. Concerning the first he does two things. First, he states how
          the ignorance is caused whereby that which is not is believed to be.
          Secondly, that whereby that which is is believed not to be (80a8) [L.
          28]. Regarding the first he does three things. First, he states how
          the aforesaid ignorance is generally caused. Secondly, he assigns its
          various possible forms (79b31). Thirdly, he answers a tacit question
          (80a6).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (79b28) that the deception according to false
          opinion which above was said to occur straightway is simple, i.e., is
          engendered in only one way. For it is not caused by a reason, which
          might vary, but by the lack of a reason which [lack] is not
          diversified into various modes each having its own characteristics any
          more than other negations are.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet because false reasons can be various and many, this ignorance,
          when it is engendered by a syllogism can occur in many ways according
          to the several ways in which a syllogism can be false. The common way
          is set forth when he says, “Let A be in no B individually” (79b29),
          i.e., let this proposition be immediately true, “No B is A.” For two
          negations are stated in the place of one— for instance if we should
          say, “No quality is a substance”— according to the doctrine on
          immediate negative propositions presented above. Therefore, if someone
          were to conclude the opposite of this with a syllogism, taking C as a
          middle to show that every B is A, there will be a deception through
          syllogism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (79b31) he shows in how many ways this can vary. And first of all
          it should be noted that a false conclusion is not concluded except
          when the syllogism is false. But a syllogism can be false in two ways:
          first, because it lacks syllogistic form, in which case it is not a
          syllogism but appears to be one. In a second way, because it employs
          false propositions, in which case it is a syllogism as to form, but it
          is a false one because of the false propositions used. Therefore, in a
          dialectical disputation, which bears on probables, use could be made
          of both types of false syllogism, because such a disputation proceeds
          from common premises. Consequently, error can arise in it both as
          regards the matter employed, which is common, and also as regards the
          form, which is common.
        </p>
        <p>
          But in a demonstrative disputation, which bears on necessary things,
          the type of syllogism used is the one which could be false only on
          account of the matter, because as it is stated in <i>Topics</i> I, a
          paralogism in a given discipline proceeds from things proper to the
          discipline, but not from true things. Hence, since syllogistic form
          must be counted among the common things, paralogism within a
          discipline-which is the matter under discussion-is not defective in
          form but only in matter, and furthermore in regard to proper and not
          in regard to common things. And so: First, he tells how such a
          syllogism might proceed from two false premises. Secondly, how it
          might proceed from one or the other premise being false (79b40). But
          since the first can occur in two ways, namely, the false proposition
          might be contrary to the true or contradictory to it, therefore:
          First, he shows how such a syllogism might proceed from two false
          statements that are contrary to true statements. Secondly, how a
          contradiction is accepted (79b34).
        </p>
        <p>
          First, then (79b30) he says that in a syllogism causing deception it
          sometimes happens that both premises are false, and sometimes only
          one. Let us take”the case of two false premises, each contrary to what
          is true. For example, suppose that C is so related to A and to B. that
          no C is A and no B is C. Now if we take the contraries of these,
          namely, that every C is A and every B is C, these two propositions
          will be completely false. For example, if I should say: “Every quality
          is a substance; every quantity is a quality: therefore, every quantity
          is a substance.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (79b34) he shows how both premises can be false and not contrary,
          but contradictory, to what is true. For example, if C is so related to
          A and to B, that it is neither contained totally under A nor is
          universally in B. Thus one might take C as “perfect” or “actual
          being,” and proceed in the following way: “Every perfect thing is a
          substance; every quantity is perfect: therefore, every quantity is a
          substance. Now although both are false, they are not entirely so, for
          their contradictories are true, namely, “Some perfect things are not
          substances,” and “Some quantity is not perfect”; but their contraries
          are false, namely, “No perfect thing is a substance,” and “No quantity
          is perfect.”
        </p>
        <p>
          But that C is not in B universally (i.e., that the statement, “Every
          quantity is perfect,” which was the minor, is not true), i.e., that
          “Every B is C,” is not true he proves by the fact that B cannot be
          contained under any whole that might be predicated universally of it.
          And this is so because the proposition, “No B is A,” was said to be
          immediate, which means that A is universally not in B. But, as has
          been stated above, those negative propositions are immediate, neither
          of whose terms is under a whole.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, this proof does not seem sufficient, because something
          can be predicated universally even of that which is not under some
          whole as a species under a genus. For the genus and the difference are
          not the only things predicated universally, but a property is too. But
          it must be said that although the proof in question is not efficacious
          generally speaking, it is in this case. Because, as it is stated in
          <i>Topics</i> I, a paralogism within a discipline— with which we are
          concerned here— proceeds from items that accord with the discipline.
          Hence he intends to use such middles as a demonstrator uses. But the
          middle of a demonstration is the definition, as has been stated above.
          Therefore, even in the syllogism of which he is speaking, he intends
          to use a definition as the middle. Now a definition contains the genus
          and difference. Hence that which is predicated universally in this
          syllogism should contain that in which the subject is, as in a whole.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, that A is not in C universally, i.e., that the statement,
          “Every perfect thing is a substance,” is not universally true is
          proved by the fact that it is not required of every universal that it
          be universally in all things that are: because no predicament is
          predicated of things contained under another predicament nor
          universally predicated of those items that commonly follow upon being,
          namely, act and potency, perfect and imperfect, prior and posterior,
          and the like.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (79b40) he shows how the aforesaid syllogism might proceed from
          one true and one false. And he says that in the aforesaid syllogism we
          might take one true, i.e., the major, which is AC, and the other
          false, namely, the minor, which is BC. That the minor proposition,
          which is BC, is always the false one he proves, as he did above, on
          the ground that B is in no C as in a whole. But that this proposition
          AC could be true, while the other is false he proves in terms. Let A
          be in B and in C individually, i.e., immediately, as a genus in its
          species; for example, as color is to whiteness and blackness. Now
          under these conditions it is obvious that the major will be true,
          namely, “Every C is A,” for example, “Every whiteness is a color,” and
          the minor false, namely, “Every blackness is whiteness”: for when
          something is predicated “first” of several, none of the several is
          predicated of any other of them. For the first predication of a genus
          is of species which are opposite.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, too, a doubt arises, because from the terms used here, not a
          false but a true conclusion follows. For the conclusion will be that A
          is in B, it having also been assumed that it is in B individually. But
          it must be answered that this example was used merely to illustrate
          how the major could be true and the minor false; although it is of no
          use in a case where a false conclusion is sought. Hence the
          Philosopher at once adds, “It is equally the case of AC if not
          atomic.” However, we could take terms such that A is not in B either
          individually or in any way, but is rather immediately removed from B.
          Neither is it necessary that it be in C individually, because it is
          not necessary that a demonstrator employ only immediate propositions:
          for he may use ones which are supported by immediate propositions. We
          can, therefore, take other terms pertaining to the present case, for
          example, “intellectual substance,” as the middle, for “Every
          intelligence is a substance,” and take as the false minor, “Every
          quantity is an intelligence.” Hence a false conclusion follows.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (80a6) he answers a tacit question. For someone might request
          that he exemplify the diversity of such a syllogism in the other
          figures. But he answers that a deception, which bears on being, i.e.,
          through which someone opines a false affirmative proposition, can be
          derived only by the first figure, because in the next figure, i.e., in
          the second, an affirmative syllogism cannot be formed. As for the
          third figure, it has no bearing on the case, because it cannot
          conclude a universal, which is principally intended in demonstration
          and in this syllogism.<br /></p

            clear</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          After showing how a false affirmative conclusion contrary to an
          immediate negative is obtained by syllogizing, the Philosopher here
          shows how by syllogizing a false negative is concluded contrary to an
          immediate affirmative. First, in the first figure. Secondly, in the
          second (8048). Concerning the first he does two things. First (80a8),
          he states his intention and says that since a universal negative may
          be concluded in the first as well as in the second figure, we must
          first show in which moods a syllogism of ignorance is formed in the
          first figure and under which conditions of truth and falsity in the
          propositions. Secondly (80a11), he establishes his proposition. First,
          he shows how such a proposition is formed from two false premises in
          the first figure. Secondly, how it is formed from one false and one
          true premise (80a14).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (80a11) that the aforesaid syllogism can be
          formed from premises, both of which are false. This is clear if A is
          both in B and in C individually, i.e., immediately. It is thus that a
          genus is immediately in the proximate species into which it is first
          divided, as color into blackness and whiteness. For the genus is
          predicated <i>per se</i> of the species, because the former is placed
          first in the definition of the latter; and it is predicated
          immediately of a proximate species, because it is put in its
          definition immediately and not in the way that a remote genus-which is
          put in the definition of a defining part-is related to an ultimate
          species. Therefore, let the terms be “color,” “whiteness” and
          “blackness.” If, then, we assume that A is in no C, for example, if we
          say, “No whiteness is a color,” but C is in every B, say “All
          blackness is whiteness,” both propositions are false, as is the
          conclusion, “No blackness is a color.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (80a14) he shows how there can be one false and one true premise
          in the syllogism under discussion. First, he shows how the major can
          be true and the minor false. Secondly, how it might be the reverse
          (8040).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (80a14) that a negative syllogism of ignorance
          can be formed in the first figure no matter which one of the
          propositions happens to be false. For it might happen that the
          proposition AC, which is the major, is true, and the proposition BC,
          which is the minor, is false. That the major proposition could be true
          he proves by the fact that the term A, whatever it be, need not be in
          all things, as color is not predicated of all beings. That the minor
          would be false he proves on the ground that it is not possible to
          assume a term of which A would be universally denied and which would
          also be predicated of B: for we are supposing that the proposition,
          “Every B is A,” is true and immediate. Therefore, if something were
          universally predicated of B, so that “Every B is C” would be true,
          then A cannot be universally denied of C. Consequently, this
          proposition, “No C is A,” which was the major, will not be true. For
          if every B is A, as we supposed, and every B is C, as we are now
          assuming, it follows in the third figure that some C is A, which
          contradicts the major. Therefore the proposition, “No C is A,” will be
          false. Hence if this is true, which is the major, it is required that
          this be false, which is the minor, i.e., “Every B is C.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Then he proves the same thing on the ground that if both premises are
          true, then as has been proved above, a false conclusion cannot
          follow—which is out of place in a syllogism of ignorance, which ought
          to conclude to a false conclusion. But it was given that this is true,
          namely, “No C is A”’: if then it is also true that “Every B is C,” it
          follows that the conclusion, “No B is A,” is true, whereas it is
          supposed to be false, being contrary to this immediate proposition,
          “Every B is A.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (80a20) he shows how the minor can be true, the major being
          false. And he says that the proposition CB, namely, the minor, can be
          true, while the major is false. For since this proposition, “Every B
          is A,” whose contrary is to be concluded, is immediate, it is
          necessary that B exist in A as a part in a whole, as “whiteness” in
          “color.” But it is possible to take something else in which B also
          exists as in a whole, though not immediately—let this other thing be
          “quality,” i.e., C. It is necessary, therefore, according to the
          aforesaid, that as between these two, namely, A and C, one should be
          under the other, i.e., color under quality. Now if someone assumes
          that A is in no C and says, “No quality is a color,” the proposition
          will be false. But the minor will be true, namely, “Every whiteness is
          a quality.” The conclusion, however, “No whiteness is a color,” will
          be false and contrary to an immediate proposition. And so it is clear
          that a negative syllogism of ignorance can be formed in the first
          figure when either one or both of the premises are false.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (8047) he shows how a negative syllogism of ignorance is formed
          in the second figure. First, when both are false. Secondly, when one
          or the other is false (80a38).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (8047) that in the second figure it does not
          happen that both propositions are entirely false. And he calls those
          propositions entirely false which are contrary to true propositions.
          He proves this: For since we are trying to conclude a false negative
          contrary to an immediate affirmative, we must assume that this
          proposition, “Every B is A,” is true and immediate, say, “Every
          whiteness is a color.” But with terms so related it is impossible to
          find a middle term which would be predicated universally of one and
          universally removed from the other. For suppose that the term C could
          be universally removed from A and universally predicated of B. Then
          the proposition, “No A is C,” will be true; consequently, its
          converse, “No C is A,” will also be true. But every B is C. Therefore,
          no B is A, the contrary of which was supposed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, it cannot be universally removed from B and universally
          predicated of A. For if it is true that every A is C, the converse,
          “Some C is A,” will be true. But if it is true that no B is C, its
          converse, “No C is B,” will be true. So, then, from these two
          propositions, “Some C is A” and “No C is B,” there follows, “Some B is
          not A,” which is the contradictory of what was supposed, namely, that
          “Every B is A.” What remains, therefore, is that it is impossible to
          find any middle which, A and B being related in the way we have
          supposed, can be predicated of one and removed from the other. Yet if
          a syllogism is to be formed in the second figure, the middle must be
          predicated of one of the extremes and denied of the other. Therefore,
          if both are totally false, the contraries would have to be true, which
          is impossible as has been proved.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, nothing prevents both from being false particularly: thus we
          may take some middle which is predicated particularly of A and of B,
          say “male,” which is predicated particularly of animal and of man. Now
          if C is taken in every A, say “Every animal is male,” and in no B, say
          “No man is male,” each proposition will be false, not entirely but
          particularly. And the same holds if, conversely, the major is negative
          and the minor affirmative, i.e., if we should say, “No animal is male”
          and “Every man is male.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (80a38) he shows how it happens when one is false. First, in the
          second mode of the second figure. Secondly, in the first mode (80b6).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (80a38) that in this figure it occurs that
          either proposition may be false. This is clear from the fact that if A
          is supposed to be predicated <i>per se</i> and immediately of B,
          whatever is in every A is in every B, as whatever is predicated
          universally of animal is predicated universally of man. Therefore, if
          some middle, C, be taken which is universally predicated of A, say
          “Every animal is living,” and universally removed from B, say “No man
          is living,” it is evident that AC, which is the major proposition,
          will be true, but BC, which is the minor, will be false.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, he proves that the converse occurs when the major is false.
          For it cannot be that something be universally removed from B and
          universally predicated of A, when the terms have that position. For it
          has been stated that if something is in A universally, it follows that
          it is also in B. Consequently, if something be removed universally
          from B, it cannot be that it is predicated universally of A. For
          example, anything universally removed from “man” cannot be universally
          predicated of “animal.” Therefore, if something is taken which is
          universally removed from man, say “irrational,” and you state that
          “Every animal is irrational” and “No man is irrational,” it follows
          that the minor proposition is true and the major false. But in these
          terms the major premise is not totally false. However, one can take a
          term in which it is totally false, for example, if we should take
          “inanimate” as the middle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (80b6) he shows the same in the first mode of the second figure,
          where the major is negative. For it is clear that with the terms A and
          B so related, as was said, something universally removed from A cannot
          be in any B. Therefore, if a middle, C, be taken which is universally
          removed from A and universally predicated of B, the major will be true
          and the minor false. For example, if the terms are “inanimate,”
          “animal” and “man.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, he shows that the minor can be true and the major false.
          For it is clear, according to the aforesaid, that that which is
          universally predicated of B cannot be universally removed from every
          A, because what is universally predicated of B must be in some A at
          least. Therefore, if C be taken as a middle which is universally
          predicated of B, say, “rational” or “living,” and universally denied
          of A, there will be a true minor proposition, namely, “Every man is
          rational” or “living.” But the major, namely, “No animal is rational,”
          is false in part, while “No animal is living,” is false entirely.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then summarizing (80b14) he concludes that a deceptive syllogism can
          be formed in immediates, when both propositions are false or only one
          is false.<br /></p

        </p>
        <p>
          After showing how a syllogism of ignorance in regard to immediate
          propositions is made, the Philosopher here shows how it is made in
          regard to mediate propositions. First, how a false negative
          proposition is concluded which is opposed to a true affirmative.
          Secondly, how a false affirmative is concluded which is opposed to a
          true negative (81a16). Concerning the first he does two things. First,
          he shows this in the first figure. Secondly, in the second (81a4). In
          regard to the first he does three things. First, he shows how a
          syllogism of ignorance is constructed in mediate propositions through
          a proper middle. Secondly, how one is constructed through a middle
          which although not proper has a relationship to the terms, a
          relationship akin to that of a proper middle (80b27). Thirdly, he
          shows how such a syllogism is constructed through an extraneous middle
          (80b32).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (80b17) that when a syllogism is constructed
          which concludes something false in propositions which are not
          individual, i.e., not immediate, if the “proper middle” through which
          the syllogism is formed be taken, then both propositions cannot be
          false, but only the major. He explains what he means by “proper
          middle.” For since the proposition whose contrary is to be syllogized
          is mediate, it is required that the predicate be syllogized of the
          subject through some middle. Therefore, the same middle can be
          employed to conclude the opposite. Say that the mediate proposition is
          “Every triangle has three angles equal to two right angles.” The
          middle through which the predicate is syllogized of the subject is, “A
          figure having an exterior angle equal to the two opposite interior
          angles.” Now if we would prove through the same middle that no
          triangle has three angles equal to two right angles, it will be a
          syllogism of falsity through a proper middle. Hence he says that a
          proper middle is one through which the syllogism of contradiction is
          made, i.e., leading to the opposite conclusion. In the above example,
          A would be “triangle,” B, “having three...” and C, the middle, “such a
          figure.” Now in the first figure the minor must be affirmative;
          therefore, that which was the minor in the true syllogism must remain
          unconverted and not changed into its opposite in the syllogism of
          falsity. Hence it must always be true. But the major proposition of
          the true syllogism is changed into its contrary negative; hence the
          major must be false. For example, we might say: “No figure having an
          exterior angle equal to the two opposite interior angles has three
          angles equal to two right angles; but the triangle is such a figure:
          therefore, no triangle has three angles equal to two right angles.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (80b27) he shows how the aforesaid syllogism is constructed
          through a middle which is extraneous but like the proper. And he says
          that it will be syllogized in like fashion if the middle is taken from
          another ordering. For example, if A had been demonstrated of B through
          C, and we were to take in the syllogism of falsity not C but D as the
          middle, in such a way, however, that D is also contained universally
          under A and predicated universally of B: say if we took for the
          middle, “a closed figure of three lines,” because here too the minor
          proposition DB must remain as it was in the syllogism which concluded
          the true, although through a proper middle. But the major proposition
          will have to be changed into its contrary. And so the minor will
          always be true and the major always false. But as to the mode of the
          argument, this deception is similar to that which is formed through
          the proper middle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (80b32) he shows how a syllogism of falsity is made through a
          middle which is extraneous and unlike the proper. For a middle can be
          taken such that it is contained universally under A but is predicated
          of no B. In this case both propositions will have to be false, because
          in order that the syllogism be formed in the first figure, it will be
          necessary to take propositions to the contrary, namely, a major which
          is negative, for example, “No D is A,” and the minor affirmative, for
          example, “Every B is D.” Clearly then both are false. Now this
          relationship of terms cannot be found in things convertible, say in a
          subject and its proper attribute which is concluded of the subject
          through some middle. For it is obvious that no middle can be taken
          such that the proper attribute would be universally predicated of it,
          and that middle be removed universally from the subject. But this
          relationship can be found when the proposition is mediate, for
          example, when a higher genus or the proper attribute of a higher genus
          is predicated of an ultimate species, as when we say, “Every man is
          living.” For “living” can be concluded of man through the middle,
          “animal.” Therefore, if we should take something of which “living”
          would be universally predicated, say “olive,” but would be universally
          removed from man, the relationship of terms that we are seeking will
          result. For this will be false, “No olive is living”; and the minor,
          too, will be false, “Every man is an olive.” Similarly, the conclusion
          will be false, “No man is living,” which is contrary to the true
          mediate proposition.
        </p>
        <p>
          It also happens that the major may be true and the minor false. For
          example, if we take as middle something which is not contained under
          A, say “stone”; then the major, AB, will be true, namely, “No stone is
          living,” because “stone” is not contained under “living,” but the
          minor will be false, namely, “Every man is a stone.” For if the minor
          remained true, while the first Was true, then the conclusion would be
          true, whereas it has been said that it is to be false. However, the
          converse does not occur, i.e., that the minor be true when the middle
          is extraneous, because such a middle cannot be predicated universally
          of B. But in the first figure the minor taken must always be an
          affirmative statement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (81a5) he shows how a negative syllogism of ignorance is made in
          the second figure. And he says that in the second figure it cannot
          occur that both propositions be totally false. For if we are to
          conclude the false proposition, “No B is A,” contrary to the true, it
          would have been required that A be predicated universally of B. Hence
          nothing will be able to be found which would be universally predicated
          of one and universally denied of the other, as has been established
          above when we treated concerning the syllogism of ignorance in
          immediates.
        </p>
        <p>
          But one ox the other of them can be totally false. And he manifests
          this first in the second mood of the second figure where the major is
          affirmative and the minor negative. Thus, let the middle be related to
          the extremes so that it is predicated universally of both, as “living”
          is predicated universally of man and of animal. Then if we take the
          major affirmative, say “Every animal is living,” and the minor
          negative,. say “No man is living,” the major will be true, the minor
          false, and the conclusion false. In like manner also, if in the first
          mood of the second figure we take the major negative, say “No animal
          is living,” and the minor affirmative, say “Every man is living,” the
          major will be false, the minor true, and the conclusion false.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having said these things he sums up and concludes that he has stated
          when and through which kinds of premises deception can occur, if the
          deceptive syllogism is privative [negative].
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (81a16) he shows how an affirmative syllogism of deception is
          formulated in mediate propositions. First, when it is formulated
          through a proper middle. Secondly, when it is formulated through a
          middle similar to a proper middle (8140). Thirdly, when it is
          formulated through an extraneous middle (81a25).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (8106), that if an affirmative syllogism of
          deception is to be formulated in mediate propositions, if a proper
          middle such as explained above be taken, it is impossible that both
          propositions be false. For since a syllogism of this kind can be
          formed only in the first figure, both propositions being affirmative,
          it is required that the minor proposition remain as it was in the true
          syllogism. Hence the major will have to be changed, namely, from
          negative to affirmative, so that it will have to be false. For
          example, if we desire to conclude that “Every man is a quantity,”
          which is the contrary of the statement, “No man is a quantity,” whose
          proper middle is “substance,” we will take the false proposition,
          “Every substance is a quantity,” and the true proposition, “Every man
          is a substance.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (81a20) he shows how a syllogism of ignorance is formed when a
          non-proper middle is taken which is not of the same order but from
          some other ordering. For example, if I say, “Every agent is a
          quantity; every man is an agent: therefore, every man is a quantity.”
          For it is necessary in this case for the minor to remain, but the
          major will have to be changed from negative to affirmative. Hence this
          deception is similar to the previous deception, as was stated in the
          privative syllogism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (81a25) he shows how an affirmative syllogism of deception is
          formulated through an extraneous middle. And he says that if an
          extraneous middle be taken such that it is contained under the major
          extreme, then the major will be true and the minor false. For A, the
          major extreme, can be predicated universally of many things that are
          not under one another, say “habit” of grammar and virtue. For this is
          mediate, “No grammar is a virtue.” There we can conclude the contrary
          of this, namely, “All grammar is virtue,” through a middle which is
          contained under virtue. Then the major will be true and the minor
          false. For example, we might say: “All temperance is a virtue; grammar
          is temperance: therefore, all grammar is a virtue.”
        </p>
        <p>
          But if a middle is taken which is not under the major extreme, the
          major will always be false, because it will be affirmative. But the
          minor may sometimes be false with such a major; then both will be
          false. For example, if we should say: “Every whiteness is a virtue;
          all grammar is whiteness: therefore....” But sometimes it can be true.
          For when the terms are so related, there is nothing to hinder A from
          being removed from every D, and D from being in every B, as happens in
          these terms, namely, “animal,” “science,” “music.” For the major
          extreme, “animal,” is removed universally from all science; hence this
          proposition which is taken as the major in the syllogism of ignorance
          is false, namely, “Every science is an animal.” But the minor, namely,
          “All music is science,” is true. And the conclusion will be false,
          being contrary to the true mediate negative. It can also happen that A
          is in no D, and D in no B, as has been said.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus it is evident that when the middle is not contained under the
          major extreme, they may both be false or just one of them, because the
          major and the minor may be false. However, with the three terms so
          related, as we have said above, the major cannot be true.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally (81a35), he summarizes and concludes that it is plain from the
          foregoing how many ways and through which alignment of true and false
          propositions it is possible to construct deceptions through
          syllogisms, both in immediate propositions and in mediate
          propositions, which are proved by demonstration.<br /></p

          >
        </p>
        <p>
          After the Philosopher has determined concerning ignorance through
          deception which is caused by a syllogism, he now determines concerning
          the ignorance of simple negation which is produced without a
          syllogism. First, he shows in which type of person this ignorance is
          had of necessity. Secondly, he proves his proposition (81a39).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (81a38) that if a person lacks any of the
          senses, say, sight or hearing, then necessarily the science of the
          sensible objects proper to those senses will be lacking. Thus, if a
          person lacks the sense of sight, then of necessity the science of
          colors will be lacking in him. And so he will have ignorance of
          negation in regard to colors, being entirely ignorant of colors.
          However, this must be understood of persons who never had the sense of
          sight, as a person born blind. But if someone loses the sight he once
          had, he does not on that account necessarily lack a science of colors,
          because the memory of colors previously sensed remains in him.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it is possible that ignorance of negation be had of certain things
          which can nevertheless be known through a sense we possess.. For
          example, if someone with sight were always in the dark, he would de
          facto lack a science of colors, but not of necessity, because he could
          acquire it by sensing colors-which does not occur in one who lacks the
          sense of sight. Hence he adds that it is impossible to receive it
          because one who lacks the power of sight cannot even acquire a
          knowledge of colors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (81a39) he proves his proposition on the ground that there are
          two ways of acquiring science: one is through demonstration, and the
          other is through induction, as we have stated in the beginning of this
          book. But these two ways differ, because demonstration proceeds from
          universals, but induction from particulars. Therefore, if any
          universals from which demonstration proceeds could be known without
          induction, it would follow that a person could acquire science of
          things of which he does not have sense experience. But it is
          impossible that universals be known scientifically without induction.
          This is quite obvious in sensible things, because we receive the
          universal aspect in them through the experience which we have in
          regard to sensible things, as is explained in <i>Metaphysics</i> I.
          But this might be doubted in things which are abstract, as in
          mathematics. For although experience begins from sense, as it is
          stated in <i>Metaphysics</i> 1, it seems that this plays no role in
          studying things already isolated or abstracted from sensible matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, to exclude this he says that even those things that are
          abstract happen to be made known through induction, because in each
          genus of abstract things are certain particulars which are not
          isolable from sensible matter, so far as each of them is a “this
          something.” For although “line” is studied in isolation from its
          sensible matter, nevertheless “this line”, which is in sensible
          matter, so far forth as it is individualized, cannot be so isolated,
          because its individuation is from this matter. Furthermore, the
          principles of abstracted [isolated] things, from which demonstrations
          regarding them are formed, are not made manifest to us except from
          certain particulars which we perceive by sense. Thus, from the fact
          that we see some single sensible whole we are led to know what a whole
          is and what a part, and we know that every whole is greater than its
          part by considering this in many. Thus the universals from which
          demonstration proceeds are made known to us only through induction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now men who lack any of the senses cannot make an induction from
          singulars pertaining to that sense, because sense is the sole knower
          of the singulars from which induction proceeds. Hence such singulars
          are utterly unknown, because it does not occur that anyone lacking a
          sense receives science of such singulars: first, because he cannot
          demonstrate from universals without induction through which universals
          are known, as has been said; secondly, because nothing can be known
          through induction without the sense which is concerned with the
          singulars from which induction proceeds.
        </p>
        <p>
          It should be noted that by these words of the Philosopher two
          positions are excluded: the first is Plato’s, who stated that we do
          not have science of things except through Forms participated from
          ideas. If this were so, universals could be made known to us without
          induction, and we would be able to acquire a science of things of
          which we have no sense. Hence Aristotle also uses this argument
          against Plato at the end of <i>Metaphysics</i> I. The second is the
          position of those who claim that in this life we can know separated
          substances by understanding their quiddities, which however cannot be
          known through sensible objects which we know and which are entirely
          transcended by them. Hence if they were known according to their
          essences, it would follow that some things would be known without
          induction and sense perception, which the Philosopher here denies even
          in regard to abstracted things.<br /></p

        </p>
        <p>
          After the Philosopher has determined concerning the demonstrative
          syllogism by showing from what and what sort of things it proceeds and
          in which figure demonstrations can be formed, he now inquires whether
          demonstrations can proceed to infinity. First, he raises the question.
          Secondly, he settles it (82a21) [L. 32]. Concerning the first he does
          two things. First, he sets down certain prefatory remarks needed for
          understanding the question. Secondly, he raises the question (81b30).
          Concerning the first he does two things. First, he prefaces something
          about the syllogistic form one must observe in demonstrations.
          Secondly, he re views what the matter of demonstration should be
          (81b14).
        </p>
        <p>
          With respect to the first (81b10) he touches on three things, the
          first of which is common to every syllogism, namely, that every
          syllogism is formed in three terms, as is indicated in
          <i>Prior Analytics</i> I. The second however, pertains to an
          affirmative syllogism whose form is such that it concludes A to be in
          C, because A is in B and B in C. And this is the form of a syllogism
          in the first figure in which alone can be concluded a universal
          affirmative, the chief quest in demonstration. The third pertains to a
          negative syllogism which of necessity has one affirmative proposition
          and one negative, but differently in the first figure and in the
          second, as is clear from what has been shown in the
          <i>Prior Analytics</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (81b14) he reviews what the matter of demonstration should be. In
          regard to this he does three things. First, he states what this matter
          is. Secondly, he shows the difference between this matter and the
          matter of a dialectical syllogism (81b18). Thirdly, he clarifies this
          difference (81b24).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (81b14) that since a syllogism has three terms
          from which are formed the two propositions which conclude the third,
          it is clear that these propositions, from which one proceeds in a
          demonstrative syllogism according to the aforesaid form, are the
          principles and suppositions we discussed earlier. For one who accepts
          such principles demonstrates through them in the syllogistic form we
          have mentioned, namely, that A is in C is proved through B; and if the
          proposition AB is mediate, another middle is used to demonstrate that
          A is in B. The like is done if the minor proposition, BC, is mediate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (81b18), apropos of what has been said, he shows the difference
          between a demonstrative and a dialectical syllogism. For since the
          latter aims at producing opinion, the sole intent of a dialectician is
          to proceed from things that are most probable, and these are things
          that appear to the majority or to the very wise. Hence if a
          dialectician in syllogizing happens upon a proposition which really
          has a middle through which it could be proved, but it seems not to
          have a middle because it appears to be <i>per se</i> known on account
          of its probability, this is enough for the dialectician: he does not
          search for a middle, even though the proposition is mediate. Rather he
          syllogizes from it and completes the dialectical syllogism
          satisfactorily.
        </p>
        <p>
          The demonstrative syllogism, on the other hand, is ordained to
          scientific knowledge of the truth; accordingly, it pertains to the
          demonstrator to proceed from truths which are really immediate. Hence
          if he happens upon a mediate proposition, he must prove it through its
          proper middle until he reaches something immediate, because he is not
          content with the probability of a proposition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (81b24) he elucidates what he has said, asserting that his claim
          that the demonstrator proceeds “to the truth from things that are” is
          supported by the fact that it is possible to find something “which is
          not predicated of a thing accidentally.” What this means he explains
          by showing how in the case of affirmative statements something is
          predicated accidentally.
        </p>
        <p>
          For something is predicated accidentally in two ways: in one way, when
          the subject is predicated of an accident, as when we say, “The white
          thing is a man”; in another way, when the accident is predicated of
          the subject, as when we say, “The man is white.” Now this way differs
          from the first, because when the accident is predicated of the
          subject, it is stated that the man is white not because something else
          is white but because the man himself is white. Yet it is a
          <i>per accidens</i> proposition, because “white” does not belong to
          man according to the specific nature of man. For neither is placed in
          the definition of the other. But when it is stated that the white
          thing is a man, it is not so stated because being a man is in the
          whiteness, but because being a man is in the subject of whiteness,
          which subject happens to be white. Hence this way is further removed
          from <i>per se</i> predication than the first.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there are certain things which are not predicated
          <i>per accidens</i> in either of these ways: these are said to be
          <i>per se</i>. Such are the things from which the demonstrator
          proceeds. But the dialectician is not so demanding; consequently, the
          question concerning such things as are predicated <i>per se</i> is not
          relevant to the dialectical syllogism but only to the demonstrative
          syllogism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (81b30) he raises the questions he intended. Concerning this he
          does two things. First, he raises the questions in regard to things to
          which they are relevant. Secondly, he shows the cases in which they
          are not relevant (82a15). Concerning the first he does two things.
          First, he raises questions in affirmative demonstrations. Secondly, he
          shows that these questions also have relevance in negative
          demonstrations (82a9). In regard to the first he does two things.
          First, he raises the questions. Secondly, he shows where such
          questions are relevant (82a7).
        </p>
        <p>
          In regard to the first (81b30) he raises three questions corresponding
          to the three terms of a syllogism. First, he raises a question
          concerning the major extreme, namely, whether one can go to infinity
          in ascending order? In this question an ultimate subject is supposed
          which is not predicated of any other, but other things are predicated
          of it. Let this subject be C, and let B be in C first and immediately,
          and let E be in B, as universally predicated of B; furthermore, let F
          be in E as universally predicated of it. The question is this: Should
          this ascending process come to a halt somewhere, so that something is
          reached which is predicated universally of other things but nothing
          else is predicated of it, or is that not necessary but a process to
          infinity occurs?
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly (81b34) he raises the question on the part of the minor term,
          namely, whether one can go to infinity in descending. In this question
          some first universal predicate is supposed which is predicated of
          other things and nothing is more universal than it so as to be
          predicated of it. Thus let A be such that nothing is predicated of it
          as a universal whole of a part, but A is predicated of H both first
          and immediately, and H of G, and G of B. The question then is this: Is
          it necessary to come to a halt in this descending process, or may it
          proceed to infinity?
        </p>
        <p>
          Then he shows the difference between these two questions. For in the
          first one we asked: If someone begins from a most particular subject
          which is in nothing else the way a universal whole is in a part but
          other things are in it, does an infinite ascending process occur? But
          in the second we are asking: If someone begins with a most universal
          predicate, which is predicated of other things as a universal whole of
          its parts but nothing is predicated of it in this way, does an
          infinite descending process occur?
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly (82a2) he raises the third question on the part of the middle
          term. In this question two determinate extremes are supposed, namely,
          a most universal predicate and a most particular subject. The question
          is whether under these conditions there can be an infinity of middles.
          Thus, if A is the most universal predicate and C the most particular
          subject, and if between A and C there is the middle, B, and again
          between A and B another middle, and likewise between B and C;
          furthermore, if there are other middles of these middles between them
          and the extremes both in ascending and in descending order. The
          question then is this: May these processes go on to infinity or is
          that impossible?
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (82a7) he shows what is the tenor of these questions. And he says
          that these questions pertain to the matter now under discussion,
          namely, to demonstrations. He says, therefore, that the attempt to
          reach true answers to these questions is the same as trying to settle
          the question whether demonstrations proceed to infinity by ascending
          or descending. By ascending, i.e., so that each proposition from which
          a demonstration proceeds would be demonstrable by another prior
          proposition. This is what he means when he asks: “Is there a
          demonstration of everything,” i.e., of every proposition? By so
          thinking, some have erred in regard to principles, as is stated in
          <i>Metaphysics</i> IV. And by descending, i.e., whether it is possible
          from any demonstrated proposition to proceed again to another
          demonstration subsequent to it. Thus, one element of the doubt is
          whether demonstrations proceed to infinity either by ascending or by
          descending. The other element is whether demonstrations are mutually
          limiting, so that one demonstration may be confirmed by another in an
          ascending process, and from one demonstration another may proceed by a
          descending process: and this until a limit is reached.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (82a9) he shows that these questions are also relevant to
          negative demonstrations, because a negative demonstration must employ
          an affirmative proposition in which the subject of the conclusion is
          contained under the middle and from which the predicate of the
          conclusion is removed. Therefore, to the extent that there is ascent
          and descent in affirmative, there must be ascent and descent in
          negative syllogisms and propositions. For example, if the conclusion
          of a demonstrative syllogism is, “No C is A,” and the middle taken is
          B, from which A is removed: the first thing to be considered,
          therefore, is whether A is removed from B first and immediately, or
          whether there is another middle G to be taken, from which A would be
          removed before it would be removed from B. In that case it would be
          necessary to consider whether A would be removed from something else
          before G, namely, from H which is predicated universally of G.
          Therefore in these also the question arises whether one can proceed to
          infinity in removing (so that something would always remain from which
          it would have to be removed), or must one stop somewhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (82a15) he shows the cases in which these questions have no
          relevance: for in cases in which there is mutual predication and
          mutual conversion there is no prior and subsequent to be taken in the
          sense in which the prior [notion] is that with which a subsequent
          [notion] is not convertible, as universals are prior; because no
          matter whether the predicates be infinite, so that one might proceed
          to infinity in predicating, or whether there be infinity on both
          sides, i.e., on the side of the predicate as well as of the subject,
          all such infinites bear a like relationship to all, because any of
          them could be predicated of any other and be the subject of any of the
          convertibles. However, there can be this difference: one of them might
          be predicated as an accident and another as a predicament, i.e., as a
          substantial predicate. And this is the difference between a property,
          and a definition: although the two are convertible with the
          subject,nevertheless the definition is an essential predicate and
          therefore naturally prior to the property, which is an accidental
          predicate. That is why in demonstrations we use the definition as the
          middle to demonstrate a proper attribute of the subject.<br /></p

        </p>
        <p>
          After raising the questions, the Philosopher here begins to settle
          them. And his treatment is divided into two parts. In the first he
          shows that the solution of some of the doubts is reduced to the
          solution of others. In the second he settles the doubt as to those
          items in which the difficulty lies <i>per se</i> as in its source
          (82b34) [L. 33]. Concerning the first he does two things. First, he
          shows that the doubt bearing on the middles is reduced to the one
          which is concerned with the extremes and is solved by the solution of
          the latter. Secondly, he shows that the doubt bearing on negative
          demonstrations is reduced to the one which is concerned with
          affirmative demonstrations (82a37). In regard to the first he does
          three things. First, he states his intended proposition. Secondly, he
          proves this proposition (82a24). Thirdly, he excludes a subterfuge
          (82a30).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (82a21) that it will be plain to anyone who
          considers the following reason that “an infinity of middles does not
          occur,” if the predications both upwards and downwards stop at certain
          terms, namely, at the highest predicate and the lowest subject. And he
          explains what upward and downward predication consists in, saying that
          one proceeds upwards when there is movement to the more universal, one
          of whose marks it is that it be predicated; but one proceeds downwards
          when there is movement to the most particular, one of whose marks it
          is that it functions as a subject.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (82a24) he shows what he has proposed in the following way: Let
          the case be that A is the highest predicate and F the lowest subject,
          and that there is an infinitude of middles, each of which we shall
          call B. Now since A was the first predicate, it will be predicated of
          some middle near it, and that middle of another middle below it. Since
          the middles are infinite, it follows that the predication will proceed
          downwards to infinity—which is contrary to what we are assuming. For
          it was assumed that the predications do not proceed downwards to
          infinity. The result is the same if we start at F, which is the lowest
          subject, and proceed upwards to infinity before A is reached—this too
          would be against our assumption. Therefore, if these are impossible,
          namely, that one may proceed to infinity by ascending or by
          descending, it will be impossible for the middles to be infinite. Thus
          it is clear that the question of an infinity of middles is reduced to
          a question of the infinity of the extremes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (82a30) he excludes an objection. For someone might object saying
          that the aforesaid proof would hold if ABF, i.e., the middle and the
          extremes, were so related as to be “had” to one another, i.e., so that
          there would be no middle between them: for this is the way the
          Philosopher defines “had” in <i>Physics</i> V, namely, that it is next
          to something without anything between. And this seemed to be supposed
          in the above proof, namely, that A is predicated of some middle as
          though “had” to it, i.e., following it immediately. But one who posits
          infinite middles will say that this cannot be supposed. For he will
          say that between any two terms that are taken there is a middle.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the philosopher says that it makes no difference whether the
          infinitude be of middles that are “had” to one another, the way
          discrete things are (for example, in a city. house is consecutive to
          house, and in numbers, unity to unity), or whether something “had”
          cannot be found in the middles although between any two middles it is
          always possible to find another, as happens in continua, in which,
          between any two signs, i.e., between two points, another can be found
          between them.
        </p>
        <p>
          That this makes no difference one way or the other to the matter at
          hand he manifests in the following way: Granted that between A and F
          there is an infinitude of middles, each of which is called B, yet no
          matter which of these I employ, there is either an infinitude of
          middles between it and A and F, or there is not an infinitude of them
          between it and one or the other of the extremes. For example, let us
          suppose that the middles are mutually “had,” as happens in discrete
          things, and let us take a middle which is “had” to A; then it will be
          necessary that between that middle and F there is still an infinitude
          of middles; and similarly, if we assume a certain finitude of middles
          between that middle and A. And the same reasoning holds if the middle
          which is taken be joined immediately to for is distant from it by a
          finitude of middles. From the fact, therefore, that from any given
          middle one must take an infinitude of middles to one or other of the
          extremes, it makes no difference whether it is joined to either
          extreme immediately, i.e., without a middle, or not immediately, i.e.,
          through other middles: because even if it be joined to one extreme
          without a middle, it will still be necessary later to find an
          infinitude of middles in relation to the other. Consequently, it will
          always be required, if there is an infinitude of middles, to proceed
          to infinity in predications either by ascending or by descending, as
          the above proof showed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (82a37) he shows that if there is no process to infinity in
          affirmadve demonstrations, then neither in negative demonstrations:
          and thus the question of negative demonstrations is reduced to the
          question of affirmative ones. He does three things in regard to this
          point. First, he proposes what he intends. Secondly, he proves what he
          proposed (82b4). Thirdly, he excludes an objection (82b28).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (82a37) that it will be clear from what
          follows that if in the predicative, i.e., in the affirmative
          demonstration, a stop is made at both, i.e., upwards and downwards, it
          will be necessary that a stop be made in the negative demonstration.
        </p>
        <p>
          To elucidate what he is proposing he says: Let the case be such that
          from the ultimate, i.e., from the lowest subject one cannot go in
          ascending order to infinity toward universal predicates. And he
          explains that “ultimate” means that which is not in any other as in a
          less particular, but something else is in it, and let it be F. And let
          the case also be that one does not go to infinity when proceeding from
          the first to the ultimate. And he explains that the “first” means that
          which is predicated of others but nothing else is predicated of it as
          more universal than it. Thus the “first” is understood to be the most
          universal, and the “ultimate” the most particular. If, therefore, on
          both sides there be a stop in affirmative demonstrations, he says that
          as a consequence, there is also a stop in negative demonstrations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (82b4) he proves his proposition. First, in the first figure.
          Secondly, in the second (8513). Thirdly, in the third (82b23). For a
          negative can be concluded in three figures.
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (82b4) that there are three ways of
          demonstrating a negative proposition through which something is
          signified not to be. In one way in the first figure according to the
          mode that B is universally in C in the universal affirmative minor,
          but A is in no B in the universal negative major. Now since we are
          supposing that there is a stop in affirmatives, both upwards and
          downwards, it is necessary that the proposition, BC, which is
          affirmative, if it is not immediate but a space exists with middles
          between B and C, be reduced to immediates, because that space which
          exists between the middle term and the extreme is affirmative, in
          which a stop is supposed. But if we take the other space, which is
          between B and A, it is clear that if this proposition, “No B is A,” is
          not immediate, it is necessary that A be removed from something else
          before being removed from B. Let this be D. But if this D be taken as
          a middle between A and B, it is necessary that it be universally
          predicated of B, because the minor must be affirmative. And if this
          too is not immediate, i.e., “No D is A ‘ “ then A has to be denied of
          something prior to D, say E, which again will be predicated
          universally of D for the same reason. Therefore, since there is a stop
          in affirmatives when we ascend, as supposed, it follows that something
          is reached of which A should be denied first and immediately;
          otherwise one would go still further in affirmatives, as is clear from
          the foregoing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (82b13) he proves the same thing for the negative which is
          concluded in the second figure. For let the case be that B, which is
          the middle, is predicated universally of A and denied universally of
          C, so that the conclusion is “No C is A.” Now if the negative premise
          needs to be demonstrated because it is mediate, it must be
          demonstrated either in the first figure in the mode of demonstrating
          concerning which we have shown that there is a stop, if there is a
          stop in affirmatives; or it must be demonstrated through this mode,
          i.e., in the second figure, or through a third mode, i.e., in the
          third figure. Now it has been established that there is a stop in
          negatives of the first figure, if there is a stop in affirmatives.
          Consequently, the same will now be demonstrated as to the second
          figure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, let this proposition, “No C is B,” be demonstrated in such
          a way that D is universally predicated of B in the universal
          affirmative major and denied universally of C in the universal
          negative minor. Now if the proposition, “No C is D,” is mediate, it
          will be required to take some other middle which will be predicated
          universally of D and universally removed from C. Continuing thus, it
          will be necessary to proceed in negative demonstrations just as we do
          in affirmatives, namely, B will be predicated of A and D of B, and
          something else of D, and so on to infinity in affirmatives. But
          because we are supposing an upward stop in the affirmatives, it is
          also necessary to come to a stop in the negatives according to this
          mode in which a negative is demonstrated in the second figure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (82b23) he shows the same thing in the third figure. Therefore,
          let B be a middle of which A is universally predicated, but C is
          universally denied of it: the conclusion will be a particular
          negative, namely, C is denied of some A. Now that there is a stop in
          the affirmative premise, “Every B is A,” is granted by our
          supposition. Furthermore, that there must be a stop in the negative,
          “No B is C,” which is the major, is evident, because if it had to be
          demonstrated, it would be done either “through what was said above,”
          i.e., through the first and second figure or in the way that the
          conclusion was concluded, namely, through the third figure, in which
          case this minor is not affirmed as universal but as particular. “But
          there is a stop in that way,” i.e., if one proceeds in the first and
          second figure. But if one proceeds in the third figure to conclude
          that “Some B is not C,” let a middle, E, be taken such that B is
          universally affirmed of it but C is particularly denied of it. “Then
          this happens once more in like manner,” i.e., according to this, one
          will always proceed in the negative demonstration by accumulating
          affirmative predications in descending order, because B which was the
          first middle will be predicated of E, and E of something else, and so
          on to infinity. But since we are supposing that there is a stop in the
          descending order in affirmatives, it is clear that there will be a
          stop in the negatives on the part of C.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (82b28) he excludes an objection. For someone could say that it
          is necessary to stop in negative propositions when there is a stop in
          the affirmatives, provided that one always syllogizes according to the
          same figure; but if one demonstrates now in one figure and now in
          another, one can go to infinity. And he say’~ that “it is obvious”
          that if one does not limit himself to one figure\in demonstrating but
          uses all, proceeding now in the first figure and now in the second and
          third, there must still be a stop in the negatives if there is one in
          the affirmatives. For these various ways of demonstrating are finite,
          and each of them will be enlarged not to infinity but finitely by
          ascending or descending, as was shown. Now if, finite things be taken
          a finite number of times, the result is finite. Hence it remains that
          in all the modes there must be a stop in negative demonstrations, if
          there is a stop in the affirmatives.<br /></p

        <p>
          After showing that if there is a stop in the extremes there must be a
          stop in the middles, and if there is a stop in affirmatives there must
          be a stop in negatives, the Philosopher now shows that there is a stop
          in affirmatives both upwards and downwards. And his treatment is
          divided into two parts. In the first part he shows his thesis
          “logically,” i.e., through characteristics common to every syllogism,
          which are based on predicates considered commonly. In the second he
          shows the same thing analytically, i.e., through characteristics
          proper to demonstration, which are based on <i>per se</i> predicates
          which are proper to demonstration (84a8) [L. 35]. The first is divided
          into two parts. In the first he shows that one does not proceed to
          infinity in predicates which are predicated in
          <i>eo quod quid</i> (i.e., pertaining to the essence of the subject].
          In the second he shows universally that one does not proceed to
          infinity in affirmative predicates (83a1).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (82b34) that since we have established that an
          infinite process does not occur in negatives if there is a stop in
          affirmatives, our present task will be to show how one speculates
          through logical reasons that there is a stop “in those,” i.e., in
          affirmatives. (These reasons are called “logical,” because they
          proceed from certain common notions that pertain to the considerations
          of logic).
        </p>
        <p>
          Now this truth is clear in regard to things predicated as constituting
          the essence of a thing, namely, the predicates from which the
          <i>quod quid est</i>, i.e., the definition, is formed. For if such
          predicates were agreed to be infinite, the result would be that
          nothing can be defined, and that if something is defined, its
          definition cannot be known: and all because the infinite cannot be
          traversed. For a thing cannot be defined, or its definition known,
          except by reaching the ultimate through descent and the first through
          ascent. Therefore, if something can be defined, or if a thing’s
          definition can be known, then in either case this consequence will
          follow, namely, there is no infinite process in the aforementioned
          predicates, but there is a stop in them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (83a1) he shows universally that there is not a process to
          infinity in affirmative predicates. In regard to this he does two
          things. First, he prefaces certain things needed for establishing the
          thesis. Secondly, he establishes it (83a36) [L. 34]. In regard to the
          first he does two things. First, he distinguishes
          <i>per accidens</i> from <i>per se</i> predicates. Secondly, he
          distinguishes among the <i>per se</i> predicates (83a21).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (83a1) that since it has been established in
          regard to certain predicates that there is no infinite process in
          them, namely, in those which are predicated as pertaining to the
          essence, our task is to show that this is universally so in all
          affirmative predicates. And he begins his consideration with
          <i>per accidens</i> predicates in which there are three modes of true
          predication. One mode is when an accident is predicated of an
          accident, as when we say, “Something white is walking.” The second
          mode is when the subject is predicated of an accident, as when we say,
          “Something white is wood.” The third mode is when an accident is
          predicated of a-subject, as when we say, “Wood is white,” or “Man
          walks.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Now these modes of predicating are mutually other and diverse, because
          when its subject is predicated of an accident, say “Something white is
          wood,” what is signified is that the universal predicate, “wood,” is
          being predicated of a subject which happens to be wood, i.e., this
          particular wood in which there is whiteness. For when I say,
          “Something white is wood,” the meaning is the same as “This wood which
          happens to be white is wood”; in other words, the sense is not that
          “white” is the subject of wood.
        </p>
        <p>
          And he proves this on the ground that it is either according to its
          totality or according to a part that a subject comes to be that which
          is predicated of it as of a subject, as a man comes to be white. But
          neither the white nor its white part, which is really white, i.e.,
          which pertains to the very essence of whiteness, becomes wood: for an
          accident is not the subject of change whereby wood comes to be from
          non-wood. But whatever begins to be such and such, comes to be it;
          therefore, if it does not come to be this, it is not it-unless it is
          granted that it always was this. But it was not always true to say
          that the white [object] is wood, because at some time the whiteness
          and the wood were not together. Therefore, since it is not true to say
          that the white [object] becomes wood, it is obvious that the white
          [object], properly and <i>per se</i> speaking, is not wood. Yet if it
          be granted that something white is wood, it is understood
          <i>per accidens</i>, namely, because that particular subject, which
          happens to be white, is wood. This, therefore, is the sense of any
          predication in which a subject is predicated of an accident.
        </p>
        <p>
          But when I say, “Wood is white,” predicating an accident of the
          subject, I do not signify, as I did in the previous mode of
          predication, that there is something else substantially white, such
          that to be wood happens to it: which, of course, is signified both in
          the previous mode, where a subject is predicated of an accident, and
          in the other mode, where an accident is predicated of an accident, as
          when I say, “The musician is white”: for this signifies nothing but
          the fact that this particular man, say Socrates, who happens to be a
          musician, is white. But when I say, “The wood is white,” I signify
          that the wood itself has become the subject of white, and not that
          something other than the wood or other than a section of the wood has
          become white.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, there is a difference among these three modes of
          predicating, because when an accident is predicated of a subject, it
          is not predicated in virtue of some other subject; but when the
          subject is predicated of an accident or an accident of an accident,
          the predication is made in virtue of that which is subjected to the
          terms acting as the subject, of which another accident is predicated
          accidentally in the second case, and the species of the subject is
          predicated essentially in the first case.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now since in each of the above modes we use the name, “predication,”
          and since it lies within our power to employ names as well as to
          restrict them, let us agree so to use our names in the following proof
          that only those things are said to be predicated which are said in
          this way, namely, not in virtue of some other subject. Consequently,
          whatever is said in another way, namely, by reason of another subject,
          as when a subject is predicated of an accident or an accident of an
          accident, shall not be said to be predicated—or if it is said to be
          predicated, it shall be said to be predicated not absolutely but
          <i>per accidens</i>. Furthermore, that which is after the manner of
          “white,” let us always take on the part of the predicate, and that
          which is after the manner of “wood,” let it be taken on the part of
          the subject. Therefore, in the following proof let us suppose this to
          be predicated which is predicated not <i>per accidens</i>, but
          absolutely, of that of which it is predicated. And the reason why we
          should use the word “predication” in this way is that we are speaking
          of demonstrative matters, and demonstrations use only such
          predications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (83a21) he shows the differences among <i>per se</i> predicates.
          In regard to this he does two things. First, he distinguishes these
          predicates into diverse genera. Secondly, he shows the differences
          among them (83a24).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (83a21) that because we are saying that those
          things alone are being predicated which are predicated not in virtue
          of some other subject, and this is diversified according to the ten
          predicaments, it follows that whatever is thus predicated is
          predicated “either in <i>quod quid est</i>,” i.e., after the manner of
          an essential predicate, or after the manner of quality or quantity or
          one of the other predicaments discussed in the <i>Categories</i>. And
          he adds, “when one is predicated of one,” because if a predicate is
          not one but several, it cannot be said to be predicated precisely as
          <i>quid</i> or <i>quale</i>, but perhaps jointly as <i>quale quid</i>,
          as when I say “Man is a white animal.” Now it was necessary to add
          this because if several things are predicated of one in such a way
          that they function as one predicate, predications will be multipliable
          to infinity according to the infinite modes of combining predicates
          one to another. Hence when there is question of a stop in things that
          are predicated, it is necessary to take one thing predicated of one
          thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (83a24) he indicates the difference among the aforesaid
          predicates. In regard to this he does three things. First, he proposes
          the difference. Secondly, he clarifies it with examples (83a27).
          Thirdly, he excludes an objection (83a33).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (83a24) that those which signify substance
          must signify, in respect to that of which they are predicated, “what
          it truly is or something that it truly is.” This can be understood in
          two ways: in one way, as showing a distinction on the part of the
          predicate which might signify either the entire essence of the
          subject, as a definition does (and he signifies this when he says,
          “what it truly is”), or part of the essence, as a genus or a
          difference does (and he signifies this when he says, “or something
          that it truly is.”) In another way, and better, as showing a
          distinction on the part of the subject, which is sometimes convertible
          with an essential predicate, as the definitum with the definition (and
          he signifies this, when he says, “what it truly is”), and sometimes is
          a subjective part of the predicate, as man is of animal (and he
          signifies this when he says, “or something that it truly is,” for man
          is a certain anima1). But those which do not signify substance but are
          said of some subject (which subject is not truly, i.e., essentially,
          that predicate nor something of it), all such predicates are
          accidental.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (83a27) he clarifies the aforesaid difference with examples,
          saying that when we say, “Man is white,” the predicate is accidental,
          because man is not that which white truly is, i.e., to be white is not
          the essence of man “or anything of what white truly is,” as was
          explained above. But, when it is stated, “Man is an animal,” perhaps
          man is that which animal truly is. For animal signifies the essence of
          man, because that which is man is essentially animal. And although
          predicates that do not signify substance are accidents, they are not
          predicated <i>per accidens</i>. For they are not predicated of some
          subject in virtue of some other subject; for when I say, “Man is
          white,” “white” is not predicated of man by reason of some other
          subject’s being white in virtue of which man is called white as was
          explained above in regard to things predicated <i>per accidens</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (83a33) he excludes an objection. For someone could say that
          predicates which signify the substance are not truly and essentially
          that which they are predicated of, nor are they something of it; and
          that accidents which exist in individuals as in subjects, do not
          correspond to any common essential predicates, because such universal
          predicates signify certain separated essences always subsisting by
          themselves, as the Platonists say.
        </p>
        <p>
          But he answers that if Forms, i.e., Ideas, are assumed to exist, they
          should be happy, because according to the Platonists they have a
          nobler existence than the material things known to us. For the latter
          are particular and material, but the former universal and immaterial.
          For they are “premonstrations,” i.e., certain exemplars, of material
          things (taking “premonstrations” here as above, when we spoke of
          something being shown beforehand in order to prove something).
          Therefore, since they are the premonstrations or exemplars of natural
          things, it is necessary that in these natural things there be found
          certain participations of those Forms which pertain to the essences of
          these natural things. Hence if such separated Forms exist, as the
          Platonists contend, they have nothing to do with the present matter.
          For we are concerned with things, the science of which is produced in
          us through demonstration. And these are things existing in matter and
          known to us and concerning which demonstrations deal. Consequently, if
          it be granted that “animal” is something separated, an existing
          premonstration, as it were, of natural animals, then when I say, “Man
          is an animal,” in the sense that we use this preposition in
          demonstrating, “animal” signifies the essence of the natural thing
          concerning which the demonstration is made.<br /></p

        </p>
        <p>
          Having set forth the distinction of predicates from one another as a
          necessary preliminary to demonstrating his proposition, the
          Philosopher now undertakes to show his proposition, namely, that there
          is no infinite process in predicates. And his treatment falls into two
          parts, according to the two ways in which he shows his proposition,
          the second part beginning at (83b33). Concerning the first he does two
          things. First, he shows that one does not proceed to infinity in
          predicates after the manner of circularity (see Lect. 8). Secondly,
          that one does not proceed to infinity in a direct line upwards or
          downwards (83b13). Concerning the first he does three things. First,
          granting what has gone before, he adds certain things required for
          showing his proposition. Secondly, from these and other established
          facts he concludes the proposition (83a37). Thirdly, he proves it
          (8309).
        </p>
        <p>
          First, therefore (83a6) he proposes two things: one of these is that
          since a predicate which signifies an accident signifies some genus of
          accident, such as quality, it cannot occur that two things be so
          related to one another that the first is a quality of the second and
          the second a quality of the first: for the nature of a quality and
          that of which it is the quality are diverse. The second is that
          universally it is not possible that a quality have some other quality
          inhering in it, because no accident is the subject of another
          accident, absolutely speaking. For to substance alone does the notion
          of subject properly belong.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (83a37) he proposes, as though concluding from these antecedents,
          what he intends to prove. He says, “If our preliminary rules are true,
          it is impossible that there be equal reciprocal predication,” i.e.,
          according to any of the above-mentioned ways. But this does not
          exclude the possibility of one thing’s being truly predicated of
          another and conversely. For we say truly that man is white and that
          something white is a man. However, this is not done equally, i.e.,
          according to an equal manner of predicating. And it is the same in
          essential predicates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (83a39) he shows the proposition. First, in essential predicates
          Secondly, in accidental ones (83b10). In regard to the first he does
          three things. First, he lays down a division of essential predicates.
          Secondly, he recalls something established above (83b1). Thirdly, he
          proves the proposition (83b8).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (83a39) that in order to show that they are
          not reciprocally predicated equally, it will be necessary to consider
          this in essential predicates. For that which is predicated equally
          will be predicated either as a substance or some other way: and if as
          a substance, then either as a genus or as a difference. For these are
          the two parts of a definition which signify the essence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (83b1) he recalls what he had proved above at the beginning of
          the previous lecture, namely, that predicates of this kind are not
          infinite; because if they were to proceed to infinity, reciprocity or
          circularity would find no place therein. He says, therefore, that as
          has been shown above, an infinite process does not take place in such
          predicates either by ascending or by descending: for example, if
          “two-footed” be predicated of man, and “animal” of two-footed,
          something else of animal, there is no process to infinity either
          upwards or downwards. Thus, if “animal” were said essentially of man,
          and “man” of Callias, and this of somone else (supposing that there
          were a genus containing under it species, one of which would be
          Callias), it would not be possible to go on in this way to infinity.
          And he recalls the reason he used earlier to prove this: for every
          such substance which has something more universal that can be
          predicated of it and which can be predicated of some inferior is
          capable of being defined; but the most general genera of which other
          more universal things are not predicated, and singulars which are not
          predicated of any inferiors, are not capable of definition. Only the
          substance between these can be defined. But a substance of which an
          infinite number of things is predicated turns out to be indefinable,
          because one who would define it must go through and understand all the
          items which are substantially predicated of the defined, since all of
          them occur in the definition either as a genus or as a difference. But
          the infinite cannot be gone through. Therefore, it is required that
          neither a universal substance, which is not a supreme genus, nor a
          lowest subject, can have an infinitude of predicates which are
          predicated of it substantially. Consequently, there is no infinite
          process either upwards or downwards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (83b8) he shows that there is no process to infinity after the
          manner of circularity in substantial predicates. And he says that if
          certain substantial predicates are predicated as genera of something,
          they are not predicated of one another equally, i.e., convertibly,
          i.e., so that one would be the genus of another and vice versa. To
          prove this he continues, “for the one will be what something truly
          is.” As if to say: if something is predicated of something as a genus,
          that of which it is predicated is something which truly is that, i.e.,
          something particular which receives that predication substantially.
          Therefore, if this be predicated of that as a genus, it will follow
          that something which belongs to something particularly would
          conversely receive the predication of it, which is tantamount to
          saying that a same thing is both a whole and a part in relation to the
          same thing—which is impossible. And the same reasoning applies to
          differences. Hence in <i>Topics</i> I it is stated that problems
          concerning a difference are reduced to problems concerning the genus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (83b10) he shows that there cannot be an infinite circular
          process in predications in which an accident is predicated of a
          subject. And he says that there cannot be conversion of a quality with
          its subject; furthermore, none of the others which are predicated
          accidentally can have that sort of predication, unless the predication
          be made <i>per accidens</i> in the sense described above, namely, that
          accidents are not predicated of their subjects except
          <i>per accidens</i>. For quality and all these others are accidental
          to the subject; hence they are predicated of their substances as an
          accident of a subject.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (83b13) he shows universally that in no genus of predication is i
          liere an infinite process upwards or downwards. And he says that not
          only is there no infinite process in predications according to
          circulation, but also that in proceeding upwards or downwards the
          predicates will not be infinite. To prove this: First, he recalls
          certain things which were established above. Secondly, from these he
          concludes his proposition 83b24).
        </p>
        <p>
          In regard to the first he reaffirms (83b13) that certain things can be
          predicated of a subject, whether they signify quality or quantity or
          any other genus of accident, or even items which constitute the
          substance of a thing, i.e., essential predicates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, he reiterates, that the latter, i.e., the substantial
          predicates, are finite.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly, he reaffirms that the genera of predicaments are finite,
          namely, quality, quantity and so on. For if someone were to say that
          quantity is predicated of substance, and quality of quantity, and so
          on to infinity, he excludes this on the ground that the genera of
          predicaments are finite.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourthly, he reaffirms that, as stated above, one thing is predicated
          of one thing in simple predication. And he mentions this because
          someone might say that one thing may well be first predicated of one
          thing, as “animal” of man, and this predication will be multiplied
          until something else can be found predicable of man, and when this is
          found, two things, will be predicated of one, so that it will be said
          that man is a white animal. Thus, many more predicates might be found
          according to various combinations of predicates. And so by continually
          adding to this number, the predicates will be increased more and more,
          so that there will be a process to infinity in predicates, just as
          there is in the succession of numbers. But he excludes this by
          predicating one of one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fifthly, he repeats that we should not say that certain items are
          predicated absolutely “of things which are not something,” i.e., of
          accidents, none of which is a subsistent being. For, as shown above,
          neither the, subject nor an accident is properly predicated of an
          accident. For all things of this sort that are not substantial are
          accidents, and nothing is predicated, simply speaking, of such things.
          Yet they whether they be substantial predicates or accidental, they
          are predicated <i>per se</i> of their subjects; but if they are
          subjects or accidents being predicated of an accident, they are
          predicated in another way, i.e., <i>per accidens</i>. For it belongs
          to the very notion of all accidents that they be said of a subject;
          and since an accident is not a subject, nothing can, properly
          speaking, be predicated of it, because “none of such,” i.e., no
          accidents, “are stated to be such that they are said to be that which
          is said,” i.e., stated to be such that they themselves, rather than
          something else distinct from them, receives the predication of that
          which is predicated of them, as happens in the case of substances. For
          man is not called “animal” or “white” because something else is
          “animal” or “white,” but because the very thing which is a man is
          animal or white; but a white thing is called “man” or “musician”
          because something else, namely, the subject of white is the man or
          musician. But the accident itself is in something distinct from it;
          and items which are predicated of an a accident are predicated of
          something other than that accident, namely, of the subject of the
          accident: it is on this ground that they are predicated of the
          accident, as has been stated. (Now he mentioned this because if an
          accident is predicated of a subject and vice versa, and all accidents
          of a subject can be mutually predicated of one another, it will follow
          that predication could proceed to infinity, because an infinitude of
          things can happen to one thing).
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (83b24) from these premises he shows his proposition, namely,
          that in a predication in which one thing is predicated of one thing
          there is no upward or downward process to infinity, because, as the
          fifth supposition states, all accidents are predicated of items which
          pertain to the substance of the thing. Furthermore, according to the
          second supposition, substantial predicates are not infinite;
          consequently, on the part of the subjects there is no infinite process
          downwards in these predications. Again, neither of these is infinite
          in the upward movement, i.e., neither the substantial nor the
          accidental predicates, both because the genera of accidents are
          finite, and because there is no infinite process upwards or downwards
          in any of these genera any more than there is in substantial
          predicates, because in each predicament the genus is predicated of a
          species in regard to something essential. Hence we can conclude
          universally that there must be some first subject of which something
          is predicated, thus establishing a stop in downward predication; then
          something else will be predicated of this, but it will come to a stop
          in the ascending process, so that something will be found which is not
          found predicated of another, either as the subsequent is predicated of
          its prior <i>per accidens</i>, or as the prior is predicated
          <i>per se</i> of its subsequent. This, therefore, is one way of
          demonstrating the proposition logically, and it is based on the
          diverse modes of predicating.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (83b33) he sets forth the second way of proving. And he says that
          when a proposition in which something is predicated of a subject is
          such that certain things can be predicated per prius of that subject,
          that proposition will be demonstrable: for example, this proposition,
          “Man is a substance,” is demonstrated by the proposition, “Animal is a
          substance,” because “substance” is predicated of animal before it is
          predicated of man. But if a proposition is demonstrable, there is no
          better way of knowing it than to know it by demonstration, just as we
          know indemonstrable principles better than by way of demonstration
          because we know them as self-evident. Besides, we cannot
          scientifically know such demonstrable propositions except through
          demonstration, because a demonstration is a syllogism productive of
          scientific knowledge, as we showed above. Furthermore, if a
          proposition is known through another one, and if we do not
          scientifically know the one through which it is known, or know it in
          the way which is better than knowing scientifically, then we do not
          scientifically know that proposition which is made known through it.
        </p>
        <p>
          With these three suppositions in mind he proceeds thus: If one does
          know something purely through demonstration “and not from something or
          from supposition,” it is necessary that there be a stop in the
          predicates which are-taken as middles. (He says, “purely and not from
          something,” to exclude) demonstrations leading to the impossible, in
          which one proceeds, against certain positions by arguing from
          propositions that have been agreed upon. Furthermore, he says, “or
          from supposition,” to exclude such demonstrations as are formed in
          subalternate sciences, which suppose the conclusion of higher
          sciences, as explained above).
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, one knows purely through demonstration when each one of the
          premised propositions, if it is demonstrable, is known through
          demonstration; and if it is not demonstrable, is known in virtue of
          itself. Under these suppositions it is necessary that there be a stop
          in predications, because if there is no stop but something prior can
          always be taken, it follows that there is demonstration of everything,
          as was said above. Therefore, if a. conclusion is demonstrated, each
          of the premises must be demonstrable. But if we can have knowledge of
          it in no better way than by knowing it through demonstration, and if
          it will be necessary to demonstrate it through other propositions, and
          those through others again, and so on to infinity, then, since it is
          not possible to go through those infinites, we shall not be able to
          make it known through demonstration or through the method better than
          demonstration, since all things are demonstrable. The consequence will
          be that one knows nothing purely through demonstration, but only from
          supposition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, by way of summary he concludes the main proposition.<br /></p

        <p>
          After showing logically that there is no infinite process upwards or
          downwards in predicates, the Philosopher now shows the same thing
          analytically. And his treatment falls into two parts. In the first he
          shows the principal proposition. In the second he infers certain
          corrolaries from the aforesaid (84b3) [L. 36]. Concerning the first he
          does two things. First, he proposes what he intends. Secondly, he
          proves his proposition (84a10).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (84a8) that the fact an infinite process
          upwards or downwards does not occur in the demonstrative sciences with
          which we are concerned can be more briefly and quickly manifested
          analytically than it was logically. Here we might note that analytic,
          i.e., demonstrative, science which is called judicative, because it
          resolves to self-evident principles, is a part of logic which even
          contains dialectics under it. However, it pertains to logic in general
          to consider predication universally, i.e., as containing under it
          predication which is <i>per se</i> and predication which is not
          <i>per se</i>. But predication <i>per se</i> is proper to
          demonstrative science. Therefore, above he proves his proposition
          logically, because he showed universally in every genus of predication
          that there is no infinite process. But here he intends to show it
          analytically, because he proves it only in things which are predicated
          <i>per se</i>. And this is a more efficient way; furthermore, it
          suffices for our purpose, because that is the only mode of predication
          we use in demonstration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (84a10) he shows his proposition concerning which he does three
          things. First, he proposes which predication analytic, i.e.,
          demonstrative, science employs, for it uses <i>per se</i> predication.
          Secondly, he recalls how many modes there are of such predication
          (84al 1). Thirdly, he shows that there cannot be an infinite process
          in any mode of <i>per se</i> predication (8408).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (84a10) that demonstration is concerned
          exclusively with items that are <i>per se</i> in things. For such are
          its conclusions and from such does it demonstrate, as was established
          above.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (84a 11) he lays down two modes of predicating <i>per se</i>. For
          in the first place those things are predicated <i>per se</i> which are
          present in their subjects as constituting their essence, namely, when
          predicates are placed in the definition of a subject. Secondly, when
          the subjects themselves are in the essence of the predicate, i.e.,
          when the subjects are placed in the definition of the predicate. And
          he gives examples of each of these ways: for “odd” is predicated
          <i>per se</i> of number in the second way, because “number” is placed
          in the definition of odd. For the odd is a number not divisible by
          two. Multitude or divisible, however, are predicated of number and are
          present in its definition; hence these are predicated <i>per se</i> of
          number in the first way. The other ways, which he mentioned
          previously, are reduced to these.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (84a18) he shows that there must be a stop in each of these modes
          of <i>per se</i> predication. In regard to this he does three things.
          First, he shows that there must be a stop both upwards and downwards
          in both of these modes of <i>per se</i> predication. Secondly, he
          concludes that there cannot be an infinitude of middles (84a28).
          Thirdly, he concludes that one cannot proceed to infinity in
          demonstrations (84a29). Concerning the first he does two things.
          First, he shows his proposition in regard to the second way of saying
          <i>per se</i>,” namely, when the subject is placed in the definition
          of the predicate. Secondly, in the first way, when the predicate is
          placed in the definition of the subject (84a25). In regard to the
          first he gives two reasons, in the first of which he proceeds in the
          following way.
        </p>
        <p>
          First (84a18) he states ‘his proposition, namely, that in neither of
          these modes of saying <i>per se</i> does an infinite process occur.
          Then he proves this of the second mode, as when “odd” is predicated of
          number. For if one goes further and states that something else should
          be predicated <i>per se</i> of “odd” according to that mode of saying
          <i>per se</i>, it follows that “odd” is present in its definition. But
          “number” is placed in the definition of odd; hence it will follow that
          “number” is also present in the definition of that third thing which
          is present <i>per se</i> in “odd.” However, this cannot go on to
          infinity, so that an infinitude of things would be in the definition
          of something, as was established above. It remains, therefore, that in
          such <i>per se</i> predications an upward process to infinity does not
          occur, i.e., on the side of the predicate.
        </p>
        <p>
          He presents the second reason (84a23) and says that no matter how fair
          one advances in these <i>per se</i> predications of the second mode,
          it will be required that all the predicates taken in order be in their
          first subject, say in number, as predicated of it, because if “odd” is
          predicated <i>per se</i> of number, it will be required that whatever
          is predicated of odd be also predicated of number. And it is further
          required that “number” be in all of them, because if “number” is
          placed in the definition of odd, it has to be placed in the definition
          of all those things which are defined by “odd.” And thus it follows
          that they are mutually in one another. Therefore, they will be
          convertible and none of wider extent than another: for this is the way
          proper attributes are related to their subjects. Hence, even though
          there be an infinitude of <i>per se</i> predicates in this way, it
          offers nothing to the purpose of one who intends to establish that
          there is an infinitude of predicates upwards or downwards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (84a25) he proves his own point in regard to the first mode of
          saying <i>per se</i>, and he states that those things which are
          predicated in essence, i.e., as pertaining to the definition of the
          subject, cannot be infinite; otherwise, definition would be
          impossible, as we showed above. From this, therefore, he concludes
          that if all the items predicated in demonstrations are predicated
          <i>per se</i>, and if there is no infinite upward process in
          <i>per se</i> predicates, it is necessary that the predicates in
          demonstrations stop in the upward movement. And from this it also
          follows that they must stop in the downward movement, because no
          matter on which side infinity is posited, science and definition are
          destroyed, as is evident from what has been said above.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (84a28) he concludes from the foregoing that if there is a stop
          upwards and downwards, the middles cannot be infinite. For it has been
          established above that if the extremes are determinate, there cannot
          be an infinitude of middles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (84a29) he further concludes that there is no infinite process in
          demonstrations. And he says that if the above statements are true, it
          is necessary that there be certain first principles of demonstration
          that are not demonstrated; consequently, there will not be
          demonstration of everything, as some claim, as was stated in the
          beginning of this book.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then he goes on to show that his consequence follows. For if it is
          granted that there are certain principles of demonstrations, it is
          necessary that they be indemonstrable: for since every demonstration
          proceeds from things that are prior, as has been established above,
          then if the principles are demonstrated, it will follow that something
          would be prior to the principles, and this is contrary to the notion
          of a principle. And so, if not all things are demonstrable, it will
          follow that demonstrations do not proceed to infinity.
        </p>
        <p>
          But all these follow from what has been established, namely, from the
          fact that there is no infinite process in middles, because the
          position that any of the foregoing statements is true, i.e., that
          demonstrations proceed to infinity, or that all things are
          demonstrable, or that there are no principles of demonstrations is
          tantamount to the position that no distance is immediate and
          indivisible’ i.e., to the position that the two terms of any
          affirmative or negative proposition belong together only in virtue of
          a middle. For if any proposition is immediate, it follows that it is
          indemonstrable; because when something is demonstrated, it is
          necessary to take a term by interposing, i.e., by setting it between
          the subject and predicate, so that the predicate will be predicated of
          that term before being predicated of the subject-or removed from it.
          But the middle in demonstrations is not taken by assuming
          extraneously; for this would be to assume an extraneous middle and not
          a proper middle-which occurs in contentious and dialectical
          syllogisms. Therefore, if demonstrations were to proceed to infinity,
          it would follow that there is an infinitude of middles between two
          extremes. But this is impossible if, as has been established above,
          the predications stop in the upward and downward process. But as we
          have shown, first logically and then analytically, these predications
          do stop both upwards and downwards, as explained. Therefore, in virtue
          of this conclusion finally induced, he manifests the intent of the
          entire chapter and why each proposition was introduced.<br /></p

        <p>
          After showing that a process to infinity does not occur in
          demonstrations, the Philosopher here adduces certain corollaries from
          what has been established. In regard to this he does two things.
          First, he shows that it is necessary to accept certain first
          propositions. Secondly, how those first things are to be used in
          demonstrations (8032). Concerning the first he does two things. First,
          he shows that it is necessary to arrive at a first, when one thing is
          predicated of several. Secondly, when one thing is predicated of one
          (84b19). In regard to the first he does four things. First, he states
          the intended proposition. Secondly, he manifests the proposition
          (84b6). Thirdly, he proves it (84b9). Fourthly, he excludes an
          objection (84b15).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (84b3) that having demonstrated the aforesaid,
          namely, that there is no process to infinity in predications and
          demonstrations, it is clear that if something is predicated of two
          things, say A of C and of D, such that one of them is not predicated
          of the other, i.e., either not at all, as animal is predicated of man
          and ox, but neither of them is predicated of the other in any way; or
          not in all cases, as animal is predicated of man and male, neither of
          which is universally predicated of the other: when the terms, I
          repeat, are thus related, it is clear that there is no need for that
          predicate, which is predicated of both, to be in them in virtue of
          something common to both and this again in virtue of something else,
          and so on to infinity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (806) he cites an example to clarify what he is proposing. For
          there are two species of triangle, one of which is scalene (none of
          whose three sides is equal to any other) and the other is isosceles
          (having two sides that are equal). But neither of these species is
          predicated of the other, and yet this proper attribute of having three
          angles equal to two right angles is present in both. Furthermore, this
          attribute is present in them in virtue of something common, namely,
          that each is a certain figure, namely, a triangle. However, this
          process does not continue forever so that something would always
          belong to it in virtue of something else and so on to infinity, so
          that “having three” would belong to triangle in virtue of something
          else again, and so on to infinity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (84b9) he proves his proposition and says: Let the case be that B
          is predicated of C and of D in virtue of this common feature A. It
          will then be clear that B will be in C and in D in virtue of that
          common feature which is A. Now if A in turn is in them in virtue of
          something common, which again is in them in virtue of some other
          common item, there will be an infinite process in the middles. It
          follows, therefore, that between the two extremes C and B there falls
          an infinitude of middle terms. But this is impossible. Therefore, if a
          same thing is in several things, it is not necessary that it be in
          them always in virtue of something else <i>ad infinitum</i>, because
          it is necessary to reach certain “immediate distances,” i.e., certain
          immediate predications, which he calls “distances,” as explained
          above.
        </p>
        <p>
          As can be seen from this proof of Aristotle’s, it is not his
          understanding that it is not always true that when some item is
          predicated of several, which are not in turn predicated of one
          another, that item is not in the several in virtue of something
          common. For this is true in everything predicated as a proper
          attribute: for if it is in several, it is required that it be in them
          in virtue of something common which might even be nameless, as we
          explained above when we treated concerning the universal. But there is
          no infinite process in that which is common, as this reason introduced
          by the Philosopher clearly proves. However, if something be taken
          which is in several as a genus in its species, it will not always be
          necessary to find something prior in virtue of which it is in them.
          For example, “living” is in man and in ass in virtue of something
          prior, namely, in virtue of “animal,” but it is not in animal and
          plant in virtue of something prior, because these are the first
          species of “living,” i.e., of animate, body.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (84b15) he excludes an objection. For someone could say that it
          is always taken in virtue of something common, in the sense that
          something from another genus might be found common to them: for
          example, if we say that “to be self-movent” is in man and in ass in
          virtue of this common feature which is “animal” and also in virtue of
          some other common feature such as “having quantity” or having color or
          other things of this sort that can be taken <i>ad infinitum</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to exclude this he says that it is required of the middle
          terms that they be taken from the same genus and “from the same
          atoms,” i.e., indivisibles. (By “atoms” he means those extreme terms
          between which the middle must be taken, if that common item which is
          taken as a middle term is to be numbered among things which are
          predicated <i>per se</i>). Why the middle terms must be taken from the
          same genus he shows from the fact that, as stated above, a
          demonstration does not cross from one genus into another.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (84b19) he shows that it is necessary to arrive at a first among
          the predicables in which one thing is predicated of one. First, in
          affirmatives. Secondly, in negatives (84b24).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (84b19) that it is clear that when A is
          predicated of B, if there is a middle between them, we can use that
          middle to demonstrate that A is in B: and these are the principles of
          this kind of conclusion. And what things soever be taken as middles
          are the principles of the mediate conclusions which are concluded
          through them. For the “elements” or principles of demonstrations are
          none but immediate propositions: and I mean “either all such
          propositions or universal ones.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Now this can be understood in two ways: in one way so that universal
          proposition is taken as set off against singular. For it is not in
          virtue of a middle that the most special species is predicated of a
          singular. Hence this proposition, “Socrates is a man,” is immediate,
          although it is not a principle of demonstration, because
          demonstrations are not concerned with singulars, since there is no
          science of such. Consequently, not every immediate proposition, but
          only one that is universal, is a principle of demonstration. In
          another way it can be understood in the sense that of all the
          propositions of any science, the universal propositions are the common
          propositions, such as “Every whole is greater than its part.” Hence
          these are absolutely the principles of demonstrations and self-evident
          to all. But the proposition, “Man is an animal,” or “The isosceles is
          a triangle,” is not a principle of demonstration throughout the
          science but only for some particular demonstrations; hence such
          propositions are not self-evident to all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consequently, if there is a middle for a given proposition, one will
          demonstrate through a middle until something immediate is readied. But
          if there is no middle for a given proposition, it cannot be
          demonstrated. But ihis is the way to find the chief principles of
          demonstrations, namely, to proceed by analysis from mediates to
          immediates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (84b24) he shows that it is necessary to arrive at a first in
          negatives, saying that if A is denied of B, if there is a middle to be
          taken from which A is removed prior to being removed from B, then this
          proposition, “B is not A,” will be demonstrable. But if there is no
          such middle to be taken, that proposition will not be demonstrable but
          will be a principle of demonstration. And there are as many
          “elements,” i.e., principles of demonstrations as there are terms at
          which a stop is reached in such a way that there is no further middle
          to find. For propositions formed of such terms are principles of
          demonstrations. Thus, if C be predicated immediately of B, and A be
          immediately removed from B or immediately predicated of it, B is the
          final term reached among the middles to be taken; hence each
          proposition will be immediate and a principle of demonstration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, it is clear from the foregoing that just as there are
          certain indemonstrable affirmative principles in which one thing is
          predicated of one thing by signifying that this is essentially that
          (as when a genus is predicated of a proximate species) or that this is
          in that (as when a proper attribute is predicated of its proper and
          immediate subject), so there are indemonstrable principles in
          negatives, namely, by denying that something is an essential predicate
          or a proper attribute. From this it is evident that there are certain
          principles of demonstration for demonstrating an affirmative
          conclusion (which must be concluded from all affirmative
          propositions), and there are certain principles of demonstration for
          proving a negative conclusion (to infer which requires that something
          negative be taken).
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (84b32) he shows how first propositions are to be used in
          demonstrating. First, in affirmative demonstrations. Secondly, in
          negatives (85a3). In regard to the first he does three things. First,
          he shows how first and immediate propositions should be taken in
          demonstrations. Secondly, how such propositions are related to
          demonstrations (8038). Thirdly, he summarizes (85a2).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (84b32) that when one is required to
          demonstrate an affirmative conclusion, for example, “Every B is A,” it
          is first necessary to take something which is first predicated of B
          before A is, and of which A is also predicated, say C. Furthermore, if
          there is something of which A is predicated before A is predicated of
          C, and something ahead of that, and so on, then no proposition and no
          term signifying a being outside of A will be taken in the
          demonstration, because it will be necessary that A be predicated of it
          <i>per se</i> in such a way that it is contained under it and is not
          extraneous to it; but it will always be necessary to condense (crowd
          together] the middles. (Here he is speaking according to an example of
          men who appear crowded together when they are sitting on a bench and
          there is no room for anyone else to sit between any two who are
          seated; in like fashion, the middles in demonstrations are condensed
          when no middle falls between the terms taken). And this is his meaning
          when he says, “the middle is condensed until the spaces become
          indivisible,” i.e., the distances between two terms are such that they
          cannot be divided into several such distances, but there is only one
          space. And this occurs when a proposition is immediate. For it is then
          that a proposition is one, not only actually but potentially, when it
          is immediate. For if it is mediate, then although it is actually one
          (because one thing is predicated of one thing), it is in fact several
          in potency, because when the middle is taken, two propositions are
          formed. In the same way, a line which is actually one, inasmuch as it
          is continuous, is several in potency, inasmuch as it is divisible at
          an intermediate point. Hence he says that an immediate proposition is
          one as a simple indivisible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (8038) he shows the relation between an immediate proposition and
          a demonstration. Here we should note that, as it is stated in
          <i>Metaphysics</i> X, in every genus there must be one first thing
          which is the most simple in that genus and is the measure of all the
          things in that genus. And because a measure is homogeneous to the
          thing measured, such first indivisibles will vary according to the
          diversity of genera. Hence these will not be the same in all genera:
          but in regard to weights one indivisible, the ounce or <i>mina</i>, is
          taken as the minimum weight (even though it is not the absolute
          minimum, because every weight is further divisible into smaller
          weights, but it is taken as a minimum by supposition). Again, in
          melodies there is taken as the one principle “a tone,” which consists
          in a proportion of an octave and a half or a “diesis,” which is the
          difference between a tone and a semi-tone. Similarly, in diverse
          genera there are diverse indivisible principles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the principles of a syllogism are propositions; hence it is
          required that the most simple proposition, which is immediate, be the
          unit which is the measure of syllogisms. But demonstration has, over
          and above a syllogism, the added feature that it causes science. Now
          “understanding” and science are related as the indivisible unit is
          related to the many. For science is effected by going from principles
          to conclusions, whereas “understanding” is the absolute and simple
          acceptance of a self-evident principle. Hence “understanding”
          corresponds to the immediate proposition, and science to a conclusion,
          which is a mediate proposition. Consequently, the indivisible unit of
          a demonstration regarded as a syllogism is the immediate proposition.
          But on the part of the science which it causes, the unit is
          “understanding.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (85a2) he sums up and concludes what was established above,
          namely, that the middle in affirmative syllogisms does not fall
          outside the extremes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (850) he shows how to use immediate propositions in negative
          syllogisms. First, in the first figure. Secondly, in the second
          (85a7). Thirdly, in the third (8500).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (85a3) that in negative syllogisms in the
          first figure, none of the middles taken while proceeding to immediates
          will fall outside the genus of the terms of an affirmative
          proposition; for example, if it is to be demonstrated that “No B is
          A,” and the middle taken is C, we have the following syllogism: “No C
          is A; but every B is C: therefore, No B is A.” Now if it should be
          necessary to prove that “No C is A,” one will be required to take a
          middle of C and A, i.e., one that will be predicated of C and
          consequently of B; thus it will belong to the genus of the terms of
          the affirmative proposition. And so it will always turn out that the
          middles taken will not fall outside the affirmative proposition,
          although they will fall outside the genus of the negative predicate,
          i.e., outside the genus of A.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (85a7) he shows how it is in the second figure, saying that if
          one is required to demonstrate in the second figure that “No E is D,”
          by taking C as middle, so as to form the syllogism, “Every D is C; but
          No E is C or Some E is not C: therefore, No E is D or Not every E is
          D,” the middle term taken will never fall outside of E. For if it
          should be necessary to demonstrate that “no E is C,” one will have to
          find a middle between E and C, because in the second figure it will
          always be necessary to prove a negative, since an affirmative cannot
          be concluded in this figure. Hence, just as in the first figure the
          middles are always taken on the side of the affirmative proposition,
          so in the second figure the middles will always be taken on the side
          of the negative proposition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (85a10) he shows how it is in the third figure, saying that in
          the third figure the middles which are taken will not be outside the
          predicate which is denied, nor outside the subject of which it is
          denied. The reason for this is that the middle is the subject in both
          propositions, whether affirmative or negative: hence if it is
          necessary to take yet another middle, it will again have to act as the
          subject of both, whether affirming or denying. And so the middles
          which are taken will never be taken outside the predicate which is
          denied, or outside the subject of which it is denied.<br /></p

        </p>
        <p>
          After determining about the demonstrative syllogism, the Philosopher
          now treats of the comparison of demonstrations one to another. And
          because science is caused by demonstration, his treatment is divided
          into two parts. In the first he treats of the comparison of
          demonstrations. In the second of the comparison of sciences (87a31)
          [L. 41]. In regard to the first he does three things. First, he raises
          a doubt concerning the comparison of demonstrations. Secondly, he lays
          down the order of procedure (85a17). Thirdly, he deals with the doubts
          raised (85a20).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (85a12) that demonstration is divided in three
          ways: for in one way it is divided into universal and particular; in
          another way into categorical and privative, i.e., affirmative and
          negative; in a third way into that which demonstrates ostensively and
          that which leads to the impossible. In each division, therefore, the
          question arises as to which is the stronger.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (85a17) he shows what order should be followed, saying that the
          comparison of universal to particular demonstration should be treated
          first. And when this has been done, we shall speak of demonstrations
          which demonstrate something affirmatively and of those which
          demonstrate to the impossible, namely, whether the affirmative is
          stronger and whether the demonstration to the impossible is stronger.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (85a20) he deals with the problems he has proposed. First, of the
          comparison of the particular with the universal. Secondly, of the
          comparison of the affirmative with the negative (86a32) [L. 39].
          Thirdly, of the comparison of the ostensive with that which leads to
          the impossible (87a1) [L. 40]. Concerning the first he does three
          things. First, he proposes reasons to show that the particular
          demonstration is more powerful than the universal. Secondly, he solves
          them (85b4). Thirdly, he gives reasons to the contrary (85b22) [L.
          38].
        </p>
        <p>
          In regard to the first he sets forth three reasons, remarking that in
          virtue of these reasons to be set down forthwith, it will perhaps seem
          to some that a particular demonstration is of more value than a
          universal one.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first reason (85a20) is this: That demonstration is stronger
          through which we know best in a scientific way. And he proves it on
          the ground that the strength of a demonstration consists in knowing in
          a scientific way. For the most that a thing can do is called its
          strength: for the strength of a man able to carry 100 pounds is not
          that he can carry ten but that he can carry 100, which is the limit of
          his power, as it is stated in <i>On the Heavens</i> I. Now the most
          that a demonstration can do is to cause scientific knowledge;
          consequently, that is the strength of a demonstration. But a thing is
          more perfect to the extent that it attains the strength appropriate to
          it, as is clear from <i>Physics</i> VII. Hence this proposition is
          quite evident, namely, that the better a demonstration causes
          scientific knowledge, the stronger it is. (He assumes that we know a
          thing better when we know it according to itself than when we know it
          according to something else: thus we know more in regard to Coriscus
          when we know that Coriscus himself is a musician than when we merely
          know that some man is a musician). And this proposition is true,
          absolutely speaking, because that which is <i>per se</i> is always
          prior to and the cause of that which is through something else, as it
          is stated in <i>Physics</i> VIII.
        </p>
        <p>
          From these facts the conclusion is gathered that a demonstration which
          makes one know something according to itself is stronger than one
          which makes one know something according to something else. But a
          universal demonstration demonstrates and makes one know something not
          according to itself, but according to something else, namely,
          according to the universal, as that a triangle with two equal sides,
          i.e., an isosceles, “has three,” not because it is isosceles but
          because it is a triangle. A particular demonstration, on the other
          hand, demonstrates about a particular thing according to itself. Hence
          according to this it follows that a particular demonstration is
          stronger than a universal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (85a31) he gives a second reason. It is this: The universal is
          not something apart from singulars, as was proved in
          <i>Metaphysics</i> VII. But a universal demonstration leads one to
          think, from the very manner of its demonstration, that the universal
          is “something,” i.e., a certain nature in the realm of beings: for
          example, when it demonstrates something of triangle apart from
          particular triangles, and of number apart from particular numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
          To these two propositions he adds two others: to the first one, which
          stated that the universal is not something apart from the singulars,
          he adds this proposition, namely, that a demonstration concerned with
          being is stronger than one concerned with non-being. But to the second
          proposition, which stated that a universal demonstration leads one to
          think that a universal is something existing as a real nature, he adds
          another proposition, namely, that a demonstration which does not cause
          error is stronger than one which leads to error.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then he shows that one is led into error on account of a universal
          demonstration, because one who proceeds according to a universal
          demonstration demonstrates concerning some universal as of some
          analogue, i.e., as of something common which is referred to many
          things proportionally, as though there existed something common which
          is neither a line nor a number nor a solid, i.e., a body, nor a plane,
          i.e., a surface, but “something apart from these,” i.e., a universal
          quantity; or “something owing to them,” i.e., something which must be
          posited, if they are to have the formality of quantity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, therefore, in virtue of two middles, equivalent as it were to
          two arguments, he concludes to one conclusion, saying that if the
          universal demonstration is as described, i.e., is less an entity than
          the particular, and more likely to create a false opinion than the
          particular, it follows from these two middles that the universal ranks
          lower than the particular.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (85b4) he solves these reasons in order. First, he solves the
          first one, saying that the first, i.e., the ground on which the first
          reason rests, is no different in the universal than in the particular,
          because in both cases we find something which is according to itself
          and something according to something else. And he shows that something
          which is according to itself is found in the universal. For “to have
          three angles equal to two right angles” does not belong to isosceles
          according to itself, i.e., precisely as isosceles, but according as it
          is a triangle. Consequently, one who knows that a certain triangle,
          namely, the isosceles, “has three,” has less knowledge of that which
          is <i>per se</i> than if he knew that a triangle “has three.” And it
          must be admitted universally that if there be any characteristic which
          does not belong to triangle as triangle, but that characteristic is
          nevertheless demonstrated of it, the demonstration will not be true.
          But if it is in it precisely as it is a triangle, then by knowing it
          in a universal way of triangle precisely as of triangle, he has a more
          perfect knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          From these facts, therefore, he concludes a conditional statement in
          whose antecedent three things are placed: one is that “triangle” is in
          more things than isosceles is; the second is that “triangle” is
          predicated of isosceles and of those others according to the same
          formality and not equivocally; the third is that “having three angles
          equal to two right angles” is present in every triangle. With these
          three suppositions, the consequent is that “the having of three” does
          not belong to triangle precisely as it is isosceles, but vice versa.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the first two were put in the antecedent on the ground that if
          “triangle” were not the wider term or if it were predicated
          equivocally of its several inferiors, it would not be compared to
          “isosceles” as universal to particular. But he added the third,
          because if “having three” did not belong to every triangle, it would
          not belong to isosceles precisely as triangle, but in virtue of being
          a certain triangle; just as the characteristic of “having three” does
          not belong to every figure precisely as figure, but because it is a
          certain figure which is a triangle.
        </p>
        <p>
          From these statements, therefore, he concludes to the opposite of that
          which the objection presupposed, namely, he concludes that one who
          knows in the universal knows the thing <i>per se</i> and as such in a
          better way than one who knows in the particular. And from this he
          further concludes his chief proposition, namely, that universal
          demonstration is stronger than particular.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (85b15) he answers the second reason, saying that if the
          universal is predicated of several according to one formality and not
          equivocally, the universal, so far as its formality is concerned,
          i.e., so far as science and demonstration are concerned, will not be
          less of an entity than the particular, but more. For the incorruptible
          is more a being than the corruptible; but the formality of a universal
          is incorruptible, whereas particulars are corruptible, in that they
          are subject to corruption as to their individual principles, although
          not as to the formality of the species, which is common to all and
          conserved through generation. And so in regard to that which pertains
          to their formality, the universals are beings to a higher degree than
          particulars. Nevertheless, in regard to natural subsistence the
          particulars, which are called the first and chief substances, have
          more being.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (85b18) he answers the third reason, saying that although in
          propositions or demonstrations that are universal, something which is
          one according to itself, say “triangle,” is signified, nevertheless
          there is no need for anyone to suppose on this account that “triangle”
          is some one thing apart from the many, any more than there is need in
          the case of things which do not signify substance but some genus of
          accident (when we signify them absolutely, as when we say “whiteness”
          or “fatherhood”), to suppose that such things exist apart from the
          substance. For the intellect is able to understand one of the things
          which are joined in reality without actually thinking of some other
          one; yet the intellect is not false. Thus, if something white is
          musical, I am able to think of the white and attribute something to it
          and demonstrate something of it, say, that it disperses the vision,
          without adverting at all to musical. However, if one were to
          understand that the white one is not musical, then the intellect would
          be false. And so when we say or understand that whiteness is a color,
          no mention being made of the subject, we are saying something true.
          But it would be false, were we to say that the whiteness which is a
          color is not in a subject. In like fashion, when we say that every man
          is an animal, we are speaking truly, even though no particular man is
          mentioned. But it would be false were we to say that man is “an animal
          existing apart from particular men.” And if this is so, it follows
          that demonstration is not the cause of the false opinion according to
          which someone supposes that the universal is some thing outside the
          singulars, but it is rather the hearer who understands incorrectly.
          Hence this does not detract at all from universal demonstration.<br /></p

          After answering the arguments which favored the false side, the
          Philosopher now introduces arguments for the true side, namely, to
          show that universal demonstration is the more powerful. In regard to
          this he sets down seven reasons, adding them to the previous solutions
          from which the proposition can also be concluded, as was clear from
          the above.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first reason (85b22), is this: Demonstration is a syllogism
          showing the cause and <i>propter quid</i>: for this is the way
          scientific knowing takes place, as stated above. But the universal
          does this better than the particular. For as was shown in the first
          solution, something is <i>per se</i> in the universal more than in the
          particular. But that in which something is <i>per se</i> is the cause
          of this something: for the subject is the cause of the proper
          attribute which is in it <i>per se</i>. However, the first thing in
          which the proper attribute is present is the universal, as is clear
          from what has been stated above. Hence it is plain that, properly
          speaking, the cause is that which is universal. From this he concludes
          the proposition, namely, that universal demonstration is more valuable
          as better declaring the cause and <i>propter quid</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (85b28) he gives the second reason. This reason is taken from the
          final causes. Here it should be pointed out that something is the end
          of another thing both in regard to becoming and in regard to being: in
          regard to becoming, as generation is for the sake of form; in regard
          to being, as a house is for the sake of habitation.
        </p>
        <p>
          He says, therefore, that we search for the “reason why” something is
          done or why something is, until we reach the point where there is
          nothing further to assign, beyond the point reached, as the reason why
          that comes to be or is, whose reason why is sought. And when we find
          this we think that we know the <i>propter quid</i>: the reason being
          that that which is ultimate in this way, i.e., leaving nothing further
          to be sought, is truly the end and terminus which is being sought when
          we seek the <i>propter quid</i>. And he gives this example: if we
          should ask why someone went out, and the answer is given, “to get
          money,” and this in order to pay a debt, and “this for this other
          reason,” namely, lest he be guilty of injustice; and we continue in
          this way until there is nothing further for the sake of which as for
          an end—as when we arrive at the ultimate end, which is happiness—we
          will say that it was for this, as for an end, that he went. And it is
          the same in all other things that are or are done for the sake of an
          end: when we arrive at it, we will know the reason why he went.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now if things are so related in the other causes as they are in the
          final cause, namely, that we know fully when the last one has been
          reached, then we will know best in the others, when we shall have
          arrived at the fact that “this is in this” no longer because of
          something further. And this happens when we shall have reached the
          universal.
        </p>
        <p>
          To elucidate this he offers the following example: If we should ask
          concerning this particular triangle, why its exterior angles are equal
          to four right angles, the answer will be that this happens to this
          triangle because it is isosceles; and it is so for the isosceles,
          because it is a triangle; and it is so for a triangle, because it is
          such and such a rectilinear figure. If no further step can be taken,
          then we know in the best way. But this happens when the universal has
          been reached. Therefore the universal demonstration is stronger than
          the particular.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (86a3) he gives the third reason, saying that the more one
          proceeds toward particulars, the nearer one gets to what is infinite;
          because, as it is stated in <i>Physics</i> III, the infinite is
          appropriate to matter which is the principle of individuation. On the
          other hand, the more one proceeds toward the universal, the nearer he
          gets to what is simple and to the end itself; because the universal
          reason is taken on the part of the form, ic is simple and which has
          the character of an end insofar as it terminates the infinitude of
          matter. Now it is obvious that infinite things as such are not
          scientifically knowable; rather to the extent that they are finite, to
          that extent are they knowable; because the principle of knowing a
          thing is not the matter but the form. Therefore, it is obvious that
          universals are scientifically more knowable than particulars.
          Consequently, they are also more demonstrable, because a demonstration
          is a syllogism that makes one know scientifically. But a demonstration
          of the more demonstrable is more powerful; for things which are
          described one in terms of the other grow apace. But demonstration is
          described in terms of the demonstrable. Consequently, since universals
          are more demonstrable, universal demonstration will be more powerful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (86a11) he gives the fourth reason and it is this: Since the end
          of demonstration is scientific knowledge, the more things a
          demonstration enables one to know, the more powerful it is. And this
          is what he states, namely, that a demonstration, according to which a
          man knows one thing and something additional, is preferable to one
          according to which a man knows only the one. But a man who has
          knowledge of the universal knows also the particular, so long as he
          knows that the particular is contained under the universal. Thus, one
          who knows that every mule is sterile, knows that this animal, which he
          recognizes to be a mule, is sterile. But one who knows the particular
          does not on that account know the universal. For if I know that this
          mule is sterile, I do not on that account know that every mule is
          sterile. It remains, therefore, that universal demonstration, through
          which the universal is known, is stronger than particular, through
          which the particular is known.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (86a14) he gives the fifth reason, and it is this: The nearer to
          the first principle the middle of a demonstration is, the more
          powerful is the demonstration. He proves this on the ground that if a
          demonstration which proceeds from an immediate principle is more
          certain than one which does not proceed from an immediate, but from a
          mediate, principle, then it is necessary that to the extent that a
          demonstration proceeds from a middle nearer an immediate principle,
          the more powerful it is. But a universal demonstration proceeds from a
          middle nearer the principle which is an immediate proposition. And he
          exemplifies this with terms. For if one is required to demonstrate A,
          which is the most universal, of B, which is the most particular, say
          “substance” of man, and B and C, say “living” and “animal” be taken,
          such that B is more general than C, as “living” than “animal,” it is
          obvious that B, which is the more universal, will be immediate to A;
          consequently, more will be known through it than through C, which is
          less universal. Hence it remains that universal demonstration is more
          powerful than particular.
        </p>
        <p>
          But he remarks that some of the above reasons are “logical,” because,
          namely, they proceed from common principles which are not proper to
          demonstration; especially the third and fourth, which take as their
          middle something which is common to all knowledge. However, the other
          three, namely, the first, second and fifth, seem to be more analytic,
          proceeding as they do from principles proper to demonstration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (86a21) he gives the sixth reason and says that the primacy of
          universal demonstration over particular is evident from the very
          propositions from which the two demonstrations proceed. For the
          universal demonstration proceeds from universal propositions, whereas
          the particular demonstration proceeds from a particular proposition.
          Now the comparison between universal and particular propositions is
          such that one who has knowledge of the former, i.e., of the universal,
          somehow knows the latter, namely, in potency. For the particulars are
          potentially in the universal, as the parts are potentially in a whole.
          Thus, if one knows that every triangle has three angles equal to two
          right angles, he already knows it potentially of isosceles. But one
          who knows something in a particular way does not on that account know
          it universally either potentially or actually. For the universal
          proposition is neither potentially nor actually contained in the
          particular. Therefore, if that demonstration is more powerful which
          proceeds from stronger propositions, it follows that universal
          demonstration is more powerful.
        </p>
        <p>
          It should be noted that this reason does not differ from the fourth
          one given above, except that in the fourth one the comparison was made
          between the conclusions which are known through demonstration, whereas
          here the comparison is between the propositions from which the
          demonstration proceeds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (86a28) he gives the seventh reason and it is this: The universal
          demonstration is intelligible, i.e., is terminated in the intellect,
          because it finishes in”a universal which is known only by the
          intellect. On the other. hand, a particular demonstration, although it
          begins in the intellect is terminated in sense, because it concludes a
          particular which is directly known by sense, and the reason
          demonstrating reaches out to the particular through a certain
          application or reflexion. Now since intellect is more powerful than
          sense, it follows that universal demonstration is stronger than
          particular.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, he concludes that this is clear in virtue of all that has
          been said above.<br /></p

        </p>
        <p>
          After showing that universal demonstration is more powerful than
          particular, the Philosopher here shows that affirmative demonstration
          is more powerful than negative. In support of this he presents five
          reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the first reason (86a32) he presupposes that, all else being equal,
          the better demonstration is the one which proceeds from fewer
          postulates or suppositions or propositions. How these differ is clear
          from what has been stated above. For propositions might even be taken
          to mean those <i>per se</i> known statements which are neither
          suppositions nor postulates, as stated above. But a supposition is not
          the same as a postulate: for a supposition is a proposition which is
          not <i>per se</i> known, but is taken by the learner as opined; a
          postulate, on the other hand, is a proposition which is not
          <i>per se</i> known and has not been opined by the learner, nothing
          being said about whether he has opinions to the contrary or not.
        </p>
        <p>
          Accordingly, he shows in two ways that, other things being equal, the
          demonstration which employs fewer of these is better. First, because
          if it happens that both propositions from which one proceeds are
          equally known, it follows that one knows more quickly through fewer
          propositions than through more, because a discourse through fewer
          propositions comes to an end sooner than one through more. For it is
          more desirable or more advantageous that a man, learn more quickly.
          Hence, it remains that a demonstration which proceeds from fewer
          propositions, provided they are equally known, is better.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, he proves the same proposition universally without the above
          supposition, namely, that all the propositions used are equally known.
          To prove this he assumes this supposition, namely, that the middles
          which are of one order are equally known, but the middles which are
          prior are better known. For this must be universally true. Therefore,
          supposing this, take one demonstration in which it is demonstrated
          that A is in E in virtue of three middles, B, C, D, so that a
          conclusion is reached from four propositions, namely, “Every B is A,”
          “Every C is B,” “Every D is C” and “Every E is D.” Then let the other
          demonstration be one which concludes the same conclusion, namely, that
          A is in E, through two middles which are F and G.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under these conditions, from the fact that the order of knowing is
          proportionate to the order of middles, since the prior known are the
          better known, as has been said, it is obvious that the proposition,
          “Every D is A” in the first demonstration must be as well known as
          “Every E is A” in the second, because two middles are used for
          obtaining each. However, it is also obvious that in the first
          demonstration this proposition, “Every D is A,” is prior and better
          known than the proposition, “Every E is A,” because this latter is
          demonstrated from something prior in the first demonstration-and from
          what has been established above, it is apparent that that through
          which something is demonstrated is more credible and more known than
          that which is demonstrated through it. What remains, therefore, is
          that this proposition, “Every E is A,” so far as it is concluded by
          the second demonstration, is better known than the same proposition so
          far as it is concluded by the first demonstration which used more
          middles. Consequently, a demonstration which proceeds from fewer is
          better than one which proceeds from more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, having proved the major proposition, Aristotle assumes that
          an affirmative proposition proceeds from fewer things than a negative:
          not indeed from fewer terms or fewer propositions materially, because
          every demonstration, whether affirmative or negative, demonstrates
          through three terms and two propositions; but a negative demonstration
          is said to proceed from more according to the quality of the
          propositions. For an affirmative demonstration takes only “being,”
          i.e., proceeds only from affirmative propositions, whereas a negative
          demonstration takes “being and non-being,” i.e., uses an affirmative
          and a negative. Therefore, the affirmative is stronger than the
          negative.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (86b10) he presents the second reason. Now this second reason is
          introduced to support the first, which might seem deficient on the
          ground that it was not subsumed under the major proposition in the way
          in which it was proved. Therefore, to forestall any subterfuge he adds
          this second reason to confirm the first. For it has been shown in
          <i>Prior Analytics</i> I that a syllogism cannot be formed out of two
          negative propositions, but one proposition at least must be
          affirmative and the other may be negative. This clearly shows that
          affirmative propositions have greater efficacy for syllogizing than do
          negatives. Hence it follows that an affirmative demonstration which
          proceeds from affirmatives only, is more powerful than the negative
          demonstration which proceeds from a negative and an affirmative.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (86b12) he presents the third reason, saying that as a
          consequence of the foregoing reasons, we can assert that when a
          demonstration is augmented, i.e., by resolving propositions into their
          principles, it is necessary that there be several affirmative
          propositions, but no more than one negative. Thus, let us take the
          following negative demonstration: “No B is A; Every C is B: therefore,
          No C is A.” Then let this demonstration be augmented as to both
          propositions, if each is mediate, by taking a middle for each, letting
          the middle of the major proposition, “No B is A,” be D, and the middle
          of the minor proposition, “Every C is B,” be E. Now since this
          proposition, “Every C is B,” is affirmative and was concluded without
          benefit of a negative, it is necessary that its middle, namely, E, be
          affirmative to each extreme. Consequently, there are two affirmative
          propositions, namely, “Every E is B,” and “Every C is E,” from which
          “Every C is B” is concluded. But the major proposition is negative,
          namely, “No B is A.” Now a negative is not concluded from two
          negatives; but in the first figure, in which demonstration is best
          made, according to what has been said, that major must be negative and
          the minor affirmative. Consequently, this middle, D, must be
          affirmative to B and negative to A, as in the following demonstration:
          “No D is A; Every B is D; therefore No B is A.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence by augmenting a negative demonstration by resolving the
          propositions into their principles, there will be four propositions:
          only one of these is negative, namely, “No D is A,” and the other
          three will be affirmative, namely, “Every B is D,” “Every E is B,” and
          “Every C is E.” And the same thing will happen in all other
          syllogisms, because it is always required that the middle, through
          which the affirmative propositions are proved, be affirmative to both
          extremes. But the middle through which the negative proposition is
          proved must be negative to one of the extremes only. Thus it follows
          that only one proposition is negative and the others all affirmative.
        </p>
        <p>
          From this it is clear that it is mainly through affirmatives that a
          negative proposition is demonstrated. Therefore, if that through which
          something is demonstrated is more known and more credible than that
          which is demonstrated through it (since a negative proposition is
          mainly proved by affirmatives and not vice versa), it follows that the
          affirmative proposition is prior and more known and more credible than
          the negative. Accordingly, the affirmative demonstration will be more
          valuable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (86b30) he presents the fourth reason, saying that the principle
          of a demonstrative syllogism is an immediate universal proposition, in
          the sense that the proper principle of an affirmative syllogism is an
          affirmative proposition and the proper principle of a negative
          syllogism is a universal negative proposition. But the effect of a
          nobler principle is itself more noble. Therefore, as an affirmative
          proposition is to a negative, so is an affirmative demonstration to a
          negative one. But an affirmative proposition is more powerful than a
          negative one. (He proves this in two ways: first, because the
          affirmative is prior and better known, since the negative is proved by
          the affirmative and not vice versa. Secondly, because affirmation
          naturally precedes negation, as being is prior to non-being—for
          although in one and the same thing which passes from non-being to
          being, the non-being is prior in the order of time, yet in the order
          of nature, being is prior and, absolutely speaking, is prior even in
          time, because non-beings are not brought into existence except by
          something that is). Therefore, it is clear that affirmative
          demonstration is mo powerful than negative.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (86b39) he presents the fifth reason and it is this: That upon
          which something depends is more principal. But negative demonstration
          depends on affirmative, because there cannot be a negative
          demonstration without an affirmative proposition, which is not proved
          except by an affirmative demonstration. Therefore, affirmative
          demonstration is more principal than negative.<br /></p

        </p>
        <p>
          After showing that universal demonstration ranks higher than
          particular, and affirmative higher than negative, the Philosopher here
          shows, thirdly, that ostensive demonstration is more powerful than
          that which leads to the impossible. Concerning this he does three
          things. First, he proposes what he intends. Secondly, he prefaces
          certain matters needed for showing the proposition (87a2). Thirdly, he
          proves his proposition (87a17).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (87a1) that since we have shown that
          affirmative, demonstration is more powerful than negative, from this
          it further follows that an affirmative ostensive demonstration is more
          powerful than one which leads to the impossible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (87a2) he lays down certain things that are necessary for showing
          his proposition. In regard to this he does three things. First, he
          shows what a negative demonstration is. Secondly, he shows what a
          demonstration to the impossible is (87a7). Thirdly, he concludes the
          comparison of the one with the other (87a13).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (87a2) that in order to manifest the
          proposition it is necessary to point out the difference between them,
          i.e., between the negative demonstration and the one leading to the
          impossible. If, therefore, one assumes that A is in No B, and B is in
          every C, and concludes that A is in no C, it will be a negative
          demonstration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (87a7) he elucidates what a demonstration leading to the
          impossible is. And he says that a demonstration leading to the
          impossible is as follows: Suppose we are to prove that A is not in B.
          Let us assume the opposite of what we wish to prove, namely, assume
          that every B is A; then assume that B is in C, using the proposition,
          “Every C is B”; from these the conclusion follows that “Every C is A,”
          which is such that everyone knows and admits that it is impossible.
          From this we conclude that the first proposition, namely, “Every B is
          A,” is false. Consequently, it will be necessary either that no B is A
          or at least that some B is not A.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it must be understood that “A is not in B” follows, when it is
          clear that B is in C, because if it is obvious that “Every C is A” is
          false, but not obvious that “Every C is B” is true, it would not, just
          in virtue of the inference, be plain that “Every B is A” is false; for
          the falsity of the conclusion might have proceeded from either
          premise, as was stated above.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (87a13) he concludes the comparison of each of the aforesaid
          demonstrations. First, he shows wherein they agree, namely, in having
          a like ordering of their terms. For just as in the negative
          demonstration, B is taken as the middle between A and C, so too in
          that which leads to the impossible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, he shows wherein they differ, because it makes a difference
          which negative proposition in each demonstration is better known,
          namely, whether it be the proposition, “No B is A,” or the
          proposition, “No C is A”: for in a demonstration leading to the
          impossible, the proposition “C is not A” is taken to be better known,
          since from the fact that A is not in C one shows that A is not in B.
          Consequently, the proposition, “C is not A,” is taken as better known.
          But when that which is set down as a premise of the syllogism is taken
          as better known, there is a demonstrative, i.e., an ostensive,
          negative demonstration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (87a17) he shows his proposition in the following way: The
          proposition, “B is not A,” is naturally prior to the proposition, “C
          is not A.” And this is proved by the fact that the premises, from
          which the conclusion is inferred, are naturally prior to the
          conclusion. But in the order of the syllogism, “C is not A” is set
          down as the conclusion, whereas “B is not A” is set down as that from
          which the conclusion is inferred. Therefore, “B is not A” is naturally
          prior.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (87a19) he removes an objection. For someone could say that even
          the negative “C is not A” is the one from which one concludes “B is
          not A” in a demonstration to the impossible. But he excludes this,
          saying that by the fact that the conclusion is destroyed and from its
          destruction something in the premises is destroyed, it does not follow
          that what was first the conclusion is now a principle and vice versa,
          absolutely and according to nature, but only in a qualified sense. For
          the relation of conclusion to principle is such that the principle is
          destroyed by the conclusion’s being destroyed. But that functions as
          the principle from which a syllogism proceeds, which is related to the
          conclusion as a whole to a part; while the conclusion is to the
          principle, as part to whole. For the subject of a negative conclusion
          is subsumed under the subject of the first proposition. But the
          propositions AC and AB are not so related to each other that AC is to
          AB as whole to part. For BA is not subsumed under CA; rather it is
          just the opposite. Hence it remains that although from the destruction
          of CA, one concludes to the destruction of BA, nevertheless CA is
          naturally the conclusion and BA the principle. Consequently, “B is not
          A” is naturally better known than “C is not A.”
        </p>
        <p>
          From this, one argues in the following way: That demonstration is the
          worthier which proceeds from better known and prior principles. But a
          negative demonstration proceeds from something better known and prior
          than does a demonstration leading to the impossible. For each causes
          one to know something in virtue of a negative proposition: but the
          negative demonstration proceeds to cause belief from the negative
          proposition, “B is not A”, which is naturally prior. Demonstration to
          the impossible, on the other hand, proceeds to cause belief from the
          negative proposition, “C is not A,” which is naturally posterior. What
          remains, therefore, is that the negative demonstration is more
          powerful than one which leads to the impossible. Furthermore, as was
          shown above, the affirmative is stronger than the negative. Therefore,
          an affirmative ostensive demonstration is much stronger than one which
          leads to the impossible.<br /></p

          >
        </p>
        <p>
          After comparing demonstrations one with another, the Philosopher here
          treats of the comparison of science, which is the effect of
          demonstration. And his treatment falls into two parts. In the first he
          compares science to science. In the second he compares science to
          other modes of knowing (88b30) [L. 44]. Concerning the first he does
          two things. First, he compares science to science as to certitude.
          Secondly, as to unity and multiplicity (87a38).
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerning the first (87a31) he lays down three modes whereby one
          science is more certain than another. Laying down the first mode, he
          says that that science is prior and more certain than another, which,
          namely, makes one know the same things both <i>quia</i> and
          <i>propter quid</i>. However, that science is not more certain which
          knows only the <i>quia</i> apart from one which knows
          <i>propter quid</i>. But this is the relation of subalternating
          science to subalternate, as has been said above, namely, that the
          subalternate science in isolation knows <i>quia</i> without knowing
          <i>propter quid</i>: thus a surgeon knows that circular wounds are
          healed more slowly, but he does not know why. But such knowledge
          pertains to the geometer who considers that characteristic of a circle
          according to which its parts do not lie close enough to form an angle,
          the nearness of whose sides makes triangular wounds heal more quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
          He lays down the second mode when he says that a science which is not
          concerned with a subject is more certain than one which is. Here
          “subject” is taken to mean sensible matter because, as the Philosopher
          teaches in <i>Physics</i> II, some sciences are purely mathematical,
          those, namely, which abstract according to reason from sensible
          matter, as geometry and arithmetic; but other sciences are
          intermediate, namely, those which apply mathematical principles to
          sensible matter, as optics applies the principles of geometry to the
          visual line, and harmony, i.e., music, applies the principles of
          arithmetic to sensible sounds. Hence he says here that arithmetic is
          both more certain and prior to music: it is prior, because music uses
          its principles for something non-mathematical; it is more certain,
          because lack of certitude arises from matter’s changes. Hence the
          closer one gets to matter, the less certain the science.
        </p>
        <p>
          He lays down the third mode when he says that a science which arises
          from fewer things is prior and more certain than one which arises from
          an addition, i.e., than one which results from that addition. And he
          gives the example that geometry is posterior to and less certain than
          arithmetic: for the things of geometry are the result of adding to the
          things which pertain to arithmetic. This is easy to see if one admits
          the postulates of Plato, according to which Aristotle is proceeding
          here, using them to prove his point (as he frequently uses the
          opinions of other philosophers as examples in his logical works in
          order to explain a point). Now Plato laid it down that “one” is the
          substance of each thing, because he did not distinguish between “one”
          which is converted with being and signifies the substance of a thing,
          and the “one” which is the principle of number and which arithmetic
          considers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Accordingly, this “one,” as receiving the added characteristic of
          occupying a position in a continuum, takes on the guise of a point.
          Hence he said that “one” is a substance not occupying a position; but
          a point is a substance that does have a position. Consequently, a
          point adds something to the notion of “one,” namely, position. And
          just as all numbers not having position are caused from “one,” so from
          the point, according to the Platonists, all continuous quantities are
          caused. For a point in motion makes a line; a line in motion makes a
          plane, and a plane in motion, makes a body. According to this, then,
          continuous quantities (which art~l treated in geometry) are the result
          of additions made to numbers (which are the concern of arithmetic).
          Hence the Platonists laid it down that numbers are the forms of
          magnitudes, saying that the point’s form is “one,” and the line’s form
          is “two,” because it has two endpoints, while a surface’s form is
          “three,” owing to the first surface’s being the triangle which is
          terminated by three angles; but the form of bodies is “four,” on the
          ground that the first solid figure is the triangular pyramid, which is
          composed of four (non-plane) solid angles, namely, one at the apex and
          three at the base.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to this it is obvious that the comparison of the certitude
          of sciences is here based on two things: for the first mode is taken
          according to the cause as it is prior to and more certain than the
          effect; but the other two are taken according to the form as this is
          more certain than matter, inasmuch as the form is the principle of
          knowing the matter. But, as it is stated in <i>Metaphysics</i> VII,
          matter is twofold: one is sensible, according to which the second mode
          is taken; the other is intelligible, i.e., its continuity, according
          to which the third mode is taken. And although this third mode was
          explained according to Plato’s theory, yet even according to
          Aristotle’s theory, a point results from some addition to “one”: for a
          point is an indivisible unity in a continuum, abstracting according to
          reason from sensible matter; but unity abstracts from both sensible
          and intelligible matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (87a38) he compares sciences one to another according to unity
          and diversity. Concerning this he does two things. First, he shows
          that there is unity and diversity among sciences both according to
          subject and according to principles. Secondly, he treats concerning
          both the subjects and principles (87b19) [L. 42]. Concerning the first
          he does two things. First, he shows what makes for unity and diversity
          of sciences. Secondly, he explains something which is needed for
          understanding what makes for multiplicity of sciences (87b5).
          Concerning the first he does two things. First, he shows what makes
          for the unity of a science. Secondly, what makes for diversity of
          sciences (87a41). Concerning the first he does two things. First, he
          lays it down that the unity of a science is considered from the unity
          of its generic subject. Secondly, he describes the genus which can be
          the subject of a science (8708).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (87a38) that a science is said to be one from
          the fact that it is concerned with one generic subject. The reason for
          this is that the process of science of any given thing is, as it were,
          a movement of reason. Now the unity of any motion is judged
          principally from its terminus, as is clear in <i>Physics</i> V.
          Consequently, the unity of any science must be judged from its end or
          terminus. But the end or terminus of a science is the genus concerning
          which the science treats: because in speculative sciences nothing else
          is sought except a knowledge of some generic subject; in practical
          sciences what is intended as the end is the construction of its
          subject. Thus, in geometry the end intended is knowledge of magnitude,
          which is the subject of geometry; but in the science of building that
          which is intended as the end is the construction of a house, which is
          the subject of this art. Therefore, the unity of each science must be
          considered in terms of the unity of its subject. But just as the unity
          of one generic subject is more universal than another, for example,
          being or substance is more common than mobile being, so one science is
          more general than another. Thus, metaphysics, which treats of being or
          substance, is more general in scope than physics, which treats of
          mobile body.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (87a38) he describes the marks of those genera concerning which
          there can be sciences: and he lays down two marks. The first of these
          is stated when he says, “All the subjects constituted out of primary
          entities,” i.e., of those subjects of which there is one genus, there
          is one science. To understand this it should be noted that, as has
          been said, the process of science consists in a certain movement of
          reason passing from one thing to another. But all movement starts from
          some principle or beginning and is terminated at something definite;
          hence in the progress of a science, reason must proceed from certain
          first principles, Therefore, if there be anything which does not have
          prior principles from which reason can proceed, there cannot be
          science of such things, if we take science to mean the effect of
          demonstration, as we do here. Thus, speculative sciences are not
          concerned with the very essences of separated substances: for we
          cannot, through demonstrative sciences, know the essences in them,
          because the essences of such substances are intelligible of themselves
          to an intellect proportionate to such intelligibility, and a grasp of
          the essences of such substances is not obtained by any prior
          conceptions. The only thing that can be known through speculative
          sciences about these substances is whether they exist and what they
          are not; anything else about them is known in terms of likenesses to
          lower things. But in that case we are really using subsequent things
          as though they were prior in order to understand them, because things
          that are subsequent according to nature are prior and better known to
          us. And so it is clear that those things concerning which we have
          science through what is absolutely prior, are of themselves composed
          of prior items; but things which are known through subsequent items
          (but prior in reference to us), even though they be simple in
          themselves, are nevertheless in our knowledge of them composed of
          things that are first to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          He lays down the second mark when he says, “The parts of this total
          subject and their <i>per se</i> properties.” Here it should be noted
          that the subject of a science can have two types of parts: first, the
          parts out of which, as out of first things, it is composed, i.e., the
          very principles of the subject; and secondly, the subjective parts.
          And although what is stated here can be applied to either of these
          types of parts, yet it seems to truer of the first type of parts. For
          in every science there are the principles of its subject, and these
          must be considered before all else: for example, in natural science
          the first consideration is about matter and form, and in grammar about
          the alphabet. But in every science there is also something ultimate,
          at which the study of that science terminates, namely, that the
          properties of the subject be manifested. But each of these, namely,
          the first parts and the properties, can be attributed to something
          either <i>per se</i> or not <i>per se</i>. For the
          <i>per se</i> principles and properties of a triangle are not the
          <i>per se</i> principles and properties of an isosceles triangle
          precisely as isosceles, but precisely as triangle. Neither are they
          the <i>per se</i> principles and properties of brass or white, even
          though the triangle happens to be of brass or be white. Hence, if
          there were a science which manifests the properties of triangle from
          the principles of the triangle, the subject of that science would not
          be isosceles or white or brass, but triangle—whose
          <i>per se</i> subjective parts would be isosceles equilateral and
          scalene.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (87a41) he shows the reason for sciences being diverse. First, he
          lays down this reason. Secondly, he explains it (87b1).
        </p>
        <p>
          It should be noted in regard to the first point that although he took
          the reason for the oneness of a science from the oneness of its
          generic subject, he does not take the reason for their diversity from
          the diversity of their subject, but from the diversity of principles.
          For he says (87a41) that one science is distinct from another when
          their principles are diverse, in the sense that the principles of the
          two sciences do not proceed from any prior principles, nor the
          principles of the one science from those of the other; because if both
          proceed from the same principles, or if one proceeds from those of
          another, they would not be diverse sciences.
        </p>
        <p>
          To understand this it should be noted that a material diversity of
          objects does not diversity habits, but only a formal diversity.
          Therefore, since something scientifically knowable is the proper
          object of a science, the sciences will not be diversified according to
          a material diversity of, their scientifically knowable objects, but
          according to their formal diversity. Now just as the formality of
          visible is taken from light, through which color is seen, so the
          formal aspect of a scientifically knowable object is taken according
          to the principles from which something is scientifically known.
          Therefore, no matter how diverse certain scientifically knowable
          objects may be in their nature, so long as they are known through the
          same principles, they pertain to one science, because they will not
          differ precisely as scientifically knowable. For they are
          scientifically knowable in virtue of their own principles.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is made clear by an example, namely, that human voices differ a
          great deal according to their nature from the sounds of inanimate
          bodies; but because the consonance of human voices and of the sounds
          of inanimate bodies is considered according to the same principles,
          the science of music, which considers both, is one science. On the
          other hand, if there are things which have the same nature but are
          considered according to diverse principles, it is obvious that they
          pertain to diverse sciences. Thus, the mathematical body is never
          really distinct from a natural body; yet because the mathematical body
          is known through the principles of quantity, but a natural body
          through the principles of motion, the science of geometry and the
          science of nature are not the same. It is clear, therefore, that for
          sciences to be diverse it is enough that the principles be diverse,
          this diversity of principles being accompanied by a diversity of
          scientifically knowable objects.
        </p>
        <p>
          But in order to have one science absolutely, both are required,
          namely, unity of subject and unity of principles. That is why above he
          made mention of unity of subject when he said, “whose domain is one
          genus,” but made mention of principles when he said, “all the subjects
          constituted out of the primary entities of the genus.”
        </p>
        <p>
          However, it should be further noted that second principles derive
          their force from the first principles. Hence for diversity of
          sciences, diversity of first principles is required. But this will not
          be verified if the principles of diverse things flow from the same
          principles, as the principles of triangle and square are derived from
          the principles of figure, or the principles of one are derived from
          the principles of another, as the principles of isosceles depend on
          the principles of triangle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet it should not be supposed that for the unity of a science it is
          enough that there be unity of first principles absolutely, but unity
          of first principles in some scientifically knowable genus. Now the
          genera of the scientifically knowable are distinguished according to
          the diverse modes of knowing: thus things that are defined with matter
          are known in one mode, and those defined without matter are known in
          another. Hence the natural body is one genus of the scientifically
          knowable, and mathematical body is another genus. Hence there are
          diverse first principles for each of these genera and, consequently,
          diverse sciences. Furthermore, each of these genera is distinguished
          into diverse species according to diverse modes and aspects of
          intelligibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (87b1) he explains the reason he laid down, saying that a sign of
          the fact that sciences are diversified according to their principles
          is obtained when one resolves a science into principles that are
          indemonstrable, for they must be of the same genus as the things
          demonstrated; because, as stated above, one does not demonstrate by
          proceeding from an alien genus. Now the reason why the reaching of
          indemonstrable principles of one genus is taken as a sign is that the
          facts demonstrated by them are in the same genus and are co-generic,
          i.e., connatural, or generically proximate to them: for these have the
          same principles. And so it is clear that the unity of a scientifically
          knowable genus, precisely as it is the scientifically knowable genus
          from which was taken the oneness of the science, and the unity of the
          principles, according to which was taken th diversity among the
          sciences, mutually correspond.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (87b5) he shows how one conclusion can be demonstrated through
          several principles. And this can happen in two ways: in one way,
          when”, a number of middles are laid down in the same coordination, and
          one of these middles is used in one demonstration and another one in
          another, both leading to the same conclusion. This, of course,
          requires that the middles be non-continuous. Thus, if the two
          extremes, A and B, are “to have three” and “isosceles” respectively,
          but the middles, D and Q are coordinate, as “triangle” and “this type
          of figure,” A could be demonstrated of B with two demonstrations. In
          the first one, C could be taken as middle, and D in the other, so that
          in neither demonstration will, there be a middle continuous with the
          extremes, because in one demonstration a middle continuous with one
          extreme and not continuous with the other would be taken, and in the
          other demonstration the converse would be taken.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or this can happen in a second way, namely, when diverse middles are
          taken from diverse coordinations; for example, if A, which is the
          major extreme, were “to be altered,” and B, which is the minor
          extreme, were “to be pleased,” and the middles taken were independent,
          say G would be “to be at rest,” and D “to be in motion.” In this case
          the same conclusion can be reached through diverse middles that are
          not of one order. Thus one demonstration would be this: “Whatever is
          at rest is altered, because it belongs to the same thing to be at rest
          and to be altered; but whatever is pleased is at rest, because rest in
          the desired good causes pleasure: therefore, whatever is pleased is
          altered.” The other demonstration would be: “Whatever is in motion is
          altered; but whatever is pleased is in motion, because pleasure is a
          movement of the appetitive faculty [power]: therefore, whatever is
          pleased is altered.” (Now the statement, “Whatever is pleased is in
          motion, “ is Plato’s opinion and is verified in sensible pleasures
          which involve movement. The other statement, “Whatever is pleased is
          at rest,” is true according to Aristotle’s opinion, as is clear from
          <i>Ethics</i> VII and X. And this is verified particularly in
          intellectual pleasures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then he says that just as this has been proved in the first figure, so
          in the other figures it is easy to see that the same conclusion can be
          syllogized with diverse middles. Now the Philosopher mentioned this to
          show that diverse middles of demonstration sometimes pertain to the
          same science, as when they are taken from the same coordination, and
          sometimes to diverse sciences, when they are taken from a different
          coordination. Thus, astronomy demonstrates that the earth is round,
          using one middle, namely, the eclipse of the sun and moon; and natural
          science uses another middle, namely, the motion of heavy objects
          tending toward the center, as it is stated in
          <i>Physics</i> II.<br /></p

        <p>
          After assigning the basis of unity and of diversity of sciences on the
          part of the generic subject and on the part of the principles, the
          Philosopher here continues with each. First, with the subjects about
          which there is science. Secondly, with the principles (88a18) [L. 43].
        </p>
        <p>
          In regard to the first it should be noted that above he laid down two
          marks of the genus which is the subject of the science: one of these
          is that it be composed of first principles, and the other is that its
          parts and properties be <i>per se</i>. Now one of these conditions is
          lacking in things that happen by fortune, because they do not come
          about <i>per se</i>, but <i>per accidens</i> and beyond one’s
          intention, as is proved in <i>Physics</i> II. The other mark is
          lacking in things that are known through sense, which are first in our
          knowledge. Therefore, he shows first that science is not concerned
          with things which come about by fortune. Secondly, that it is not of
          things that are known through sense (87b28).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (87b19) that demonstrative science cannot be
          concerned with things that occur through fortune, i.e., things that
          come about <i>per accidens</i>. He proves this in the following way:
          Every demonstrative syllogism proceeds either from necessary
          propositions or from propositions which are true for the most part.
          Now from necessary propositions a necessary conclusion follows, as has
          been proved above; in like manner, from propositions which are true
          for the most part, a conclusion follows which is true for the most
          part, or perhaps one which is necessary, in the sense that the
          necessary can follow from the contingent, as the true can follow from
          the false. However, it never happens that from propositions which are
          true for the most part, a conclusion will follow which is true in few
          cases; because that would mean that in certain cases the propositions
          would be true and the conclusion false, which is impossible, as has
          been shown. It is necessary, therefore, that the conclusion of a
          demonstrative syllogism either be necessary or be true in the majority
          of cases. But that which is by fortune is neither necessary nor is it
          true in (the majority of cases, but it occurs rarely, as is proved in
          <i>Physics</i> II. Therefore, demonstrative science cannot be
          concerned with that which is by fortune.
        </p>
        <p>
          It should be noted, however, that there happens to be demonstration of
          things which occur, as it were, for the most part, insofar as there is
          in them something of necessity. But the necessary, as it is stated in
          <i>Physics</i> II, is not the same in natural things (which are true
          for the most part and fail to be true in a few cases) as in the
          disciplines, i.e., in mathematical things, which are always true. For
          in the disciplines there is a priori necessity, whereas in natural
          science there is a posteriori (which nevertheless is prior according
          to nature), namely, from the end and form. Hence Aristotle teaches
          there that to show a <i>propter quid</i>, such as if this has to be,
          say that if an olive is to be generated, it is necessary that this,
          namely, the olive seed, pre-exist, but not that an olive is generated
          of necessity from a given olive seed, because generation can be
          hindered by some defect. Hence if a demonstration is formed from that
          which is prior in generation, it does not conclude with necessity,
          unless perhaps we take as necessary the fact that an olive seed is
          frequently generative of an olive, because it does this according to a
          property of its nature, unless it is impeded.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (87b28) he shows that science is not concerned with things that
          are known according to sense. About this he does two things. First, he
          shows that science does not consist in sensing. Secondly, how sense is
          ordained to science (88a13). Concerning the first he does two things.
          First, he shows that science is not through sense. Secondly, he ranks
          science above sense (88a5). Concerning the first he does two things.
          First, he shows the truth. Secondly, he shows the errors of certain
          ones (87b34).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (87b28) that just as science is not of things
          which are by fortune, so neither does it consist in knowledge which is
          through sense. And he proves this in the following way: It is obvious
          that sense knows the qualities of a thing and not its substance. For
          the <i>per se</i> object of sense is not the substance and the
          essence, but some sensible quality, such as hot, cold, white, black,
          and so on. But qualities of this sort affect singular substances
          existing in a definite place and time: hence it is necessary that this
          which is sensed be a “this something,” i.e., a singular substance, and
          that it be somewhere now, i.e., in a definite time and place. From
          this it is clear that that which is universal cannot fall under sense.
          For that which is universal is not restricted to the here and now,
          because then it would not be universal. For we call that a universal
          which is always and everywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, this is not to be understood according to the way of an
          affirmation, as though it pertained to the very notion of a universal
          or of that which is universal, namely, that it be always and
          everywhere. For if to exist always and everywhere pertained to the
          very notion of that which is universal, say to the notion of man or
          animal, it would then be required that each individual man and animal
          be always and everywhere, because the notion of man and of animal is
          found in each of its singulars. Or if this were required by the very
          notion of the universal, as it is required of a genus that it contain
          species under it, it would follow that nothing would be universal, if
          it were not found everywhere and always. According to this, “olive”
          would not be universal, because it is not found in all lands. Hence,
          the statement under consideration must be understood after the manner
          of a negation or abstraction, i.e., that the universal abstracts from
          every definite time and place. Hence of itself, just as it is found in
          each thing in one place or time, so it is apt to be found in all.
          Thus, therefore, it is clear that the universal does not fall under
          sense. Consequently, because demonstrations are mainly universal, as
          has been shown above, it is obvious that science acquired by
          demonstration does not consist in knowledge obtained through sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (87b34) he excludes the errors of those who believed that science
          consists in sense-perception. And this notion seems to belong to those
          who did not believe that understanding differs from sense and,
          consequently, that there is no knowledge except sense-knowledge, as it
          is stated in <i>On the Soul</i> III and <i>Metaphysics</i> IV. So, to
          exclude this he says that even if we could perceive through sense that
          a triangle has three angles equal to two right angles, it would still
          be necessary to learn this by demonstration if one is to have science;
          for it could not be scientifically known through sense, because sense
          bears on singulars, whereas science consists in knowing the universal,
          as has been shown.
        </p>
        <p>
          But because he had given the example of something that cannot be
          perceived through sense, he makes his point clearer with an example
          taken from things that can be sensed, namely, from an eclipse of the
          moon which is caused by the opposition of the earth, which is
          interposed between the sun and moon, so that the brightness of the sun
          cannot reach the moon because of the earth’s shadow; and the moon is
          eclipsed when it enters the shadow. Let us suppose, then, that someone
          were on the moon and with his senses could perceive the shadow caused
          by the interposition of the earth. This person, then, would sensibly
          perceive that the moon is darkened by the shadow of the earth, but
          this would not mean that he would therefore know totally the cause of
          the eclipse. For the <i>per se</i> cause of an eclipse is that which
          universally causes an eclipse. But the universal is not known through
          sense; rather, we receive universal knowledge from many individually
          observed cases in which the same thing is found to happen. And so it
          is through the universal cause that we demonstrate something in the
          universal way that constitutes science.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (88a5) he shows that science is nobler than sense. For it is
          clear that knowledge through the cause is more noble; but the
          <i>per se</i> cause is the universal cause, as has been said.
          Therefore, knowledge through the universal cause, such as science is,
          is more honorable. But because it is impossible to apprehend such a
          universal cause through sense, it follows that science, which shows
          the universal cause, is not only more honorable than any sense
          knowledge, but more honorable than any other intellectual knowledge,
          provided it concern things which have a cause: for to know something
          through the universal cause is more noble than any other way of
          knowing that which has a cause, without knowing the cause.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the case is otherwise in regard to first things, which do not
          have a cause. For these are understood in virtue of themselves; and
          such knowledge of these things is more certain than any science,
          because it is from such knowledge that science acquires its certitude.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, he concludes to his chief point, namely, that it is
          impossible through sense to know something demonstrable, unless
          perhaps one takes “sense” in an equivocal meaning, calling
          demonstrative science “sense” on the ground that demonstrative science
          concerns the determinately one just as sense does: on which account
          sure calculations are called science.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (88a11) he shows how sense is ordained to science. For some
          problematic doubts are caused by the shortcomings of sense. For there
          would be no need to investigate certain matters, if we were to see
          them; not because science consists in seeing, but because from things
          seen by way of experiment the universal is obtained, concerning which
          there is science. For example, if we should see a porous pane of glass
          and observed how the light passes through the openings in the glass,
          we would have the scientific answer as to why the glass is
          transparent. (He uses this example because it is the opinion of those
          who supposed that light is a body and that certain bodies are
          transparent because of openings called pores. But because they cannot
          be perceived by sight, since they are so small, we wonder why glass is
          transparent. A similar example can be given of certain things that
          have a latent sensible cause).
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, because he had said that science of such things is not
          obtained by seeing, he shows that this is true. For in seeing we know
          isolated singulars; but to know scientifically we must know them all
          at once in the universal, if we are to know that such and such is the
          fact in all cases. For we see each individual glass singly, but we
          receive science that it is thus for all glass.<br /></p

        <p>
          After his treatment concerning that about which there is science, the
          Philosopher continues here with the principles of sciences and shows
          that the principles of all syllogisms are not the same. First, he
          shows this logically, i.e., through reasons common to all syllogisms.
          Secondly, he shows it analytically, i.e., through reasons that are
          peculiar to demonstration (88b10). Concerning the first he does three
          things. First, he proves his proposition by showing the difference
          between false syllogisms and true ones. Secondly, by the difference
          between some false syllogisms and other false ones (88a26). Thirdly,
          by the difference between some true syllogisms and other true ones
          (88a31). Concerning the first he does two things. First, he proves his
          proposition. Secondly, he excludes an objection (88a20).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (88alS) that if we first speculate this matter
          in a logical way, it is clear that the principles of all syllogisms
          cannot be the same, inasmuch as some syllogisms are false, i.e.,
          conclude false statements, and some are true, i.e., conclude to the
          truth. Now the principles of false and of true syllogisms are diverse:
          for the principles of true syllogisms are true, but the principles of
          false syllogisms are false. Therefore the principles of all syllogisms
          are not the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (88a20) he excludes an objection. For someone might say that
          there are false principles even in true syllogisms, because it is
          possible to syllogize the true from the false. But he excludes this,
          saying that although it happens that the true is syllogized from the
          false, this occurs only once in the first syllogism, in which the true
          is concluded from the false. But if one is forced to adduce other
          syllogisms to support the propositions in the premises, then those
          syllogisms would have to proceed from what is false, because from what
          is true the false cannot be concluded. Consequently, it is only in the
          first syllogism that the true is concluded from the false.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then he gives an example of this: Let the proposition, “Every C is A,”
          be true, and take for each of these extremes a false middle, B, so
          that A is not in B nor B in C. Now if other middles be taken to prove
          these propositions, all the propositions of the false syllogism will
          be false, because every false conclusion is concluded from the false,
          but a true conclusion can be concluded from the true. Hence, when the
          propositions from which the true is concluded are true, one need not
          reach anything false. Thus, therefore, since some propositions are
          true and some false, it follows that the principles of true syllogisms
          are not the same as the principles of false syllogisms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (88a26) he shows that not even the principles of false syllogisms
          are the same. For it occurs that some false conclusions are contrary
          to one another and incompatible with other false conclusions. Thus,
          the conclusion, “Justice is injustice,” is incompatible with the
          conclusion, “Justice is fear,” since both are false. For just as fear
          differs generically from justice, so from injustice. In like fashion,
          the two conclusions, “Man is a horse,” and “Man is a cow,” are
          contrary and incompatible. Again, these two propositions are
          incompatible, “Something equal is greater,” and “Something equal is
          less.” For it is necessary to arrive at such conclusions from
          principles, from which, when they are laid down, other things follow.
          Therefore, since they are contrary and incompatible, so too were the
          principles from which they were concluded.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (88a31) he shows that not even in the case of true syllogisms are
          the principles the same. And he gives four reasons, the first of which
          is based on the differences among proper principles. Hence he says
          that not even all these,” i.e., true conclusions, “are inferred from
          the same basic truths.” For the principles of diverse genera are
          themselves diverse: thus the pripciples of magnitudes are points, and
          of numbers unities; and these are not exactly the same, for numbers do
          not have position, but points do.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, if all principles of syllogisms were in agreement, they
          would have to meet at some same middle either by ascending upwards to
          the major term or by descending downwards toward the minor term:
          because in a syllogism it is necessary that the terms be assumed
          either within or without. They are assumed within, when a multiplicity
          of syllogisms is used to prove the propositions presented. For then it
          is necessary to take middles that are between the predicates of the
          propositions and their subjects. Thus, if we form the syllogism,
          “Every B is A, Every C is B, therefore, Every C is A”; if it is
          necessary to prove “Every B is A,” we must take a middle between B and
          A, say D. Again, if it is necessary to prove the minor, we must take
          another middle between C and B, say E. In this process the terms
          assumed are always within.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, they are assumed from without, when the major term is taken
          as middle by ascending, or the minor by descending: thus, if A is
          concluded of C through B, and C is then concluded of B through A, and
          so on; similarly, by descending, if we conclude B of E through C.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, in syllogisms sharing principles in common, it is necessary
          either that the middle of one syllogism be taken above the
          propositions of another syllogism or that the extremes of one be taken
          above or below the extremes of the other syllogism. But this cannot
          occur in things whose principles are diverse, because points cannot be
          taken as middles or extremes in syllogisms in which something about
          number is concluded, nor unities in syllogisms in which something
          about magnitudes is concluded. What remains, therefore, is that the
          principles of all syllogisms cannot be the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second reason is presented at (88a37) and it is based on common
          principles. He says that there cannot be certain common principles
          from which alone are syllogized all conclusions, as this common
          principle, “Of each thing there is affirmation or negation,” which is
          universally true in every genus. Nevertheless, it is impossible that
          all things be syllogized exclusively from such common principles,
          because the genera of beings are diverse. Thus, the principles which
          pertain only to quantities are diverse from those which pertain
          exclusively to qualities. Such principles must be co-assumed with
          common principles, if one is to reach a conclusion in each matter. For
          example, if one wishes in quantities to syllogize from the aforesaid
          common principle, it is necessary to admit that since it is false that
          a point is a line, it must be true that a point is not a line; in like
          manner, in qualities, it is necessary to co-assume something peculiar
          to quality. Hence what remains is that it is impossible that the
          principles of all syllogisms be the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (88b4) he gives the third reason which is based on a comparison
          of premises with conclusions. And he says that the principles are not
          much fewer than the conclusions. They are as a matter of fact fewer,
          because although two principles are needed to infer one conclusion,
          i.e., two propositions are required, because one conclusion is not
          concluded immediately except from two premises, nevertheless you can
          use one proposition to infer a number of conclusions, insofar as many
          things can be taken under the subject or under the predicate. However,
          the principles are not much fewer than the conclusions, because most
          of the facts which are co-assumed with the principles to obtain other
          conclusions are themselves conclusions. (Here propositions are being
          called.,principles”). But propositions are formed of terms either
          added or interposed, i.e., propositions in syllogisms are multiplied
          either by assuming terms extrinsically (either above the major term
          and below the minor, as has been explained above), or by accepting
          terms which are in the middle.
        </p>
        <p>
          To this must be added the fact that conclusions are infinite. For
          anything can be concluded of anything else either affirmatively or
          negatively. And lest this seem to conflict with the earlier statement
          that predications do not proceed to infinity, he adds that the terms
          are finite: and this is why it was stated above that a stop must be
          made in predications. Nevertheless, an infinitude of conclusions can
          be derived from a finite number of terms according to diverse
          combinations, if we take “conclusions” in a general sense, as
          including those that are <i>per se</i> and those that are
          <i>per accidens</i>. For we are now speaking of syllogisms in general.
          Therefore, if the conclusions are infinite and the principles are not
          much fewer than the conclusions, it follows that principles of
          syllogisms are also infinite. Therefore, the principles of all
          syllogisms are not the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (88b8) he gives the fourth reason and it is based on the
          difference between the necessary and the contingent. And he says that
          some of the principles which we use in the syllogism are contingent
          and some necessary, as is clear from <i>Prior Analytics</i> I, where
          he taught how to syllogize from necessary and from contingent
          premises. However, the necessary and the contingent are not the same.
          Therefore, the principles of all syllogisms are not the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          What he concludes from these last two reasons is that in view of what
          has been established, and because conclusions are infinite, it is
          impossible that the principles of all syllogisms either be the same or
          even be finite.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (88b10) he shows the same thing analytically, namely, through
          reasons proper to the principles by which sciences demonstrate. And he
          gives three reasons. Concerning the first of these he says that if
          someone does not say that the principles of all syllogisms are the
          same, but says something somewhat different, namely, that some are
          principles of geometry and some of logic-which are called the
          principles of syllogisms or reasonings—and some are principles of
          medicine, and so on for the principles of all sciences, so that in
          this sense the principles of all demonstrations are the same, this
          does not support his claim that principles are the same: because from
          the facts that are given, nothing follows except that each science has
          its own principles.
        </p>
        <p>
          The contention that the principles of one science are the same as
          those of another-which would be required if the principles of all
          scientific syllogisms were the same-is impossible and ridiculous,
          because according to this it would follow that everything in the
          sciences would be the same and hence that all the sciences would be
          the same. For things that are the same as a same thing are the same.
          But the principles of each science are somehow the same as the
          conclusions, because they belong to the same genus: for one may not
          demonstrate by passing from one genus into another, as has been shown
          above. Therefore, if the principles are the same, it will follow that
          everything in the sciences would be the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (88b15) he gives the second reason and it is this: If a person
          who contends that the principles of all are the same, intended to say
          that anything is demonstrated from anything, then he is saying
          something foolish, because this is possible neither in “evident
          mathematicals nor in analysis.” (By “evident mathematicals,” i.e.,
          evident considerations or disciplines he means those cases in which a
          conclusion is drawn immediately from evident premises; but by
          “analysis” he means those cases where the assumed propositions are not
          evident but must be analyzed into others which are more evident). And
          that this is impossible he proves on the ground that in each of these
          two cases the principles of the demonstrative syllogism are immediate
          propositions, which are either immediately assumed in evident
          mathematicals or doctrines, or are reached by analysis. But we see
          that a different conclusion is demonstrated, when a different
          immediate proposition is co-assumed. Consequently, it cannot be that
          anything is demonstrated from just anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (88b20) he excludes a certain objection. For someone could say
          that there are two genera of immediate propositions: for some are
          first immediate propositions and some secondary, taking the order of
          immediate propositions according to the order of the terms. For those
          immediate propositions which consist of first and common terms, as
          “being” and “non-being,” “equal” and “unequal,” “whole” and “part,”
          are first and immediate propositions, as “It does not occur that the
          same thing both is and is not,” and “Two things which are equal to the
          same thing are equal,” and so on. But the immediate propositions that
          are concerned with later and less common terms are secondary in
          relation to the first, as that “a triangle is a figure,” or that “man
          is an animal.” Therefore, someone might say that secondary
          propositions are co-assumed for demonstrating diverse conclusions, but
          that the first immediate propositions are the same in all
          demonstrations.
        </p>
        <p>
          To exclude this he says that if anyone should assert that those first
          immediate propositions are the ones from which all things are
          demonstrated, he ought to consider that in each genus there must yet
          be one principle or one immediate proposition which is first in that
          genus, even though it is not absolutely first; and that from one which
          is absolutely first, together with a co-assumed principle proper to a
          particular genus, one should demonstrate in that genus. Consequently,
          not all things can be demonstrated from common principles alone, but
          it is necessary to accept proper principles which are diverse for
          diverse genera.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (88b22), having excluded the injudicious interpretation of the
          position against which he is disputing, he concludes to his point. And
          he says that if it is not admitted that anything is demonstrated from
          just anything—as we must, in view of the foregoing—it follows, that
          one conclusion is not derived from some principle in such a way that a
          different conclusion can be derived from it; otherwise just anything
          is demonstrated from just anything. Hence it is necessary that the
          principles of diverse sciences be diverse. If it is required that the
          principles of each science be of the same genus as everything
          demonstrated from them, it will be required that from these principles
          be demonstrated these conclusions, and “those from those,” i.e., from
          diverse principles, demonstration being made in diverse sciences which
          treat of diverse genera.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (88b25) he presents the third reason which states that it is
          clear from another angle that this does not occur, namely, that the
          principles of all the sciences are the same; because it has been shown
          above that the principles of diverse genera are themselves generically
          diverse. Hence since diverse sciences are concerned with diverse
          genera, it follows that the principles of diverse sciences are
          diverse.
        </p>
        <p>
          But because the common principles which all sciences use are in some
          way the same, he distinguishes among the principles and says that
          principles are twofold: some of the first principles from which one
          demonstrates are as the first dignities; for example, “Being and
          non-being are not the same.” Again, there are other principles,
          namely, those with which the sciences are concerned, namely, the
          subjects of the sciences, because we use the definitions of the
          subjects as principles in demonstrations. Therefore, the members of
          the first group of principles from which we demonstrate are common to
          all the sciences; but the principles with which the sciences are
          concerned are proper to each science, as number to arithmetic, and
          magnitude to geometry. But the common principles must be applied to
          these proper principles, if there is to be demonstration. And because
          one does not demonstrate only from common principles, it cannot be
          said that the principles of all demonstrative syllogisms are the same,
          which is what he intended to prove.<br /></p

        <p>
          After comparing sciences with one another from the viewpoints of
          certitude, of unity and of diversity, the Philosopher here compares
          science to everything else that pertains to knowledge. And his
          treatment falls into two parts. In the first he treats of the
          comparison of science to opinion, which bears on the true and false.
          In the second, of the comparison of science to those habits of
          knowledge which are concerned exclusively with the true (89b6). The
          first part is divided into two parts. In the first he determines the
          truth. In the second he excludes a doubt (89a11). Concerning the first
          he does three things. First, he lays down the difference between
          science and opinion. Secondly, he shows what pertains to science
          (88b31). Thirdly, what pertains to opinion (88b33).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (88b30) that science differs from opinion; in
          like manner the scientifically knowable, which is the object of
          science, differs from the opinable, which is the object of opinion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (88b31) he shows what pertains to science, setting down two
          things which pertain to it. One of these is that it is of the
          universal, for science is not concerned with singulars which fall
          under sense. (He explained this above). The other is that science is
          obtained in virtue of necessary things. And he explains that the
          necessary is that which cannot be otherwise. This, too, was explained
          above, namely, that demonstration proceeds from necessary things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (88b33) he shows what pertains to opinion, namely, that it is
          concerned with things that could be otherwise, either universally or
          particularly. This he proves in three ways. First, by way of a
          division, saying that in addition to necessary truths, which cannot be
          otherwise, there are non-necessary truths, which could be otherwise.
          Now from what has been said above, it is clear that science is not
          concerned with the latter, because it would follow that contingent
          things would be such as could not be otherwise. For science is
          concerned with such things, as has been said. Similarly, it cannot be
          said that understanding is concemed with them. “Understanding” is
          taken here not as a faculty [power] of the soul, but as being the
          principle of science, i.e., as the habit of first principles, from
          which demonstration proceeds in causing science.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence in explaining what that understanding is which is the principle
          of science he adds, “Nor of indemonstrable knowledge” (88b37), i.e.,
          not of facts that could be otherwise. As if to say: understanding is
          nothing more than a science of the indemonstrable. For just as science
          implies certainty of knowledge acquired through demonstration, so
          understanding implies certitude of knowledge without demonstration;
          not because of a shortcoming in some demonstration, but because that
          about which this certainty is had, is indemonstrable and
          <i>per se</i> known. Therefore, to explain this he adds that
          demonstrative science is nothing else than the certain intuition of an
          immediate proposition. But that understanding is science of the
          indemonstrable is clear from the fact that he says that it is the
          principle of science. For since science is concerned with the
          necessary, and the necessary is not concluded except from the
          necessary, as has been proved above, it is required that
          understanding, which is the principle of science, not be concerned
          with contingent things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having shown, therefore, that neither science nor understanding is
          concerned with contingent things, he sets down a division and says
          that understanding and science and opinion happen to be true as “that
          does which is stated by them,” i.e., which is verbally stated by
          understanding and science and true opinion. For the true is found both
          in the intellect’s act of composing and dividing and in the outward
          expression of this act insofar as it signifies the inward truth of the
          opinion or science or understanding. Therefore, if every truth belongs
          either to understanding or science or opinion, and there are some
          contingent truths, and they belong neither to science nor
          understanding, what is left is that opinion is concerned with them,
          whether they be actually true or actually false, provided that they
          could be other than they are.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to elucidate what opinion is, he adds that opinion is the
          acceptance, i.e., the grasping, of a proposition that is immediate and
          not necessary. And this can be understood in two ways: in one way, so
          that the immediate proposition in itself is indeed necessary, but it
          is accepted by opinion as non-necessary; in another way, so that it is
          in itself contingent. For an immediate proposition is one that cannot
          be proved through a middle, whether it be a necessary proposition or
          not. For it has been shown above that there is no process to infinity
          in predications, neither on the part of the middles nor on the part of
          the extremes. And this was shown not only analytically in
          demonstrations, but also logically in general as to syllogisms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, if there be a contingent proposition which is mediate, it
          must be reduced to others that are immediate. However, it is not
          reduced to necessary immediate propositions, because necessary things
          are not the proper principles of contingent things, nor can contingent
          things be concluded from necessary things. Hence what remains is that
          some contingent, propositions are immediate and some mediate. Thus,
          “The man does not run,” is mediate, for it can be proved through this
          middle, “The man is not in motion,” which is also contingent, albeit
          immediate. The acceptance of such immediate contingent propositions is
          opinion. Yet this does not mean that the accepting of a mediate
          contingent proposition is not opinion. For opinion is related to
          contingent things, as science and understanding to necessary things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly (89a5), he proves the same point by means of that which is
          commonly observed, saying that what has been said, mainly, that
          opinion is concerned with the contingent is confessed, i.e., in
          agreement with things that are observed. For opinion seems to denote
          something weak and uncertain and to be of such a nature that weakness
          and uncertainty are in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly (89a7), he proves the same point by experiment. For no one,
          when he thinks that it is impossible for a thing to be otherwise,
          supposes that he is forming an opinion; rather he considers himself to
          know scientifically. But when he thinks that something is such and
          such and that there is nothing to prevent its being otherwise, then it
          is that he considers himself to have opinions. This would indicate
          that opinion concerns such things, i.e., contingent things, but
          science necessary things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (89a11) he raises a doubt concerning the aforesaid. First, he
          raises the doubts. Secondly, he solves them (89a16).
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerning the first (89a11), he presents two doubts, one of which is
          concerned with the opinable and the scientifically knowable. If
          opinion is concerned with the contingent and science with the
          necessary, and the contingent is not the same as the necessary, a
          doubt remains as to how a man can opine and scientifically know the
          same thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second doubt concerns science and opinion, namely, why opinion is
          not science; supposing, of course, that one claims that there can be
          opinion about every known thing. For in regard to everything known a
          man can opine that it could be otherwise (except perhaps in the case
          of first principles <i>per se</i> known, whose contraries cannot be
          conceived, and concerning which there is not science but
          understanding). But in regard to all mediate truths of which there is
          demonstration and science, someone can suppose that it is possible
          that they could be otherwise. Consequently, they can fall under
          opinion. For opinion is not concerned exclusively with things
          contingent in their very nature, because then a man could not have
          opinion about everything he knows. Rather opinion is concerned with
          that which is accepted as possible to be otherwise, whether it is that
          or not. Therefore, on this supposition, it remains that science and
          opinion are the same, because both the scientific knower and the man
          of opinion acquire science and opinion through middles until they
          reach things which are immediate, as is clear from the foregoing.
          Hence if someone proceeds through middles to immediate propositions he
          has science. Now this is what the man of opinion does, because just as
          it is possible to have an opinion that something is so, it is also
          possible to have an opinion why something is so. But when I say,
          “why,” a middle is implied. Hence it is clear that opinion can proceed
          to immediates through a middle, whether opinion be of things that are
          contingent in their very nature, or of things accepted as contingent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (89a16) he solves the aforesaid doubts. First, he solves the
          second one which is concerned with the identity of science and
          opinion. Secondly, he solves the first one which is concerned with the
          identity of the scientifically knowable and the opinable (89a23).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (89a16) that if someone proceeds through
          middles to immediates in such a way that the middles are not
          considered capable of being otherwise, but are considered to behave as
          definitions which are the middles through which demonstrations
          proceed, there will not be opinion but science. But if someone
          proceeds to the immediates through certain true middles which,
          nevertheless, are either not verified of the things of which they are
          said <i>per se</i> (as definitions which are predicated essentially or
          signify the species of a thing)-or he does not take them as being in
          these things <i>per se</i>, then he will have opinion and will not
          truly know the <i>quia</i> and the <i>propter quid</i> at once, even
          if he proceeds as far as the immediates: for then he will be forming
          an opinion through the immediates and will not know scientifically.
          But if he does not proceed through immediates but through mediates,
          then he will not be forming an opinion bearing on the
          <i>propter quid</i> but only the <i>quia</i>. For even scientific
          knowledge, when it is not <i>propter quid</i> and immediate, is not
          <i>propter quid</i> science but <i>quia</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (89a23) he solves the first doubt which concerns the identity of
          the scientifically known and the object of opinion. Here it should be
          noted first of all that it is not unfitting that what is
          scientifically known by one person be a matter of opinion for another,
          because what one takes as impossible to be otherwise than stated and
          as scientifically known, another might take as possible to be
          otherwise and as a matter for opinion. But to say that the same man
          has opinion and scientific knowledge of the same thing at the same
          time, is not entirely true, but only in a way. For just as there can
          be true and false opinion about the same thing somehow but not
          absolutely, so also in regard to opinion and scientific knowledge. For
          if someone were to say that there could be a completely true and
          completely false opinion about the same thing, as some do say (for
          example, those who said that whatever seems to be true to a person is
          true, as it is stated in <i>Metaphysics</i> IV), then a person who
          would say such a thing would be forced to admit certain absurdities
          and the many other things pointed out in <i>Metaphysics</i> IV which
          follow from stating that the same thing is true and false. In
          particular this absurdity would follow, namely, that no opinion is
          false and that what he opined to be false he did not opine. Hence it
          cannot be said that there is true and false opinion of the same thing
          absolutely.
        </p>
        <p>
          But because “same” is said in many ways, it happens that somehow there
          is true and false opinion about a same thing, and somehow not. For if
          “a same thing about which there are opinions” means the same real
          extramental subject, then there can be true and false opinion about a
          same thing. But if “same” refers to the proposition that is opined,
          then it is impossible. For example, to opine that the diagonal is
          commensurable with the side of a square is to opine with a false
          opinion; and it is absurd to say that this statement can be opined as
          a true opinion.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if we take diagonal as the enunciable subject, then there can be
          true and false opinion of a same thing. For in regard to a diagonal,
          one opines truly that it is really incommensurable, and another opines
          falsely that it is commensurable. Thus, it is clear that although that
          concerning which there is science and opinion be the same in subject,
          it is not the same in notion. For the diagonal which is said to be
          commensurable and not to be commensurable is the same in subject,
          because the subject of each statement is the same. Nevertheless, it is
          clear that there is a mental distinction between diagonal insofar as
          it is taken as commensurable and insofar as it is taken as
          incommensurable. Consequently, there can be true and false opinion
          about the same subject, but not of the same subject according to
          notion.
        </p>
        <p>
          The same is true of science and opinion. For it is science when
          someone knows this to be an animal in such a way that it cannot not be
          an animal; but it is opinion when someone knows it to be an animal in
          such a way that it might not be an animal. For example, if there is
          science concerning the fact that man is truly that which is an animal
          in such a way that it is impossible for it to be otherwise, there will
          be opinion concerning the fact that man is not truly that which is an
          animal, and as a result could be otherwise. For it is clear that the
          subject both known and opined is the same, namely, man; but in notion
          it is not the same. Thus, therefore, from the foregoing it is obvious
          that it is impossible to know scientifically and to opine the same
          thing at the same time, because a man would at one and the same time
          have a conjecture that could be otherwise and that could not be
          otherwise. But this could occur in the case of two men, namely, that
          one have science about a thing and another have opinion about the same
          thing, as has been stated. But this does not occur in the same person
          for the reason given.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (89b6) he compares science to certain habits that are concerned
          with truth. First, to those habits which deal with principles and
          conclusions. Secondly, to the habit which is specifically concerned
          with the middle (89b10).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (89b6) that in regard to those forms of
          knowledge that are other than opinion, the question of how they are
          distinguished into reason and understanding and science and art and
          prudence and wisdom, pertains somehow to the considerations of first
          philosophy or even of natural philosophy and somehow to the
          considerations of moral philosophy which is called ethics.
        </p>
        <p>
          To understand this it should be noted that in <i>Ethics</i> VI,
          Aristotle lays down five things which are always concerned with the
          truth, namely, art, science, wisdom, prudence and understanding,
          adding two that are concerned with the true and false, namely,
          suspicion and opinion. Now the first five are concerned solely with
          the true, because they imply rectitude of reason. But three of them,
          namely, wisdom, science and understanding imply reason’s rectitude in
          regard to necessary truths: science in regard to conclusions,
          understanding in regard to principles, and wisdom in regard to the
          highest causes, which are the divine causes. But the other two,
          namely, art and prudence, imply the rectitude of reason in regard to
          contingent things: prudence in regard to things to be done, i.e., in
          regard to acts which remain within the one acting, such as to love,
          hate, choose, and similar acts that pertain to moral activity, of
          which prudence is the director. Art, however, implies the rectitude of
          reason in regard to things to be made, i.e., things that are done to
          external matter; for example, cutting and other activities in which
          art directs.
        </p>
        <p>
          To this list he adds “reason,” which pertains to bringing, principles
          to their conclusions. Now to treat of wisdom, namely, what it is and
          how it works, and to treat of science and understanding and art,
          pertain somehow to first philosophy. Prudence, on the other hand,
          pertains to moral consideration; understanding and reason, insofar as
          they name certain powers, pertain to natural consideration, as is
          clear in <i>On the Soul</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (89b10) he makes mention of the habit which is specifically
          concerned with the middle. And he says that quick wit is a certain
          accurate and facile conjecturing of the middle (the reason) why
          something occurs; and this when one does not have much time to inspect
          or deliberate, as when a person, seeing that the moon has all its
          brightness whenever it is turned toward the sun, immediately
          understands why this is, namely, because it is illumined by the sun.
          Similarly, in the case of human acts: if a person sees a poor man
          arguing with a rich man, he knows that the rich man took something
          from him, and the argument is about its return. Or if he should see
          persons formerly enemies now made friends, he knows that the reason is
          because both have a common enemy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, he shows in two ways that to know the middle is to know the
          “why”: first, with the following reason, namely, because such a quick
          witted person, seeing all the middle causes, knows all the ultimate
          ones into which they are all finally analyzed, and through which the
          “why” is known. Secondly, he manifests this with an example presented
          in a syllogism. Thus, let us suppose the moon to be C, i.e., the minor
          extreme, and “to be bright because of its opposition to the sun,” to
          be A. the major extreme; but “to be illumined by the sun,” to be B,
          i.e., the middle. For C is B. i.e., “The moon has light from the sun,”
          and A is in B, because “that which has light from the sun is bright
          when turned toward the sun.” Thus it is proved that A is in C through
          B.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence it is clear that quick wit is the faculty of quickly
          apprehending the middle, and is present in persons as a natural gift
          or is acquired by training. But he presented various examples of quick
          wit to show that in all the aforesaid habits, namely, prudence,
          wisdom, and so on, there can be quick wit.<br /></p

        <p>
          After determining about the demonstrative syllogism in the first book,
          the Philosopher intends in this [second] book to treat concerning its
          principles. But there are two principles of the demonstrative
          syllogism, namely, its middle and the first indemonstrable
          propositions. Therefore this book is divided into two parts. In the
          first he determines concerning the knowledge of the middle in
          demonstrations. In the second concerning the knowledge of the first
          propositions (99b18) [L. 20]. For since it has been established in the
          first book that every doctrine and every discipline takes its start
          from pre-existing knowledge, and since in demonstrations the knowledge
          of the conclusion is acquired through some middle and through the
          first indemonstrable propositions, we are left with the task of
          investigating how these come to be known.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the first part is divided into two parts. In the first he inquires
          what is a middle in demonstrations. In the second part he inquires how
          that middle is made known to us (90a36) [L. 2]. But because the middle
          in demonstrations is employed in order to make known something about
          which there might have been doubt or question, therefore in regard to
          the first he does two things. First, he lays down the number of
          questions. Secondly, from these questions he pursues his investigation
          by showing how the questions pertain to the middle of demonstrations
          (89b38). Regarding the first he does three things. First, he
          enumerates the questions. Secondly, he explains complex questions
          (89b26). Thirdly, simple questions (89b32).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (89b21) that the number of questions is equal
          to the number of things that are scientifically known. The reason for
          this is that science is knowledge acquired through demonstration. But
          things which we previously did not know are those of which we must
          seek knowledge by demonstration: for it is in regard to things which
          we do not know that we form questions. Hence it follows that the
          things we inquire about are equal in number to the things we know
          through science. But there are four things that we ask, namely,
          <i>quia</i> [i.e., is it a fact that], <i>propter quid</i> [i.e., why,
          or what is the cause or reason], <i>si est</i> [if it is, i.e.,
          whether it is], <i>quid est</i> [what is it]. To these four can be
          reduced whatever is scientifically inquirable or knowable.
        </p>
        <p>
          However in <i>Topics</i> I he divides questions or problems into four
          kinds in a different way, but all of them are included under one of
          the questions listed here, namely, the one called <i>quia</i>. For in
          the <i>Topics</i> he is concerned only with questions to be disputed
          dialectically.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (89b26) he clarifies the questions he laid down; and first of all
          the complex ones. To understand this it should be noted that science
          bears only on the true, and the true is not signified except by an
          enunciation; therefore, only the enunciation can be scientifically
          knowable and so inquirable. But, as it is stated in
          <i>On Interpretation</i> II, the enunciation is formed in two ways: in
          one way from a name and a verb without an appositive, as when it is
          stated that man is; in another way when some third item is set
          adjacent, as when it is stated that man is white.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore the questions we form can be reduced either to the first
          type of enunciation so that we get, as it were, a simple question; or
          to the second type, and then the question will be, as it were, complex
          or put in number, because, namely, the question concerns the putting
          together of two items.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to this latter type a twofold question can be formed: one of
          them is whether this is true which is stated. This question he
          expounds first, saying that when we ask concerning some thing whether
          that thing is this or that, so that in effect we are somehow putting
          it in number, namely, by taking two things one of which is predicate
          and the other subject, as when we ask if the sun is failing because of
          an eclipse or not, and is man an animal or not, then we are said to
          ask <i>quia</i>: not in the sense that the word “ <i>quia</i> ”
          functions as a question mark, but because we are asking in order to
          find out <i>quia</i> [i.e., that] it is so. An indication of this is
          that when we have discovered it through demonstration, we cease our
          questioning; and if we had known it at the very beginning, we would
          not have asked whether it is so. But inquiry does not cease until that
          is obtained which was asked. And so, since the question in which we
          ask whether this is this ceases once we have certified that it is so,
          it is clear what a question of this kind asks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (89b28) he clarifies the next question which also puts in number,
          ‘I saying that when we know that it is so, we ask
          <i>propter quid</i> [i.e., why] it is so. For example, when we know
          that the sun is failing through an eclipse and that the earth is moved
          during an earthquake, we ask <i>why</i> the sun is failing or why the
          earth is being moved. Therefore we ask it in this way, namely, by
          putting in number.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (89b32) he clarifies the other two questions which do not put in
          number but are simple. And he says that we ask certain things in a
          manner different from the aforesaid questions, namely, by not putting
          in number; as when we ask whether or not there be centaurs, for in
          this case the question we ask concerning the centaur is simply whether
          it exists and not whether the centaur be this, say white, or not. And
          just as when we knew that this is this, we then asked why, so once we
          know of something simply that it is, we ask what it is, for example,
          what is God or what is man. These then and so many are the things we
          ask; and when we have found the answer, we are said to know
          scientifically.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (89b38) he shows how the aforesaid questions are related to the
          middle. Concerning this he does three things. First, he states what he
          intends. Secondly, he explains what he had said (90a2). Thirdly, he
          proves his proposition (90a5).
        </p>
        <p>
          In regard to the first it should be noted that two of the aforesaid
          questions put in number and two do not. From the first member of each
          of these groups, he forms another grouping composed of the question
          <i>that</i> it is and the question <i>if</i> it is. And he says that
          when we ask <i>that</i> this is this, or when we simply ask concerning
          something, <i>if</i> it is, we are not asking anything else than
          whether or not a middle is to be found of that which we ask; and this
          is something not conveyed by the form of the question. For when I ask
          whether the sun is eclipsed or whether man exists, it is not obvious
          from the form of the question that I am asking whether there is some
          middle by which it might be demonstrated that the sun is eclipsed or
          that man exists; but if the sun is eclipsed or man does exist, the
          consequence is that some middle can be found to demonstrate the things
          which are inquired. For no one forms a question concerning immediate
          things which, although they are true, do not have a middle, since
          things of this sort, being evident, do not fall under a question.
          Thus, therefore, one who asks whether this is this or whether this
          absolutely is, as a consequence is asking whether there is a middle of
          this sort. For in the question <i>if</i> it is or <i>that</i> it is,
          one is asking whether that which is a middle exists, because that
          which is the middle is the reason of that concerning which one asks
          whether this is this or simply whether it is, as will be explained
          below. Nevertheless the question is not being asked under the aspect
          of middle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now it happens that having found the answer to what is asked by these
          two questions, one knows either <i>that</i> it is or <i>if</i> it is:
          one of which consists in knowing the existence absolutely; but the
          other in part, as when we know that man is white, because to be white
          does not signify the existence of man in his entirety but signifies
          him to be something. This is why when a man is becoming white, we do
          not say that he is coming to be absolutely, but in a qualified sense.
          But when it is asserted that man is, his existence is signified
          absolutely, so that when a man comes to be, he is said to become
          absolutely.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, when we know <i>that</i> it is and ask <i>why</i> it is, or
          when we know <i>if</i> it is and ask <i>what</i> it is, we are asking
          what is the middle. And as in the other cases, so here, this is
          gathered not from the form of the question but by way of concomitance.
          For one who seeks the cause <i>why</i> the sun is eclipsed is not
          seeking it as a middle which demonstrates, but he is seeking that
          which is a middle, because it is by way of consequence that once he
          has it, he can demonstrate. And the same applies to the question what
          is it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (904) he manifests what he had said, namely, that
          <i>that it is</i> and <i>if it is</i> differ as <i>in part</i> and
          <i>absolutely</i> differ. For when we inquire whether the moon is
          waning or waxing, it is a question in part, since in a question of
          this type we are asking if the moon is something, namely, is it waning
          or has it waxed or not. But when we ask whether the moon exists or
          whether it is night, the question bears on existence absolutely.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (90a5) he proves his point, namely, that the aforesaid questions
          pertain to the middle. First, he proves it with a reason. Secondly,
          with a sign (90a24).
        </p>
        <p>
          He concludes therefore first (90a5) from the explanation given above
          that in all the aforesaid questions one is either asking
          <i>whether</i> there is a middle, namely, in the question
          <i>that it is</i> and in the question <i>if</i> it is, or what the
          middle is, namely, in the question <i>why</i> and in the question
          <i>what is it</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          And he proves that the question <i>why</i> inquires what the middle
          is. For it is obvious that a cause is the middle in a demonstration
          which enables one to know scientifically, because to know
          scientifically is to know the cause of a thing. But it is precisely
          the cause that is being sought in all the above questions. That this
          is so he manifests first in regard to the question that. For when it
          is asked whether the moon is waning, then according to the manner
          explained above, what is being asked is whether or not something is
          the cause of this waning. Then he shows this for the question why. For
          once we know <i>that</i> something is the cause of the moon’s waning,
          we ask what the cause is; and this is to inquire <i>why</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The same applies to the other two questions, as he shows in the
          following way. For he says that whether we assert not that something
          is this or that (for example, when I say that man is white or is a
          grammarian), but that the substance itself exists absolutely; or do
          not assert that some thing exists absolutely, but that some thing is
          something by putting in number (whether that something be a thing
          predicated <i>per se</i> or a thing predicated <i>per accidens</i>);
          no matter in which of these ways we take the thing to be, its cause is
          the middle for demonstrating it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then he explains what he means by a substance to exist absolutely when
          we inquire concerning the moon or the earth or a triangle or any other
          subject whether it is and then take some middle to demonstrate this. I
          say that a thing is something when we inquire concerning eclipse in
          regard to the moon, or equality or inequality in regard to triangle,
          or whether it is in the middle of the universe or not in regard to the
          earth. And he asserts that as far as the present point is concerned it
          makes no difference which way a thing is taken to be, because in all
          these cases <i>what it is</i> is the same as <i>why</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          He manifests this first of all in regard to the waning, of the moon.
          For if one asks <i>what</i> is the eclipse of the moon, the answer is
          that it is the absence of light in the moon because of the earth’s
          being set between it and the sun. And this same answer is given when
          it is inquired <i>why</i> the moon is eclipsed. For we say that the
          moon is eclipsed because there is a lack of light due to the earth’s
          opposition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then he manifests the same idea with another example. For if one asks
          <i>what</i> is a chord, the answer is given that it is a numerical
          ratio according to high and low notes. Again, if one asks why a high
          note and a low note are concordant, the answer is given that it is
          because the high note and the low note have a numerical ratio. And so
          the question what is it and the question <i>why</i> reduce to the same
          thing subjectively, although they differ in formality. Hence because
          the question <i>why</i> leads us to inquire what the middle is, as has
          been shown, what is left is that when one asks <i>what is it</i>, the
          middle is likewise inquired.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then he shows the same thing in regard to the question <i>that</i>.
          For, as has been said, concordance is a numerical ratio between high
          and low notes. Men, therefore, one asks whether a high and low note
          concord, he is inquiring whether there is some numerical ratio of the
          high and low note; and this is the middle for demonstrating that a
          high and a low note concord. Consequently in the question <i>that</i>,
          one inquires whether there is a middle. But once we have found
          <i>that</i> there is a numerical ratio of the high and low note, we
          then ask what that ratio is: and this is to ask <i>what</i> or
          <i>why</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here Aristotle seems to say that the definition of a proper attribute
          is the middle in demonstration. However it must be remarked that the
          definition of the proper attribute cannot be completed without the
          definition of the subject. For it is obvious that the principles which
          the definition of the subject contains are the principles of the
          proper attribute. Hence a demonstration will not reach the first cause
          unless one takes as the middle of demonstration the definition of the
          subject. And so the proper attribute must be concluded of the subject
          by means of the definition of the proper attribute; furthermore, the
          definition of the proper attribute must be concluded of the subject
          through the definition of the subject. This is why it was laid down at
          the very beginning that one must know beforehand the
          <i>what is it</i> not only of the proper attribute but of the subject
          also; which would not be required unless the definition of the proper
          attribute were concluded of the subject through the definition of the
          subject.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is clear from the following example: If we wish to demonstrate of
          triangle that it has three angles equal to two right angles, we first
          take as middle the fact that it is a figure having an exterior angle
          equal to its two opposite interior angles-which is, as it were, the
          definition of a proper attribute. But this in turn must be
          demonstrated by the definition of the subject, so that we would say:
          “Every closed figure of three straight lines has an exterior angle
          equal to its two opposite interior angles; but the triangle is such a
          figure. Therefore...” And the same is true if we were to demonstrate
          that a high note concords with a low note: for we would state the
          definition of the attribute which in this case consists in their
          having a numerical ratio; but then to demonstrate this attribute we
          would have to take the definition of high note and of low note. For a
          low note is one which is apt to act on the sense for a long time,
          whereas a high note is one which does so for a short time: but between
          the long and the short there is a numerical ratio. Therefore, there is
          a numerical ratio between a high note and a low note. And if the high
          note and the low note were defined some other way, it would make no
          difference. For in any case something pertaining to quantity would
          have to appear in their definition, so that it would be necessary to
          conclude that there is a numerical ratio between them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (90a44) he manifests his point by means of a sensible sign. And
          he says that those cases in which the middle is perceptible by sense
          clearly show that every question is a question concerning a middle,
          because, namely, when the middle is known through the senses, no room
          is left for a question. For we ask one of the aforesaid questions in
          matters pertaining to sense, when the middle does not appear: thus, we
          ask whether or not there is an eclipse of the moon because we do not
          sensibly perceive the middle which is the cause making the moon to be
          eclipsed. But if we were to situate ourselves in a place above the
          moon, we would see how the moon became eclipsed by entering the
          earth’s shadow. Then we would no longer ask <i>if</i> it is or
          <i>why</i> it is, but both would at once be obvious to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          But because someone could object that sense-perception bears on
          singulars—whereas it is universals that are being asked about, just as
          it is universals that are scientifically known—and consequently, it
          does not seem that the matter under question can be made known through
          sense; therefore, as though in answer to this objection he adds that
          it is precisely because we do sense the particular (namely, that this
          body of the moon enters this shadow of the earth), that we happen at
          once to know the universal. For our sense would observe the fact that
          the light of the sun is now blocked by the earth’s opposition; and
          through this it would be clear to us that the moon is now eclipsed.
          And because we would conjecture that the eclipse of the moon always
          occurs in this way, the sense knowledge of the singular would
          immediately become a universal in our science.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so from this example he concludes that knowing the
          <i>quod quid</i> [ <i>quod quid</i> refers to any or all of the items
          that constitute the essential nature of a thing.] and the
          <i>why</i> are the same. For from the fact that we observe the earth
          situated between the sun and moon, we would know scientifically both
          <i>what</i> an eclipse of the moon is and <i>why</i> the moon is
          eclipsed. And one of these, namely, the knowledge what it is, is
          reduced to the science by which we know that something simply is, and
          not that something is in some thing. But the <i>why</i> is reduced to
          our knowledge of things that are in some thing, as when we say that
          three angles are equal to or greater than or less than two right
          angles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, he summarizes and concludes the main point, namely, that it
          is clear from the foregoing that in all questions there is question of
          the middle.<br /></p

        <p>
          After showing that every question is in some sense a question of the
          middle, which is the <i>quod quid</i> and the <i>propter quid</i>, the
          Philosopher now begins to make manifest how the middle becomes known
          to us. And it is divided into two parts. In the first part he shows
          how the <i>quod quid</i> and <i>propter quid</i> are related to
          demonstration. In the second part he shows how the
          <i>quod quid</i> and <i>propter quid</i> should be investigated
          (96a22) [L. 13]. The first part is divided into two parts. In the
          first he manifests how the <i>quid est</i> is related to
          demonstration. In the second he manifests how the
          <i>propter quid</i> which signifies a cause is related to
          demonstration (94a20) [L. 9]. In regard to the first he does two
          things. First, he states his proposal. Secondly, he pursues his
          proposal (90b1).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (90a36) that since every question for whose
          solution a demonstration is adduced is a question of the middle which
          is quid and <i>propter quid</i>, our first task is to declare how the
          <i>quod quid</i> is made known to us, namely, is it through
          demonstration or division or some other way. Furthermore, we must
          point out how to reduce to the <i>quod quid</i> those items of a thing
          that are apparent. And because a definition is a statement which
          signifies the <i>quod quid</i>, it is necessary also to know what a
          definition is and why certain things are definable. Consequently we
          shall proceed in these matters in the following way. First, by raising
          difficulties. Secondly, by establishing the truth (93a1) [L. 7]. Then
          (90b1) he pursues his proposal in the order stated. First, he proceeds
          dialectically by raising difficulties. Secondly, by determining the
          truth (93a1) [L. 7]. In regard to the first he does two things. First,
          he proceeds by disputing about the definition which signifies
          <i>quod quid</i>. Secondly, about the <i>quod quid</i> which is
          signified by the definition (91a12) [L. 31. Concerning the first he
          does three things. First, he inquires disputatively whether there is
          definition of all things of which there is demonstration. Secondly,
          whether conversely there is demonstration of all things of which there
          is definition (91b19). Thirdly, whether there can be definition and
          demonstration of the same thing (90b27). In regard to the first he
          does two things. First, he states his intention. Secondly, he pursues
          his proposal (90b1).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (90b1) that when a number of items are planned
          for discussion, one should take his start from the item which is most
          fruitful in settling the “had,” i.e., the subsequent, problems. This
          would mean that in our case we should begin with the fact that someone
          might wonder whether the same thing and according to the same aspect
          could be known through definition and demonstration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (90b4) he proves that there is not definition of all things of
          which there is demonstration. This he does in four ways, the first of
          which is the following: a definition is indicative of the
          <i>quod quid</i>; but anything which pertains to the
          <i>quod quid</i> is predicated both affirmatively and universally:
          therefore, a definition contains or signifies only those things which
          are predicated affirmatively and universally. But not all syllogisms
          demonstrate affirmative universal conclusions: in fact some are
          negative, as for example, all those in the second figure; and some are
          particular, as for example, all those in the third figure. Therefore,
          there is not definition of all things of which there is demonstration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly (90b7), he shows the same thing when he says that there
          cannot even be definition of all things which are concluded through
          affirmative syllogisms-which occurs only in the first figure, as when
          it is demonstratively syllogized that every triangle has three angles
          equal to two right angles. Now the reason for this statement, namely,
          that there cannot be definition of all things thus syllogized, is that
          to know something demonstratively is nothing else than to have a
          demonstration. From this it follows that if the science of all these
          things is had only through demonstration, there is not definition of
          them. For things which have a definition are made known through their
          definition. Otherwise it would follow that a person who does not have
          a demonstration of these things would have scientific knowledge of
          them, for the simple reason that nothing hinders a person who knows
          the definition from not having at the same time the
          demonstration-although the definition is a principle of the
          demonstration. For not everyone who knows the principles knows how to
          deduce the conclusion by demonstrating.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly (9014), he shows the same thing through an induction from
          which a conviction can arise sufficient for admitting the
          above-mentioned conclusion. He says, therefore, that demonstration is
          concerned with things which are <i>per se</i> in something, as is
          clear from what has been established in the first book. But a
          definition never gives anyone a knowledge of those items which are
          <i>per se</i> in a thing, much less of those which are in it
          <i>per accidens</i> -not that there cannot be definitions of accidents
          which are in a thing <i>per se</i> or <i>per accidens</i>; but because
          no one has ever given the definition of that which is to be in a thing
          <i>per se</i> or <i>per accidens</i>, which the syllogism concludes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fourthly (90b16), he shows the same thing with a reason, namely, that
          the definition makes the substance known: first of all, because
          substance is defined in a primary way, whereas accident is defined
          secondarily by means of a definition which adds something alien, as is
          stated in <i>Metaphysics</i> VII; and secondly, because an accident is
          not defined save insofar as it is signified after the manner of a
          substance by employing a noun. But the things upon which
          demonstrations bear are not substances nor things signified after the
          manner of substances, but things signified after the manner of
          accidents, namely, after the manner of something inhering in some
          thing. Hence he concludes that it is not possible that there be a
          definition of everything of which there is demonstration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (90b19) he inquires whether conversely there is demonstration of
          everything of which there is a definition. And he shows that there is
          not for two reasons, the first of which has already been touched upon
          above. For it seems that of one thing, precisely as it is one, there
          is one science, i.e., one way of knowing it. Hence if that which is
          demonstrable is truly known scientifically in virtue of the fact that
          a demonstration is had of it, then something impossible follows, if it
          can also be scientifically known through a definition: for the one
          having the definition would be knowing something demonstrable without
          having the demonstration-which seems absurd. And this reason was the
          second of the four previously presented.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (90b23) he gives the second reason. For definitions are
          principles of demonstrations, as was established in Book I; but the
          principles are not demonstrable—otherwise it would follow that there
          are principles of principles and that demonstrations would proceed to
          infinity, which is impossible, as we have shown in the first book.
          Hence it follows that definitions are not demonstrable, being as they
          are first principles in demonstrations. Consequently, there is not
          demonstration of all things of which there is definition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (90b28) he inquires whether it is possible for there to be
          definition and demonstration of the same thing in some cases even
          though not of all. And with three reasons he shows that there is not.
          The first of these reasons is that a definition is manifestive of the
          <i>quod quid</i> and of the substance, i.e., of the essence, of a
          thing. Demonstrations, on the other hand, do not manifest this but
          suppose it: thus in mathematical demonstrations it is supposed from
          arithmetic what unity is and what odd is; and the same applies in
          other demonstrations. Therefore, there is not demonstration and
          definition of the same thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (90b33) he presents the second reason and it is this: In the
          conclusion of a demonstration something is predicated of something
          either affirmatively or negatively; but in a definition nothing is
          predicated of anything: thus in the definition that man is a
          two-footed animal, neither animal is predicated of two-footed nor
          two-footed of animal. Likewise in the definition that a circle or a
          triangle is a plane figure, neither plane is predicated of figure nor
          figure of plane. For if the parts of a definition were to be joined to
          one another, the resulting predication would have to be understood in
          a manner which suits a definition, namely, in <i>quod quid</i>. But
          this we do not observe. For the genus is not predicated
          <i>quod quid</i> of the difference, nor the difference of the genus.
          Therefore, there is not definition and demonstration of a same thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (90b38) he gives the third reason and says that it is one thing
          to manifest the <i>quod quid</i> and another the <i>quia</i>, as is
          clear from the difference between the questions listed above; but the
          definition shows the quid of something, whereas a demonstration shows
          either affirmatively or negatively that something is or is not so of
          something. But we see that for different things different
          demonstrations are required, unless those two different things are
          related as whole and part: for in that case there would be one and the
          same demonstration concerning both. Thus, the demonstration that a
          triangle has three angles equal to two right angles applies also to
          isosceles, which is related to triangle as part to whole. But that is
          not the case in these two things, namely, in the <i>quia</i> and in
          the quid; for neither is a part of the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, it has been established that there is not demonstration of
          everything of which there is definition, nor conversely. Furthermore,
          it has been possible from this to conclude that these are not of the
          same thing, and that definition and demonstration are neither the same
          nor is one in the other as a subjective part in its whole—otherwise it
          would be necessary that even those things of which they are be related
          after the manner of whole and part in such a way, namely, that
          everything definable would be demonstrable, or vice versa—which was
          disproved above.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, he summarizes and concludes that so far we have proceeded by
          opposing.<br /></p

        <p>
          After inquiring disputatively whether the definition signifying
          <i>quod quid</i> can be demonstrated, the Philosopher continues to
          inquire disputatively and asks whether the <i>quod quid</i> itself,
          which is signified by a definition, can be proved demonstratively.
          First, he states what he intends. Secondly, he pursues his proposal
          (91a14).
        </p>
        <p>
          First, therefore (91a12), he raises the question: Can there be a
          syllogism or demonstration of that which is the <i>quod quid</i>,
          namely, in such a way as to conclude that this is the
          <i>quod quid</i> of this; or can this not be done, as the immediately
          preceding reason supposed?
        </p>
        <p>
          Now it was necessary to undertake this disputation on the heels of the
          previous one, because in a definition one must be sure not only that
          what it signifies is the <i>quod quid</i>, but also that it be
          formulated in such a. way as to be suitable for manifesting the
          <i>quod quid</i>, i.e., in such a way as to be composed of prior and
          better known items and possess the other diaracteristics which mark a
          definition. It is significant that he says,.1 whether there be
          syllogism or demonstration,” for some of the reasons which follow
          conclude that there is not demonstration of the <i>quod quid</i>, and
          others that there is no syllogism at all of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (91a14) he proceeds disputatively to show that there is not
          sy1logism, or demonstration of the <i>quod quid</i>. First, he
          excludes certain special ways by which it might seem possible to
          demonstrate the <i>quod quid</i>. Secondly, he presents common reasons
          for this (953) [L. 6]. Concerning the first he does three things.
          First, he shows that <i>quod quid</i> cannot be demonstrated by using
          convertible terms. Secondly, that it cannot be demonstrated by
          division (91b12) [L. 4]. Thirdly, that it cannot be demonstrated by
          accepting that which is required for <i>quod quid</i> (92a6) [L. 51.
          In regard to the first he does three things. First, he prefaces
          certain notions required for showing the proposal. Secondly, he
          induces a reason (91a17). Thirdly, he discloses the inconvenience
          which follows (91a32).
        </p>
        <p>
          With respect to the first (9104) he presupposes two things: the first
          of these pertains to the syllogism, namely, that every syllogism
          proves something about something by means of some middle, as is clear
          from the above. The other pertains to what is to be proved by the
          syllogism, namely, the <i>quod quid</i>, for which two conditions are
          required. The first of these is that the <i>quod quid</i> be proper,
          for each thing has its own proper essence or quiddity. But because not
          everything which is proper to something pertains to its essence, a
          second condition is required, namely, that it be predicated in quid.
          Furthermore, a third condition must follow on these two, namely, that
          the <i>quod quid</i> be convertible with that of which it is.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (91a17) he lays down a reason in support of his proposal.
          Regarding this he does three things. First, he states what sort of
          syllogism would be required for concluding a <i>quod quid</i>, if this
          were possible. Secondly, he concludes to the inconvenience that
          follows from this (9145). Thirdly, he uses terms to exemplify this
          (91a28). Concerning the first he does three things. First, he shows
          what is required for a syllogism concluding the <i>quod quid</i> so
          far as it is something proper. Secondly, what is required so far as it
          is predicated in quid (9108). Thirdly, he shows that without these
          characteristics such a syllogism would not be possible (91a21).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (9108) that if A which is to be proved of C as
          its <i>quod quid</i> is proper to C (which is required of the
          <i>quod quid</i>, as has been said), it will be necessary that the
          first, namely, A, be proper to the middle which is B; for if A
          exceeded [i.e., were more universal than] B, which is predicated
          universally of C, it would follow that A exceeds C even more. In like
          manner, it is clear that B will have to be proper to C: for if B were
          to exceed C, it would follow that A, which is predicated universally
          of B, exceeds C; consequently, it would not be proper to it, as was
          supposed. What remains, therefore, is that if there is to be a
          syllogism concluding <i>quod quid</i>, the terms will have to be so
          related that all are mutually convertible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (91a18) he shows what the syllogism in question must have, if the
          condition is to be fulfilled that what it concludes be predicated in
          <i>quod quid</i>. And he says that such a syllogism must be so
          formulated that the major extreme, which is A, be predicated in
          <i>quod quid</i> of the middle, which is B; in like manner, B will
          have to be predicated in <i>quod quid</i> of the minor extreme, which
          is C. In this way it can be concluded that A is predicated of C in
          <i>quod quid</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (91a21) he shows that the aforesaid way of syllogizing is
          required. And he asserts that if one does not so take the terms by
          “thus duplicating,” i.e., observing the two conditions laid down
          above, i.e., taking the <i>quod quid</i> on the side of both, it does
          not follow of necessity that A would be predicated of C in
          <i>quod quid</i>. Indeed, if the aforesaid conditions are observed on
          the part of one only, it is not sufficient for the purpose intended.
          For even if A were predicated of B in <i>quod quid</i>, it would not
          on that account follow that it must be predicated in
          <i>quod quid</i> of everything of which B might happen to be
          predicated in some random way. Consequently, it follows that the
          <i>quod quid</i> must be taken on the side of both in such a way,
          namely, that not only must A be the <i>quod quid</i> of B, but also
          that B must be the <i>quod quid</i> of C, as being predicated
          convertibly and in <i>quod quid</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (91a25) he leads to the inconvenience: for if, as has been
          indicated, not only is there found on the side of both something which
          is predicated in <i>quod quid</i> -as a genus predicated of a
          species-but it is further found on the side of both that this
          something is the <i>quod quid erat esse</i> -which a definition
          signifies-it follows that the <i>quod quid erat esse</i> was already
          in the middle term, i.e., that the middle term is the
          <i>quod quid erat esse</i> of the minor extreme. Consequently, we
          would have been supposing the very thing we had set out to prove,
          namely, the quiddity of C. [ <i>quod quid erat esse</i> refers to the
          essential nature of a being.]
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (91a28) he clarifies what he has just said, using terms. Thus, if
          we wish to show what man is, let C, i.e., the minor extreme, be “man,”
          and A, the major extreme, be the “ <i>quod quid</i> of man,” say
          “two-footed animal,” or something similar to this. Therefore, if this
          is what we intend to prove by the syllogism, it is necessary to find
          the definition of some middle, namely, B, such that A will be
          predicated of every B. Furthermore, to this middle will pertain some
          other middle definition which, namely, was the definition of the minor
          extreme. Hence it will follow that this middle will also be the
          <i>quod quid</i> of man. Consequently, one who syllogizes in this way
          would be supposing what he was required to prove, namely, that B is
          the <i>quod quid erat esse</i> of man.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (91a32) he shows how this inconvenience follows from the
          premises. To this end he does three things. First, he indicates the
          method by which this may be fittingly done. And he says that what has
          been said should be considered in two propositions which are first and
          which have terms that belong to each other immediately. For it would
          be possible to prove our point either with several propositions (which
          would lead to several syllogisms), or with only two propositions, but
          taking them as mediate. But because in the final analysis we must
          always arrive at two immediate propositions, then for the sake of
          brevity and dispatch let us assume such propositions from the very
          start. Thus we shall be able to manifest our point quite easily.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly (91a35), he states what he intends and says, concluding from
          the foregoing, that those who would demonstrate through convertible
          terms the <i>quod quid</i> of some thing (say, what is a soul, or what
          is man, or anything else of this sort), necessarily commit the fault
          of begging the question. And he cites as an example Plato’s definition
          of soul. For since the soul is alive and is the body’s cause of being
          alive, it follows that it differs from the body in the fact that the
          body lives in virtue of some cause other than itself, but the soul
          lives in virtue of itself. But Plato posited that number is the
          substance of all things: for he failed to distinguish between one,
          which is converted with being and refers to the substance of that of
          which it is predicated, and one which is the principle of number. As a
          consequence, it followed that the soul as to its substance is a
          number, just as any other thing containing many things in itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Likewise Plato posited that to live is one of the ways of being moved.
          For the living are distinguished from the non-living on two scores,
          namely, sense and movement, as it is stated in <i>On the Soul</i> I.
          Furthermore, he asserted that sensing or knowing is one way of being
          moved. Thus, therefore, he said that the soul is a self-moving number
          in addition to saying that the soul is its own cause of being alive.
          Consequently, if anyone desired to prove what a soul is, namely, that
          it is something which is its own cause of being alive, and assumed as
          middle that the soul is a number which moves itself, it would be
          necessary to beg this, namely, that the soul is a self-moving number,
          such that this is identical with the soul as being its
          <i>quod quid</i>. Otherwise, it would not follow, if something is the
          <i>quod quia</i> of self-moving number, that it is the
          <i>quod quid</i> of the soul itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly (91b1), he proves his proposal, namely, that such a proof
          involves begging the question. And he says that it does not follow
          from the fact that A follows on B and B on C, that the major extreme,
          A, is the <i>quod quid</i> of the minor extreme, C; what follows is
          simply that A is in C. And if it is further granted that A is the
          <i>quod quid</i> of something and is predicated universally of B, it
          does not yet follow that A is the <i>quod q uid</i> of C: for it is
          plain that this, i.e., the <i>quod quid</i> of animal is universally
          predicated of this which is man’s <i>quod quid</i>. For just as it is
          true that animal is universally predicated of man, so it is true that
          the definition of animal is universally predicated of the definition
          of man; but that does not mean that they are entirely one and the
          same.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so it is clear that unless one takes the terms in such a way that
          the first is entirely one and the same with the middle, and the middle
          with the last, it will not be possible to syllogize that A, which is
          the first, is the <i>quod quid</i> of C—which is the last—and its
          essence. But if the terms are taken in that way, it follows that prior
          to its being concluded, the <i>quod quid</i> of C, namely, B, was
          assumed in the premises. From this it follows that there is not a
          demonstration but a begging or assuming of the question.<br /></p

          >
        </p>
        <p>
          After showing that <i>quod quid</i> cannot be demonstrated with
          convertible terms, the Philosopher now shows that it cannot be
          demonstrated by the method of division. And in regard to this he does
          two things. First, he shows what he proposes. Secondly, he excludes a
          certain solution (91b28). Concerning the first he does two things.
          First, he shows what he proposes by using a reason common to all
          things which are syllogized. Secondly, he shows it with reasons proper
          to that which is <i>quod quid</i> (91a45).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (91b12) that just as the
          <i>quod quid</i> cannot be demonstrated by convertible terms, so
          neither by the method of division through which, as a matter of fact,
          nothing is proved syllogistically, as was established in
          <i>Resolutions Touching Figures</i>, i.e., in
          <i>Prior Analytics</i> I. For just as in the
          <i>Posterior Analytics</i> resolution to first principles is taught,
          so in the <i>Prior Analytics</i> resolution is made to certain first
          simple items which pertain to the arrangement of the syllogism in mood
          and figure.
        </p>
        <p>
          That something cannot be syllogized by the method of division he
          proves from the fact that in this method, given the premises, the
          conclusion does not follow of necessity, which it should, considering
          the nature of a syllogism. Rather, the same thing happens in the
          method of division as happens in the method of induction. For one who
          induces through singulars to the universal does not demonstrate or
          syllogize from necessity. For when something is proved
          syllogistically, it is not necessary to make further inquiry
          concerning the conclusion or to ask that the conclusion be conceded;
          what is necessary is that the conclusion be true, if the premises laid
          down are true. But, as he shows with certain examples, this does not
          happen in the method of division. For the method of division consists
          in assuming something common which is divided into at least two
          members, so that, one being removed, the other is concluded. For
          example, if beings are so divided that on the one hand is animal and
          on the other lifeless things, then having established that man is not
          a lifeless thing, it is concluded that he is animal. But this
          conclusion does not follow, unless the hearer grants that man is
          either an animal or a lifeless thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          It might be remarked here that he quite fittingly compared division to
          induction. For in both cases one is required to suppose that he has
          listed all the things contained under some general heading; otherwise,
          the person inducing could not conclude a universal from the singulars
          he assumed, nor could the person dividing conclude to one member just
          because the others have been eliminated. Thus it is obvious that one
          cannot in virtue of the fact that Socrates and Plato and Cicero run,
          induce of necessity the conclusion that every man runs, unless his
          audience concedes that nothing more is contained under man than the
          ones listed. In like manner, one who divides cannot, in virtue of
          having proved that this colored object is neither white nor grey,
          conclude of necessity that it is black, unless his audience grants him
          that nothing else is contained under colored object than the things
          mentioned in the division. And because a person investigating what man
          is must assume not only the genus which is animal but also the
          difference, he goes on to say in his example that if every animal is
          either of the land or of the water and it is established that because
          man is not a water animal, he is this whole which is land animal, that
          statement does not follow of necessity from the premises: rather it is
          further required that he suppose his audience to have granted him
          something, namely, that animal is sufficiently divided into those of
          the land and those of the water. And because in some cases several
          divisions are used in obtaining the <i>quod quid</i> of a thing, the
          fore, after laying down two divisions in his example, he adds that it
          makes no difference whether few or many are used. For the formality is
          the same in all. And thus he concludes once more that those who
          proceed by the method of division, even in matters that could be
          syllogized, do not use a syllogized proof.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (91b25) he induces two reasons proper to the <i>quod quid</i>.
          The first of these is that not everything which is truly predicated of
          something is predicated in <i>quod quid</i> or signifies its essence.
          Therefore, even if it be conceded that one has sufficiently proved by
          the method of division that this whole, namely, land animal, is truly
          predicated of man, it does not on that account follow that it is
          predicated of it in <i>quod quid</i> or that it shows the
          <i>quod quid erat esse</i>, i.e, that it demonstrates the essence of
          the thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (91b26) he gives the second reason. For the essence of a thing is
          declared through certain definite items which may neither be added to
          or subtracted from. But there is nothing to hinder one who proceeds by
          the method of division from adding something over and above the items
          which suffice for showing the <i>quod quid</i>, or from subtracting
          some of the things which are necessary for this, or from going beyond
          and exceeding the essence of the thing, as when it is more common than
          the thing itself—which happens when the ultimate differences which
          contract common things are removed. Hence the <i>quod quid</i> is not
          sufficiently proved by division. And this is what he concludes,
          namely, that in the method of division the above-mentioned conditions
          are not satisfied, i.e., the conditions that what is concluded be
          predicated in <i>quod quid</i> and that it neither exceed nor be
          exceeded.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (91b28) he excludes a certain solution. First, he proposes it.
          Secondly, he excludes it (91b33).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (91b28) that one might solve our objections by
          saying that when a division is made, one could be taking all the
          things that are predicated in <i>quod quid</i>, so that as a
          consequence of the division
        </p>
        <p>
          he accomplishes what was primarily intended, namely, that he obtains a
          definition signifying the <i>quod quid</i> and leaves out nothing
          which is required for defining. And if he does these two things,
          namely, if all the items he assumes in the division are predicated in
          <i>quod quid</i> and all such
        </p>
        <p>
          things are included in the division so that nothing is left out, then
          it is necessary that what is obtained be the <i>quod quid</i>. And the
          reason for this necessity is that in taking everything which is
          predicated in <i>quod quid</i> and leaving nothing out, that which is
          found must be something individual, i.e., the individual notion of
          such a thing, so that no further division is required for it to be
          appropriate to this thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (91b33) he excludes this solution, saying that even though under
          the aforesaid conditions something individual is necessarily obtained,
          as explained above, the method is nevertheless not syllogistic;
          although it might make one know the <i>quod quid</i> in some other
          way. And this is not unbecoming, namely, that something be manifested
          in a way other than by a syllogism: for one who uses induction does
          not prove anything syllogistically, but yet he does manifest
          something.
        </p>
        <p>
          That one who reaches a definition by way of division does not achieve
          a syllogism he shows by something similar. For if a conclusion is
          induced from a major proposition, the second proposition being
          omitted, and the person concluding declares that this must follow from
          the premises, the hearer could ask why it is necessary—which is
          something that does not happen in a syllogistic proof. Hence such a
          method of arguing is not syllogistic. Similarly, in terms of division
          no syllogism is achieved, because t lie question why always remains.
          Thus, if someone wishing to disclose what man is were to assert by the
          method of division that man is a two-footed mortal animal, or one that
          has two feet but no wings, then as h adds one item to another in his
          division, he could be asked in regard to each one, why is it
          necessary. For one who sets out to manifest a <i>quod quid</i> by
          division will not only assert but also prove—in keeping with what he
          thinks—that everything which exists is mortal or immortal. And
          although it be granted that through this division he might be
          demonstrating his proposition, nevertheless it is not necessary that
          the notion’ so concluded be a definition; for perhaps the items out of
          which such a notion is formed are not predicated in
          <i>quod quid</i> or exceed the substance of the thing defined. But
          even though such a notion might happen to be a definition, it is
          nevertheless not proved by the syllogism to be a definition, as is
          clear from what has been established above.<br /></p

          After showing that the <i>quod quid</i> cannot be demonstrated either
          by convertible terms or by the method of division, the Philosopher
          here shows that it cannot be demonstrated by taking that which is
          required for a <i>quod quid</i>. In regard to this he does two things.
          First, he shows what he proposes. Secondly, he concludes from all of
          the foregoing that there is no way in which <i>quod quid</i> maybe
          demonstrated (92a34). Concerning the first he does two things. First,
          he employs reasons proper to what he proposes. Secondly, he employs a
          reason common to what is now being said and to what was said above
          (92a28). Concerning the first he does two things. First, he shows that
          the <i>quod quid</i> cannot be demonstrated by taking that which
          pertains to the notion of its <i>quod quid</i>. Secondly, he shows
          that the <i>quod quid</i> of this thing cannot be demonstrated by
          taking the <i>quod quid</i> of some other thing (9240). In regard to
          the first he does two things. First, he raises the question. Secondly,
          he argues for his proposal (92a9).
        </p>
        <p>
          He asks therefore first (92a6) whether one might demonstrate what
          something is according to its substance by supposing that the
          <i>quod quid</i> of a thing can be obtained if one satisfies the
          conditions which are proper to the <i>quod quid</i>: for example, if
          one were to prove that two-footed land animal is the
          <i>quod quid</i> of man, having taken as middle the fact that this
          notion is converted with man and is composed of genus and difference;
          which are the only conditions required for a <i>quod quid</i>.
          Furthermore, this whole, which has been stated, is proper to the
          <i>quod quid</i> because it is the being or reality of it, i.e., of
          that which is <i>quod quid</i>. It is as though he were saying that
          being a convertible notion composed of a genus and difference is
          exactly the same as being the <i>quod quid</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (92a9) he lodges two objections against the above question,
          showing that the <i>quod quid</i> cannot be demonstrated in the way it
          suggests. The first of these is that just as the previously mentioned
          ways of demonstrating failed because they assumed the very thing in
          question, so too in the present instance. For it, too, assumes the
          <i>quod quid erat esse</i>, as for example when it is assumed that
          every convertible notion composed of genus and difference signifies
          the <i>quod quid est</i>; consequently, the proof is not acceptable.
          For one must never take as middle the very thing the demonstration is
          intended to prove; rather it is necessary to demonstrate it through
          some other middle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (92a11) he gives the second reason, which is based on a likeness
          to a syllogism. For when a person syllogizes, he is not required to
          use the definition of syllogism in order to syllogize; because the
          items from which a syllogism proceeds are such that each item is
          either a whole proposition, i.e., a universal or major proposition, or
          a part, i.e., a particular or minor proposition subsumed under the
          major one. Consequently, the definition of a syllogism is not one of
          the things from which a syllogism proceeds. In like manner if someone
          wishes to syllogize the <i>quod quid erat esse</i> of something, he is
          not required to mention what a <i>quod quid erat esse</i> is; but he
          must have this in reserve in his mind over and above the items which
          are put in the definition or in the syllogism. For these notions of a
          syllogism and of a definition function in defining and syllogizing as
          rules of art which an artisan must respect in his works. Now an
          artisan who makes a knife does not do so by establishing the rules
          according to which he works, but in the light of the rules he has in
          his mind he examines whether the knife was made well. So, too, a
          person who syllogizes does not mention the notion of a syllogism as he
          syllogizes, but in view of the notion of a syllogism he examines the
          syllogism he made, in order to see whether it is good.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence if a person should wonder, once a syllogism has been formed,
          whether it syllogized or not, the one who formed the syllogism can
          settle this doubt by showing that it does syllogize, on the ground
          that a syllogism is such and such a thing. So, too, a person who
          intends to syllogize the <i>quod quid erat esse</i> should have
          reserved in his mind the notion of what a
          <i>quod quid erat esse</i> is, so that if someone should say that a
          <i>quod quid erat esse</i> has not been syllogized, he can answer that
          it has, because such and such is put down as the
          <i>quod quid erat esse</i>. Thus, therefore, it is clear that a person
          who syllogizes a <i>quod quid erat esse</i> should not state what a
          syllogism is or what a <i>quod quid erat esse</i> is.
        </p>
        <p>
          The (92a20) he shows that the <i>quod quid</i> of one thing cannot be
          demonstrated from the <i>quod quid</i> of another thing. Concerning
          this he does two things. First, he proposes what he intends. Secondly,
          he proves what he proposes (92a23).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (92a20) that the <i>quod quid</i> is not
          proved, if someone wished to prove it by supposing the
          <i>quod quid</i> of some other thin; for example, if someone were to
          proceed in such a way as to assume that the being or reality of
          divisible and of evil is the same, i.e., that division is the
          <i>quod quid</i> of evil, and then argued in the following manner: “In
          all things which have a contrary the <i>quod quid</i> of one contrary
          is a contrary; but the contrary of good is evil, and of divisible the
          contrary is indivisible: therefore, it follows that indivisible is the
          <i>quod quid</i> of the good.” And these examples are taken according
          to Plato’s opinion that the notion of the one and of the good are the
          same. For we notice that everything seeks unity as its own good. But
          one is the same as indivisible; and so in virtue of the opposition it
          follows that evil is the same as divisible. For everything shuns
          division of the self, because through division it tends to what is
          shattered and imperfect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (92a23) he proves what he has proposed, namely, that the
          <i>quod quid</i> cannot be demonstrated: and this by giving two
          reasons. The first of these is that even according to this method one
          demonstrates by assuming the <i>quod quid erat esse</i>, and thus he
          assumes what he should have proved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (92a24) he gives the second reason, saying that not only is it
          improper to take the <i>quod quid erat esse</i> when demonstrating,
          but this impropriety is compounded when one takes a
          <i>quod quid erat esse</i> to demonstrate a
          <i>quod quid erat esse</i>: because even in demonstrations in which
          this is proved of this, say a proper attribute of a subject, a
          <i>quod quid erat esse</i> is taken as middle; nevertheless the one so
          taken is not the very thing which was to be concluded or something
          which has the same notion and is converted. But good and indivisible,
          and evil and divisible, have the same notion; and each pair is
          converted, because one being posited, the other is posited, and vice
          versa.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (92a28) he presents a common reason against anyone who
          demonstrates from supposition and division. And he says that the same
          opposition is directed against both, namely, against one who tries to
          demonstrate the <i>quod quid</i> by division and against one who
          proceeds by laying down the <i>quod quid</i> in the syllogism. For
          clearly a definition signifies something which is one: hence to
          signify this oneness the items laid down in the definition should be
          arranged without a conjunction; thus one should say that man is a
          two-footed land animal, but not that man is an animal and two-footed.
          Hence if anyone desires to prove the <i>quod quid</i>, he must prove
          that one thing is formed from the things assumed. But it is not
          required, according to the above-cited methods of division and
          supposition, that one predicate be formed from these items which are
          taken for defining: since there might be several, for example, if one
          should state that man is grammatical and musical. It seems therefore
          that according to the ways mentioned above, the <i>quod quid</i> is
          not proved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (92a34) he concludes from the foregoing that there is no way to
          prove the <i>quod quid</i>, saying: if then the
          <i>quod quid</i> cannot be proved either by convertible terms or
          division or opposition, how will the definer be able to demonstrate
          the substance of a thing or the <i>quod quid</i> ? For it is now clear
          from the foregoing that he does not prove it according to the method
          whereby, in virtue of items that are <i>per se</i> known, one
          manifests that something else must follow through things which are
          said-which is required for a demonstration.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, besides these three modes there is a fourth, namely, through
          induction. But it turns out that the <i>quod quid</i> cannot be proved
          by manifest singulars, namely, in such a way that something is
          predicated of all and is not anything that might be otherwise: because
          one who thus proceeds by induction will not demonstrate the
          <i>quod quid</i> but will demonstrate that something is or is not; for
          example, that every man is an animal, or that no animal is a stone.
        </p>
        <p>
          But no other method is available for demonstrating the
          <i>quod quid</i>, save perhaps the method of demonstrating something
          to the senses, as when something is pointed out with the finger. But
          it is obvious that this method cannot be invoked in the present
          instance, because the <i>quod quid</i> is not an object of sense but
          of intellect, as it is stated in <i>On the Soul</i> III. It remains,
          therefore, that there is no way in which the <i>quod quid</i> can be
          demonstrated.<br /></p

        <p>
          After considering each of the ways in which something might be
          demonstrated and showing that none can demonstrate the
          <i>quod quid</i>, the Philosopher now shows what he proposes through
          common reasons. Concerning this he does three things. First, he lays
          down something which is necessary for proving what he proposes.
          Secondly, he shows what he proposes (957). Thirdly, he sums up what
          has been stated (97b35).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (92b3) that there does not seem to be any
          possible way for a person to demonstrate that some <i>quod quid</i> is
          man: and this because whoever knows a <i>quod quid</i> to be of man or
          of any other thing is required to know that the thing exists. For
          since there is no quiddity or essence of a non-being, it is impossible
          to know the <i>quod quid</i> of something which is not; but one might
          know the meaning of the name or have a notion composed of several
          names. Thus a person is capable of knowing the ‘ meaning of the word
          <i>tragelaphus</i> or <i>goat-stag</i>, because it signifies an animal
          composed of goat and stag, but it is impossible to know the
          <i>quod quid</i> of a goat-stag, because there is no such thing given
          in nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (92b7) from what has been established he goes on to prove what he
          proposed. In regard to this he does two things. First, he shows that
          the <i>quod quid</i> cannot be shown by demonstration. Secondly, that
          it cannot be shown by definition (9526).
        </p>
        <p>
          In regard to the first he presents three reasons, the first of which
          (92b7) is the following: just as a definition is brought forward to
          manifest something which is one in the sense that from the parts of
          the definition something is formed which is one <i>per se</i> and not
          one <i>per accidens</i>, so a demonstration which employs a definition
          as its middle must demonstrate something which is one; for the
          conclusion must be proportionate to the middle. Consequently, it is
          clear that one cannot in virtue of one and the same definition
          demonstrate things that are diverse. But the <i>quod quid</i> of man
          is one thing and his being or existence is another—for it is only in
          the First Principle of being, Who is being essentially, that to be and
          quiddity are one and the same; in all other things, which are beings
          by participation, the to be has to be other than the quiddity.
          Therefore, it is not possible to demonstrate both the quid and the
          <i>quia</i> with the same demonstration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (92b11) he presents the second reason and it is this: According
          to a common opinion of wise men, it is necessary that all i.e., the
          whole demonstrated by a demonstration, be the <i>quia</i> est, unless
          perchance someone would want to say that the <i>quia</i> est itself is
          the substance of a thing. However, this is impossible. For the
          <i>to be</i> is not the substance or essence of anything existing in a
          genus; otherwise it would be required that being be a genus, because a
          genus is something predicated in <i>quod quia</i>. But, as it is
          proved in <i>Metaphysics</i> III, being is not a genus. For this
          reason God Who is His own essence is not in a genus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, if the <i>quia</i> est were the substance of any thing,
          then in the same breath that one shows the <i>quia</i> est he would be
          showing the <i>quid est</i>; consequently, the whole which a
          demonstrator manifests would not be the <i>quia</i> est. But this is
          false. Therefore, it is clear that demonstration manifests only the
          <i>quia</i> est, for it demonstrates some enunciation which signifies
          that something is or is not.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is apparent also in the way a science proceeds. For geometry
          assumes what the name triangle signifies, and demonstrates
          <i>quod sit</i>, as when it demonstrates that an equilateral triangle
          has been formed on a given straight line. Therefore, if one
          demonstrated merely <i>what</i> a triangle is apart from the method of
          demonstrating which the sciences employ, he would not be demonstrating
          this whole which is that a triangle exists, but only what I call
          triangle. For just as, owing to the fact that <i>to be</i> is not the
          substance of a thing, one who demonstrates <i>to be</i> demonstrates
          that and nothing more, so if someone demonstrates the <i>quid est</i>,
          that is all he demonstrates. It would follow, therefore, that someone
          who knew the <i>quid est</i> in virtue of a definition would not know
          <i>an est</i> —which is impossible in view of what has been
          established above.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (92b18) he presents the third reason. Now this reason uses
          ordinary definitions as examples to manifest the same fact that was
          concluded in the previous reason, namely, that one who demonstrates
          the <i>quid est</i> is not demonstrating the <i>quia</i> est.
          Wherefore he says that it is clear not only in the light of the
          foregoing but also in view of the modes of terms, i.e., of
          definitions, which are presently in vogue that those who define do not
          manifest the <i>quia</i> est. For example, one who defines a circle as
          something all the lines from whose center to the circumference are
          equal, is still left with the question <i>why</i> there must be such a
          thing as he has defined, i.e., why it is necessary to posit that there
          exists such a thing as was defined; for example, why it is required to
          posit that there is a circle which is defined in the way mentioned.
          For it is acceptable to give a like description of a brass mountain by
          saying, for example, that it is a brass body which is lofty and
          extensive; but the task would still remain to establish whether there
          is such a thing in nature. And this because terms, i.e., defining
          notions, do not state that their counterpart either exists or is
          capable of existing; rather, whenever such a notion is formulated, it
          is legitimate to ask why such a thing should exist. Clearly then, it
          is impossible to demonstrate <i>quid est</i> and <i>quia</i> est
          simultaneously.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (92b26) by leading to something absurd, he shows that the
          <i>quod quid</i> cannot be shown by demonstration. First, therefore,
          he shows what would follow from this. Secondly, he shows that what
          does follow is unacceptable (92b28).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore (92b26) that since a definer might show either the
          <i>quid est</i> or merely what a name signifies, it follows that a
          definition does not necessarily manifest the <i>quod quid</i>, which
          belongs to definition in the proper sense; otherwise, it will follow
          that a definition signifying <i>quod quid</i> is nothing more than a
          statement signifying in the same way that a name does: for the only
          thing that a definition adds to such a notion is that it signifies the
          essence of some thing. Hence, if there is no thing whose essence the
          definition signifies, it will be no different from a statement
          explaining the signification of some name.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (92b28) he shows that it is unacceptable for a definition to be
          nothing more than a statement explaining the signification of a name:
          and this for three reasons. The first of these is that it happens that
          even things which are neither substances nor beings in a universal
          sense can be signified by a name. Now a name can be explained by some
          interpretation. Consequently, if a definition were nothing more than a
          statement interpreting a name, it would follow that a definition could
          be given of non-substances and of things that do not exist at all. But
          this is clearly false, for as 4t is shown in <i>Metaphysics</i> VII,
          definition bears principally on substance and on other things insofar
          as they are related to substance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (92b30) he gives the second reason and it is this: To any notion,
          i.e., to any statement signifying something, it is possible to apply a
          corresponding name which is explained by that notion. Therefore, if a
          definition is nothing more than a notion explaining a name, it would
          follow that all notions were definitions. As a consequence, it would
          follow that when we dispute or converse with anyone, the disputations
          or our discussions are definitions; similarly, it would follow that
          the Iliad, i.e., Homer’s poem about the Trojan War, is a definition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (92b32) he gives the third reason and it is this: No science
          demonstrates that a given name signifies a given thing. For names are
          arbitrary i signs; hence they must be used according to the will of
          the one inventing them. But it is obvious that definitions are given
          in every science. Therefore, it is obvious that definitions do not
          signify this, i.e., a mere interpretation of a name.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (92b35) he sums up what has been so far discussed disputatively.
          And he says that from the foregoing it is seen to follow that
          definition and syllogism are neither the same nor concerned with the
          same; and furthermore that a definition demonstrates nothing, since it
          is not concerned with the same thing as a demonstration. In like
          manner, it seems to have been shown that it is not possible to know
          <i>quod quid</i> either by a definition or a demonstration, bcause a
          definition merely shows the what and a demonstration the <i>quia</i>.
          But to know the <i>quod quid</i> a knowledge of <i>quia</i> est is
          required, as has been shown.<br /></p

        </p>
        <p>
          After inquiring disputatively how the definition and the
          <i>quod quid</i> are known, the Philosopher here determines the truth.
          First, he states what his intention is. Secondly, he carries out what
          he proposes (93a4). Thirdly, he summarizes (94a13) [end of L. 8].
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (93a1) that after the disputative process we
          must once more consider, but this time by establishing the truth, how
          much of the foregoing has been well stated and how much not well
          stated: and this both in regard to definition, by considering what a
          definition is, and in regard to <i>quod quid</i>, by considering
          whether it might somehow or other be manifested through a definition
          or a demonstration or not at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (93a4) he carries out what he has proposed. First, in regard to
          the <i>quod quid</i>. Secondly, in regard to definition which is a
          statement signifying it (93b28). Concerning the first he sets down two
          methods of manifesting the <i>quod quid</i>. First, the method of
          logical proof. Secondly, the method of demonstrative proof (93a16).
        </p>
        <p>
          Regarding the first he reviews first of all (93a4) that which was
          established above, namely, that it is the same thing to know
          <i>quid est</i> and to know the cause involved in the question an est,
          just as it is the same thing to know <i>propter quid</i> and to know
          the cause involved in the question <i>quia</i> est. The reason for
          this, i.e., for the fact that it is the same thing to know the
          <i>quid est</i> and the cause involved in the si est, is that there
          must be some cause of the fact that a thing exists, for something is
          referred to as caused by reason of the fact that it has a cause of its
          existing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the cause of existing is either the same, i.e., the same as the
          essence of a thing, or something not the same: the same, indeed, as
          matter and form, which are parts of the essence; not the same, as
          agent and end, which two causes are somehow the cause of the form and
          matter, for the agent acts for an end and unites the form to the
          matter. And if we consider the cause which is other than the essence
          of a thing, sometimes it is such a cause that a demonstration can be
          formed in virtue of it, and sometimes not. For the effect does not
          follow of necessity from every efficient cause; but from the
          supposition of the end it follows that what is required for the end
          also exists, as is proved in <i>Physics</i> II.
        </p>
        <p>
          So let us suppose that an effect exists which has as its cause not
          only the essence of the thing but also another cause such that
          something can be demonstrated through it; for example, we might say
          that if a man has attained happiness, it is necessary that virtue
          pre-exist. Now let us assume that the essence of virtue is a habit
          which operates according to right reason. Therefore, it can be
          demonstrated that there is a habit which operates according to right
          reason, if there is a habit conducive to happiness. Let that other
          cause, therefore, which is demonstrative, be taken as the middle, and
          let a syllogism be formed in the first figure (which must be done,
          because the <i>quod quid</i> must be universally and affirmatively
          predicated of the thing of which it is the <i>quod quid</i>): the
          syllogism then will be: “Every habit conducive to happiness is a habit
          operating according to right reason; but virtue is such a habit:
          therefore... He concludes, therefore, that this method which is now
          being examined is one method of showing the <i>quod quid</i> through
          something else which is a cause. And this method is evidently
          suitable, because, as was established above, it is necessary that the
          middle taken for proving <i>quod quid</i> be the <i>quid est</i>; and
          similarly that the middle taken for proving properties be something
          proper.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there is the further consideration that since the
          <i>quid est</i> is the cause of the very being of the thing, then
          according to the diverse causes of one thing, there are various ways
          of assigning the <i>quod quid</i> of the same thing. For example, the
          <i>quod quid</i> of house can be formulated in terms of its material
          cause, so that we might say that it is something composed of wood and
          stones; and also in terms of the final cause, namely, that it is an
          artifact constructed for habitation. Thus, therefore, it will occur
          that since there are several <i>quod quid</i> ’s of the same thing,
          one of them will be demonstrated and another not demonstrated but
          supposed. Hence it does not follow that there is a begging of the
          question, because one <i>quod quid</i> is supposed and the other
          proved. Nor is this a method proving the
          <i>quod quid</i> demonstratively, but of syllogizing it logically,
          because by this method it is not sufficiently proved that what is
          concluded is the <i>quod quid</i> of the thing of which it is
          concluded, but merely that it is in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (93a16) he shows how by demonstration the <i>quod quid</i> can be
          achieved. Regarding this he does two things. First, he shows how the
          <i>quod quid</i> can be manifested in certain instances through
          demonstration. Secondly, he shows that it is not so in all cases
          (93b22) [L. 8]. Concerning the first he does three things. First, he
          lays down certain things needed for showing what he proposes.
          Secondly, he manifests what he has proposed (93a28). Thirdly, he
          summarizes (93b15).
        </p>
        <p>
          With respect to the first (93a16) he lays down three things. The first
          of these is a comparison between the <i>quod quid</i> and the
          <i>propter quid</i>. He says, therefore, that in order to show how it
          occurs that the <i>quod quid</i> can be achieved through
          demonstration, we must start once more from the beginning.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first thing to be considered is the fact that a person may be in
          either of two states as regards knowledge of the <i>propter quid</i>.
          For sometimes we have the <i>quia</i> in our knowledge and are still
          seeking the <i>propter quid</i>; and sometimes both are manifest to us
          at one time. A third case is impossible, namely, that one know the
          <i>propter quid</i> of something before the <i>quia</i>. And the same
          holds for the <i>quod quid erat esse</i>: sometimes we know a thing to
          be without perfectly knowing the quid sit; sometimes we know both at
          once. Again, a third case is impossible, namely, to know
          <i>quid est</i> without knowing if it is.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (32a21) he lays down the second preliminary remark, saying that
          there are two ways in which we might know something to be without
          perfectly knowing the <i>quid est</i>: in one way, insofar as we might
          know one of its accidents, as for example, when by the speed of its
          motion we judge that something is a hare; in another way, by knowing
          something of its essence. This of course is possible in the case of a
          composite substance, as when we comprehend something to be a man in
          virtue of the fact that it is rational, without yet knowing the other
          items which complete the essence of man. However, in simple substances
          this does not occur, because one cannot know anything concerning the
          substance of a simple thing without knowing the entire essence, as is
          clear from <i>Metaphysics</i> IX.
        </p>
        <p>
          At any rate, a person who knows some thing to be must know it through
          something of that thing, namely, something outside the essence of the
          thing or something pertaining to its essence. And he clarifies this
          with the example of knowing thunder to be, because we perceive a sound
          in the clouds—which of course pertains to the essence of thunder,
          albeit not the entire essence, because not every sound in the clouds
          is thunder—or of knowing a defect, i.e., an eclipse, of the sun or
          moon to be, because there is a failure of light-although not every
          failure of light is an eclipse. And the same applies if someone
          perceives a man to be, because there is an animal; or a soul to be,
          because something is moving itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (93a24) he sets forth the third preliminary remark, saying that
          those things which we know to exist through some accident belonging to
          them are such that there is no correlation between this knowledge and
          knowledge of their <i>quid est</i>, because in virtue of such
          accidents we do not even truly know that they are. We do of course
          know these accidents to be theirs, but because the accidents are not
          the things themselves, we do not thereby know that the things
          themselves exist. Moreover, it is fruitless to seek the
          <i>quid est</i> if one does not know <i>quia</i> est; but those things
          which we know to exist through something of their own can be more
          easily known by us as to what they are. Hence it is plain that as we
          are in regard to knowing that something is, so we are in regard to
          knowing what it is.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (93a28) in the light of the foregoing he manifests what he
          proposed. And he says that in regard to a thing which we know exists
          because we know something of its essence, let us consider the
          following example in which A, the major extreme, is <i>defect</i>,
          i.e., eclipse; and in which C, the minor extreme, is <i>moon</i>; and
          <i>interposition of the earth between sun and moon</i> is B, the
          middle. In this case, therefore, to ask whether the moon is eclipsed
          or not is the same as to ask whether B exists or not; but to ask
          whether B exists or not is to ask if there is some reason for that
          eclipse. For B, i.e., the interposition of the earth, is the reason
          for the moon’s eclipse; and if there is an interposition of the earth
          we say that the other exists, i.e., the eclipse of the moon. Or,
          similarly, if we should seek the reason for one side of a
          contradiction, i.e., does it lie in having or in not having two right
          angles.
        </p>
        <p>
          But when we find that what we seek exists, for example, that there is
          an eclipse, then we know the <i>quia</i> and the
          <i>propter quid</i> together, if what is sought is found through an
          appropriate middle which is the cause; and if not, but it is found
          through something extrinsic, we will know the <i>quia</i> ‘and not the
          <i>propter quid</i>. For example, let the moon be C and the eclipse A,
          and let us take as middle, i.e., B, the fact that the moon, although
          it is full, is now unable to cause a shadow when we put an object
          between it and us. For the moon, whenever it is not eclipsed, causes a
          shadow if some body is interposed; yet the fact that it is now unable
          to cause a shadow is not the cause of the eclipse, but rather its
          effect. Therefore, if B be predicated of C (i.e., that the moon is now
          unable to produce a shadow of an object which is interposed), and if
          moreover A is true of that middle (i.e., if we assume that whenever
          this happens, the moon is eclipsed), it will be plain that the moon is
          eclipsed. But it will not yet be clear why the moon is eclipsed.
          Similarly, we will know that there is an eclipse but not know what an
          eclipse is, when we know that A is in Q i.e., that the moon is
          eclipsed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now just as in this example neither the <i>propter quid</i> nor the
          <i>quid</i> is known, so to inquire why [i.e., <i>propter quid</i> ]
          something is, is the same as to inquire [ <i>quid</i> ], i.e., what it
          is. Thus, if we should ask <i>propter quid</i>, i.e., why the moon is
          eclipsed, namely, is it because the earth is between the sun and moon,
          or because the moon has turned, i.e., because the dark side of the
          moon has been turned toward us, as some say, or even because the light
          of the moon has been extinguished in something moist: to ask whether
          it is due to any of these causes that the moon is eclipsed is nothing
          more than to ask whether the eclipse of the moon consists in the
          interposition of the earth, or the turning of the moon, or the
          extinction of its light. And this middle is the reason of the other
          extreme: thus, in the foregoing example, it is the reason for A which
          is the major extreme, because the eclipse of the moon is nothing more
          than the moon’s light being blocked by the earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          He gives a further example, namely, inquiring what is thunder.
          According to the opinion of Anaxagoras and Empedocles it is the
          quenching of fire in a cloud; although according to his own opinion in
          <i>Meteorology</i> II, thunder is caused by a dry exhalation in a cold
          environment beating against a cloud. But he frequently uses the
          opinions of others in his examples. So, if according to the
          above-mentioned opinion, one should ask why it thunders, the answer
          might be given that it is because fire is being quenched in a cloud.
          Therefore, let the cloud be C, the minor extreme, and thunder A, the
          major extreme, and the quenching of fire B, the middle. Then we may
          syllogize in the following manner: “In C is B, i.e., in the cloud is a
          quenching of fire; but every quenching of fire is a sound: therefore
          in the cloud is a sound of thunder.” And thus it is clear that to
          arrive at the <i>propter quid</i> through demonstration, we take the,
          <i>quid est</i>, because the very middle which shows the
          <i>propter quid</i> is a statement defining the first term, i.e.,
          defining the major extreme. But if we had to take some other middle to
          demonstrate this, it would be taken from the remaining statements,
          i.e., from the definition of the minor extreme and of other extrinsic
          causes. For since the subject is the cause of its proper attribute, it
          is required that the definition of the proper attribute be
          demonstrated by the definition of the subject. And this is clear in
          the other example; for since the moon is a body fixed by nature to
          move in such and such a way, it is necessary that at some time the
          earth be interposed between it and the sun.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (93b15) he sums up what has been said, saying that we have shown
          how the <i>quod quid</i> is taken and made known, namely, by taking
          the <i>propter quid</i>. We have also said that there is neither
          syllogism nor demonstration of the <i>quid est</i> in the sense of
          properly syllogizing or demonstrating the <i>quod quid</i>, although
          the <i>quod quid</i> is manifested by syllogism and demonstration,
          insofar as the middle in a <i>propter quid</i> demonstration is the
          <i>quod quid</i>. Hence, it is clear that a <i>quod quid</i> having
          another cause cannot be known without a demonstration, but the
          demonstration is nevertheless not of the <i>quod quid</i>, as was
          proved in the objections. And according to this the above objections
          are true.<br /></p

            has therefore</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          After showing that in some instances the <i>quod quid</i> is acquired
          through demonstration, the Philosopher now shows that this is not
          possible in all. And in order to show this he repeats (93b22) that of
          some things there is a cause other than the thing, but of other things
          not. Therefore, because the <i>quod quid</i> is acquired by a
          demonstration whose middle is a cause, it is manifest that there are
          certain things whose <i>quod quid</i> must be taken as an immediate
          principle, in the sense that one must suppose both the to be and the
          quid of that thing, or manifest it by some means other than
          demonstration, say by an effect or by a likeness or some other way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here it should be noted that his statement that some things have a
          cause not distinct from themselves can be understood in three ways. In
          one way, it means that it simply and absolutely has not a cause of its
          being. And this is proper to the First Principle alone, which is the
          cause of the being and truth of all things. For there is nothing to
          prevent even things which exist of necessity from having some cause of
          their necessity, as is stated in <i>Metaphysics</i> V. And therefore,
          although the Philosopher is speaking in the plural here, his words
          should not be taken to mean that there are several things which have
          no cause of their being.
        </p>
        <p>
          In another way it can be understood as referring to the order of the
          causes of one thing. For it is clear that in things which have four
          causes, one cause is somehow the cause of another one. For since
          matter is fot the sake of form and not vice versa, as is proved in
          <i>Physics</i> II, a definition which is based on the formal cause is
          the cause of the definition which is taken from the material cause of
          the same thing. And because the thing produced obtains a form in
          virtue of the action of the generator, it follows that the agent is
          somehow the cause of the form, and the definition the cause of the
          defined. Furthermore, every efficient cause acts for an end; hence,
          too, the definition taken from the end is somehow the cause of the
          definition which is taken from the efficient cause. Beyond this it is
          impossible to go in the genera of causes: hence the dictum that the
          end is the cause of the causes. Yet in the individual genera of causes
          one can proceed from the subsequent to the prior; but definitions
          should be given through proximate causes.
        </p>
        <p>
          And according to this interpretation we find it stated in certain
          books that definitions which are made in terms of the species have no
          middle by which they might be demonstrated: but that definitions made
          in terms of matter can have a middle, in the sense that definitions
          which are given according to the material cause, can be demonstrated
          by those which are given according to the formal cause. But a
          definition which is given according to formal cause cannot be further
          demonstrated by an intrinsic principle of the thing which belongs in a
          proper way to the <i>quod quid</i> as entering into the essence of the
          thing. But if it were to be demonstrated by the efficient and final
          cause, one would have to say that a higher cause is related as formal
          to the lower. However, these words are not present in the Greek
          version; hence they seem to be a Gloss introduced into the text by a
          copyist’s error.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly, they could be understood in the sense that there are some
          things which do not have a cause in the generic subject of some
          science; as in the genus of number, with which arithmetic is concerned
          one arrives at unity, which has no principle in this genus. And this
          sense concurs with the example which the Philosopher adds when he
          states that the arithmetician accepts what unity is and that it is.
          And just as in the case of things that do not have something else as
          cause, so too in the case of things which can have a middle and whose
          cause is something else, their <i>quod quid</i> can be manifested; in
          such a way, however, that the <i>quod quid</i> is not demonstrated,
          but rather that the middle of demonstration is taken as
          <i>quod quid</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (93b28) having shown how the <i>quod quid</i> is related to
          demonstration, he shows how definition is related to demonstration.
          Concerning this he does two things. First, he shows how a definition
          is related to demonstration. Secondly, he uses an example to manifest
          what he has stated (94a2). In regard to the first he does three
          things. First, he lays down one type of definition which signifies
          <i>quid est</i>. Secondly, another type which signifies
          <i>propter quid</i> (93b38). Thirdly, he shows how each of these
          definitions is related to demonstration (93b39).
        </p>
        <p>
          In regard to the first he supposes first of all (93b28) that
          definition is a statement signifying the <i>quod quid</i>. But if no
          other notion could be had of a thing except the definition, it would
          be impossible for us to know that some thing is, without knowing the
          <i>quid est</i> of it; because it is impossible for us to know that a
          thing is except in virtue of some notion of that thing. For in regard
          to a thing completely unknown to us, we cannot know if it is or not.
          But we do find some other notion of a thing besides the definition,
          namely, a notion which explains the signification of a name, or a
          notion of the very thing named; which notion, however, is distinct
          from the definition, because it does not signify the
          <i>quid est</i> as does a definition, but perhaps some accident. Thus
          one might find some notion which explains what the word triangle
          means. Then having the <i>quia</i> est in virtue of this notion, we
          would seek the <i>propter quid</i> in order that we might thereby
          arrive at the <i>quod quid</i>. But, as stated above, it is difficult
          to arrive at this in the case of things whose existence we do not
          know. Furthermore, the cause of this difficulty was mentioned above,
          namely, because when we do not know a thing to be by means of
          something of that thing, we do not know absolutely if it is or is not,
          but only according to an accident, as was explained above.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then in order to distinguish the notion signifying the
          <i>quid est</i> from the other notions, he adds that there are two
          ways in which a notion can be said to be one. For some are one by
          junction only: in this way even the <i>Iliad</i>, i.e., the poem of
          the history of Troy, possesses a unity. And this is the way the notion
          which explains a name or describes the thing named through its
          accidents is one, as when it is stated that man is a risible animal
          capable of discipline. But a notion is also one insofar as it simply
          signifies one thing about one thing of which it is the notion, and
          this not in virtue of some accident. And such a notion is the
          definition signifying <i>quid est</i>, because the essence of anything
          is one. Thus, therefore, he concludes that what has been said, namely,
          that a definition is a notion of the <i>quod quid</i>, is one
          definition of a definition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (93b38) he lays down another type of definition, saying that
          another definition of definition is that it is a notion manifesting
          the <i>propter quid</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (93b39) he shows how each of these definitions is related to
          demonstration, concluding from the foregoing that the first definition
          merely signifies, but does not demonstrate the <i>quod quid</i>;
          whereas the second definition is, as it were, the definition of the
          <i>quod quid</i> and differs from a demonstration by position alone,
          i.e., in the ordering of the terms and propositions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (94a2) he uses examples to manifest what he had said. In regard
          to this he does two things. First, he shows by examples what has been
          said. Secondly, from the foregoing he gathers the various kinds of
          definition (940).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore (94a2) that it is one thing to say <i>why</i> it
          thunders and another what thunder is: because according to the opinion
          of those who state that the quenching of fire in a cloud is the cause
          of thunder, one is giving the <i>propter quid</i> when he asserts
          thunder to be due to the fact that fire is quenched in a cloud;
          whereas one who asserts that thunder is the sound of fire being
          quenched in a cloud is stating what thunder is.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now each of these signifies the same notion but not in the same way.
          For when one states that it thunders because fire is being quenched in
          a cloud, the notion is signified after the manner of a continuous
          demonstration, i.e., not broken down into explicit propositions; yet
          all the terms of a demonstration are continually being taken. But when
          it is asserted that thunder is the sound of fire being quenched in the
          clouds, the notion is signified after the manner of a definition. But
          if we were to say that thunder is the sound in the clouds, no mention
          being made of the quenching of fire, it will be a definition
          signifying <i>quid est</i>, and will be merely the conclusion of a
          demonstration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (94a9) he gathers together from the foregoing how many modes of
          definition there are insofar as they are relevant to demonstration.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, he repeats something previously stated, namely, that in the
          case of things which do not have a cause, their definitions are to be
          taken as immediate principles. Hence he says here that the definition
          of “immediate things,” i.e., of things not having causes, is as an
          indemonstrable positing of the <i>quod quid</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          From this, therefore, he concludes that there is a threefold genus of
          definition when considered relative to demonstration. For there is one
          definition which is an indemonstrable notion of a thing’s
          <i>quod quid</i>: this is the one which he said concerns immediate
          things. Another definition is that which is, as it were, a
          demonstrative syllogism of a thing’s <i>quod quid</i> and differs from
          a demonstration merely by structure, i.e., by a different acceptance
          and position of the phrasing, as when it is stated that thunder is the
          sound of fire being quenched in the clouds. The third is the
          definition which only signifies <i>quod quid</i> and is the conclusion
          of a demonstration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (94a13) he summarizes what has been said, declaring that it is
          plain from the foregoing in what way there is demonstration of the
          <i>quod quid</i> and in what way not; namely, that the
          <i>quod quid</i> can be taken from a demonstration but cannot be
          demonstrated. The things have also been pointed out in which there can
          be demonstration of the <i>quod quid</i> according to the manner
          indicated (namely, in things having a cause) and those in which there
          cannot be (namely, in things not having a cause). It has also been
          indicated in how many ways definition is said to be: namely, that some
          signify <i>quod quid</i>, and others even the <i>propter quid</i>. It
          has also been stated how <i>quod quid</i> is demonstrated, namely, so
          far forth as this is signified by a definition which signifies only
          <i>quod quid</i>; and how it is not demonstrated, namely, insofar as
          in virtue of the definition not only the quid but also the
          <i>propter quid</i> are taken. It has also been pointed out how
          definition is related in various ways to demonstration; and how it
          comes about that there is demonstration of the definition of a same
          thing, and how this does not come about.<br /></p

        </p>
        <p>
          After showing how the <i>quid est</i> functions relative to
          demonstration, the Philosopher now shows how the <i>propter quid</i>,
          which signifies the cause, functions relative to demonstration. In
          regard to this he does two things. First, he shows how causes are
          taken in a demonstration. Secondly, how diversely in diverse things
          (95a10) [L. 10]. Concerning the first he does two things. First, he
          proposes what he intends. Secondly, he manifests what he has proposed
          (94a24).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (94a20) that, as was established in the first
          book, because we think we know in a scientific manner when we know the
          cause, and a demonstration is a syllogism causing us to know in a
          scientific manner, the consequence is that the middle of a
          demonstration is a cause.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there are four genera of causes as is more fully explained in
          <i>Physics</i> II and <i>Metaphysics</i> V. One of these is the
          <i>quod quid erat esse</i>, i.e., the formal cause, which is the
          completeness of a thing’s essence. Another is the cause which, if
          placed, the caused must also be placed: this is the material cause,
          because things which follow on the necessity of matter are necessary
          absolutely, as is established in <i>Physics</i> II. The third is the
          cause which is the source of motion, i.e., the efficient cause. But
          the fourth is that for the sake of which something is performed,
          namely, the final cause. And so it is clear that through the middle in
          a demonstration all these causes are manifested, because each of these
          causes can be taken as the middle of a demonstration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (94a24) he manifests what he had said. In regard to this he does
          two things. First, he shows how the various causes are taken as
          middles of demonstration in various things. Secondly, he shows how
          there can be various causes of the same thing (94b27). Concerning the
          first he does four things. First, he shows how the material cause is
          taken in demonstration. Secondly, he manifests his point in regard to
          the formal cause (94a35). Thirdly, he does the same in regard to the
          efficient cause (94a36). Fourthly, in regard to the final cause
          (94b8). Regarding the first he does two things. First, he sets forth
          the way in which the material cause is taken in a demonstration; a
          way, namely, that applies also to the other causes. Secondly, he
          presents an example (94a28).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (94a24) that that which once it exists,
          something else must also exist, namely, a material cause, is not to be
          so taken that something follows of necessity if one proposition alone
          is taken; rather, one must take at least two which are so related that
          they communicate in one middle. Therefore, if one middle which is the
          material cause be taken in two propositions, a conclusion follows of
          necessity; as if we were to say: “Everything composed of contraries is
          corruptible; but a stone is such: therefore, a stone is corruptible.”
          Now it is required that two propositions be taken, not only because
          the syllogistic form demands it, but also because not all things which
          are from matter have necessity from the matter, as is proved in
          <i>Physics</i> II. And therefore, besides the proposition in which it
          is stated that this has matter, another must be taken which declares
          that from such matter something follows of necessity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (94a28) he presents an example from mathematics. Now this does
          not conflict with the statement in <i>Metaphysics</i> III that
          mathematical sciences do not demonstrate through material cause: for
          although mathematics abstracts from sensible matter, yet not from
          intelligible matter, as it is stated in <i>Metaphysics</i> VI. This
          matter is considered intelligible precisely insofar as something
          divisible is taken in numbers or in continua. Therefore, in
          mathematics whenever something is demonstrated of a whole through the
          parts, it seems to be a demonstration through material cause: for the
          parts are compared to the whole according to the notion of matter, as
          is stated in <i>Physics</i> II. And because matter is more
        </p>
        <p>
          properly said of sensible things, he preferred not to name it material
          cause, but a cause of necessity.
        </p>
        <p>
          To understand the example in the text it should be noted that every
          angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle, as is proved in
          <i>Euclid</i> III in the following way: Given a semicircle ABC such
          that its chord, namely, the diameter of the whole circle, is cut in
          half at the point D which is the center of the circle. From this point
          D draw a perpendicular line which touches the circumference of the
          circle at point B,
        </p>
        <p>
          from which are drawn two lines, one to point A and one to point C. He
          says, therefore, that angle ABC which falls within the semicircle is a
          right angle. And the proof is this: Triangle BDC has three angles
          equal to two right angles; but its angle BDC is a right angle, because
          BD is perpendicular to DC. Therefore, its other two angles, namely,
          DBC and BCD are equal to one right angle. But these two angles are
          equal, because the lines BD and DC are equal; since they proceed from
          the center to the circumference. It follows therefore that angle DBC
          equals one half a right angle. In the same way it is proved that angle
          ABD equals one half a right angle. Therefore, the entire angle ABC is
          a right angle.
        </p>
        <p>
          This, proof, therefore, the Philosopher uses here, saying that in this
          way is shown why “that is right which falls in a semicircle,” i.e.,
          why the angle which falls in a semicircle is a right angle, when that
          is given which, when it exists, it follows that it is a “right.”
          Therefore let <i>right angle</i> be A, the major extreme;
          <i>the half of two right angles</i>, the middle, be B; and
          <i>angle falling in a semicircle</i>, the minor extreme, be C. Now the
          cause of A’s being in C, i.e., of the angle in the semicircle’s being
          right is B, namely, that the angle of a semicircle is half of two
          right angles. For this half is by conversion equal to A; in like
          manner, C is equal to B For B consists in being the half of two right
          angles. Therefore, since this is the case, it is necessary that A be
          in C, which is nothing else than for the angle of a semicircle to be
          right. He further adds that this method of demonstration can also
          pertain to the formal cause (which he called
          <i>quod quid erat esse</i>) on the ground that being half of two right
          angles can be taken as an expression signifying the
          <i>quod quid</i> of a right angle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (94a35) he returns to what has been previously established and
          states that it was shown there how the formal cause which is the
          <i>quod quid erat esse</i> pertains to the middle of demonstration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (94a36) he gives an example of the movent cause, touching on an
          event from the history of the Greeks, namely, that the Athenians,
          allying themselves with certain other Greeks, once invaded the
          Sardians who were subject to the king of the Medes; and for that
          reason the Medes invaded the Athenians. He says, therefore, that one
          might ask <i>propter quid</i> [i.e., why] the war of the Medes with
          the Athenians occurred; and this <i>propter quid</i> would be the
          cause why the Athenians were attacked by the Medes, namely, because
          the former along with certain allies, namely, the Eretrians, made an
          assault upon the Sardians: for this was the first motive of the war.
          Therefore, let <i>war</i> be the major extreme, A, and
          <i>the first to attack</i> be the middle, B, but <i>Athenians</i>, the
          minor extreme, C. Therefore B is in C, so far forth namely as it
          belongs to the Athenians that they were the first to make an assault.
          But A is in B, because namely the ones who were first to work an
          injustice were in turn warred upon. Thus, therefore, A is in B,
          inasmuch as they were attacked who first launched the war. But this,
          namely, B, which is the middle, pertains to the Athenians who first
          began the war. And thus it is clear that in this example the cause
          which first moved is taken as middle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (94b8) he manifests the same thing in the final cause. Concerning
          this he does two things. First, he sets forth an example in final
          cause. Secondly, he shows the difference between the final cause and
          the cause which is the source of motion (94b23).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (94b8) that it happens in like manner in all
          cases where the cause taken is the end for the sake of which something
          is done: for example, if we should state <i>propter quid</i> [i.e.,
          for what purpose] someone walks after dinner, namely, to be made
          healthy; and again <i>propter quid</i> [i.e., for what] does a house
          exist, namely, so that the vessels, i.e., a man’s belongings, may be
          kept safe. Thus, therefore, this, namely, walking after dinner is done
          for the sake of health; this other, namely, the building of a house is
          for the sake of keeping belongings safe. Thus, there is no difference
          in saying <i>propter quid</i> [i.e., for what purpose] one should walk
          after dinner and that for the sake of which this is necessary. So
          <i>let walk after dinner</i> be C, the minor extreme; but
          <i>food not to rise to the entrance of the stomach</i> be B, the
          middle; and <i>be made healthy</i> be A, the major extreme. Hence let
          B be in C, because walking after dinner brings it about that food does
          not rise to the entrance of the stomach; and for this reason one is
          made healthy, which is for A to be in B. For it is seen that to C
          which is walk belongs B, which is that food does not rise to the
          entrance of the stomach. From this follows A, which is to be made
          healthy. Thus, therefore, it is clear that B, namely, that the food
          does not rise to the entrance of the stomach is the cause why C is A,
          i.e., why walking after dinner is healthful: and this, namely, that
          foods do not rise to the entrance of the stomach is involved in the
          notion of being kept healthy. For A, i.e., to be healthful, will be
          thus explained, i.e., made known. But the fact that B is in C is
          <i>propter quid</i>, namely, because to be healthy consists in being
          in such a state that foods do not rise to the opening of the stomach.
          And in order that each of these be better understood one should
          arrange the reasons, so that the middle will be taken as the reason of
          the major extreme, as appears in the above example.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (94b23) he shows how the situation is otherwise in the cause
          which is the principle of motion. For in the order of generation the
          final cause and the cause which is the principle of motion behave in
          contrary ways. For there, namely, in the demonstration which is based
          on the cause which is the principle of motion, the middle must
          eventuate first, i.e., be first in the order of generation, just as
          the Athenians assaulted the Sardians before being attacked by the
          Medes. But here, in the demonstration which is based on final cause,
          the first to be taken in the order of generation is C, which is the
          minor extreme; and the last, the effect of the final cause. But in the
          way of generation the last thing is the end for the sake of which
          something is done. For it is obvious that one first of all walks after
          dinner, and on that follows the fact that foods do not rise to the
          entrance of the stomach, upon which further follows the man’s health
          which is the chief end.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (94b27) he shows how for the same effect several of the aforesaid
          causes can be taken. In regard to this he does two things. First, he
          manifests that there are several causes of a same thing. Secondly, he
          shows the cases in which this is applicable (94b35).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (94b27), that it happens that one and the same
          effect exists because of an end or for its sake, and also from the
          necessity of some prior cause: thus, the fact that light appears
          through the skin of a lantern comes about of necessity; for it is
          necessary that a tiny body pass through pores that are larger. Now
          this is said according to the opinion of those who posit light as a
          subtle body, and the appearance of light through a transparency as
          occurring because of the size of the pores which are regarded as
          openings. But a subtle body seems to be comprised of tiny parts. And
          because this is not according to his own opinion, he adds that this
          arises from that sort of necessity, namely, if light does appear by
          passing through, i.e., by the passing of its parts through the pores
          of the transparency. But the appearing of light through the skin of a
          lantern occurs for some end, namely, in order that with the help of
          the light we might walk at night without stumbling.
        </p>
        <p>
          In such cases, therefore, it is possible to argue in two ways: in one
          way from a pre-existing cause, as when we say that if this occurs then
          this other will occur; for example, if a light is set in a lantern, it
          follows that it will be diffused through the pores of the skin. In
          another way from a posterior cause which is posterior in the order of
          becoming. According to this, one will argue that if some ultimate end
          comes to pass, it is required that those items precede through which
          the end is attained, as is clear in thunder; which if it is quenched
          fire, it is necessary that it hiss, i.e., make the sound and roar of
          fire being quenched. And if the opinion of the Pythagoreans is true
          that thunder takes place to strike terror into the denizens of
          Tartarus, then one should say that thunder takes place to the end that
          the men in Tartarus shudder.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (94b35) he shows in which things this occurs that has been said.
          In regard to this he does three things. First, he shows how this is in
          regard to things which are from nature. Secondly, with things that are
          done intentionally (95a3). Thirdly, he draws a corollary (954).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (9035), that very many of these, namely, which
          are from necessity and are done for an end, are found chiefly in
          things which subsist by nature and in things which are constructed by
          nature. For nature makes certain things, acting for an end, and
          certain things it makes from the necessity of prior causes. This
          latter is twofold: one, according to nature, which is according to the
          condition of the matter; the other, according to movent cause’ as a
          stone is moved by necessity sometimes upwards and sometimes downwards,
          but not on account of the same type of necessity: it is moved downward
          on account of a necessity of nature, but upward on account of a
          necessity of the mover, i.e., of the one casting it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (95a3) he shows how this is in regard to things that proceed from
          intention. And he says that in things that are done through reason (as
          works of art are), some are such that they never occur by chance; for
          example, a house and a statue, and never from the necessity of nature:
          but they are always done for an end, because they are always done by
          reason, which does not act without intending an end.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, there are certain things which can indeed be produced from
          the reasoning of art, but can also come about through fortune: as in
          the case of health, which can sometimes be produced by the art of
          medicine; but because it can occur from a natural cause, it can happen
          that someone be healed not intending it, as if a leper should be
          healed from eating a serpent which he ate to die. The same can happen
          in regard to safety, namely, when a person entering a house for some
          other purpose is saved from the hands of enemies hunting him. And this
          happens mainly in all cases in which something can happen one way or
          another, when it is not due to fortune, i.e., when a same effect might
          happen without fortune from various causes. For example, a person
          might enter a house not by chance in order to be saved from the hand
          of his enemies or to eat or to rest. Hence, if in intending one of
          these something else occurs, it will be from fortune. But a house and
          a statue cannot be produced except by identical causes and therefore
          such things cannot be done by fortune.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (95a7) he concludes from the foregoing that arrival at a good is
          either by nature or by art. For art and nature operate in similar
          fashion for an end, as is stated in <i>Physics</i> II. But what is
          done by fortune is not done of set purpose. He says this because even
          though fortune may be involved in things that are being done for
          something, as it is stated in <i>Physics</i> II, nevertheless that
          which is said to be done by fortune is not intended as an end, but
          happens outside one’s intention.<br /></p

        </p>
        <p>
          After showing how the four genera of causes are used as middles in
          demonstrating, the Philosopher now shows how in different cases
          something is demonstrated through a cause. But there are two
          differences to be noted in this regard: the first difference is
          whether the cause is or is not simultaneous with its effect; the
          second difference is whether the cause produces its effect always or
          only as a general rule—this second difference will be discussed later
          (96a8) [L. 12].
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerning the first he does two things. First, he shows how something
          is proved through a cause which is simultaneous with that of which it
          is the cause. Secondly, how something is demonstrated through a cause
          which is not simultaneous with that of which it is the cause (95a23).
        </p>
        <p>
          In regard to the first point it should be noted that since one is
          involved with the notions of prior and subsequent when he analyzes
          motion, so too in considering the causes of motion one must take into
          account that the cause and the caused are related as prior and
          subsequent. For it is obvious that a natural agent causes its effect
          by moving something. Furthermore, just as the movable object is
          brought to the terminus of its motion by virtue of the entire motion,
          so by virtue 0~1 the first part of that motion it is brought to the
          second part, and so on. Hence, just as the entire motion is the cause
          of the subsequent state of rest, so the first part of the motion is
          the cause of the subsequent part, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          This analysis is true whether we confine ourselves to one object which
          is being moved without interruption from beginning to end, or to
          several objects the first of which moves the second and the second the
          third. And although at the same time that the first mover is moving
          its object that object is being moved, nevertheless the object thus
          moved continues to act as mover even after it stops being moved.
          Consequently, while it is acting as mover, another object is being
          moved. In this way several moveable objects are successively moved in
          such a way that one is the cause of the motion of another, and so on,
          as happens in the case of thrown objects whose motion the Philosopher
          explained in <i>Physics</i> VIII. Therefore, in this example it turns
          out that the cause is not simultaneous with that of which it is the
          cause, namely, inasmuch as the first part of the motion is the cause
          of the second part, or the first moved object moves the second.
        </p>
        <p>
          But although the motion has succession in its parts, it is
          nevertheless simultaneous with its movent cause. For the moveable
          object is moved at the same time that the mover acts, inasmuch as
          motion is nothing else than the act existing in the moveable object
          from the mover, such that in virtue of that act the mover is said to
          move and the object is said to be moved. Indeed, the requirement that
          the cause be simultaneous with what is caused must be fulfilled even
          more in things that are outside of motion whether we take something
          outside of motion to mean the terminus of the motion-as the
          illumination of air is simultaneous with the rising of the sun--or in
          the sense of something absolutely immovable, or in the sense of
          essential causes which are the cause of a thing’s being.
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerning the first point, therefore, he does two things. First, he
          states what he intends to establish. Secondly, he clarifies this with
          examples (95a13).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (95a10) that whenever the cause is
          simultaneous with its effect, it is necessary to take the same cause
          for the coming to be or the “having come to be” or the future
          existence, as is taken for the actual existence: for if the cause is
          simultaneous with that of which it is the cause, then just as it is
          necessary that when the cause exists, the effect be, so it is
          necessary that when the cause is coming to be, the effect be coming to
          be; and when the cause has come to be, the effect should have come to
          be; and when the cause will have been, the effect will have been. Nor
          does it avail to object that when a builder is coming to be—while he
          is learning the art of building—the edifice is not yet being
          constructed: for “builder” does not stand for the cause in act of the
          edifice, but for the cause in potency, or as possessed of the skill.
          But “someone building” denotes the cause in act: it is this cause that
          must be simultaneous with that of which it is the cause, as it is
          stated in <i>Physics</i> II. There is identity in the sense that in
          all these cases the middle is the cause. However, this must be taken
          according to a due proportion, namely, so that the <i>to be</i> of the
          cause corresponds to the <i>to be</i> of the effect, and the coming to
          be of the cause to the coming to be of the effect, and the “having
          come to be” of the cause to the “having come to be” of the effect, and
          the future being of the cause to the future being of the effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (95a13) he clarifies what he had said with two examples, the
          first of which concerns the eclipse of the moon. For we say that there
          was an eclipse of the moon yesterday, because the earth was interposed
          between the sun and the moon yesterday; and that an eclipse of the
          moon is now coming to be, because such an interposition is now coming
          to be; and that tomorrow there will be an eclipse of the moon, because
          the earth will be between then; and that there is now an eclipse of
          the moon, because the earth is now interposed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second example concerns ice. Thus we might state what ice is and
          take as its definition that it is rigidly congealed water. Therefore,
          let C be <i>water</i>, i.e., the minor extreme, and A be
          <i>congealed</i>, i.e., the major extreme, and take B as the middle,
          i.e., <i>that which completely lacks heat</i>. For when that which is
          moist gives off heat it congeals; hence when it intensely gives off
          heat, the moist object becomes very thick and hard. Bringing this into
          syllogistic form, therefore, we shall say that B is in C, namely,
          because ice involves a complete giving up of heat; but A is in B,
          because that which completely lacks heat is congealed. Therefore, just
          as the fact that it has a deficiency of heat is the cause of ice’s
          being water which is completely congealed, so the cause of ice’s
          coming to be is that B is coming to be. And the same holds for having
          come to be and for future coming to be. And so he concludes that if
          the cause and the caused are taken to be simultaneous, it is necessary
          that they be simultaneous in coming to be, in being, in having come to
          be, and in future coming to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (95a23) he shows how a cause which is not simultaneous with its
          effect is taken as the middle of demonstration. First, in things that
          come to be in a direct line. Secondly, in things that come to be
          reciprocally (95b38) [L: 12]. Concerning the first he does three
          things. First, he states the question. Secondly, he interjects
          something that must be known in order to solve the question (95a27).
          Thirdly, he settles the question (95b 1) [L. I I]. In regard to the
          first he does two things. First, he proposes the question. Secondly,
          he elucidates it (95a24).
        </p>
        <p>
          First therefore (95a23) he proposes the question, namely, whether in
          the case of causes which are not simultaneous with what they cause,
          one should say that what is caused follows upon its cause according to
          a continuous temporal succession, or not?
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (95a24) he restates the question more plainly. For we see that
          some causes of things do not exist at the same time as those things:
          thus the cause of a “having come to be” is something prior to it,
          namely, a “coming to be”; and the cause of a “shall have come to be”
          is a “shall be coming to be”; and again the cause of a “coming to be”
          is a previous “has come to be.” Therefore, the question is this: Do
          these causes which follow one upon the other exist in a continuous
          span of time or not? For it is necessary that the demonstrator know
          this, because if there is no continuity in these causes, it will not
          be possible to employ an immediate principle, because between any two
          discontinuous now’s it is always possible to take something
          intermediate. Consequently, if that now during which the effect exists
          is not continuous with that now in which the cause exists, it will be
          possible to find a cause between them, and so on to infinity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (95a27) he explains something that must be understood in order to
          solve this question. First, he proposes what he intends. Secondly, he
          proves what he has proposed (95a32).
        </p>
        <p>
          In regard to the first (95a27) it should be noted that just as a line
          is a continuous thing, but a point is an indivisible which terminates
          and divides the line, so the process of becoming or of being moved is
          something continuous, but the fact of having been moved or having come
          to be is something indivisible which can be taken either as
          terminating an entire motion or as dividing the motion, in the sense
          of being the end of the first part and the beginning of the second
          part of the motion, just as in the case of a point which divides the
          line.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this way, therefore, a “having come to be” is both a cause which
          precedes a “coming to be” of which it is the principle, and an effect
          following the “coming to be” of which it is the terminus. Therefore’
          if we are to demonstrate, the demonstrative syllogism must proceed
          from a subsequent “having come to be” to a previous “coming to be.”
          Thus, we would say: “This has come to be; therefore that was
          previously coming to be.” But because the very “having come to be” is
          the principle of the “coming to be” (or the things that have come to
          be are the cause of those that are coming to be), it follows that the
          former is similarly related to the things that are coming to be,
          namely, that one may syllogize from a subsequent “coming to be” to a
          prior “having come to be,” as though we were to say: “The sun is being
          moved to the midst of the heavens; therefore it was previously moved
          to a point in the east.” But one may not syllogize from what is prior
          to what is later and say, for example, that because this has first
          come to be, it follows that what is later is coming to be or has come
          to be. And what is true of the relationship between coming to be and
          having come to be applies to what shall have come to be and what will
          be coming to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (95a32) he proves what he had said. In regard to this he does two
          things. First, he proves his proposition with a reason based on the
          notion of time considered absolutely. Secondly, with a reason based on
          the time that intervenes between a cause which is prior and an effect
          which is subsequent (95a39).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (95a32) that the reason why one may not
          syllogize from what is prior to what is subsequent is that the prior
          having been posited, it is not necessary that the subsequent follow
          either at some definite time or at some indefinite future time.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, therefore, he manifests this in regard to a definite time, as
          in the case where we might say: “The patient has drunk the medicine;
          therefore he will be cured on such and such a day.” For if one could
          syllogize from a previous fact to something which will occur later at
          a definite time, it would be possible to conclude that because it is
          true to say that this has happened, namely, that the patient has drunk
          the medicine, it will also be true to say that what is subsequent has
          come to pass, namely, that he has been cured. But this does not
          follow: because it is possible to discover some time in which it is
          true to say that he has drunk the medicine but not yet true to say
          that he has been cured, say the time between the taking of the
          medicine and the attainment of the cure.
        </p>
        <p>
          And this is what he says, namely, that the reason why the aforesaid
          conclusion does not follow is because during the interim it is false
          to say that this has taken place, namely, that he has been cured,
          although the other has already taken place, namely, that he has drunk
          the medicine. The same reasoning holds in regard to the future. For we
          cannot condude, “He is now drinking the medicine; therefore he will be
          cured,” referring to some definite time; because this will not be true
          for each subsequent period of time, namely, not in the intervening
          time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly (95a35). he proves the same point in regard to an unspecified
          future time, as when we might say, “He is drinking the medicine;
          therefore he will be cured.” For it does not follow that because this
          has taken place, namely, that he has drunk the medicine, that this
          will be, namely, that he will be cured. For it has already been
          established that a cause which necessarily infers its effect is
          simultaneous with its effect. Furthermore, the middle which is taken
          is homogeneous, i.e., of one genus. For example, to prove that certain
          things have come to be in the past, one takes as the middle and cause
          something which has taken place in tile past; likewise, for things of
          the future, something which is future, and for things that are in the
          process of coming to be, one takes that which is coming to be, and for
          things that exist, one takes that which exists. However, when one
          syllogizes, “This has taken place; therefore this will be,” the middle
          taken is not of one genus, but one middle is prior and the other
          subsequent. Therefore, having posited what is prior, the subsequent
          does not follow of necessity in those cases in which the effect of
          causes can be impeded.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (95a39) he presents another argument which is based on the
          intervening time. And he says that just as on the part of time
          considered absolutely, it is obvious that one may not syllogize from
          what is prior to what is subsequent either according to a specified
          time or according to an unspecified time; so neither on the part of
          the intervening time is it possible to assume a specified or an
          unspecified time in which that which is subsequent can be concluded
          from what is prior. For it has already been established that during
          the entire intervening time it is false to say that the subsequent
          exists, even though that which is prior has already occurred.<br /></p

        </p>
        <p>
          After stating the question whether in things that do not come to be
          simultaneously the subsequent according to temporal continuity follows
          the prior, and after interjecting something necessary, namely, that
          one may not syllogize from what is prior to what is subsequent, the
          Philosopher now undertakes to settle the question he raised.
          Concerning this he does two things. First, he shows how coming to be
          and having come to be are related according to continuity of time.
          Secondly, he proves his proposal (95b12).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (95b1), that in order to prove the proposal it
          is necessary to investigate what it is that joins or forms a
          continuity between a “having come to be” and a “coming to be,” so that
          one might follow the other without interruption.
        </p>
        <p>
          In regard to this he says first of all that it is obvious that a
          “coming to be” is not <i>had</i>, i.e., is not consecutive to a
          “having come to be.” (Those things are said to be consecutive which
          have no member of their genus between them; for example, two soldiers
          in a line or two clerics in their choir stalls. <i>Had</i>, however,
          adds the notion of contact to that which is consequent, as it is
          stated in <i>Physics</i> V). Thus, therefore, he is saying that a
          “coming to be” cannot be consecutive or contiguous to a “having come
          to be.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Then he proves this, because not even a “having come to be” is
          contiguous in the sense of consecutive to any other “having come to
          be”: for two instances of “having come to be” are related in the way
          that two indivisible boundaries of time are related, or as two points
          in a line. Hence just as two points are not consecutive to one
          another, so neither are two instances of “having come to be”: for the
          points and the instances of “having come to be” exist as indivisibles,
          and such things are not consecutive in their continua, as is proved in
          <i>Physics</i> VI. And since two instances of “having come to be” are
          not consecutive, it is therefore obvious that a “coming to be” and a
          “having come to be” are not consecutive. For a “coming to be” is
          something divisible, just as a “being moved” is; but a “having come to
          be” is something indivisible, just as a point is. Therefore, as the
          line is to the point, so the “coming to be” is to the “having come to
          be.” For there is an infinitude of “having come to be’s,” just as
          there is potentially an infinitude of points in a line. And this is
          the cause why it is impossible to take two points that are consecutive
          in a line, namely, because between any two points there is still
          another point to be taken; likewise, between any two “having come to
          be’s” there is another to be taken. Hence two “having come to be’s”
          are not consecutive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, because a “having come to be” is the terminus of a
          “coming to be,” it follows that not even a “coming to be” is
          consecutive to a “having come to be”; otherwise two “having come to
          be’s” would be consecutive. Rather a “coming to be” is terminated
          immediately at a “having come to be,” as a line is terminated at a
          point. This matter is treated at greater length in the analysis of
          motion, i.e., <i>Physics</i> VI.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (95b12) he shows in the light of the foregoing how the effect can
          be taken as being immediate or mediate to the cause in cases where
          they are not simultaneous. First, he proves his proposal. Secondly, he
          elucidates it with examples (95b31). Concerning the first he does two
          things. First, he shows his proposal in regard to the past. Secondly,
          in future things (95b25). Concerning the first he does two things.
          First, he shows his proposal. Secondly, he excludes an objection
          (95b23).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says, therefore first (95b12) that from what has been established
          it is possible to gather how a cause which is taken as a middle in
          demonstration may be consecutive to that which is in the process of
          becoming or of being generated: because even in these demonstrations
          which syllogize about things that are in a “coming to be,” it is
          necessary to admit a middle and a first which are immediate, as when
          we conclude that A has come to be because C has come to be, so long,
          namely, as C has come to be subsequently and A previously. For
          example, if we should say, “He has been cured; therefore he drank the
          medicine”: for the syllogism would not follow if we began with what is
          prior, as we have established above; but C is taken as a principle,
          although it is later in coming to be, owing to the fact that it is
          closer to the present <i>now</i> than A.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the present now is a principle of time because according to it the
          past and future are distinguished; hence it is necessary to take the
          present <i>now</i> as the principle for making known the succession of
          time. For in the realm of the past, something is more subsequent in
          becoming, future. Therefore, just as C is taken as the principle of
          syllogizing, since it is more subsequent in coming to be than A and
          closer to the present <i>now</i>, so we may take D as nearer to the
          present now than C, and conclude that if D has come to be, C came to
          be previously: for example, if he performs the tasks of a healthy man,
          then previous to that he was cured.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, we can conclude that if D has come to pass, it is necessary
          that A have previously come to pass; and we take as cause that which
          was in the interim, namely, C. For D having come to be, it is
          necessary that C previously have come to be; and C having come to be,
          it is necessary that A have previously come to be. Therefore, D having
          come to be, it is necessary that A have previously come to be. For
          example, if this person now accomplishes the tasks of a healthy man,
          it follows that previously he had been cured; and if he has been
          cured, it is necessary that previously he have drunk the medicine.
          Therefore, by always taking a middle in this way, for example,
          something else between C and A, as C was taken as middle between D and
          A, one will come to rest somewhere at something immediate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (95b23) he presents an objection. For someone can say that some
          thing immediate will never be reached, but it will always be necessary
          to take something between two “having come to be’s” on the ground that
          in every instance of coming to be there is an infinitude of “having
          come to be’s,” since one “having come to be” is not consecutive to
          another, as has been said. But he excludes this objection because
          although there is an infinitude of “having come to he’s” in one case
          of coming to be, nevertheless it is necessary to begin at some middle,
          namely, from a <i>now</i> as from something first: for it has been
          established that that which is subsequent is a principle of
          syllogizing. But in relation to all things that have come to be in the
          past, the latest is the present <i>now</i>; hence it is necessary to
          take the present <i>now</i> as the first and immediate principle.
          However, any other “having come to be” is taken as a mediate
          principle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (95b25) he shows the same for future things, saying that as the
          case was in that which has come to be, so it is in that which will
          have come to be: because if it is true that D will be, it is necessary
          that it previously be verified that A exists; and the cause of this
          will be taken to be C, which falls as middle between D and A. For if C
          will be, it is necessary that prior to it A will be.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this case, too, the objection concerning the infinite division of
          the future into instants, or of motion into moments can be lodged:
          because, as in the case of past things, so also in future things, the
          indivisibles are not consecutive. Nevertheless here too, something
          must be taken as an immediate principle, as was done in things which
          came to be in the past. For although one cannot take two consecutive
          “having come to be’s” either in the past or in the future,
          nevertheless something terminal can be the closer it is to the present
          now; but the converse is true in regard to the taken in both, and this
          will be taken as the immediate principle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (95b31) he elucidates what he had said with examples, saying that
          the manner of arguing employed above can be considered in regard, to
          human works. Thus, let us take the “having come to be” of a house as
          something terminal; from this it is concluded, as something first,
          that it is necessary that the stones have previously been cut; and we
          shall take as middle the laying of the foundation: because if the
          house has been constructed, it is necessary that previously the
          foundation has been laid; and if the foundation has been laid, it is
          necessary first that the stones have been cut. And what was taken in
          regard to the past must also be taken in regard to the future: for
          example, if a house will exist, it is necessary that first the cutting
          of the stones will occur, and that this be’ demonstrated through some
          middle, which is the laying of the foundation.<br /></p

          >
        </p>
        <p>
          After showing how one must take the middle, which is the cause, in,
          things that come to be in a direct line, the Philosopher now shows
          hhow one should take it in the case of things that come to be in
          reciprocal generation. First, he proves his proposal. Secondly, he
          elucidates it with examples (96a2).
        </p>
        <p>
          In regard to the first it should be noted that because the circular
          movement of the heavens is the cause of generation in sublunar things,
          it is stated in <i>On Generation</i> II that a kind of circular
          reciprocity is found is generation in the sense that earth is
          generated from water, and water in turn from earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore (95b38) that since we observe a certain pattern of
          generation in things that are generated <i>circularly</i>, it is
          possible in these cases also to follow what has been established
          above, namely, to syllogize from what is subsequent, provided that the
          terms of the demonstration are taken in such a way that middle and
          extremes follow one upon the other: because in the case of things that
          are generated in that way, there is a kind of circular conversion in
          the sense that one passes from the first thing to the last thing, and
          then a return is made from the last to the first; although these
          things are not numerically but specifically the same, as is explained
          in <i>On Generation</i> II. Hence it does not follow that the same
          numerical thing is prior and subsequent, or is cause and effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          And this is suitable to the process of demonstrations, for, as has
          been established in the foregoing, whenever conclusions are converted,
          i.e., whenever some of the premises can be syllogized from them, this
          is a circular demonstration. And although this is not fitting if the
          very same thing which was first the conclusion is later the principle
          of the same numerical thing (otherwise the same thing would be at once
          better known and less known), nevertheless if they are not entirely
          the same, as happens in things that are circularly generated, there is
          nothing unfitting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (96a2) he uses examples to elucidate what he has said, saying
          that a circular process is seen to occur in the works of nature. For
          if the earth is saturated with rain, it is necessary that the action
          of the sun release vapors from it; when these are released and borne
          aloft, it is necessary that clouds be formed; and after they are
          formed, it is necessary that rain
        </p>
        <p>
          water be formed; and when this is formed, it is necessary that in
          falling upon the earth it saturate it. Now this saturation of the
          earth was the very thing we took as being first; however, it is not
          the same saturation as the one from which we first began.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus it is clear that a cycle has been achieved in the sense that with
          one of them existing, another comes to be; and that other existing,
          still another comes to be; and that one existing, a return is made to
          the first, which is not numerically the same, but specifically the
          same. Yet this cycle of causes cannot be found according to the order
          which is found in pe se causes; for in <i>per se</i> causes it is
          necessary to reach some one thing which is first in each genus of
          causes as is proved in <i>Metaphysics</i> II. But the fact that water
          is generated from fire, and fire in turn from water, is not
          <i>per se</i> but <i>per accidens</i>. For being is generated
          <i>per se</i> not from actual being but from potential being, as it is
          stated in <i>Physics</i> I. Therefore, if we proceed from cause to
          cause in <i>per se</i> causes, there will not be a cycle. For we will
          accept as the efficient cause of the rain-soaked earth, the heat of
          the air which is caused by the sun, but not vice versa; but the
          material cause we take as water, whose matter is not vapor but the
          common matter of the elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (96a8) he shows how one demonstrates through the cause
          differently in things which occur always and in things which occur as
          a general rule. Concerning this he does three things. First, he
          proposes what he intends. Secondly, he proves what he has proposed
          (96a12). Thirdly, he sums up (96a20).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (96a8) that there are some things which come
          to be universally both as to time, because always, and as to subject,
          because in all cases; either because they maintain themselves as
          unchangeable things which are not subject to coming to be, or because
          they come to be as changeable things which always follow a uniform
          pattern, as in the case of heavenly movements. Again, there are other
          things which do not occur in the sense of always, but as a general
          rule. An example of this is that every human male develops a beard as
          a general rule, although it does not occur always. Therefore, just as
          in the case of things that occur always, it is necessary to take a
          middle which is always, so in the case of things which occur as a
          general rule, it is necessary to take a middle that occurs as a
          general rule.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (96a12) he proves that if one is to conclude to something that
          occurs as a general rule it is necessary to take a middle which occurs
          as a general rule. For if one were to assume the opposite by taking a
          middle which occurs universally and always; for example, if A, which
          is the major extreme, is predicated universally of B, which is the
          middle, and B of C, which is the minor extreme, then it follows of
          necessity that A is predicated universally of C both as to time and as
          to subject, which is the same as being predicated always and of each
          thing. Hence, we are now saying that for something to be predicated
          universally is the same as being predicated of all and always. But it
          has been assumed that A is predicated of C as a general rule.
          Therefore, it is necessary that the middle, which is B, should be
          taken as existing as a general rule.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus it is obvious that certain immediate principles of things which
          occur as a general rule can be taken, such that those principles exist
          or come to be as a general rule. Yet such demonstrations do not enable
          one to know that what is concluded is true absolutely but only in a
          qualified sense, namely, that it is true in the majority of cases. And
          this is the way that the principles which are taken possess truth.
          Hence sciences of this kind fall short of sciences which deal with
          things absolutely necessary, so far as the certitude of demonstration
          is concerned.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (96a20) he sums up what has been said, saying that we have now
          established how the <i>quod quid</i> which is practically identical
          with the <i>propter quid</i> is assigned among syllogistic terms,
          inasmuch as we have shown how the several genera of causes are middles
          of demonstration according to the respective diversities of things. We
          have also shown in what sense there is or is not demonstration or
          definition of the <i>quod quid</i>.<br /></p

        <p>
          After showing how the <i>quod quid</i> and <i>propter quid</i> are
          related to demonstration, the Philosopher now shows how they can be
          investigated. First, how the <i>quod quid</i> should be investigated.
          Secondly, how the <i>propter quid</i> ought to be investigated (98a1)
          [L. 17]. Concerning the first he does two things. First, he states his
          intention. Secondly, he pursues it (96a24). He says therefore first
          (96a22) that after stating how <i>quod quid</i> is recognized and how
          the <i>quod quid</i> or <i>propter quid</i> is taken as a middle in
          demonstration, we must now point out how to investigate those items
          which are predicated in <i>quod quid</i>. Then (96a24) he states his
          proposal. First, he indicates what characteristics should be present
          in things which are accepted as constituting the <i>quod quid</i>.
          Secondly, how to investigate them (96b15) [L. 14]. Concerning the
          first he does three things. First, he presents a certain division.
          Secondly, he proposes what should be the characteristics of things
          which are taken as constituting <i>quod quid</i> (96a32). Thirdly, he
          proves (96b2).
        </p>
        <p>
          In regard to the first (96a24) it should be noted that things
          predicated in <i>quod quid</i> must be such that they are predicated
          always and universally, as has been established above. Then taking
          those things which are predicated of each thing in the sense of
          always, he says that we find among them certain ones which apply to
          more than that in which they are present, but not to the extent of
          being found outside that genus.
        </p>
        <p>
          (He explains what is meant by <i>apply to more</i>, saying that those
          things are said to apply to more which are indeed universally present
          in something, but are not solely in it but in other things also). This
          would imply that there is another and opposite member which applies to
          more, but is outside the genus. He gives an example of the first one,
          saying that there is something which is present in every <i>three</i>,
          as well as in <i>non-three’s</i>, as is obviously true of
          <i>being</i>, which is universally present not only in
          <i>three</i> but in other things; and not only in the genus of number,
          but even in things outside the genus of number. <i>Odd</i>, however is
          found in every <i>three</i> and in more things, because it is found
          also in <i>five’s</i>; however, it is not found outside the genus of
          <i>three</i>, namely, number, because even <i>five</i> is in the genus
          of number. For nothing outside the genus of number can be called
          <i>odd</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (96a32) he shows what should be the characteristics of things
          that are taken as constituting the <i>quod quid</i>. First, he
          proposes his intention. Secondly, he clarifies it with examples
          (96a34).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (96a32) that in order to manifest the
          <i>quod quid</i>, we must take items which are both always and
          <i>applicable to more</i> (but not outside the genus), until the term
          is reached. And they should be so selected that each item when first
          taken should be applicable to more, but when all are taken together
          the combination does not apply to more, but is converted with the
          thing whose <i>quod quid</i> is sought. For the <i>quod quid</i> of a
          thing must signify its essence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (96a34) he manifests what he had said with an example. Let us,
          therefore, take those four, namely, <i>number</i>, <i>odd</i>, and
          <i>prime</i> in both its senses. For there are two senses in which a
          number is said to be <i>prime</i>: in one way because it is not
          divided by any other number, as opposed to <i>four</i>, which is not a
          prime number, since it can be divided by <i>two</i>; <i>three</i>,
          however, is a prime number, because it is not divided by any other
          number except <i>one</i>. In another way a number is called
          <i>prime</i> because it is not composed of other numbers, as opposed
          to <i>seven</i>, which is prime in the first way, because it is not
          divided by any other number except <i>one</i>, but is not
          <i>prime</i> in the second way, for it is composed of <i>three</i> and
          <i>four</i>. <i>Three</i>, however, is not composed of several
          numbers, but only of the number <i>two</i>, and <i>one</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so it is obvious that each of the four aforesaid notions belongs
          universally to every <i>three</i>, although each of them is also found
          in other things in the genus of number. For <i>number</i> and
          <i>odd</i> are found in all odd numbers; but the fourth, i.e, being
          <i>prime</i> in both ways, belongs also to <i>two</i>, which is
          neither divided by any other number nor composed of numbers, but only
          of units; hence, when they are all assembled they signify the
          <i>quod quid</i> of three.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the requirement that each particle of the definition apply to more
          than the definition seems superfluous. For the Philosopher says in
          <i>Metaphysics</i> VII that when the ultimate differences are reached,
          those differences will be equal to the species; therefore, it is not
          required that the difference apply to more things than the species
          does. This can also be proved with an argument. For the Philosopher
          says in <i>Metaphysics</i> VIII that a formality which is based on
          differences seems to be of the species and of the act, i.e., of the
          form; because, as he says in the same place, the difference
          corresponds to the form. But each species has its own appropriate form
          which belongs to no other species. Therefore, it seems that the
          ultimate difference does not exceed the species.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, the Philosopher in <i>Metaphysics</i> VII says that there
          is no more in a definition than genus and differences, and that it is
          possible for a definition to be formed of two things, one of which is
          a genus and the other a difference. But a difference cannot be found
          outside its appropriate genus; otherwise it would not divide the genus
          <i>per se</i> but <i>per accidens</i>. Therefore, it seems that the
          difference does not exceed the species.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it should be answered that if one were able to discover the
          difference which would make known the substantial form of the species,
          then, as the arguments prove, the ultimate difference would not apply
          to more things than the species does. But because the essential forms
          are not known to us <i>per se</i>, they must be disclosed through
          certain accidents which are signs of that form, as is stated in
          <i>Metaphysics</i> VIII. However, one should not take the pro
          <i>per accidens</i> of that species, because they are the ones that
          will be demonstrated by the definition of the species; rather the form
          of the species must be made known by certain accidents that are more
          common. Hence according to this, the differences which are used are
          indeed called substantial, inasmuch as they are adduced in order to
          declare the essential form; but they are more common than the species,
          inasmuch as they are taken from signs which follow upon higher genera.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (96b2) he explains what he had said above. First, the statement
          that the items mentioned above should be predicated universally and
          necessarily of three. Secondly, that the very essence of three is
          constituted by those items (96b6).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (96b2) that since it has been established
          above that items which are predicated in <i>quod quid</i> are present
          of necessity, and whatever is present of necessity is predicated
          universally, it follows that whether those items which are taken in
          the manner above indicated be predicated as <i>quod quid</i> of three
          or of any other thing, it is necessary that they be predicated
          necessarily and universally.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (96b6) he shows that from things which are taken in the
          abovementioned way the essence of three or of anything else is
          constituted; for it is necessary, if the items mentioned above are not
          the substance of three, that they be its genus, either named or
          unnamed, since they are predicated in <i>quod quid</i>. For not every
          formality has a name. That is why there are many genera and species
          without names. However, the reason why the above formality is the
          genus of three, if it does not signify its essence, is that whatever
          is predicated in quid is either the genus or the definition signifying
          the essence. Yet it cannot be the genus; otherwise it would apply to
          more things than three’s: for we assume a genus to be something which
          potentially contains several species under it. But we have established
          that the aforesaid formality applies only to the atoms, i.e., to the
          individuals contained under three. What remains, therefore, is that
          the formality in question is the definition signifying the essence of
          three. For the essence of a thing is supposed to be that which is
          found in the individuals of that species ultimately, according to the
          manner of predication described above. And what has been said of three
          is also understood of any other things regarding which something is
          demonstrated to be the same in the manner indicated above.<br /></p

        <p>
          After showing what should be the characteristics of the items which
          constitute the definition signifying the essence of a thing, the
          Philosopher now shows how they should be investigated. Concerning this
          he does two things. First, he proposes the most suitable method of
          investigating the items to be put in the definition, namely, by
          division of the genus. Secondly, he sets forth another method, namely,
          by similarities and differences (97b7) [L. 16]. Concerning the first
          he does two things. First, he shows that one should employ division of
          the genus for investigating the particles of the definition. Secondly,
          he shows what to look for in such an investigation (97a23) [L. 15]. In
          regard to the first he does two things. First, he shows the truth.
          Secondly, he excludes an error (97a6) [L. 151. Concerning the first he
          does three things. First, he shows how the particles of a definition
          are investigated by the method of dividing the genus. Secondly, how
          the process of division is useful for this task (96b25). Thirdly, how
          to avoid pitfalls which can invalidate this process (96b30).
          Concerning the first he does two things. First, he shows that one
          should employ division of the genus for defining. Secondly, how one
          should take the differences (96b18).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (96b15) that when someone wishes to deal with
          some whole, i.e., a universal, in order to define it, it is
          recommended that he first divide the genus into the first parts of
          that genus, i.e., those that are not further divisible into species;
          for example, he should divide number into <i>two</i> and <i>three</i>.
          Having accomplished this division through which the genus is known, he
          should then try to obtain the definition of each species as is done in
          other matters, say in the matter of straight line and circle and right
          angle. For all these are fittingly defined after one has divided the
          genus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (96b18) he shows how to obtain the differences, saying that after
          we have learned what the genus is by dividing the genus into its
          species, for example, whether it is in the genus of quality or
          quantity, the next step is to investigate the differences by
          considering the proper attributes which, as has been said, are signs
          manifesting the forms proper to the species. And this should first be
          done by means of certain common items. For if we assemble the
          accidents from the more common genera (which he here calls
          <i>indivisibles</i>, because they are not resolved into prior genera),
          then from their definitions the things we are searching for will be
          immediately obvious. For “the basic element of all definitions must be
          something simple,” i.e., a common genus; furthermore, it is only in
          such simple things that the accidents inhere <i>per se</i> which are
          commonly found in many, but they are found in all other things in
          virtue of those simple genera. For example, black and white belong
          <i>per se</i> to terminated body; and in virtue of this common
          characteristic they belong also to man and horse and other things.
          Hence if one is to obtain the definition of something to which white
          belongs universally, say the definition of snow, he must have recourse
          to the more common genus, such as terminated body, and obtain from it
          the cause of whiteness; and according to this we would learn why snow
          is white universally. And that cause could pertain to the
          <i>quod quid</i> of snow: for example, the solidifying of a moist
          element which makes it be terminated, some light being preserved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (96b25) he shows how the above method is useful in definitions.
          And he says that when someone seeks to define according to the above
          method, i.e., by dividing the genus into species, the benefit it
          confers is that it accomplishes the division of the genus through
          differences. How this method reveals the <i>quod quid</i> has been
          indicated above. Furthermore, these divisions are useful for achieving
          the <i>quod quid</i> solely in the manner described above; they seem
          to contribute nothing to the syllogizing of the <i>quod quid</i>, as
          we said earlier. Rather it seems that upon dividing, one immediately
          obtains everything without syllogizing, as though he knew them from
          the beginning before he divided.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (96b30) he shows what to avoid if this method is not to fail.
          Concerning this he does two things. First, he shows that one must
          avoid improper order. Secondly, one must avoid diminution (96b35).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (96b30) that it makes a great difference, when
          arranging the items present in a definition, which items are mentioned
          first and which are mentioned later. For it is possible to state that
          man is a gentle animal which is two-legged, or to state that man is a
          two-legged animal which is gentle. That the order of terms does make a
          difference in defining is clear from the fact that anything which is
          defined should be composed of two things, namely, a genus and a
          difference. Therefore, if “gentle” is taken as a difference of animal,
          it is required that “gentle animal” be some one thing which can be
          taken as a genus from which, with the addition of the difference
          “two-legged,” man is constituted. And the same reason holds for
          anything else which is formed from several things into a unit which is
          <i>per se</i> and not <i>per accidens</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, just as it does make a difference whether this or that be
          taken for the genus or the difference, or whether something is taken
          as a difference constituting the genus or as dividing it, so it makes
          a difference in defining just how the parts of the definition are
          ordered. For if I say that man is a two-legged gentle animal, “animal”
          will be taken as the genus, “gentle” as the difference constituting a
          genus, and “two-legged” as the difference dividing it. It will be the
          opposite if I say that man is a gentle two-legged animal. Therefore,
          since a variation in order makes a difference in <i>quod quid</i>, the
          consequence is that one who divides should not only suppose the things
          which are taken for defining, but should take care about the ordering
          of those things. And so it is clear that a definition does not
          syllogize the <i>quod quid</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (96b35) he teaches that one should avoid diminution, pointing out
          how to make certain that nothing required for the <i>quod quid</i> be
          omitted. And he says that the only way this can be avoided is by
          following the method he will indicate.
        </p>
        <p>
          To understand this it should be noted that all the differences of
          higher genera pertain to the <i>quod quid</i> of some species. For the
          lower genus is constituted by the difference which divides the higher
          genus. Therefore, to avoid diminution it is necessary that none of
          these differences be overlooked. But they are overlooked if someone,
          after taking the supreme genus, were to take a difference which
          divides not that supreme genus but some lower genus. But this can be
          recognized in the following way: when animal is taken as a supreme
          genus, if someone then takes the division of something pertaining to
          lower genera, not everything which is contained under the higher genus
          will fall into that division.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an example of this he says: for example, not every animal is either
          whole-winged or possessed of divided wings. (An animal is said to be
          whole-winged if its wings are each a continuous whole, as in a bat;
          but an animal is said to be possessed of divided wings if its wings
          are composed of distinct feathers, as in a hawk or raven). But neither
          of these belongs to a non-winged animal. However, any animal that
          flies is contained under one or other of these differences, because it
          is according to the above differences that this genus,
          <i>flying animal</i>, is divided. But the first and immediate
          difference of animal is such that every animal falls under the
          division. And the same applies to all other genera, whether we are
          dealing with genera extrinsic to animal, such as stone and plant, or
          those which are contained under animal, such as bird and fish. Yet the
          first difference of bird is such that every bird is included; and the
          same is true of fish.
        </p>
        <p>
          He concludes, therefore, that if someone proceeds to divide according
          to this method, namely, that the totality which is divided is
          contained under the parts of the division, he will be able to know
          that nothing necessary for defining has been omitted. But if he
          proceeds some other way, he is bound to omit something; and he will
          not be sure that he has defined integrally.<br /></p

        </p>
        <p>
          After presenting the truth concerning the division of the genus which
          is used in defining, the Philosopher here excludes two errors. In
          regard to the first one he does three things:
        </p>
        <p>
          First (97a6) he excludes the error and says that it is not necessary
          that one who defines by dividing should know all the things which
          exist in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly (97a7) he sets forth the opinion of those who make this
          error. For some have said that it is not possible to know the
          difference between one thing and everything else, unless everything
          else is known, as is plain in regard to any two given things, whose
          difference we cannot know unless we know both things. However, they
          added that the <i>quid est</i> of something cannot be known, unless
          the difference between it and everything else is known. For that
          wherein something is not different is identical with it, whereas that
          by which something differs is other than it. But we cannot know what a
          thing is, unless we know what is the same as it and what is other than
          it. According to this, therefore, they concluded that something cannot
          be known unless everything is known.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly (97a11) he disproves what they say in two ways. First, he
          destroys the statement according to which it is said that that by
          which something differs is something other. For we are now speaking
          about what is the same and what is other according to the essence
          which the definition signifies. But it is obvious that even in the
          same species there are many accidental differences which neither
          diversify the substance of the species which the definition signifies,
          nor are in it <i>per se</i>. Hence it follows that not every
          difference makes something other in such a way that it must be known
          if one is to define.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly (97a13), he disproves it another way. For since one who
          proposes to define by dividing must take opposing differences in such
          a way that everything contained under the divided whole falls under
          this member or that member of the division, and must subsume under one
          or the other of the members that whose definition is sought (if he
          knows that the thing he intends to define is contained under that
          member of the division), then it makes no difference, so far as his
          intent is concerned, whether he knows or does not know the things of
          which the opposing differences might be predicated. For example, if I
          divide animal into rational and irrational, and assume that man is
          contained under animal in the way we have proposed, it is not required
          that I know the things of which irrational is predicated or how they
          differ from one another. For it is obvious that if someone proceeds in
          this way, namely, by dividing the genus into its first differences and
          taking the definitum [thing being defined] as subsumed under one of
          the members and then dividing until certain items are reached that
          cannot be further divided by essential differences, then by proceeding
          in this manner he will have the definition of the substance which he
          was seeking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, the persons mentioned above were deluded for failing to
          distinguish between something in common and in detail. For it is
          required of one who knows what something is, that he know all things
          in common but not in detail. For example, one who knows what man is
          must know that it is through being an animal that man is distinguished
          from all things that are not animals, and through being rational that
          man is distinguished from all things that are not rational. But it is
          not required that he know anything more about these others than is
          included in the general notion of <i>non-animal</i> or
          <i>irrational</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (97a19) he excludes the second error. For someone might believe
          that whoever uses division for defining must assume that the entire
          whole is contained under the members of the division. But he says that
          this is not necessary, if the opposites through which the division is
          made are immediate; because the divided whole is necessarily contained
          under one of the opposites, provided the first differences of the
          genus were taken. For differences which are immediate when compared to
          a lower genus are not immediate if compared to a higher genus. For
          example, <i>even</i> and <i>odd</i> are immediate if compared to
          number of which they are proper differences, but not if they are
          compared to quantity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (97a23), after rejecting things which are not required in the
          divisions of the definitum, he shows what is really required. First,
          he proposes what he intends. Secondly, he manifests his proposal
          (97a25).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (97a23) that in order to achieve a term, i.e.,
          a, definition, by the method of division three things must be
          observed: first, that the things which are taken be predicated in
          <i>quod quid</i>; secondly, that they be arranged according to what is
          first and what is second; thirdly, that everything taken pertain to
          the <i>quod quid</i> and that nothing be omitted. Then (97a25) he
          manifests his proposal. First, he shows how these three rules can be
          observed. Secondly, he shows that it is enough to observe those three
          rules (97b1).
        </p>
        <p>
          In regard to the first point he does three things. First (97a25), he
          shows how the first rule is observed, saying that this one (namely,
          that one take things which are predicated in <i>quod quid</i>) is
          observed, first of all, by the fact that a person can form syllogisms
          to show that what is assumed is in the thing (as is done when there is
          dispute about whether something is an accident); secondly, to show
          that it is predicated in <i>quod quid</i> (as is done when there is
          dispute about a genus).
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly (97a28), he shows how the second rule is observed, namely,
          that there be a correct ordering of the parts. And he says that the
          parts of a definition are arranged as they should, if one takes what
          is first—and he will do this, if he first takes that which is implied
          by the other things that are taken later, and not conversely. For this
          is more common and prior. But such a thing must be taken in the
          definition as a genus, as when it is stated that man is an animal,
          two-legged and walking. For if he is a two-legged walker, he is an
          animal; but not vice versa. Therefore, when I have taken animal as
          first, the same method must be observed in arranging the other items.
          For the second item to be employed in the definition will be that
          which according to the foregoing description will be first among all
          the others; likewise, the third item to be taken will be that which is
          first in respect of the items <i>had</i>, i.e., following. For it will
          always turn out that when the more general item has been removed, that
          which is <i>had</i>, i.e., that which immediately follows, will be
          true in regard to all the other items, say a fourth and a fifth, if
          that many parts are needed for the definition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly (9704), he shows how the third rule can be observed. And he
          says that it will be obvious that all items pertaining to the
          <i>quod quid</i> are present in the definition according to the
          aforesaid method, because when we divide the genus, we take its first
          differences, under which the divisum is universally contained; for
          example, that every animal is this or that, i.e., rational or
          irrational, and we assume that what we intend to define is this, i.e.,
          rational. And again we take this whole, namely, rational animal, and
          divide it by its proper differences; but when we arrive at the
          ultimate difference, it will be impossible to divide by other specific
          differences, but as soon as the ultimate difference is added, the
          thing whose definition is being sought will differ in no way from the
          assembled whole, i.e., from the description formed by all the parts
          that were taken. Thus, man does not differ specifically from any of
          those of whom rational mortal animal is predicated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (97b1) he shows that the observance of the three aforesaid rules
          is sufficient for defining, because the definition will have neither
          more nor less than it should. That no more has been assigned than it
          should have is obvious from the first rule, namely, because the only
          things accepted are items predicated in <i>quod quid</i>; and it was
          necessary to accept such things. Likewise it will be clear that
          nothing has been omitted. For either the genus or the difference might
          be missing. But that the genus is not missing is clear from the second
          rule; for the first thing taken was the item without which the others
          do not exist, and which can exist without the others: and this is the
          genus. And with the genus the differences were then taken. But that
          all the differences have been taken is obvious from the third rule,
          since there can be no further subsequent difference taken after the
          one concerning which we have said that it has no difference; otherwise
          it would follow that what had been admitted to be the last would still
          differ with an essential difference, whereas it had been said that it
          does not have a difference.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, it is obvious from the foregoing that no difference has
          been left out in the meantime, namely, because first differences are
          always taken. Hence it remains that for defining it is sufficient that
          the three aforesaid rules be observed.<br /></p

        </p>
        <p>
          After teaching how to investigate the <i>quod quid</i> according to
          the most suitable method which is by division of the genus, the
          Philosopher now teaches another method. Concerning this he does three
          things. First, he describes the method. Secondly, he gives examples
          (97b15). Thirdly, he proves that this method is satisfactory (97b26).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (97b7) that if someone is searching for the
          definition of some thing, he should examine things which are similar
          to it as well as things which are different from it. He shows how this
          should be done when he says that in those things which are similar,
          one should consider some item that is the same in all; for example,
          what is found to be the same in all men is that they all coincide in
          being rational. After that, one should investigate the things which
          agree with the first things in genus and are specifically the same
          among themselves, although specifically different from the things
          first taken, as horses from men. It is also necessary to investigate
          what is the same in these things, namely, these horses; say neighing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then having taken what is the same in all of the former, i.e., men,
          namely, rational, and what is the same in the others, i.e., horses,
          namely, neighing, the next step will be to consider whether anything
          is the same in those two, namely, in rational and neighing. And this
          method of investigating must be continued until one common formality
          is found. For this will be the definition of the thing. However, if
          such an investigation does not uncover one common formality, but leads
          to two or even several diverse formalities, it will be obvious that
          the thing whose definition is being sought will not be one thing
          according to essence but several. Consequently, it will not have one
          definition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (97b15) he elucidates what he had said with an example, saying
          that if we would investigate what magnanimity is, we should first of
          all consider certain magnanimous persons, in order to learn what is
          the one item they have insofar as they are magnanimous. Thus,
          Alcibiades was said to be magnanimous, and so were Achilles and Ajax;
          all of whom have one item in common—not to tolerate insults. The sign
          of this is that Alcibiades fought rather than accept insults; Achilles
          went mad from anger; Ajax committed suicide. Then we should consider
          this in others who are said to be magnanimous, say in Lysander and
          Socrates. For they have this in common that they were unmoved by good
          fortune or bad, but were indifferent to both.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, let us take these two items, namely, equanimity in the face
          of the vicissitudes of life and intolerance of insults, and see if
          there is anything common to them. For in this consists the notion of
          magnanimity. For example, we might say that these two things are due
          to the fact that a person considers himself worthy of great things.
          For it is from this attitude that a man does not tolerate insults and
          it is also from this attitude that he scorns fluctuations affecting
          external goods as being trifles. But if nothing common is to be found
          in the two items taken, the species of magnanimity would not be one
          but two. Hence one common definition could not be given.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (97b26) he shows that the above method is well adapted to finding
          the <i>quod quid</i>. Concerning this he does two things. First, he
          shows that the method is suitable. Secondly, he shows what should be
          avoided in this method (97b38). Concerning the first he does two
          things. First, he shows that the above method is suitable as to its
          result, namely, as to arriving at something common. Secondly, as to
          its procedure, namely, inasmuch as it starts with particular cases
          (97b28).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (97b26) that it was said advisedly that one
          who is investigating the <i>quod quid</i> must reach something common,
          because every definition of something is given insofar as that thing
          is considered in its universality, and not as it is considered in this
          or that individual. For a physician does not define health as it
          exists in this eye of this man, but either as it is universally and
          absolutely in regard to all men, or he distinguishes health according
          to various species; for example, when he says this to be health for
          the cholerics, or for the bilious.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (97b28) he shows that this method is satisfactory as to
          procedure, inasmuch as it proceeds from the less common to the more
          common. And this in two ways: first, by reason of facility. For a
          discipline begins from the easier things. But it is easier to define
          something singular, i.e., something less common, than something
          universal, which is more common; inasmuch as equivocations are less
          likely to be detected in universals, because they are less
          determinate, than in things which are undifferentiated, i.e., in
          things which are not divided by specific differences. Accordingly, one
          must define by ascending from singulars to universals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly (97b31), he shows the same thing by reason of evidence. For
          just as in demonstrations one should syllogize by presupposing
          something which is evident and obvious, so too in terms, i.e., in
          definitions. For no one can pass to a knowledge of something which is
          unknown except by means of something known, whether he intends to know
          <i>quia</i> est, which is made known through demonstration, or
          <i>quid est</i>, which is done by definition.
        </p>
        <p>
          But this happens, i.e., something evident preexists, if it is defined
          or happens to be defined separately, i.e., distinctly, by means of
          items that are predicated singularly, i.e., which belong to this or
          that thing properly and distinctively. Thus, if someone desires to
          know what similar is, he will not examine every single thing which can
          be called similar, but only some similar things; for example, how
          things are similar in color, and how something is accounted similar in
          figure. For it is from the unity of color that things are said to be
          similar in color; but in the realm of figure, two things are similar
          because corresponding angles are equal and the sides proportional.
          Likewise in other things: if someone desires to define sharp, he will
          not examine everything which can be called sharp, but he will consider
          sharp as applied to a sound.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence it is clear that one who follows this method when he defines is
          automatically avoiding the possibility of equivocation. Consequently,
          it is clear that this is a practical method of defining, i.e., the
          method of passing from the less common to the more common, inasmuch as
          it is easier in special things to define what is special, and
          univocation can be more easily recognized in such things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (97b38) he excludes a certain method of procedure in definitions,
          saying that just as one may not dispute by metaphors, so he may not
          define by metaphors; for example, by stating that man is an inverted
          tree. Furthermore, in definitions one may not use anything stated
          metaphorically. For since definitions are the most important and most
          efficacious middles in disputations, it would follow, if definitions
          were stated in metaphorical terms, that one would have to dispute by
          metaphors. But this is not valid, because a metaphor is interpreted
          according to something which is similar; whereas it does not follow,
          if something is similar in one respect, that it is similar in all
          respects.<br /></p

        <p>
          After showing how one should go about investigating the
          <i>quod quid</i>, the Philosopher now shows how one should investigate
          <i>propter quid</i>. Concerning this he does two things. First, he
          shows how <i>propter quid</i> should be investigated. Secondly, how
          diverse questions make use of a common <i>propter quid</i> (98a23).
          Concerning the first he does two things. First, he shows that one
          takes the <i>propter quid</i> by taking some common univocal item.
          Secondly, by taking some common analogous item (9840). Concerning the
          first he does two things. First, he teaches how to take the
          <i>propter quid</i> by taking a common univocal item which is a
          definitively named genus. Secondly, by taking anything else that is
          common (98a13).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (98a1) that in order to get the
          <i>propter quid</i> in regard to individual problems that are
          proposed, it is required to consider divisions and subdivisions, and
          so to proceed to the individual cases by disputing, having first
          supposed a common genus. For example, if someone wished to consider
          <i>why</i> something belongs to certain types of animals, he would
          have to discover what items belong to every animal. Once these have
          been discovered, he would once more consult the divisions to determine
          what things follow first upon that common item which is contained
          under animal; for example, what things follow upon every bird. Then
          one would continue in this manner, always taking the first item into
          which a given division is immediately divided. This is the very thing
          that was observed above in the divisions by which one proceeds to
          investigate <i>quod quid</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          By thus proceeding it is obvious that we shall always be able to say
          <i>propter quid</i> certain things are present in those things which
          are contained under something common. Thus, if we would like to know
          why certain things such as being asleep and being awake are found in
          man and horse, we would let <i>animal</i> be that in which A, the
          middle, is found, and let B, i.e., the major extreme, stand for items
          that inhere in every animal, say, <i>being asleep and awake</i>. Then
          we let certain species of animals, such as <i>man, horse, cow</i>, be
          taken as minor extremes, namely, C, D, E. In this way it is manifest
          that the reason why B, i.e., <i>being asleep or awake</i>, is found in
          D, i.e., in <i>man</i>, is that it is due to A, i.e., because man is
          an <i>animal</i>. Then the same should be done in regard to the
          others, and the same notion must be observed in all. The reason for
          this procedure is that the subject is the cause of a proper attribute.
          Therefore, if we wish to investigate the cause why some attribute is
          found in certain inferiors, it is necessary to take as common the
          proper subject through whose definition the cause of that attribute is
          taken.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (98a13) he shows how to investigate the <i>propter quid</i> by
          arriving at something common which is a genus without a definite name.
          And he says that what has been stated above applies to those common
          items to which names have been assigned. However, it is not enough to
          consider only such items but anything else which seems to be commonly
          present in them, even if it is not a genus or does not have a name.
          After that, one must discover what this common factor follows upon, as
          well as what follows upon this common unnamed factor. For example,
          <i>to have horns</i> is something common, but it neither has a name
          nor is it a genus. Furthermore, two things follow upon this common
          factor: one of these is that every horned animal, because it must chew
          its cud, has several stomachs; one of which, existing farther in and
          called <i>echinus</i>, is hard and prickly, as it is stated in
          <i>The History of Animals</i> II. Another item which follows upon
          horned animals is that they do not have teeth in both jaws, but only
          in the lower one, because the dental matter is converted into horns.
          Again one must consider which animals are apt to have horns, namely,
          cows and deers. For in that way it will be clear why these animals
          have those properties, namely, because they have horns.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (98a20) he shows how to investigate <i>propter quid</i> by
          arriving at some common analogous item. And he says that another
          method of investigating <i>propter quid</i> is to select something
          common according to analogy, i.e., proportion. For it is possible to
          take something analogous which is not the same according to species or
          genus: for example, the bone (called <i>sepion</i>) of squid, the
          spine of fish and the backbone of land animals. For all these agree by
          proportion, because spine and backbone are related to fish and land
          animals in the same way. Now because of this unity of proportion
          certain things follow upon this common analogous item, just as if they
          shared in one generic or specific nature; for example, to be covered
          with flesh.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (98a23) he shows how many problems concur as to
          <i>propter quid</i>. First, as to having one middle. Secondly, as to
          the order of the middles (98a29).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (98a23) that some problems are the same,
          namely, inasmuch as they agree as to <i>propter quid</i>. In one way,
          because they have the same middle: thus many things are demonstrated
          by the middle which is <i>antiperistasis</i>, i.e., counter-resistance
          or reverberation. On the other hand, some middles are the same not
          absolutely but in genus, and these are diversified by certain
          differences which are based either on the diversity of subjects or on
          the diversity of their ways of coming to be. For example, if it is
          asked why an echo comes to be, or why something appears, namely, in a
          mirror, or why a rainbow is formed. For they are the same problem as
          to the middle <i>propter quid</i>, which is generically the same,
          since all are caused by a reverberation. However, the reverberations
          differ specifically. For an echo comes to be through the reverberation
          of air set in motion by a sounding body toward a concave body; an
          image in a mirror comes to be by the fact that the modification of the
          medium is rebounded at the mirror; but the rainbow is formed by the
          rays of the sun being reflected back by moist vapors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (98a29) he shows how problems agree as to <i>propter quid</i> by
          reason of the subordination of the middles. And he says that there are
          certain other problems which differ from one another in point of
          having diverse middles, one of which is under another. And he gives
          the example that someone wonders why the Nile overflows more near the
          end of the month, i.e., of the lunar month. For the reason is that
          there is more rain near the end of the month. And the reason for this
          is taken from another middle, namely, because the moon which controls
          moisture is waning then. Consequently, as its light wanes the vapors
          in the air condense more; and this causes rain. And so it is plain
          that those two middles are related to one another in the sense that
          one of them is under the other.<br /></p

        <p>
          After showing how one should investigate <i>propter quid</i>, the
          Philosopher now raises two questions in regard to <i>propter quid</i>.
          The first of these concerns the co-existence of cause to caused. The
          second pertains to the unity of cause (99a1) [L. 19]. Concerning the
          first he does three things. First, he proposes the question. Secondly,
          he raises an objection (98b2). Thirdly, he solves the question
          (98b25).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (98a35) that in regard to cause and caused, it
          is possible to wonder when one of them exists, does the other also
          exist? However, this question should not be interpreted as referring
          to coexistence in time but of succession, such that if one is posited,
          does the other follow regardless of whether they are concurrent in
          time, or before and after. And he gives two examples. In one of them,
          the cause precedes the caused in time: for the cause why the leaves of
          a tree fall off is that it has broad leaves; for the possession of
          broad leaves and their falling are not simultaneous in time. In the
          other example, the cause and the caused are simultaneous in time; as
          the interposition of the earth is simultaneous in time with the
          eclipse of the moon. The question, therefore, is whether upon the one
          of them the other follows.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (98b2) he objects to the question proposed and shows that cause
          and caused are always together as to succession: and he gives two
          reasons for this. The first one is based on the notion of cause and
          caused. And he says that every caused thing must have some cause.
          Hence, if something is posited as caused and it is not simultaneously
          posited that such and such is its cause, it follows that something
          else is its cause. For example, from the fact that the earth is
          between, it follows that the moon is eclipsed; and from the fact that
          a tree has broad leaves, it follows that its leaves fall off.
          Therefore, if there is no other cause, it follows that this caused is
          simultaneous with its cause.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (98b4) he gives the second reason which is based on the fact that
          cause and caused are demonstrated the one by the other. Concerning
          this he does three things. First, he states the reason. Secondly, he
          dismisses the error that could follow (98b16). Thirdly, he proves what
          he had presupposed (98b22).
        </p>
        <p>
          In regard to the first he says (98b4) that it is also manifest that
          cause and caused follow upon one another simultaneously, if it is true
          that either can be demonstrated by the other: because the conclusion
          of a demonstration follows of necessity from the middle. But the fact
          that either can be demonstrated by the other is shown by the following
          example: Let <i>leaf falls off</i> be A, the major extreme;
          <i>to have a broad leaf</i> be B, the middle; and <i>vines</i> be C,
          which is the minor. Thus, therefore, A is in B, because whatever has
          broad leaves, its leaves fall off; but B is in C, because every vine
          has broad leaves. And so it is concluded that A is in C, because every
          vine loses its leaves. Now in this whole process the cause is taken as
          middle; consequently, the caused is demonstrated by the cause.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it is also possible conversely to demonstrate the cause through
          the caused, namely, that a vine has broad leaves because its leaves
          fall off. For we may take as D, the major term, the fact of having
          broad leaves; and as E, the middle, the fact that the leaves fall off;
          and as Z, vine, which is the minor extreme. Thus, therefore, E is in
          Z, because from every vine the leaves fall off; but D is in E, namely,
          that whose leaves fall off has broad leaves. From this it is concluded
          that every vine has broad leaves, which is taken as the cause
          accounting for the leaves falling off.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (98b16) he excludes an error which could follow from the
          foregoing, namely, that according to the same reason one of the
          foregoing may be demonstrated from the other. But he rejects this,
          saying that if it does not occur that the two given things are
          mutually causes one of the other, namely, in the same genus of cause
          (since the cause is prior to that of which it is the cause, and it
          does not occur that a same thing is prior and subsequent in the same
          way), then since the cause of the eclipse of the moon is the fact that
          the earth is between, it is not possible that the eclipse of the moon
          is the cause of the earth’s being between. Therefore, if a
          demonstration through cause is a demonstration proper quid, whereas
          one which is not through the cause is demonstration of the
          <i>quia</i>, as was established in Book I, it follows that one who
          demonstrates through the eclipse of the moon that the earth is
          between, knows <i>quia</i> not <i>propter quid</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (98b22) he proves what he had supposed, namely, that the
          interposition of the earth is the cause of the eclipse and not the
          converse. And he says that it is obvious that the eclipsing of the
          moon is not the cause of the earth’s being between, but it is rather
          the converse; because in explaining an eclipse it is stated that the
          earth is between, as has been stated. Therefore, since quid and
          <i>propter quid</i> are the same, it is clear that the eclipse of the
          moon is known through the fact that the earth is between, as through a
          middle which is <i>propter quid</i>; and not conversely.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (98b25) he solves the proposed question, showing the cases in
          which it is true that cause and caused always follow upon one another,
          and the cases in which it is not true. Concerning this he does two
          things. First, he shows the cases in which it is not true. Secondly,
          those in which it is true (98b32).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (98b25) that one common thing happens to have
          several causes, insofar as it is found in diverse things; as to be
          worthy of blame belongs to a rash person because of excess, but to a
          timid person because of a deficiency. Therefore, let us assume that
          some thing is predicated of several things chiefly and immediately,
          i.e., that A is predicated in a first way of B and also of C; as to be
          blameworthy is predicated of excessiveness and deficiency. Let us
          further assume that these two, namely, C and B, are predicated of D
          and E; as excessiveness of rash, and deficiency of timid. Therefore, A
          will be predicated of D and of E, because both the rash and the timid
          are blameworthy. But the cause of A’s being in D is B; for a rash
          person is blameworthy because of excess. But the cause of A’s being in
          E is C; for a timid person is blameworthy because of defect. It is
          clear, therefore, that since the cause exists, the thing must exist:
          because whether A is excess or defect, it is necessary that something
          be blameworthy. On the other hand, if the thing exists, it is
          necessary that one of the causes exist, although it is not necessary
          that both causes exist. For example, supposing that something is
          blameworthy, it is not necessary that it be due to excess, but it is
          necessary that it be due either to excess or to defect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (98b32) he shows in which cases it is necessary that cause and
          caused follow one another simultaneously. And he says that if
          something be asked in a universal way, and if both the cause and that
          whose cause is sought be taken in a universal way, then it is required
          that the effect always follow upon the cause, and the cause upon the
          effect. Thus the fact of losing leaves does not belong in a first way
          to several things as it did in the above example, but it belongs
          determinately to one common first thing; although of that common thing
          there are many species, to which it belongs universally that their
          leaves fall off: say, if we took either plants or this type of plant,
          namely, the type that has broad leaves. Hence in all of these it is
          required to take an equal middle, so that the cause and that of which
          it is the cause are converted. Thus we might inquire why trees lose
          their leaves: if the cause of this is taken to be the fact that the
          moist element has hardened and made easier to dry out, it will follow
          that if the effect exists, the cause also exists; for example, if the
          tree has its leaves falling off, it is required that there be a
          hardening of its moist element. Conversely, it is required that if the
          cause is posited, then the effect is posited in such a thing: thus if
          the hardening of the sap exists, it follows not of anything at random
          but of the tree, that the leaves fall off.<br /></p

        <p>
          Having settled the question he raised, namely, whether upon the
          existence of the effect the existence of the cause follows, and
          conversely; the Philosopher now inquires whether unity of cause
          follows upon unity of effect, and conversely. Concerning this he does
          two things. First, he shows how one cause is inferred from one effect.
          Secondly, from this he shows the sequential connection of cause and
          effect (99a17). In regard to the first he does three things.
        </p>
        <p>
          First (99a1) he proposes the question, which is this: Does it occur
          that of the same effect there is not the same cause in all cases but
          different ones, or does this not occur? For it seemed to be supposed
          in solving the previous question that in various cases there can be
          various causes of one effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly (99a2), he solves the question by distinguishing. For it
          occurs that something is assigned as the cause of some effect in three
          ways: in one way, by taking the <i>per se</i> cause and then
          concluding the effect demonstratively; in another way, by taking a
          sign; in a third way, by taking an accident. Therefore, if one takes
          as cause that which is <i>per se</i> the middle of demonstration,
          there can be but one cause of one effect in all cases. And he proves
          this on the ground that a <i>per se</i> middle in demonstrations is a
          formality of the ultimate, i.e., the definition of the major extreme,
          which, if it needs to be demonstrated of the subject, will be
          demonstrated by the definition of the subject, as we have established
          above. Now it is obvious that of one thing there is one definition.
          Hence it is necessary that of one effect there is no cause but the one
          which is the middle of demonstration.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, if one does not take as the inferring cause that which is
          <i>per se</i> the middle of demonstration, but some sign or accident
          is used as the middle, then it does happen that of one effect several
          causes, as it were, are taken in diverse things, as is clear in the
          example given earlier. For the <i>per se</i> cause why something is
          blameworthy is that it is not according to reason. But to be excessive
          or defective is a sign of that which is not according to reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly (99a4), he elucidates his solution by showing that the members
          of the division he cited are possible. And he says that it is possible
          to consider both that which is the cause and that of which it is the
          cause, <i>per accidens</i>: thus a musician is <i>per accidens</i> the
          cause of a house whose <i>per se</i> cause is a builder, who in turn
          is <i>per accidens</i> the cause of its being a haven for thieves, if
          this happens to occur in the house. Indeed, these problems even seem
          to be <i>per accidens</i>. But if cause and caused are not taken
          <i>per accidens</i>, it is required that the middle taken as cause be
          of the same order as the effect whose demonstration is sought.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence if certain things are equivocal, then the common middle which is
          taken will also be equivocal; if they are not equivocal but agree as
          it were in genus, then the middle too will be common according to
          genus. Thus the fact that proportionals alternate, i.e., are
          commutatively proportional, is found univocally in many things, say in
          numbers and in lines, in which they have a cause which is in one sense
          different and in one sense the same: different, indeed, according to
          species, inasmuch as a line is one thing and a number another thing;
          but the same according to genus, inasmuch as lines as well as numbers
          agree in having such increments from which commutative proportion is
          demonstrated of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other examples he gives concern equivocal things. He says that the
          cause of being similar is one thing in colors and another in figures,
          because similarity is predicated equivocally of the two. For in
          figures, to be similar consists in nothing more than that the sides
          have anology, i.e., that the sides are proportional and the angles
          equal. But in colors, similarity consists in the fact that they cause
          the same alteration in the sense, or something else of this sort.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly, however, he says concerning things which agree according to
          analogy that in their case it is also required that the middle be one
          according to analogy, as when it was stated above that both a rainbow
          and an echo are reverberations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (99a17) he shows how in the light of the foregoing, causes follow
          one upon the other. Concerning this he does three things. First, he
          shows what sort of sequential connection there is between cause and
          effect. Secondly, he orders this connection in a syllogistic figure
          (99a30). Thirdly, he raises a doubt from the foregoing (99b7).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (99a17) that the type of connection found
          between cause and caused and the subject in which that caused inheres
          is such that if one were to take in a particular case that of which
          the cause is sought, it will be in more than the cause or subject.
          Thus, to have its exterior angles equal to four right angles belongs
          to every triangle for a single reason, namely, because its three
          exterior angles added to its three interior angles are equal to six
          right angles. Therefore, since the three interior angles are equal to
          two right angles, it follows that the three exterior angles are equal
          to four right angles. However, a rhombus also has four exterior angles
          equal to four right angles, but for another reason. For its exterior
          angles plus its interior angles equal eight right angles, but the four
          interior angles of a rhombus are equal to four right angles;
          therefore, the four exterior angles are equal to four right angles.
          Therefore, to have its exterior angles equal to four right angles
          extends to more things than either triangle or rhombus does; but if
          the latter are taken together, they are equal to the former. For all
          figures, which agree in having their exterior angles equal to four
          right angles must similarly agree as to their middle, which is the
          cause of being equal to four right angles. And he proves this, as in
          the previous case, on the ground that the middle is the definition of
          the major extreme. And this is why all sciences come to be in virtue
          of a definition.
        </p>
        <p>
          He proves this also with an example from natural things. For the fact
          that its leaves fall follows on being a vine, but it extends to more,
          because it is true of several other things; it also follows upon being
          a fig tree, and extends to more. But it does not extend to more than
          the sum total of things in which it is found, but it is equal to their
          sum. Therefore, if someone desires to discover what is the first
          middle in relation to all, it will be the definition of the fact that
          the leaves fall: and this definition will be the first middle in
          respect to the others, since all the others are such. And again, some
          other middle will be discovered for this, say that the sap hardens by
          drying, or something of that sort. Hence, if it be asked what it is to
          have leaves fall off, we will say that it is nothing more than “the
          seminal sap hardening at a point of contact,” i.e., where the leaf
          meets a branch.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (99a30) he arranges the mode of the aforesaid connection in
          syllogistic form, saying that if the sequence of cause and caused be
          sought, it can, be assigned in the following way according to the
          figures of syllogisms. Thus let A be in every B, and B in all things
          that are D, but in things additional to D. Then B will inhere
          universally in the things contained under D, inasmuch as that is said
          to inhere universally which is not converted. But a primary universal
          is one such that each of the inferiors contained under it is not
          converted with it, but all of them taken together are converted with
          the first universal and exceed each of those which are contained under
          it. Thus, therefore, the cause of the fact that A inheres in the
          things contained under D is B. Therefore, it is required that A extend
          to more things than B does. If this were not so but they were equal,
          then why should B be the cause of inferring that A is in D, any more
          than A be the cause of inferring that B is in D? For either of two
          convertible things can be concluded from the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose, furthermore, that A is predicated of all things in which E
          inheres, but is not convertible. Then it will be necessary to say that
          all the things contained under E form one thing, which is diverse from
          B. For if A were not diverse from B, how could it be true to say that
          A inheres in every B and not vice versa, since A is only in E and in
          B? And so it would follow, if E and B were not diverse, that A would
          not be in more than E. Therefore, suppose that A is in more things
          than D and than E. Then why could not a cause be found explaining why
          it is in all things which are in D? And this cause is B. But we must
          still inquire whether all the things contained under E have one cause.
          Let C be that cause. Thus, therefore, he concludes that a same thing
          turns out to have several causes, but not in the same subject
          according to species. Thus the cause of that which is A is both B and
          C; but B is the cause that A is found in the things contained under D,
          while C is the cause that A is found in the things contained under E.
          And he gives an example from natural things. Let the fact of
          <i>being long-lived</i> be taken as A; <i>quadrupeds</i> as D;
          <i>to have no bile</i>, i.e., in superfluity (which is the cause of
          long life in quadrupeds) as B; <i>birds</i> as E; and
          <i>to be dry</i>, or something of that sort, which is the cause of
          long life, or something of that sort in birds, as C.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (99b7) he raises a problem occasioned by the foregoing. For it
          was stated above that one does not straightway from the beginning
          arrive at something atomic, i.e., at the indivisible, in which is
          found that whose cause is being sought. But straightway many and
          indistinct things are found in which that one thing occurs;
          furthermore, there is not one middle through which this one thing can
          be demonstrated of all, and the causes are several. The doubt
          therefore is this: If some cause is to be taken of these several
          middles, is it to be taken on the side of the primary universal, say
          on the side of A, or on the side of the singulars, i.e., of those
          which are less common, as E and D were taken above, i.e., quadrupeds
          and birds?
        </p>
        <p>
          And he answers this by saying that it is always required to take the
          middles which are nearer the subject, in which the cause of that
          common caused thing is searched for: and it is necessary to proceed
          thus until one readies that which is immediate to the common caused
          thing. And he assigns a reason for this, namely, because that which is
          on the part of what is contained under something common is the cause
          of its being under this common thing; just as is the case if D is
          under B, and if C is the cause of D having B in it. And from this it
          further follows that C is the cause of A’s being in D, and that B is
          the cause of A’s being in C. But A is in B in virtue of itself and
          immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally (99b15), he summarizes what has been said in the entire
          teaching of the <i>Analytics</i>, saying that it is clear from all
          that has been stated—both in the book of the <i>Prior</i> and in this
          book of the <i>Posterior</i> —concerning the syllogism and concerning
          demonstration, both what each is and how each is formed. Furthermore,
          in regard to demonstrative science it is also clear how it comes to
          exist in us. For this pertains to the same thing, because
          demonstration is a syllogism causing scientific knowledge, as has been
          established above.<br /></p

        </p>
        <p>
          After showing how that which is the principle of demonstration in the
          sense of a middle comes to be known, the Philosopher now shows how the
          first common principles come to be known. First, he states his
          intention. Secondly, he pursues it (99b20). He says therefore first
          (99b18), that from what follows it will be clear concerning
          indemonstrable principles both how we come to know them and by what
          habit they are known. However, the plan we shall observe calls for us
          first to propose certain problems touching this matter. Then (99b20)
          he pursues his plan. Concerning this he does two things. First, he
          raises the problem. Secondly, he settles it (99b32). In regard to the
          first he does three things. First, he prefaces something from which
          the need for an inquiry of this kind is indicated. Secondly, he raises
          the questions (99b23). Thirdly, he objects to a question (99b26).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (99b20), that it has already been established
          above that nothing is scientifically known through demonstration,
          unless the first immediate principles are known beforehand. Therefore,
          in order to have scientific knowledge of demonstration, it is useful
          to know how the first principles are acquired.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (99b23) he raises three questions touching this knowledge of the
          principles. The first question is whether the knowledge of all
          immediate principles is the same or not. The second is whether there
          is a science of all immediate principles or of none; or is there
          science of some, and some other type of knowledge of the others. The
          third question is whether the habitual knowledge of those principles
          comes to exist in us after previously not existing, or have they
          always been in us but escaped our notice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (99b26) he objects to the last question to which the others are
          ordered. First, he objects to the second side, saying that it is
          absurd to claim that we have the habitual knowledge of these
          principles but they escape our notice. For it is obvious that those
          who have knowledge of the principles have a knowledge which is more
          certain than that which is acquired through demonstration. But
          knowledge through demonstration cannot be had such that it escapes the
          notice of the one having it. For it was established in the beginning
          of this book that a person who has scientific knowledge of something
          knows that it is impossible for it to be otherwise. Therefore, it is
          far less possible for someone having a knowledge of the first
          principles to have it escape his notice. Yet this absurdity would
          follow, if habitual knowledge of this kind were in us but escaped our
          notice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly (99b28), he objects to the other side. For if a person states
          that we acquire these habits or principles <i>de novo</i> after
          previously not having them, we are left with the further problem of
          how we can know and learn such principles <i>de novo</i> without some
          previous knowledge existing in us: for it is impossible to learn
          anything save from preexisting knowledge, as we have established above
          in regard to demonstration. But the reason why we cannot learn the
          immediate principles from pre-existing knowledge is that pre-existing
          knowledge is more certain, since it is a cause of certitude of the
          things which are made known through it. But no knowledge is more
          certain than the knowledge of these principles. Hence it does not seem
          that we can begin to know them, when previously we did not know.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly (99b30), he concludes from the above two arguments that it is
          neither possible always to have had the knowledge of these principles
          but it escaped our notice, nor possible that such knowledge is
          generated <i>de novo</i> in us to supplant a state of absolute
          ignorance in which no other habitual knowledge was possessed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (99b32) he solves these questions. First, he solves the last one
          Secondly, he solves the first two (100b5). In regard to the first he
          does three things. First, he proposes that some principle of knowing
          must pre-exist in us. Secondly, he shows what it is (99b34). Thirdly,
          he shows how from a pre-existing principle of knowing we attain the
          knowledge of i principles (100a4).
        </p>
        <p>
          He says therefore first (99b32), that there must be in us from the
          beginning a certain cognitive power that exists previously to the
          knowledge of principles, but not such that it is stronger as to
          certitude than the knowledge of principles. Hence the knowledge of
          principles does not come about in us from pre-existing knowledge in
          the same way as things which are known through demonstration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (99b34) he shows what that pre-existing cognitive principle is.
          Apropos of this he posits three grades among animals. The first of
          these is something which seems to be common to all animals, namely,
          that they have a certain connatural faculty [i.e., potency, i.e.,
          power] for estimating about sense-perceptible things. This faculty,
          which is not acquired <i>de novo</i> but follows upon their very
          nature, is called <i>sense</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (99b36) he mentions the second grade, saying that although sense
          is found in all animals, in some of them a sensible impression remains
          after the sense-object is removed, as happens in all the perfect
          animals. But in certain others this does not occur, as in certain
          imperfect animals; say in those which are not capable of progressive
          local movement. And it might perhaps be that in regard to some animals
          an impression remains in regard to certain sense-objects which are
          more vigorous, and not in regard to those which are weaker. Therefore,
          those animals in which no impression of sensible objects remains at
          all have no knowledge except when they are sensing. Similarly, in
          regard to animals in which such an impression is apt to remain, if it
          does not remain in them in the case of certain sensible objects, they
          cannot have any knowledge of them except while they are sensing. But
          animals, in which a trace of such an impression remains, are capable
          of having some knowledge in the mind beyond sense; and these are the
          animals which have <i>memory</i>. Then he mentions the third grade,
          saying that although many animals have memory, among them is a further
          difference. For in some of them reasoning occurs concerning these
          things which remain in the memory, as in men; in others, however, it
          does not, as in brutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (100a1) he shows, in view of the foregoing, how the knowledge of
          first principles comes about in us; and he concludes from the
          foregoing that from sensing comes remembrance in those animals in
          which a sensible impression remains, as has been stated above. But
          from remembrance many times repeated in regard to the same item but in
          diverse singulars arises <i>experience</i>, because experience seems
          to be nothing else than to take something from many things retained in
          the memory.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, experience requires some reasoning about the particulars, in
          that one is compared to another: and this is peculiar to
          <i>reason</i>. Thus, when one recalls that such a herb cured several
          men of fever, there is said to be experience that such a herb cures
          fevers. But reason does not stop at the experience gathered from
          particulars, but from many particulars in which it has been
          experienced, it takes one common item which is consolidated in the
          mind and considers it without considering any of the singulars. This
          common item reason takes as a principle of art and science. For
          example, as long as a doctor considered that this herb cured Socrates
          of fever, and Plato and many other individual men, it is
          <i>experience</i>; but when his considerations arise to the fact that
          such a species of herb heals a fever absolutely, this is taken as a
          <i>rule of the art of medicine</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This, then, is what he means when he says that just as from memory is
          formed experience, so from experience or even from the universal
          resting in the mind (which, namely, is taken as if it is so in
          <i>all</i> cases, just as experience is taken as being so in certain
          cases.—This universal is said to be resting in the mind, inasmuch as
          it is considered outside the singulars, which undergo change.
          Furthermore, he says that it is <i>one outside the many</i>, not
          according to an autonomous existence but according to the
          consideration of the intellect which considers a nature, say of man,
          without referring to Socrates and Plato. But even though it is one
          outside the many according to the intellect’s consideration,
          nevertheless in the sphere of existents it exists in all singulars one
          and the same: not numerically, however, as though the humanity of all
          men were numerically one, but according to the notion of the species.
          For just as <i>this white</i> is similar to <i>that white</i> in
          whiteness, not as though there were one numerical whiteness existing
          in the two, so too Socrates is similar to Plato in humanity, but not
          as though there were numerically one humanity existing in the two.—)
          the principle of <i>art</i> and <i>science</i> is formed in the mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          And he distinguishes between art and science, just as he did in
          <i>Ethics</i> VI, where it is stated that <i>art</i> is right reason
          in regard to things to be made. And so he says here that if from
          experience a universal in regard, to generation is taken, i.e., in
          regard to anything that can be made, say in regard to healing or
          husbandry, this pertains to <i>art</i>. <i>Science</i>, however, as it
          is stated in the same place, is concerned with necessary things; hence
          if the universal bears on things which are always in the same way, it
          pertains to <i>science</i>; for example, if it bears on numbers or
          figures. And this process which has been described is verified in
          regard to the principle of all sciences and arts. Hence he concludes
          that there do not pre-exist, any habits of principles in the sense of
          being determinate and complete, neither do they come to exist anew
          from other better known pre-existing principles in the way that a
          scientific habit is generated in us from previously known principles;
          rather the habits of principles come to exist in us from pre-existing
          sense.

          And he gives as an example a battle which starts after the soldiers
          have been beaten and put to flight. For when one of the soldiers shall
          have, taken a stand, i.e., begun to take a battle position and not
          flee, another takes his stand next to him, and then another, until
          enough are gathered to form the beginning of a battle. So, too, from
          the sense and memory of one particular and then of another and
          another, something is finally reached which is the principle of art
          and science, as has been stated.
        </p>
        <p>
          But someone could believe that sense alone or the mere remembrance of
          singulars is sufficient to cause intellectual knowledge of principles,
          as some of the ancients supposed, who did not discriminate between
          sense and intellect. Therefore, to exclude this the Philosopher adds
          that along with sense it is necessary to presuppose such a nature of
          mind as cannot only suffer this (i.e., be susceptible of universal
          knowledge, which indeed comes to pass in virtue of the possible
          intellect) but can also cause this in virtue of the agent intellect
          which makes things intelligible in act by abstraction of universals
          from singulars.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (100a4) he elucidates something asserted in the preceding
          solution, namely, that the universal is taken from experience bearing
          on singulars. And he says that what was stated above, albeit not
          clearly—namely, how from the experience of singulars the universal is
          formed in the mind—must now be discussed again and explained more
          clearly. For if many singulars are taken which are without differences
          as to some one item existing in them, that one item according to which
          they are not different, once it is received in the mind, is the first
          universal, no matter what it may be, i.e., whether it pertains to the
          essence of the singulars or not. For since we find that Socrates and
          Plato and many others are without difference as to whiteness, we take
          this one item, namely, white, as a universal which is an accident.
          Similarly, because we find that Socrates and Plato and the others are
          not different as to rationality, this one item in which they do not
          differ, namely, rational, we take as a universal which is an essential
          difference.
        </p>
        <p>
          But how this one item can be taken he now explains. For it is clear
          that sensing is properly and <i>per se</i> of the singular, but yet
          there is some how even a sensing of the universal. For sense knows
          Callias not only so far forth as he is Callias, but also as he is this
          man; and similarly Socrates, as he is this man. As a result of such an
          attainment pre-existing in the sense, the intellective soul can
          consider man in both. But if it were in the very nature of things that
          sense could apprehend only that which pertains to particularity, and
          along with this could in no wise apprehend the nature in the
          particular, it would not be possible for universal knowledge to be
          caused in us from sense-apprehension.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then he manifests this same point in the process which goes from
          species to genus. Hence he adds: “Again in these,” namely, in man and
          horse, “the mind lingers in its consideration, until it attains to
          some thing indivisible in them, which is universal.” For example, we
          consider such an animal and another one, say a man and a horse, until
          we arrive at the common item, “animal,” which is universal; and in
          this genus we do the same until we arrive at some higher genus.
          Therefore, since we take a knowledge of universals from singulars, he
          concludes that it is obviously necessary to acquire the first
          universal principles by induction. For that is the way, i.e., by way
          of induction, that the sense introduces the universal into the mind,
          inasmuch as all the singulars are considered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then (1005) he solves the first two question, namely, whether the
          knowledge of first principles is science, or some other habit. In
          regard 1 to this he accepts, from what has been stated above, that the
          knowledge... of principles pertains to the intellect whose function is
          to know the universal: for he says that the universal is a principle
          of science. But in regard to the intellect there are two genera of
          habits, and these are not related to the true in exactly the same way.
          For some are always true, whereas others sometimes receive what is
          false, as in opinion and in those cases of reasoning which can be of
          the true and of the false. Again, there are certain erroneous habits,
          namely, which bear on the false. But because principles are most true,
          it is clear that they do not pertain to habits which are always of the
          false, or even to habits which now and then receive falsity, but only
          to habits which are always of the true. But these are
          <i>science</i> and <i>understanding</i> [i.e., intuition]. (In
          <i>Ethics</i> VI a third one is added, namely, <i>wisdom</i>: but
          because wisdom, as it is stated there, comprehends within itself both
          science and understanding—since it is a science and the chief of the
          sciences—he omits it here). Therefore, leaving this one aside, no
          other genus of knowledge but understanding is more certain than
          science.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now it is plain that the principles of demonstrations are better known
          than the demonstrated conclusions, as was established in Book I.
          Moreover, it cannot be through science that we have those principles,
          because science is the result of reasoning, namely, demonstrative,
          whose principles are the very things about which we are speaking.
          Therefore, because nothing can be truer than science and understanding
          (for wisdom is included in them), what follows from our consideration
          of the foregoing is that, properly speaking, the knowledge of
          principles is understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          He also proves this with another reason, namely, because a
          demonstration is not”of necessity a principle of a demonstration;
          otherwise there would be an infinite process in demonstrations, and
          this was disproved in Book I. Since, therefore, demonstration causes
          science, it follows that science cannot be the principle of science,
          as though the principles of the sciences were made known through
          science. Therefore, if we have no other type of knowledge except
          science which is always true, it follows that understanding will be
          the principle of science, namely, because the principles of the
          sciences are made known through understanding, so far forth, namely,
          that this understanding which is the principle of science is
          cognoscitive of the principles from which science proceeds. But this,
          namely, science, is <i>all</i>, i.e., a whole, which is related to
          every thing (i.e., to the entire matter with which science is
          concerned) in the way that understanding is related to the principles
          of science.
