    <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
    <p>
      Since in some natural bodies certain natural activities appear whose
      principles cannot be, understood, your honor has askted that I write what
      I think about them.
    </p>
    <p><b>Statement of the problem</b></p>
    <p>
      We see indeed that a body follows the movments of the elements governing
      it. A stone, for example, is moved towards the center (of the earth)
      according to the property of earth dominant in it. Metals also have the
      power of cooling according to the property of water. Therefore al actions
      and movements whatsoever of bodies colnposed of elements take place
      according to the property and power of the elements of which such bodies
      are made Now such actions and movements have a clear origin, about which
      there arises no doubt. But there are some workings of these bodies which
      cannot be caused by the powers of the elements: for example, the magnet
      attracts iron, and certain medicines purge particular humors in definite
      parts of the body. Actions of this sort, therefore, must Je traced to
      higher principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must now consider that an agent of a lower rank acts or is moved
      according to the power of a superior agent in two ways: one way in so far
      as the action prcceeds from it according to a form and power imparted by a
      superior agent, as the moon illuminated through light received froa the
      sun. In another way it acts only through the power of the superior agent,
      without receiving a form for acting. It is moved only through the motion
      of the superior agent, as a carpenter uses a saw for cutting. The sawing
      is indeed primarily the work of the artisan but secondarily of the saw in
      so far as it is moved by the artisan—not because such an action follows
      upon some form and power which might stay in the saw after the artisan has
      used it. If, then, elementary bodies share in the actions or movements of
      superior agents, it ought to be in one or the other of the above mentioned
      ways; either the actions result from forns and powers implanted by
      superior agents in the elementary bodies, or the actions merely follow
      upon the movement of the elementary bodies by thesuperior agents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Superior agents which exceed the nature of elements and elementary bodies
      are not only heavenly bodies, but also superior separated substances. Each
      of them produces in inferior bodies actions or movements which do not
      spring from a form implanted in the inferior 'bodies,.but which come
      solely from the movement of the superior agents. For the sea, in its ebb
      and flow, has this motion over and above the property of the element
      (water) from the power of the moon, not indeed thrcugh an implanted form,
      but through the moon's movement, which agitates the water. Then again
      necromantic images have effects which do not issue from form; they may
      have received, but from demons who are active in the images. And we think
      the same thing sometimes happens through the action of God or the good
      angels. For the fact, that sick people were cured at the shadow of Peter
      the Apostle or that some illness is dispelled upon contact with a saint's
      relics, is not attributable to a form implanted in these bodies, but only
      to the divine power which uses the bodies for these results.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is clear that not all the workings of elementary bodies manifesting
      occult operations are like these. Firstly, the said workings, since they
      do not arise from some implanted form, are not found commonly in every
      individual of the same species: for not every bone nor all the relics of
      the saint heal upon touch, but those of some at some times. And so neither
      does every image have effects of this sort, nor does all water flow and
      ebb according to the movement of the moon. But certain secret workings are
      found in some bodies which are likewise found in all which are of the same
      species—for example, every magnet attracts iron. Whence it follows that
      these (latter) activities arise from an intrinsc principle common to
      things of the same species. Secondly, activities, which have been
      mentioned above, do not always proceed from habits of this sort. The
      evident proof for this is that they do not proceed from a power residing
      and permanent in them, but only from the motion of a superior agent—just
      as the saw does not always cut wood brought into contact with it, but only
      when it is moved for this purpose by an artisan. Certain occult workings,
      however, arise from inferior bodies, which whenever they are used,
      themselves being passive, produce the same effects, as rhubarb always
      purges a definite humor. And from this it is concluded that the action
      arises from some power residing and permanent in the body.
    </p>
    <p><b>Explanation</b></p>
    <p>
      It remains now to consider wha: is that permanent intrinsic principle from
      which such activities proceed. Clearly this principle is some potency: for
      the interilal principle by which an agent acts or suffers action we call a
      potency. And indeed this potency according as it is referred to the limit
      of anything's possible activity receives the name and description of
      power. Now the power which is the principle of such actions and passions
      is shown to be derived especially from the specific form of a thing; for
      every accident which is proper to some species, is derived from the
      essential principles of that species. Hence it is that to explain the
      characteristic passions of their subjects we take for the cause a
      definition designating the essential principles of the thing. But the
      principle of essence and <i>quidditas</i> is a form existing in
      determinate matter. Therefore such povrers ought to proceed from forms of
      things according as they exist in their own matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, since the nature of a thing is termed its form and matter, if a
      power of a thing should not be derived from them, it will not be a power
      natural to the thing, and consequently no activity or passion proceeding
      from such a power will be natural. Now such activities which go beyond
      nature are not abiding—for example, that water when heated heats; but
      secret activities of which we are now speaking are always the same, or as
      often as possible. Hence the conclusion that powers which are the
      principles of these actions are essential and proceed from a form
      according as it exists in such matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Platonists indeed were wont to attribute the principle of substantial
      forms to separated substances which they called species or ideas, the
      individual representations of which they said were natural forms implanted
      in matter. But this principle cannot be sufficient. First, the thing
      making ought to be like the thing made. Now that which comes about in
      natural things is not iorm, but a mixture of matter and form; for to this
      purpose something is made, that it be. Properly it is said to be the
      subsistent composite whereas the form is said to be that whereby something
      is. Therefore, that which comes to be is not rightly form but a composite,
      and that which makes natural things to be is not only form but the
      composite.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, forms existing apart from matter ought to be unmoved, because
      movement is an act of something in potency, which is the case with prime
      matter. And so these forms ought to be unchangeable. Now from a cause that
      is always the same proceed forms that are always the same. But this is not
      evident in the forms of inferior bodies, because of the coming-to-be and
      passing-away of these bodies. Therefore, of these corruptible bodies the
      principles ol their forms are heavenly bodies, which, being different
      according to their rise and fall, cause coming-to-be and passing-away in
      inferior bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, such forms are derived from separated substances as first
      principles, which, through the power and movement of heavenly bodies,
      impress upon corporeal matter forms which they can understand in
      themselves. And, since we have shown that activities and powers of natural
      things are caused by their specific forms, it follows that they may be
      traced back further, namely to higher principles, to heavenly bodies or to
      the powers of heavenly bodies, and still further to separated intellectual
      substances.
    </p>
    <p>
      A trace of both of these princples is evident in the very workings of
      natural things; for the fact, that the activities of Nature take place
      with a certain change and according to a definite interval of time, is due
      to a heavenly body upon whose movement the reckoning of time is based. But
      due to separated intellectual substances one finds in the operations of
      Nature that they proceed along fixed paths to determined ends, with order
      and in a most fitting way, like those things which are made by human
      skill; so that the whole work of Nature seems to be the achievement of a
      wise agent. Thus Nature is said to act with wisdom. Now the work of a wise
      man ought be well-ordered; for we say rightly that this is characteristic
      of the sage, that he disposes of all things harmoniously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, because the forms of inferior things arise from the wisdom of
      separated substances through the intermedary of the power and movement of
      heavenly bodies, some order ought to be found among these forms of
      inferior bodies, and in such a way, namely, that some are less perfect and
      closer to natter, while others, however are more perfect and closer to
      superior agents. The most imperfect forms, though, and especially close to
      matter, are the forms of elements, of which the inferior bodies are
      composed as regards their matter. And these (inferior bodies) are indeed
      the nore noble (the more) that, being removed from a contrariety of
      elements, they approach uniformity of composition, and thus become in some
      way or other like to havenly bodies, which are free of all contrariety.
      Now that which is composed of contraries is neither of the contraries in
      act but cnly in potency. And therefore the greater the uniformity of
      mixture which such bodies approach, so much the more noble a form do they
      receive froin God. Such is the human body, which, enjoying a most uniform
      composition, as the excellence of touch in men indicates, has a most noble
      form, namely a rational soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Powers and activities ought to be in proportion to the forms from which
      they proceed. And thus it is that the forms of elements which are for the
      most part material give rise to active and passive qualities, for example,
      heat and cold, moisture and dryness and other similar things which regard
      the distribution of matter. But the forms of mixtures, namely of inanimate
      bodies like stones, metals, minerals, in addition ls to the powers and
      activities which they share with the elements of which they are composed,
      have certain other more noble virtues and activities arising from specific
      forms—for instance, gold gladdens the heart and the sapphire stops
      bleeding. Thus, always in an ascending order, the more noble the specific
      forms, so much the more excellent are the powers and operations which come
      from them, till that most noble form, the rational soul, is reached, which
      has intellectual power and activities which not only surpass the power and
      activity of the elements but also every corporeal power and activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now from the forms at either end of the scale we ought to pass judgment on
      the forms in between. For as the power of heating and cooling is in fire
      and water as a result of their special forms, and as man's intellectual
      power and activity arise from his rational soul, so all powers and
      activities of things in between which exceed the virtues of the elements,
      arise from their proper forms, and are traced back to higher principles,
      to the powers of heavenly bodies, and still further to separated
      substances. For from these principles the forms of inferior bodies are
      derived, the rational sod alone excepted, which so proceeds from an
      immaterial cause, that is, from God, that it is in no way the product of
      the power of heavenly bodies. Otherwise it could not have intellectual
      power and activity wholly free of the body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, because such powers and workings are derived from a specific
      form which is common to all the individuals of the same species, it is
      impossible for an individual of a species to have some kind of power or
      activity beyond the otker individuals of the same species, just because it
      came into being under a definite configuration of heavenly bodies. Yet it
      is possible that in an individual of the same species the power and
      activity arising from the species should be found more or less intense
      according to a diverse distriburion of matter and the different
      configuration of the heavenly botlies at the coming into being of this or
      that individual.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this it is further evident that artificial forms are certain
      accidents which do not arise from the species. For it is impossible that
      an artificial product can have or share in a heavenly body's operation and
      virtue, in order that, through some endowed power, it might effect natural
      results transcending the virtue of the elements. If there were any such
      powers in artificial things they would not arise from a form (impressed)
      by heavenly bodies, since the form produced) by the artisan is nothing
      other than order, composition and shape, from which such powers and
      activities cannot come Clearly, then, if artificial things evidence some
      such powers—for example, should serpents die at the sight of some
      sculpture or animals be paralyzed in their tracks or suffer injury—it does
      not come from same impressed and permanent virtue but from the power of an
      external agent, which uses these things as instruments for its own
      results.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor can it be said tha: such activities result from the power of heavenly
      bodies, becausc they act only in a natural way on those inferior things.
      And that a body has such and such a shape does not make it either more or
      less suitable for receiving the impression of a natural agent. Thus it is
      impossible, that images or sculptures which are nade for producing
      extraordinary effects should have their efficacy from heavenly bodies,
      although they seem to be made under certain constellation. They have it
      only from superior agents which work through inages and sculptures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as images are made from natural matter, but get their form through
      human skill, so also human words have indeed their matter, that is, the
      sounds produced by the mouth of man, but they have their meaning and as it
      were their form from the intellect expressing its concepts through such
      sounds. And so, for a like reason, human words do not have any efficacy
      for changing a natural body through the power of some natural cause, but
      only through some spiritual substance.
    </p>
    <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
    <p>
      For these works which are effected through such words, or through any kind
      of image or sculpture, or any such things, are not natural, because they
      do not spring froin an iutrinsic but only froin an extrinsic virtue.
      Rather they are to be classed as superstition. The activities, however,
      which we have said above arise from the forms of things are natural,
      because they proceed from internal principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so let what has been said about occult workings and activities suffice
      for the present.
