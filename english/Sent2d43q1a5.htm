            Furthermore, Gregory, expounding upon Job 39 "The cry of the
            leaders" etc. (in his
            <i>Moralium</i>), says that the vices which first take possession of
            the mind conquer man with a sort of reasoning, persuading, as it
            were, after the manner of a leader. But afterwards the mind is
            dissipated irrationally by diverse vices. But the sin against the
            Holy Spirit withdraws most greatly from the persuasion of reason.
            Therefore, it cannot be first, but appears, rather, to follow upon
            other sins.

            ><i>Objection 3:</i> Furthermore, the Philosopher says in Book V of
            the <i>Nichomachean Ethics</i> that it is not in the power of a
            person to do unjust acts immediately, as the unjust so do (see V. 9.
            1137a4-9 of that work, and 1074 of Aquinas's commentary on the
            <i>NE</i>). But the unjust do unjust acts with pleasure and by
            choice. Therefore, it is not in the power of man that he immediately
            and by choice commits sin. However, everyone who sins against the
            Holy Spirit, sins through choice. Therefore, in the first act of
            sin, one is unable to sin against the Holy Spirit.

            despair, so too are merits opposed to demerits. But hope presupposes
            merits. For hope is a definite expectation of future beatitude
            gifted to one by reason of merit and grace. Therefore, despair
            presupposes demerits. At the least, this species of the sin against

            frequenter oriatur; sicut fraus assignatur filia avaritiae, quae
            tamen potest ex luxuria vel ex alio vitio oriri, quamvis ex avaritia
            saepius oriatur. illud autem peccatum habet aptitudinem ut ex eo
            aliud oriatur, cujus objectum est vehementius appetibile, ut supra
            dictum est. hoc autem est quod habet majorem apparentiam boni. unde

            ><i>Response:</i> As was said previously in the body of dist. 42,
            art. 3 (where one sin is said to arise from another), one does not
            consider what always happens, but what happens for the most part on
            account of an aptitude that one sin has that frequently arises by
            reason of another, just as fraud is designated as an offspring of
            avarice which, nevertheless, can arise from luxuria or because of
            some other vice, although it more often arises from avarice.
            However, that sin has an aptitude so that from it another (sin)
            arises whose object is more vehemently desirable, as was said
            previously. This comes about in so far as it has the greater
            appearance of good. Hence, that sin whose object most greatly
            withdraws one from the nature of good, is least able to be first.
            But as it is that which arises always or more frequently from
            another, this (latter) sort (of sin) is the sin against the Holy
            Spirit, as it is determined to be a definite sin. It is for this
            reason that it more often, and as it were always, follows upon
            another sin. Nonetheless, it is thus possible for man in the first
            act of sin to sin against the Holy Spirit, and particularly with
            respect to two ultimate kinds, namely resisting the known truth, and
            envy of the spiritual graces by which we are reconciled (to the
            Father). For these very species seem to possess a greater
            distinction from the other (species of the sin against the Holy
            Spirit). However, this also happens to the other species (of the sin
            against the Holy Spirit), if the matter is diligently considered.
            Upon examining the diverse kinds of human states of life, one can
            immediately throw off hope for future glory (that is, despair) on
            account of the difficulty in arriving at it, and on account of the
            delights of those who do not take care for it. And in this,
            similarly, the soul of such a one stands firm so that in all these
            things, he follows his own will, which is obstinacy, and thus with
            respect to the other (species of the sin against the Holy
            Spirit).</font

            ><i>Response to Objection 3:</i> As was said above, the sin against
            the Holy Spirit is not from choice in this way, namely, the way in
            which a person who has a habit sins out of choice. On the contrary,
            through an act of sin against the Holy Spirit, some habit is
            acquired from preceding habits. And for this reason the objection
            does not proceed because the unjust sin by reason of choice as
            having a habit.</font

            actual merits, but only in the intention of the one who hopes. In
            like manner, it is not fitting that despair presupposes some actual
            preceding demerit.</font

            ><i>Response to Objection 5:</i> Repentance, in so far as it
            designates an act, is not a reality unless it deals with past evils.
            In so far, however, as it designates a habit, by which one is called
            a penitent, it is not required that a sin have been committed, but
            that one have this intention, such that if one happens to commit a
            sin, one would repent immediately. In like manner this suffices for
            the notion of impenitence so that someone never repents concerning
            his sins, if he commits them.</font
