    It seems to be a power, for
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. After mentioning synderesis, Jerome says: “We see that this conscience is
    cast down headlong at times.” From this it seems that conscience and
    synderesis are the same thing. But synderesis is in some sense a power.
    Therefore, conscience is, too.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. Only a power of the soul is the subject of a vice. But conscience is the
    subject of the defilement of sin, as is clear from Titus (1:15): “Both their
    mind and their conscience are defiled.” Therefore, conscience is a power.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. It was said that the defilement is not in conscience as in a subject. —On
    the contrary, nothing numerically the same can be defiled and clean, unless
    it is the subject of defilement. But everything which is changed from
    defilement to cleanness while remaining numerically the same, is clean at
    one time and defiled at another. Therefore, everything which is changed from
    defilement to cleanness, or the converse, is a subject of defilement and
    cleanness. But conscience is changed from defilement to cleanness, according
    to Hebrews (9:14): “How much more shall the blood of Christ... cleanse our
    conscience from dead works to serve the living God.” Therefore, conscience
    is a power.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    4. Conscience is said to be a dictate of reason, a dictate which is nothing
    else but the judgment of reason. But a judgment of reason pertains to free
    choice from which it gets its name. Therefore, free choice and conscience
    seem to be the same thing. But free choice is a power. Therefore, so is
    conscience.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    5. Basil says that conscience is “the natural power of judgment.” But the
    natural power of judgment is synderesis. But synderesis is in some sense a
    power. Therefore, so is conscience.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    6. Sin exists only in the will or in the reason. But sin exists in
    conscience. Therefore, conscience is the reason or the will. But reason and
    will are powers. Therefore, conscience is, too.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    7. Neither a habit nor an act is said to know. But conscience is said to
    know, according to Ecclesiastes (7:23): “For thy conscience knoweth that
    thou also hast often spoken evil of others.” Therefore, conscience is not a
    habit or an act. Therefore, it is a power.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    8. Origen says that conscience is “a correcting and guiding spirit
    accompanying the soul, by which the soul is kept free from evil and made to
    cling to good.” But spirit designates a power or even the essence of the
    soul. Therefore, conscience designates a power.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    9. Conscience is an act, a habit, or a power. But it is not an act, because
    it does not always remain in act, for its act is not present in one who is
    asleep. Yet one who is asleep is said to have conscience. Nor is it a habit.
    Therefore, it is a power.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">Difficulties (Second Series)</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. That it is not a habit is shown in this way: No habit of reason deals
    with individual things. But. conscience is concerned with particular acts.
    Therefore, conscience is not a habit of reason. It is not a habit of any
    other power since conscience pertains to reason.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. In reason there are only speculative and operative habits. But conscience
    is not a speculative habit, since it has an ordination to activity. Nor is
    it an operative habit, since it is neither an art nor prudence. And the
    Philosopher puts only these in the operative part. Therefore, conscience is
    not a habit.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    That it is not an art is clear. That it is not prudence is proved in this
    way: Prudence is the correct ordering of acts, as is said in the
    <i>Ethics.</i> But it does not consider individual actions, for, since there
    are an infinite number of these, there can be no ordering of them. Again, it
    would follow that prudence, taken in itself, would be essentially increased
    as it considered many individual actions. But this does not seem to be true.
    However, conscience considers individual actions. Therefore, conscience is
    not prudence.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. It was said that conscience is a habit by which the universal judgment of
    reason is applied to a particular undertaking.—On the contrary, two habits
    are not needed for something which one can do. But one who has habitual
    knowledge of a universal can make the application to singulars with the
    intervention of the sensitive faculty alone. Thus, from the habit by which
    one knows that all mules are sterile, he will know that this mule is sterile
    when through his senses he perceives that this is a mule. Therefore, a habit
    is not needed for the application of a universal judgment to a particular
    act. Thus, conscience is not a habit. We conclude as before.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    4. Every habit is either natural, infused, or acquired. But conscience is
    not a natural habit because such a habit is the same in all men. But not all
    men have the same conscience. Again, it is not an infused habit, because
    such a habit is always correct. But conscience is sometimes erroneous.
    Again, it is not an acquired habit, because, if it were, conscience would
    not exist in children or in a man before he had acquired it through many
    acts. Therefore, it is not a habit. We conclude as before.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    5. According to the Philosopher, a habit is acquired from many acts. But one
    has conscience from one act. Therefore, conscience is not a habit.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    6. The Gloss indicates that conscience in the damned is a punishment. But a
    habit is not a punishment; rather it is a perfection of the one who has it.
    Therefore, it is not a habit.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary (First Series)</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. Conscience seems to be a habit. For, according to Damascene, it is “the
    law of our understanding.” But the law of our understanding is the habit of
    the universal principles of law. Therefore, conscience i a habit.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. The Gloss on Romans (2:14) says: “Although the Gentiles do not have the
    written law, they have the natural law, which each one understands and by
    which he is conscious of what is good and what is evil.” From this it seems
    that the natural law is that by which one is conscious. But everyone is
    conscious through consciousness (<i>conscientia</i>) <i>.</i> Therefore,
    conscience (<i>conscientia</i>) is the natural law. We conclude as before.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. Science denotes habitual knowledge of conclusions. But conscience is
    scientific knowledge. Therefore, it is a habit.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    4. A habit is formed by repeated acts. But one acts repeatedly according to
    conscience. Therefore, from such acts a habit is formed, which can be called
    conscience.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    5. On the first Epistle to Timothy (1:5), “Now the end of the commandment is
    charity, from a pure heart, and a good conscience, and an unfeigned faith,”
    the Gloss says: “A good conscience, that is, hope.” But hope is a habit.
    Therefore, conscience is, too.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    6. That which is implanted in us by God seems to be an infused habit. But,
    according to Damascene,” just as the tendency to sin is implanted in us by
    the devil, so conscience is implanted in us by God. Therefore, conscience is
    an infused habit.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    7. According to the Philosopher, everything which is in the soul is habit,
    faculty, or passion. But conscience is not a passion, for by such things we
    do not merit or demerit, nor are we praised or blamed for them, as the
    Philosopher also says. Nor is conscience a power, for a power cannot be set
    aside, but conscience can be set aside. Therefore, conscience is a habit.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <i>To the Contrary (Second Series):</i>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. Conscience seems to be an act, for it is said to accuse and excuse. But
    one is not accused or excused unless he is actually considering something.
    Therefore, conscience is an act.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. Knowledge which consists in comparison is actual knowledge. But
    conscience denotes knowledge with comparison. For one is said to be
    conscious (<i>conscire</i>), that is, to know together (simul <i>scire</i>)
    <i>.</i> Therefore, conscience is actual knowledge.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Some say that conscience can have three meanings. For, at times it is taken
    for the thing itself of which one is conscious, just as faith is taken for
    the thing believed. Sometimes it is taken for the power by which we are
    conscious, and sometimes for the habit. And some say that it is also taken
    for the act. The reason for this distinction seems to be that, since there
    is an act of conscience, and since an object, a power, a habit, and the act
    itself are considered with reference to the act, we sometimes find a name
    which is used equivocally for all four of these. Thus, the name
    <i>understanding</i> sometimes signifies the thing understood
    (<i>intellectam</i>), as names are said to denote concepts
    (<i>intellectus</i>); sometimes, it signifies the intellective power itself;
    sometimes, a habit, and, sometimes, an act.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    However, with names such as these, the commonly accepted meaning should be
    followed, because words should be used in their more common signification,
    as is said in the Topics. But the name <i>conscience</i>, according to
    common usage, seems at times to be used for the thing of which one is
    conscious, as when one says: “I will reveal my conscience to you,” that is,
    what is in my conscience. But this title cannot properly be given to the
    power or the habit, but only to the act. For all the things which are
    attributed to conscience fit only this meaning.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    We must bear in mind that it is not customary to have one name for a power,
    an act, and a habit, unless the act is proper to the power or habit, as to
    see is proper to the power of sight, and to know is proper to the habit of
    knowledge. As a result, sight sometimes means the power and sometimes the
    act. Knowledge is used in a similar way. However, if there is an act which
    is proper to many or all habits or powers, it is not customary to indicate a
    power or a habit by such a name of the act. This is clear with the noun
    <i>use,</i> for it denotes the act of any habit and power, since
    <i>use</i> belongs to that of which it is the act. Hence, this name
    <i>use</i> so signifies an act that it does not mean a habit or a power at
    all.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    This seems to be the case with conscience. For the name
    <i>conscience</i> means the application of knowledge to something. Hence, to
    be conscious (<i>conscire</i>) means to know together (<i>simul scire).</i>
    But any knowledge can be applied to a thing. Hence, conscience cannot denote
    a special habit or power, but designates the act itself, which is the
    application of any habit or of any knowledge to sonic particular act.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Moreover, knowledge is applied to an act in two ways. According to one way,
    we consider whether the act exists or has existed; according to the other,
    whether it is correct or not. According to the first mode of application, we
    are said to have conscience [that is, consciousness] of an act inasmuch as
    we know that the act has been placed or has not been placed, as happens in
    the common manner of speaking when one says: “As far as my conscience
    [consciousness] is concerned, this has not taken place; that is, I do not
    know or I did not know whether this took place.” It is according to this
    manner of speaking that we understand the passage in Genesis (4 3:2 2): “We
    cannot tell [ <i>non est in conscientiis nostris</i> ] who put it (the
    money) in our bags”; and the passage in Ecclesiastes (7:23): “For thy
    conscience knoweth that thou also hast often spoken evil of others.” It is
    according to this that conscience is said to bear witness of some thing, as
    in Romans (9:1): “my conscience bearing me witness...”
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    According to the second mode of application, by which knowledge is applied
    to an act, so that one knows whether the act is right or not, there is a
    double course. There is one according to which we are directed through the
    habit of scientific knowledge to do or not to do something. There is a
    second according to which the act, after it has taken place, is examined
    with reference to the habit of knowledge to see whether it was right or not.
    This double course in matters of action is distinguished according to the
    double course which exists in things speculative, that is, the process of
    discovery and the process of judging. For the process by which through
    scientific knowledge we look for what should be done, as it were taking
    counsel with ourselves, is similar to discovery, through which we proceed
    from principles to conclusions. The other process, through which we examine
    those things which already have been done and consider whether they are
    right, is like the process of judging, through which we reduce conclusions
    to principles.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    We use the name <i>conscience</i> for both of these modes of application.
    For, in so far as knowledge is applied to an act, as directive of that act,
    conscience is said to prod or urge or bind. But, in so far as knowledge is
    applied to act, by way of examining things which have already taken place,
    conscience is said to accuse or cause remorse, when that which has been done
    is found to be out of harmony with the knowledge according to which it is
    examined; or to defend or excuse, when that which has been done is found to
    have proceeded according to the form of the knowledge.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    But we must bear in mind that in the first application, in which scientific
    knowledge is applied to an act to know whether it has taken place, it is
    application to a particular act of sensitive knowledge, as of memory,
    through which we recall what was done, or of sense, through which we
    perceive the particular act in which we are now engaged. But in the second
    and third applications, by which we deliberate about what should be done, or
    examine what has already been done, the operative habits of reason are
    applied to an act. These are the habit of synderesis and the habit of
    wisdom, which perfect higher reason, and the habit of scientific knowledge,
    which perfects lower reason. Of these, either all are applied at the same
    time, or only one of them is applied. We examine what we have done according
    to these habits, and, according to them, we take counsel about what should
    be done. Examination, however, concerns not only what has been done, but
    also what is to be done. But counsel concerns only what is to be done.

    <span style="font-weight: bold"
      >Answers to Difficulties (First Series)</span
    >
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. When Jerome says: “We see that this conscience is cast down headlong at
    times,” synderesis, which he calls a spark of conscience, is not indicated,
    but conscience itself, which he had mentioned earlier. Or we can say that
    the whole force of conscience, as examining or taking counsel, depends on
    the judgment of synderesis, just as the whole truth of speculative reason
    depends on first principles. Therefore, he calls conscience
    <i>synderesis</i> in so far as conscience acts by reason of its power. This
    answer is especially apt because he wanted to show how synderesis can fail.
    For it does not err in regard to universal principles, but only in regard to
    the application to individual acts. Thus, synderesis does not err in itself,
    but, in a sense, errs in conscience. Therefore, he joins conscience with
    synderesis to explain this failure of synderesis.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. Defilement is not said to be in conscience as in a subject, but as the
    thing known is in knowledge. For one is said to have a defiled conscience
    when he is conscious within himself of some defilement.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. A defiled conscience is said to be cleansed, in so far as one who was
    earlier conscious of sin knows later that he has been cleansed from the sin.
    Thus, he is said to have a pure conscience. Accordingly, it is the same
    conscience which first was unclean and later clean, not, however, in the
    sense that conscience is the subject of cleanness and uncleanness, but that
    through examination made by conscience both are known. It is not that it is
    numerically the same act by which one knew he was unclean before and knows
    he is clean afterwards, but that both are known from the same principles,
    just as consideration which proceeds from the same principles is called the
    same.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    4. The judgments of conscience and of free choice differ to some extent and
    correspond to some extent. For they correspond in this, that both refer to
    this particular act. However, the judgment of conscience applies to it in so
    far as conscience examines it. On this point the judgment of both conscience
    and free choice differ from the judgment of synderesis. They differ from
    each other, since the judgment of conscience consists simply in knowledge,
    whereas the judgment of free choice consists in the application of knowledge
    to the inclination of the will. This is the judgment of choice.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Thus, it sometimes happens that the judgment of free choice goes astray, but
    not the judgment of conscience. For example, one debates something which
    presents itself to be done here and now and judges, still speculating as it
    were in the realm of principles, that it is evil, for instance, to fornicate
    with this woman. However, when he comes to apply this to the act, many
    circumstances relevant to the act present themselves from all sides, for
    instance, the pleasure of the fornication, by the desire of which reason is
    constrained, so that its dictates may not issue into choice. Thus, one errs
    in choice and not in conscience. Rather, he acts against conscience and is
    said to do this with an evil conscience, in so far as the deed does not
    agree with the judgment based on knowledge. Thus, it is clear that it is not
    necessary for conscience to be the same as free choice.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    5. Conscience is called the natural power of judgment in so far as the whole
    examination or counseling of conscience depends on the natural power of
    judgment, as we said earlier.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    6. Sin is in the reason and the will as in a subject, but it is in
    conscience in a different way, as has been said.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    7. Conscience is said to know something not in a proper sense, but in the
    sense that knowledge is predicated of that by which we know.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    8. Conscience is called spirit, that is, an impulse of our spirit, just as
    reason is called spirit.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    9. Conscience is neither a power nor a habit, but an act. And, although the
    act of conscience does not always exist, and does not exist in one who is
    asleep, the act itself remains in its principle, that is, in habits which
    can be applied to act.

    1. Conscience is called the law of our understanding because it is a
    judgment of reason derived from the natural law.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2.One is said to be conscious within himself through the natural law, in the
    sense in which one is said to deliberate according to principles, but he is
    conscious within himself through conscience, in the sense in which he is
    said to deliberate by means of the very act of consideration.

    4. From these acts there does not arise a habit of a different mode from the
    habit by which the acts are elicited, but either a habit of the same nature
    is formed, as the habit of love is formed from acts of infused charity, or
    an already present habit is strengthened, as in one who has acquired the
    habit of temperance from repeated acts, the habit itself is strengthened.
    Accordingly, since the act of conscience proceeds from a habit of wisdom and
    science, a new habit will not be formed from them, but those habits will be
    perfected.

    6. Even natural habits exist in us because they were put there by God.
    Consequently, since conscience is an act proceeding from the natural habit
    of synderesis, God is said to have imprinted it in the way in which He is
    said to be the source of all knowledge of truth which is in us. For God
    endows our nature with the knowledge of first principles.

    7. Act is included in habit in that division of the Philosopher because he
    had proved that habits are formed from acts, and that habits were the
    principle of similar acts. Accordingly, conscience is not a passion nor a
    power, but an act, which is reduced to a habit.

        3 Synderesis is “a spark of conscience,” as Jerome says. Therefore,
        conscience is related to synderesis as fire is to a spark. But the
        activity and movement of a fire and of a spark [from it] are the same.
        Therefore, the activity and movement of conscience and synderesis are
        also the same. But synderesis is never mistaken. Therefore, neither is
        conscience.

        4. According to Damascene, conscience is the “law of our understanding.”
        But the law of our understanding is more certain than the understanding
        itself, and, “understanding is always correct,” as is said in
        <i>The Soul.</i> Therefore, with much greater reason, conscience is
        always correct.

        5. Reason, in so far as it is coincident with synderesis, does not make

        the witness in the divine court, as is clear from Romans(2:15): “their

        never can be deceived, it seems that conscience can never err.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        As is clear from what has been said, conscience is nothing but the
        application of knowledge to some special act. Error, however, can occur
        in this application in two ways; in one, because that which is applied
        has error within it, and, in the other, because the application is
        faulty. Thus, in using a syllogism, mistakes can happen in two ways:
        either from the use of false premises, or from faulty construction of
        the syllogism. But this use of something false takes place only in one
        of the premises and not in the other. For, as has been said, through
        conscience the knowledge of synderesis and of higher and lower reason
        are applied to the examination of a particular act.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        However, since the act is particular and the judgment of synderesis is
        universal, the judgment of synderesis can be applied to the act only if
        some particular judgment is used as the minor premise. Sometimes, higher
        reason furnishes this particular judgment; sometimes, lower reason does.
        Thus, the act of conscience is the result of a kind of particular
        syllogism. For example, if the judgment of synderesis expresses this
        statement: “I must not do anything which is forbidden by the law of
        God,” and if the knowledge of higher reason presents this minor premise:
        “Sexual intercourse with this woman is forbidden by the law of God,” the
        application of conscience will be made by concluding: “I must abstain
        from this intercourse.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Error has no place in the general judgment of synderesis, as is clear
        from what we have said earlier, but a mistake can occur in the judgment
        of higher reason, as happens when one judges something to be licit or
        illicit which is not, as heretics who believe that oaths are forbidden
        by God. Therefore, mistakes occur in conscience because of the error
        which existed in the higher part of reason. Similarly, error can occur
        in conscience because of error which exists in the lower part of reason,
        as happens when one is mistaken about civil norms of what is just or
        unjust, good or bad. Error also occurs because conscience does not make
        a correct application to acts. For, as in constructing speculative
        syllogisms one can neglect the proper form of argumentation, and thus
        arrive at a false conclusion, so he can do the same in practical
        syllogisms, as has been said.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Still, we must remember that in some things conscience can never make a
        mistake, namely, when the particular act to which conscience is applied
        has a universal judgment about it in synderesis. For, as in speculative
        matters, error does not occur when we are dealing with particular
        conclusions which are derived directly from universal principles and
        expressed in the same terms—as for instance, no one is deceived in the
        judgment: “This whole is greater than its part,” just as no one is
        deceived in the judgment: “Every whole is greater than its part”—so,
        too, no conscience can err in the judgments: “I should not love God” or
        “Some evil should be done.” For, in each of these syllogisms, the
        speculative as well as the practical, the major premise is self-evident
        in so far as it exists in the universal judgment, and the minor, by
        means of which the particular predication of identity is made, is also
        self-evident. This is the case when one says: “Every whole is greater
        than its part. This whole is a whole. Therefore, it is greater than its
        part.”

        1. Conscience is called the natural power of judgment in so far as it is
        a conclusion derived from that power. And in this conclusion there can
        be error; not, however, because of error in the natural power of
        judgment, but because of an error of the particular judgment used in the
        minor premise or because of a faulty reasoning process, as has been
        said.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Conscience adds to scientific knowledge the application of that
        knowledge to a particular act. There can be error in the application,
        although there is not error in the scientific knowledge itself. Or we
        should say that, when I say conscience, I do not imply scientific
        knowledge (<i>scientia</i>) alone, taken strictly in so far as it deals
        only with things which are true, but taken in the broad sense for any
        knowledge (<i>notitia</i>) <i>.</i> In this sense, according to the
        common use of the word, we say that we know (<i>scire</i>) everything
        with which we are acquainted (<i>novisse</i>) <i>.</i>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Just as the spark is that part of fire which is purer and hovers
        above the whole fire, so synderesis is that which is supreme in the
        judgment of conscience#And it is according to this metaphor that
        synderesis is called a spark of conscience, nor is it necessary for the
        relation between synderesis and conscience to be the same as that
        between a spark and fire in all other respects. Yet, even in material
        fire the fire receives some modification because a foreign element is
        added to it, a modification which a spark, because of its purity, does
        not receive. So, too, some error can find its way into conscience
        because it has to do with particulars, which are, as it were, matter
        foreign to reason. This error does not occur in synderesis existing in
        its purity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. Conscience is called the law of understanding by reason of that which
        it has from synderesis. It is never this, but something else which is
        the source of error, as has been said.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. Although reason does not err because it is united to synderesis,
        still, when higher or lower reason is mistaken, it can be applied to
        synderesis, just as a false minor premise is united with a true major.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. The testimony of witnesses is decisive in court when it cannot be
        shown false through other clear evidence. But, in one whose conscience
        is erroneous, the testimony of his conscience is shown to be false by
        the very dictate of synderesis. Thus, in the divine court not the
        testimony of a mistaken conscience, but the dictates of the natural law,
        will be decisive.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. Not conscience, but synderesis, is the first rule of human activity.
        Conscience, however, is a kind of rule which is itself regulated. Hence,
        it is not strange that it can make mistakes.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. The hope which is based on a correct conscience has certainty, and
        this hope is freely given hope. However, the hope which is based on a
        false conscience is that of which it is said: “The hope of the wicked
        shall perish” (Proverbs 10:2 8).

        1. No one is bound to do anything except by some law. But man does not

        Conscience is certainly binding. But, to see how it binds, we must bear
        in mind that binding, taken metaphorically from corporeal things and
        applied to spiritual, means imposing necessity. For he who is bound must
        necessarily stay in the place where he is bound, and the power to go off
        to other places is taken away from him. Hence, it is clear that binding
        has no place in things which have internal necessity. For we cannot say
        that fire is bound to rise, although it is necessary for it to rise.
        Binding, then, has place only in things which are necessary with a
        necessity imposed by something else.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Now, there is a twofold necessity which can be imposed by an outside
        agent. One is the necessity of coercion, through which someone with
        absolute necessity does that which the agent forces him to do.
        Otherwise, it is not properly called coercion, but inducement. The other
        necessity is conditional, on the presupposition, that is, of an end to
        be attained. In this way, necessity is so imposed on one that, if he
        does not do a certain thing, he will not receive his reward.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The first necessity, that of coercion, has no place in movements of the
        will, but only in physical things, because by its nature the will is
        free from coercion. The second necessity, however, can be imposed on the
        will, so that one must, for example, choose this means if he is to
        acquire this good, or avoid this evil. For, in such matters, avoiding
        evil is considered equivalent to achieving some good, as is clear from
        the Philosopher.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Moreover, as necessity of coercion is imposed on physical things by
        means of some action, so, too, it is by means of some action that
        conditional necessity is imposed on the will. But the action by which
        the will is moved is the command of the one ruling or governing.
        Consequently, the Philosopher says4 that by means of his command the
        king is the source of movement.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Similarly, too, where the will is concerned, the relation between the
        command of a ruler and the imposition of the kind of obligation by which
        the will can be bound is like the relation between physical action and
        the binding of physical things through the necessity of coercion.
        However, the action of a physical agent never imposes necessity on
        another thing except by the contact of its action with the object on
        which it is acting. So, no one is bound by the command of a king or lord
        unless the command reaches him who is commanded; and it reaches him
        through knowledge of it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Hence, no one is bound by a precept except through his knowledge of the
        precept. Therefore, one who is not capable of the knowledge of a precept
        is not bound by the precept. Nor is one who is ignorant of a precept
        bound to carry out that precept except in so far as he is required to
        know it. If, however, he is not required to know it, and does not know
        it, he is in no way bound by the precept. Thus, as in physical things
        the physical agent acts only by means of contact, so in spiritual things
        a precept binds only by means of knowledge. Therefore, just as it is the
        same power by which touch acts and by which the power of the agent acts,
        since touch acts only by the power of the agent and the power of the
        agent acts only through the mediation of touch, so it is the same power
        by which the precept binds and by which knowledge binds, since the
        knowledge binds only through the power of the precept, and the precept
        only through the knowledge. Consequently, since conscience is nothing
        else but the application of knowledge to an act, it is obvious that
        conscience is said to bind by the power of a divine precept.

        1. Man does not make the law for himself, but through the act of his
        knowledge, by which he knows a law made by someone else, he is bound to
        fulfill the law.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. <i>Counsel</i> has two meanings. Sometimes, counsel is nothing other
        than the action of reason inquiring about things to be done. In this
        sense, the relation of counsel to election is the same as that of a
        syllogism or question to a conclusion, as is clear from the Philosopher.
        Taken in this sense, counsel is not opposed to precept, for we take
        counsel in this way about matters of precept. Hence, obligation can
        arise from such counsel. It is in this sense that counsel is found in
        conscience in so far as it is applied to one function of conscience,
        when, namely, it makes an investigation into some action.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In the other sense, counsel is called persuasion or inducement to do
        something when it does not have compelling force. In this sense, counsel
        is opposed to precept. Friendly exhortations are of this sort, and,
        sometimes, conscience proceeds from that type of counsel. For the
        knowledge of this counsel is sometimes applied to a particular act. But,
        since conscience does not bind except in virtue of that which is in
        conscience, conscience which follows from counsel cannot bind in any
        other way than the counsel itself. Consequently, one is bound not to
        despise it, but he is not obliged to follow it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Although man is not higher than himself, the one whose precept he
        knows is higher than man. This is how he is bound by his conscience.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. When a man sins in making the error itself, a false conscience is not
        enough to excuse him. This is the case when he makes a mistake about
        things which he is required to know. However, if the error is about
        things which he is not required to know, he is excused by his
        conscience, as is clear when one sins from ignorance of a fact, as when
        one approaches another’s wife, whom he thinks is his own.

        It seems that it does not, for
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Augustine says that sin is a word, deed, or desire contrary to the
        law of God. Therefore, nothing binds under pain of sin except God’s law.
        But a false conscience is not in accordance with God’s law. Therefore,
        it does not bind under pain of sin.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. On Romans (13:1), “Let every soul be subject to higher powers,”
        Augustine says that we should not obey a lower power contrary to the
        commandment of a higher power, just as we should not obey the proconsul
        if his order is contrary to that of the emperor. But a false conscience
        is inferior to God. Therefore, when conscience gives orders contrary to
        the commands of God, the command of a mistaken conscience seems to
        impose no obligation whatever.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. According to Ambrose, sin is “a transgression of the divine law and
        disobedience to the heavenly commands.” Therefore, whoever disobeys the
        divine law sins. But a false conscience makes a man disobey the divine
        power when, for instance, his conscience tells him to do something which
        is forbidden by the divine law. Therefore, a false conscience leads one
        into sin if he follows it, rather than binds him under pain of sin if he
        does not follow it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. According to the law, if a man’s conscience tells him that he and his
        wife are related within the forbidden degrees of kindred, and that
        conscience is probable, then he must follow it against a precept of the
        Church, even if an excommunication is attached to the precept. However,
        if his conscience is not probable, he is not bound to follow it, but
        should obey the Church. But a false conscience, especially about things
        which are intrinsically evil, has no probability at all. Therefore, such
        a conscience does not bind.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        S. God is more merciful than a temporal lord. But a temporal lord does
        not accuse a man of sin in something which he did by mistake. Therefore,
        in God’s sight a man is much less obliged under pain of sin by a
        mistaken conscience.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. It was said that a false conscience binds with reference to
        indifferent things, but not with reference to things which are
        intrinsically evil.—On the contrary, a mistaken conscience is said not
        to bind when dealing with things which are intrinsically evil because
        the dictate of natural reason opposes it. But natural reason in like
        manner opposes the false conscience which is mistaken about indifferent
        things. Therefore, that, too, does not bind.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. An indifferent action may be accepted or rejected. But there is no
        necessary obligation to do or omit an action which may be accepted or
        rejected. Therefore, conscience imposes no necessary obligation to
        indifferent actions.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. If from a false conscience one acts contrary to the law of God, he is
        not excused from sin. Accordingly, if one who acted against his
        conscience, even when it was mistaken, were to sin, it would follow
        that, whether he acted according to his false conscience or not, he
        would sin. Therefore, he would be so perplexed that it would be
        impossible for him to avoid sin. But this seems impossible, because,
        according to Augustine: “No one sins in that which he cannot avoid.”
        Therefore, it is impossible for such a false conscience to bind.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. Every sin belongs to some genus of sin. But, if conscience tells one
        that he should fornicate, to abstain from fornication cannot be
        classified in any genus of sin. Therefore, he would not sin in thus
        acting contrary to his conscience. Therefore, such a conscience does not
        bind.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">To the Contrary</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. On Romans (14:23), “For all that is not of faith is sin,” the Gloss
        says: “That is, it is a sin in conscience, even if it is good in
        itself.” But conscience which forbids that which is good in itself is
        false. Therefore, such a conscience binds.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Observance of the legal prescriptions of the Mosaic law in the new
        dispensation of grace was not indifferent but intrinsically evil. Hence,
        Galatians (5:2) says: “If you be circumcised, Christ shall profit you
        nothing.” Nevertheless, conscience prescribing the observance of
        circumcision was binding. Hence, in the same Epistle (5:3) we read: “And
        I testify again to every man circumcising himself, that he is a debtor
        to do the whole law.” Therefore, a false conscience binds in things
        intrinsically evil.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Sin is principally in the will. But whoever decides to transgress a
        divine commandment has an evil will. Therefore, he sins. Whoever
        believes that something is a command and decides to violate it wills to
        break the law. Therefore, he sins. Moreover, one who has a false
        conscience, whether in things intrinsically evil or in anything at all,
        believes that what is opposed to his conscience is contrary to the law
        of God. Therefore, if he decides to do that, he decides to act contrary
        to the law of God, and, so, he sins. Consequently, conscience, no matter
        how false it is, obliges under pain of sin.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. According to Damascene: “Conscience is the law of our understanding.”
        But to act contrary to a law is a sin. Therefore, it is also a sin to
        act against conscience in any way.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. One is bound by a precept. But that which conscience dictates becomes
        a precept. Therefore, conscience binds, no matter how false it may be.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">REPLY</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        There are different opinions on this matter. For some say that
        conscience can be mistaken both in things which are intrinsically evil
        and also with regard to indifferent things. Furthermore, a mistaken
        conscience does not bind in things which are intrinsically evil, but
        does bind with regard to indifferent things. But those who say this do
        not seem to understand in what sense conscience imposes an obligation.
        For conscience is said to bind in so far as one sins if he does not
        follow his conscience, but not in the sense that he acts correctly if he
        does follow it. Otherwise, a counsel would be called obligatory, for one
        who fulfills a counsel acts correctly. Still, we do not say that we are
        bound to counsels, since one who neglects what is of counsel does not
        sin. But we say that we are bound to precepts because, if we do not
        1~ecp them, we commit sin. Therefore, conscience is not said to bind in
        the sense that what one does according to such a conscience will be
        good, but in the sense that in not following it he will sin.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Moreover, it does not seem possible for a man to avoid sin if his
        conscience, no matter how mistaken, declares that something which is
        indifferent or intrinsically evil is a command of God, and with such a
        conscience he decides to do the opposite. For, as far as he can, he has
        by this very fact decided not to observe the law of God. Consequently,
        he sins mortally. Accordingly, although such a false conscience can be
        changed, nevertheless, as long as it remains, it is binding, since one
        who acts against it necessarily commits a sin.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        However, a correct conscience and a false conscience bind in different
        ways. The correct conscience binds absolutely and for an intrinsic
        reason; the false binds in a qualified way and for an extrinsic reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        I say that a correct conscience binds absolutely because it binds
        without qualification and in every circumstance. For, if one’s
        conscience tells him to avoid adultery, he cannot change that conscience
        without sin, since he would commit a serious sin in the very error of
        changing such a conscience. Moreover, as long as it remains, it cannot
        actually be set aside without sin. Thus, it binds absolutely and in
        every event. But a false conscience binds only in a qualified way, since
        it binds conditionally. For one whose conscience tells him he must
        fornicate is not obliged in such a way that he cannot omit the
        fornication without sin except on condition that such a conscience
        remains. But this situation can be changed, and without sin. Hence, such
        a conscience does not oblige in every event. For something can happen,
        namely, a change of conscience, and, when this takes place, one is no
        longer bound. That which is only conditional is said to be qualified.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        I also say that a correct conscience binds for an intrinsic reason, and
        a false conscience binds for an extrinsic reason. This is clear from the
        following. For one who wishes or desires something because of something
        else desires that because of which he desires the others for an
        intrinsic reason, and the other for an extrinsic reason, as it were.
        Thus, one who loves wine because of its sweetness loves sweetness for an
        intrinsic reason, and wine for an extrinsic reason. But one who has a
        false conscience and believes that it is correct (otherwise, he would
        not be mistaken), clings to his false conscience because of the
        correctness he believes is there, and, strictly speaking, clings to a
        correct conscience, but one which is false accidentally, as it were, in
        so far as this conscience, which he believes to be correct, happens to
        be false. It is for this reason that, strictly speaking, he is bound by
        a correct conscience, but accidentally by a false conscience.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        We can find this solution from what the philosopher says when he asks
        almost the same question, that is, whether one is guilty of excess only
        if he departs from right reason, or also if he departs from a mistaken
        reason. His solution is that one who departs from right reason goes to
        excess essentially, and one who departs from mistaken reason goes to
        excess accidentally. And a man departs absolutely from the former and
        with some qualification from the latter, for what is essential is
        absolute, and what is accidental is qualified.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. Although that which a false conscience dictates is out of harmony
        with the law of God, the one who is mistaken considers it the law of
        God. Therefore, taking the thing in itself, if he departs from this, he
        departs from the law of God, although it would be accidental that he
        does not depart from the law of God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. The argument proceeds correctly when there are distinct cornmands
        from higher and lower sources, and both, as essentially distinct, reach
        the one who is obliged by the command. But this is not the situation
        here, since the dictate of conscience is nothing other than the delivery
        of a divine command to him who has the conscience, as is clear from what
        we have said. In the proposed example the cases would be similar if the
        command of the emperor could never reach a man except through the
        proconsul, and the proconsul would not order anything except in so far
        as he repeated the emperor’s commands. Then, it would be the same thing
        to despise the command of the emperor and the command of the proconsul,
        whether the latter spoke the truth or lied.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. A false conscience which is mistaken in things which are
        intrinsically evil commands something which is contrary to the law of
        God. Nevertheless, it says that what it commands is the law of God.
        Accordingly, one who acts against such a conscience becomes a kind of
        transgressor of the law of God, although one Who follows such a
        conscience and acts according to it acts against the law of God and sins
        mortally. For there was sin in the error itself, since it happened
        because of ignorance of that which one should have known.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4 When a conscience is not probable, it should be changed. But, as long
        as such a conscience remains, one sins mortally if he acts against it.
        Hence, this does not prove that a false conscience does not bind as long
        as it remains, but that it does not bind absolutely and in every event.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        5. We do not conclude from that argument that a false conscience does
        not bind under pain of sin if it is not followed, but that, if it is
        followed, it excuses from sin. Consequently, the argument is not to the
        point. When the error itself is not a sin, the conclusion is true, as
        when the error is due to ignorance of some fact. But, if it is ignorance
        of a law, the conclusion is wrong because the ignorance itself is a sin.
        For before a civil judge, also, one who thus appeals to ignorance of a
        law which he should know is not excused.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        6. Although in natural reason there is a basis for proceeding to the
        opposite of that which a false conscience dictates, whether the mistake
        is about indifferent things or things intrinsically evil, natural reason
        does not actually dictate the opposite. For, if it did dictate the
        opposite, conscience would not be mistaken.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        7. Although an indifferent action, in so far as the act itself is
        concerned, can be accepted or rejected, still, when one thinks that such
        an action has been commanded, it loses its indifference because of his
        judgment.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        8. One whose conscience tells him to commit fornication is not
        completely perplexed, because he can do something by which he can avoid
        sin, namely, change the false conscience. But he is perplexed to some
        degree, that is, as long as the false conscience remains. And there is
        no difficulty in saying that, if some condition is presupposed, it is
        impossible for a man to avoid sin; just as, if we presuppose the
        intention of vainglory, one who is required to give alms cannot avoid
        sin. For, if he gives alms, because of such an intention, he sins; but,
        if he does not give alms, he violates the law.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        9. When a false conscience says that something must be done, it commands
        this under some aspect of good, either as a work of justice, or
        temperance, and so forth. Therefore, one who acts against such a
        conscience falls into the vice opposed to the virtue to which his
        conscience thinks it belongs when commanding it. Or, if such a
        conscience orders something under the guise of a command of God, or only
        of some superior, he commits the sin of disobedience by going against
        it.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. A superior must always be obeyed in things which are not against
        God’s will. But indifferent things are not against God’s will.
        Therefore, one is obliged to obey a superior in these matters. We
        conclude as before.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. The higher power should be more obeyed than the lower power, as the
        Gloss says. But the soul of a prelate is higher than the soul of a
        subject. Therefore, the subject is bound more by the command of the
        superior than by his own conscience.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. A subject should not pass judgment on the command of a superior, but
        the superior should judge the acts of the subject. But the subject would
        judge the command of the superior if he refused the command because of
        his own conscience. Therefore, no matter what conscience dictates in
        indifferent matters, the command of the superior should prevail.

        A spiritual bond is stronger than a physical bond, and an intrinsic bond
        stronger than an extrinsic bond. But conscience is an intrinsic
        spiritual bond, whereas the office of the superior is physical and
        extrinsic, as it seems, because all his authority is based on a
        dispensation which is limited to time. Hence, when we reach eternity, it
        will cease, as the Gloss indicates.Therefore, it seems that one should
        obey his conscience rather than a superior.

        The answer to this question is clear enough from what has been said. For
        it has been mentioned above that conscience binds only in virtue of a
        divine command, either in written law or in the law inherent in our
        nature. Therefore, to compare the bond of conscience with the bond
        resulting from the command of a superior is nothing else than to compare
        the bond of a divine command with the bond of a superior’s command.
        Consequently, since the bond of a divine command binds against a command
        of a superior, and is more binding than the command of a superior, the
        bond of conscience is also greater than that of the command of a
        superior. And conscience will bind even when there exists a command of a
        superior to the contrary.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Nevertheless, the situation is not the same in the case of a correct
        conscience and that of a false conscience. For a correct conscience
        binds absolutely and perfectly against the command of a superior. It
        binds absolutely, because one cannot be freed from its obligation, for
        such a conscience cannot be changed without sin. And it binds perfectly,
        because a correct conscience binds in the sense not only that one who
        follows it does not commit sin, but also that he is free from sin, no
        matter what command of a superior there is to the contrary.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But a false conscience binds against the command of a superior even in
        indifferent matters with some qualification and imperfectly. It binds
        with some qualification, because it does not bind in every event, but on
        condition that it endures. For one can and should change such a
        conscience. It binds imperfectly, because it binds in the sense that the
        one who follows it does not commit a sin, but not in the sense that one
        who follows it avoids sin when there is a command of a superior to the
        contrary, and the command of the superior still binds to that
        indifferent thing. For in such a case he sins in not acting, because he
        acts against his conscience, and in acting, because he disobeys the
        superior. However, he sins more if he does not do what his conscience
        dictates, as long as that conscience remains, since it binds more than
        the precept of the superior.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">Answers to Difficulties</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        1. One who vows obedience must obey in those things to which the vow of
        obedience extends. He is not freed from that obligation by a mistake of
        conscience, nor, on the other hand, is he freed from the bond of
        conscience by that obligation. Thus, there remain in him two opposite
        obligations. One of these, conscience, is greater, because more intense,
        and less, because more easily removed; the other is just the opposite.
        For the obligation to obey the superior cannot be removed, whereas a
        false conscience can be changed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        2. Although of itself the work is indifferent, it loses its indifference
        because of the dictate of conscience.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        3. Although a superior is higher than a subject, God, in virtue of whose
        command conscience binds, is greater than the superior.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        4. The subject does not have to judge about the command of the superior,
        but only about its fulfillment, which is his concern. For each is bound
        to examine his actions according to the knowledge he has from God,
        whether natural, acquired, or infused. For every man should act
        according to reason.
