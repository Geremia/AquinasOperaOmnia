          </p>

          <p>
            I, wisdom, have poured out rivers. I, like a brook out of a river of
            mighty water: I, like a channel of a river, and like an aqueduct,
            came out of paradise. I said: ‘I will water my garden of plants and
            I will water abundantly the fruits of my meadow.’ Sirach 14:40-42
          </p>
          <p>
            Among the many opinions coming from different sources as to what
            true wisdom might be, the Apostle gives one that is singularly firm
            and true when he says, ‘Christ, the power of God and wisdom of God,
            has become for us God-given wisdom’ (1 Corinthians 1:24, 30). This
            does not mean that only the Son is wisdom, since Father, Son and
            Holy Spirit are one wisdom, just as they are one essence. Rather,
            wisdom especially belongs to the Son because the works of wisdom in
            many ways agree with what is proper to the Son. Through the wisdom
            of God the hidden things of God are made manifest and the works of
            creatures are produced, and not only produced, but restored and
            perfected. I mean that perfection whereby a thing is called perfect
            when it has attained its proper end.
          </p>
          <p>
            That <i>the manifestation of divine things</i> pertains to the
            wisdom of God is clear from the fact that God himself fully and
            perfectly knows himself by his wisdom. Hence, if we know anything of
            him it must be derived from him, because every imperfect thing takes
            its origin from the perfect. So it is said, ‘And who shall know your
            thought, except you give wisdom and send your Holy Spirit from
            above?’ (Wisdom 9:17). This manifestation is effected specially by
            the Son: he himself is the Word of the Father, as is said at the
            beginning of John, and manifesting the Father and the whole Trinity
            in speech belongs to him. Hence we read in Matthew 11:27, ‘Nor does
            anyone know the Father except the Son, and him to whom the Son
            chooses to reveal him’; and in John 1:18, ‘No one has at any time
            seen God. The only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father,
            he has revealed him.’ It is rightly said of the person of the Son
            therefore, ‘I, wisdom, have poured out rivers.’ I take these rivers
            to be an eternal procession whereby the Son proceeds from the Father
            and the Holy Spirit from both in an ineffable manner. These rivers
            were once hidden and in some way confused with the likenesses of
            creatures, even in the enigmas of Scripture, so that scarcely any of
            the wise believed the mystery of the Trinity. The Son of God came
            and poured forth rivers, making known the name of the Trinity.
            Matthew 18:20: ‘Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations,
            baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
            Holy Spirit.’And Job 28:11: ‘The depths also of rivers he hath
            searched: and hidden things he hath brought to light.’ This touches
            on the matter of Book One.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second thing that pertains to the wisdom of God is
            <i>the production of creatures</i>. He not only has speculative but
            also operative wisdom—like that of the artisan to his
            works—concerning created things. Thus Psalm 103.74: ‘You hast all
            things with wisdom.’ And Wisdom itself says in Proverbs 8:30: ‘I was
            with him, forming all things.’ This attribute is especially found in
            the Son insofar as he is the image of the invisible God, in whose
            likeness all things are formed: ‘He is the image of the invisible
            God, the first-born of every creature, for in him were created all
            things’ (Colossians 1:15); ‘All things were made through him’ (John
            1:3). Rightly then does the person of the Son say, ‘I, like a brook
            out of a river of mighty water,’ in which is noted both the order
            and mode of creation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Order, because as a brook is derived from a river, so the temporal
            procession of creatures [derives] from the eternal procession of
            persons. Hence in Psalm 148:5 is said, ‘He commanded and they were
            made.’ The Word gave birth to what was in him in order that it might
            be, according to Augustine in the Supplement of his
            <i>Literal Commentary on Genesis</i> 1.2. It is always what is first
            that is the cause of what is after, according to Aristotle in
            <i>Metaphysics</i> 2; hence the first procession is the cause and
            reason of every subsequent procession.
          </p>
          <p>
            The mode is signified in two respects: on the part of the one
            creating, who, although he completes all things, is measured by
            nothing else, which is conveyed by calling him mighty. And, on the
            part of the creature, because just as the brook proceeds beyond the
            bed of the river, so the creature proceeds from God beyond the unity
            of essence, in which as in a river bed the flow of the persons is
            contained. And in this the matter of the Second Book is made known.
          </p>
          <p>
            The third thing that pertains to the wisdom of God is
            <i>the restoration of his works</i>. A thing should be repaired by
            the one who made it; hence it is fitting that those things which
            were made through wisdom, through wisdom should be repaired; hence
            in Wisdom 9:19 it is said, ‘Men were taught what pleases you, and
            were saved by wisdom.’ This restoration is especially accomplished
            by the Son, insofar as he has been made man and, by the restored
            state of man, in a certain way restores all things which were made
            for man. Hence in Colossians 1:20: ‘Through him he should reconcile
            to himself all things, whether on the earth or in the heavens.’
            Rightly then from the person of the Son is it said, ‘I like the
            channel of a river and like an aqueduct came out of paradise.’ This
            paradise is the glory of God the Father, from which he came forth
            into the valley of our misery, not because he set it aside, but
            because he hid it. ‘I came forth from God and have come into the
            world.’Concerning this coming forth two things are made known,
            namely, its mode and its fruit. The channel of a river is swiftest,
            hence it designates the mode whereby, as out of an impetus of love,
            Christ completed the mystery of our redemption. Hence Isaiah 59.19:
            ‘He shall come as a violent stream which the spirit of the Lord
            drives on.’ Its fruit is designated when it is said ‘like an
            aqueduct’, for just as an aqueduct is produced from one source which
            it distributes in order to make the earth fruitful, so from Christ
            flow diverse kinds of grace for nourishing the Church, as is said in
            Ephesians 4:11: ‘And he himself gave some men as apostles, and some
            as prophets, others again as evangelists, and others as pastors and
            teachers, in order to perfect the saints for a work of ministry, for
            building up the body of Christ.’ This touches the matter of Book
            Three, in the first part of which the mysteries of our redemption
            are treated, and in the second the graces gathered for us by Christ.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fourth thing that pertains to the wisdom of God is
            <i>perfection</i>, whereby a thing is conserved in its end. Take
            away the end, and only vanity remains, which wisdom cannot suffer to
            abide with her; hence it is said, in Wisdom 8:1, that wisdom
            ‘reaches from end to end mightily and orders all things sweetly’. A
            thing is ordered when it is stabilized in its end, which it
            naturally desires. This especially pertains to the Son, who, since
            he is the true and natural Son of God, leads us to the glory of our
            paternal inheritance. Hence Hebrews 2:10: ‘For it became him for
            whom are all things and through whom are all things, who had brought
            many sons into glory.’ Hence it is rightly said, ‘I said, I will
            water my garden of plants.’
          </p>
          <p>
            The attainment of the end requires preparation, by which whatever is
            not appropriate to the end is removed; thus Christ too, in order
            that he might lead us to the end of eternal glory, prepared the
            medicine of the sacraments, by which the wound of sin is wiped away.
            Two things are to be noted in the foregoing words, namely,
            preparation, which is through the sacraments, and leading into
            glory.
          </p>
          <p>
            Preparation is made known by ‘I will water my garden of plants.’ The
            garden is the Church, of which the Song of Songs 4:12 says, ‘My
            sister, my spouse, is a garden enclosed,’ in which there are diverse
            plants according to the diverse order of the saints, all of them
            planted by the hand of the Omnipotent. This garden is watered by
            Christ with the streams of the sacraments, which flowed from his
            side. Hence in commendation of the beauty of the Church it is said
            in Numbers 24:5, ‘How beautiful are your tabernacles, O Jacob, and
            your tents, O Israel!’ and a little later, in verse 6, ‘as watered
            gardens near the rivers’. Therefore the ministers of the Church who
            dispense the sacraments are called waterers: ‘I have planted, Apollo
            watered’ (1 Corinthians 3.6).
          </p>
          <p>
            Induction into glory is made known in what follows: ‘I will water
            abundantly the fruits of my meadow.’ Christ’s fruits are the
            faithful of the Church, which by his labour he brought forth like a
            mother, of which Isaiah 66:9: ‘Shall not I that make others to bring
            forth children myself bring forth, saith the Lord?’ The fruits of
            this bringing forth are the saints who are in glory, of which fruit
            the Song of Songs 5:1: ‘Let my beloved come into his garden and eat
            the fruit of his apple trees.’ He waters them from the abundance of
            his own fruition, of which abundance Psalm 35:9: ‘They are filled
            with the bounteousness of your house.’ It is called bounteousness
            because it exceeds every measure of reason and desire. Isaiah 64:4
            ‘Eye has not seen, O God, besides you, what things you have prepared
            for those who wait for you.’ This touches the matter of Book Four,
            in the first part of which sacraments are treated, and in the second
            the glory of resurrection.
          </p>
          <p>The aim of the Sentences is clear from what has been said.<br /></p

            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Since we desire to throw a little of our need and fragility along
            with the poor woman into the Lord’s treasury (Lk 21), we have dared
            to climb difficult heights and carry on a project that is above our
            strength. To finish it and gain the reward of our labor, we place
            our trust in the Samaritan who left two denarii for the care of the
            half-living victim, with a promise to pay all that cost more than
            this (Lk 10).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            We find pleasure in the truth of the One who promises, but we are
            terrified at the immensity of the labor. The desire to be of making
            progress urges us on, but the weakness of failing discourages us.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Zeal for the house of God will overcome that, and burning with this,
            we have tried to fortify our faith with the bucklers of the tower of
            David (Sg 4:4) against the errors of carnal and animal men, or
            rather, show how it is fortified, as well as to open up the hidden
            things of theological inquiry, and to transmit information about the
            Church’s sacraments to the small level of our intelligence.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            This is because we could not legitimately resist the wishes of our
            zealous brothers who are fired up to serve us with their
            praiseworthy study and language and style.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            These wheels are turned in us by the love of Christ, even though we
            have no doubt that all speech endowed with human eloquence has
            always been the object of calumny and contradiction from rivals. For
            dissenting movements of the will are followed by dissenting
            positions of mind, so that, even when every statement is perfect
            from the standpoint of truth, others will think or prefer something
            else, and the error of irreligion will struggle against the truth
            which is either not understood or is offensive, and a hostile will
            results. The God of this world lets this happen among the sons of
            rebellion (Eph 2:2), who do not subject their wills to reason, nor
            spend time studying doctrine, but attempt to adapt the words of
            wisdom to their dreams, not following the line of truth but of whim.
            Bad will incites them not to understand the truth but to defend what
            they please, not desiring to be taught the truth, but to turn their
            ears from that to fables (2 Tim 4). Their profession is more to
            master what they fancy rather than what is taught; they do not
            desire what is taught, but to adapt doctrine to what they desire.
            They have an air of wisdom in superstition, because a lying
            hypocrisy follows defection from the faith, so that piety shows up
            in words after conscience has lost it. And that fake piety they turn
            into impiety by the lie of all their words. With fabrications of
            false doctrine they conspire to corrupt the holiness of faith. And
            they introduce itching of ears to others under the new dogma of
            their desire, who then devote themselves to contention and fight the
            truth with no bond of restraint. For there is a heavy battle between
            the promulgation of the truth and the defense of whims.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Because we want to overthrow their church which is hateful to God,
            and to shut their mouths so that the virus of wickedness may not
            spread to others, and to hold up the light of truth on the
            candle-stand, we labored and sweated hard, with God’s help, to
            compile this work from testimonies of truth that are established for
            eternity. It is divided into four volumes, where you will find the
            examples and doctrine of our elders. In it we exposed the fraud of
            viperous teaching through the sincere profession of faith in the
            Lord, embracing the opening for demonstrating the truth, avoiding
            the danger of the irreligious profession, and using a tempered
            moderation between the two. Wherever our voice sounds too little,
            still it does not depart from paternal limits.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Therefore no lazy or very learned person should regard this labor as
            superfluous, since it is necessary for many who are not lazy and
            many who are not learned, including myself, as it gathers the
            teaching of the Fathers in a brief volume, together with their
            testimonies, so that it is not necessary for the inquirer to go
            through a large number of volumes, since this brief collection
            offers what he is looking for without labor.

            In this treatise I desire not only pious readers but also those who
            will freely correct it, especially where there a deep question of
            truth is being treated. I wish as many will discoverer it as will
            contradict it. So that the topic sought may be easily found, we put
            titles so as to distinguish the chapters of each book.<br /></p

              ON THE MASTER’S PROLOGUE</span
            >
          </p>

          <p style="text-align: justify">
            The Master puts a prologue before this work, in which he does three
            things: First he makes the reader benevolent, second docile—at
            “Because we want...”, third attentive—at “Therefore no lazy...”
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            He makes the reader benevolent by giving the motives for writing
            this work, and here he shows his affection for God and his neighbor.
            There are three motives. The first has to do with himself, that is,
            the desire of making progress in the Church. The second has to do
            with God, that is, God’s promise of reward and help. The third has
            to do with his neighbor, that is the pressure of his companions’
            request.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            On the other hand, there are three counter-motives. The first has to
            do with himself: his defect of intelligence and knowledge. The
            second has to do with the work: the loftiness of the subject and the
            magnitude of the labor. The third has to do with his neighbor: the
            contradiction of hostile people.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            The first two of the motives arouse love for God, the third love for
            neighbor; so this section is divided into two. In the first he
            mentions the motives that show love for God, in the second the
            motive that shows love for neighbor, at “This is because we could
            not legitimately resist...”
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Besides the motive factors, he adds the discouraging factors. So
            first he discusses the conflict between motive and discouraging
            factors, secondly the victory, at “Zeal for the house of God...”
            Here first the motive factor is mentioned, that is the desire of
            making progress: “Something (which rings of immodesty) from our need
            and fragility” Here the first discouraging factor comes up: lack of
            knowledge.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            “Need” properly refers to a lack of external goods, and it is
            transferred to a lack of acquired knowledge.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            “Fragility” is properly a defect of interior substance, and is
            transferred to a defect of intelligence. “The poor woman” is
            mentioned in Mark 12 and Luke 21.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            “The treasury [ <i>gazophlacium</i> ]” is a repository of wealth.
            “Gazae” is Persian for wealth, and “phylasso” is Greek for
            “preserve. And sometimes it refers to the ark in which the treasure
            is kept, as in 2 Kings 12:9: “Jehoiada the priest took a chest...”
            and sometimes for the place where the ark is laid, as in John 8:20:
            “Jesus said this in the Treasury.” But here it signifies the study
            of sacred Scripture, in which he saints put their works.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            “To climb difficult heights” is the second discouraging factor that
            has to do with the work, and divine things are said to be difficult
            in themselves. They are climbed, however, by three steps. The first
            is leaving the senses behind, the second in leaving bodily
            phantasies behind, the third in leaving natural reason behind.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            “A project that is above our strength” indicates the height of the
            subject in comparison to ourselves. Against this it is said (Sir
            3:22): “Do not seek things higher than yourself.”—I answer: It is
            true, if we trust in our own powers, but if we trust in divine help
            we can speculate about things superior to our ability.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            “We have dared/ presumed”—Against this is the statement (Sir 37:3
            Vulgate): “O most wicked presumption”; so it seems that he sinned.—I
            answer: Understand “presumed” as assuming something for others. Or
            say that it would be presumption, considering human powers, but not
            if we consider God’s help, by which we can do anything, as it is
            said (Phil 4:13): “I can do anything in him who strengthens me.”
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">

            “In the Samaritan”—This is taken from the parable in Luke 10, and
            the Samaritan stands for God (Ps 120:4): “He does not sleep or doze
            who guards Israel.” For “Samaritan” means guard.

          <p style="text-align: justify">
            “That cost more”—exceeding, as the holy fathers did with their
            studies. Against this is (Rev 22:18): “If anyone adds to this, God
            will add to him the plagues...”—I answer: There are two kinds of
            things that can be added: what is contrary and diverse, and that is
            erroneous or presumptuous, or what is contained implicitly, by
            explaining it, and that is praiseworthy.

            “We could not legitimately resist the wishes of our zealous

            First he states the motive, then the counter-motive, at “even though
            we have no doubt that all speech endowed with human eloquence has

            “No one knows whether he deserves love or hatred;” therefore...—I
            answer: Love, in one sense, is an infused habit; and no one can know
            with certitude that he has it, unless by revelation, but he can
            guess that he has by some probable signs. In another sense, love is
            a deep appreciation of what is loved, and someone can know that he
            has that.

            “Even though we have no doubt that all speech endowed with human

            hostile people. Here he does three things: First he gives evidence
            of opposition by a comparison with other people. Secondly he gives
            the reason for the opposition in the disorder of the will, which
            gives rise to error, and in turn hostility, and in turn opposition,
            at “For dissenting movements of the will are followed by dissenting
            positions of mind.” Thirdly, he declares the wickedness of his

            superstition;” thirdly from their obstinate contention, at “who
            devote themselves to contention and fight the truth.” He shows that
            they are disordered on two counts: (1) because their will does not

            “Because we want to overthrow their church which is hateful to God,
            and to shut their mouths...” Here he makes the listener docile,
            going over the reasons for the work. And first he gives the final
            cause with regard to two advantages: (1) the destruction of error;
            thus he refers to the “hateful church”—(Ps 25:5): “I hated the
            assembly/church of the wicked.”—“so that the virus,” that is, the
            poison, “may not spread to others;” (2) the manifestation of the
            truth; thus he says: “wanting to hold up the light of truth on the
            candle-stand”—which is taken from Luke 8:16: “No one lights a lamp
            and puts it under a bushel
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">“The candle-stand”—in the open.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Secondly he takes up he efficient cause, first the principle one:
            “with God’s help,” then the instrumental one: “We compiled,” because
            this work is a compilation of various authoritative texts.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            “Sweat”—including any bodily defect which follows upon spiritual
            labor.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Thirdly he shows the material cause: “from testimonies of truth.”—Ps
            118:152: “From long ago I have known your testimonies”
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Fourthly, he gives the formal cause, first with reference to the
            distinction of books: “into four volumes,” then to the manner of the
            work: “the examples of our elders” which serve as illustrations, and
            “doctrine” which are reasons.
          </p>

            “Viperous”—heretical; for the heretics, by giving birth to others in

          <p style="text-align: justify">“We have exposed”—we have bound.</p>

          <p style="text-align: justify">
            “Therefore no lazy or very learned person should regard this labor
            as superfluous.”—Here he makes the listener attentive, (1) first
            from the usefulness of the work: “it gathers the views (sententias)
            of the Fathers in a brief volume.” A view, according to Avicenna, is
            a definitive and most certain idea. (2) He does this secondly from
            the depth of the matter: “In this treatise I desire not only pious
            readers” who will understand it according to the faith, “but also
            those who will freely correct it” reading it for the sole purpose of
            correction. A free person, according to the Philosopher, is someone
            who is his own master, not acting because of hatred or hostility.
            (3) He does this by arranging the method of procedure: “So that the
            topic sought may be easily found, we put titles so as to distinguish
            the chapters of each book.”

            In order to make evident the sacred doctrine which is treated in

            one, whether it is practical or speculative; and if speculative,
            whether it is wisdom, knowledge or understanding; (4) its subject;

              >Is another doctrine beyond the natural disciplines necessary for
              men?</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>We proceed to the first question thus:</p>
          <p>
            1. It seems that no doctrine beyond the natural disciplines is
            necessary for man. For as Dionysius says in the Letter to Polycarp,
            ‘Philosophy is the knowledge of the things that exist.’ And he
            observes, making an induction from each of them, that every kind of
            existing thing is treated in philosophy—of Creator and creature, of
            the works of nature as well as our works. But any doctrine must be
            of existing things, since there is no science of non-being.
            Therefore, there should be no doctrine beside the natural
            disciplines.
          </p>
          <p>
            2. Again, every doctrine is for the sake of perfection, either of
            understanding, as with the speculative intellect, or with respect to
            an effect issuing in a work, as with the practical intellect. But
            both are accomplished by philosophy, because intellect is perfected
            by the demonstrative sciences, and the affections by the moral
            sciences. Therefore no other doctrine is necessary.
          </p>
          <p>
            3. Moreover, whatever can be known from the principles of reason by
            the natural intellect is either treated in, or can be discovered by,
            the principles of philosophy. But the knowledge that can be achieved
            by natural intellect suffices for the perfection of man. Therefore,
            no other science than the philosophical is necessary.
          </p>
          <p>
            In proof of the middle: That which can achieve its perfection by
            itself is more noble than that which cannot. But other animals and
            insensible creatures achieve their ends by purely natural means,
            though not without God, who works in all things. Therefore man,
            since he is nobler than they, can acquire knowledge sufficient for
            his perfection through natural intellect.
          </p>
          <p>ON THE CONTRARY:</p>
          <p>
            Hebrews 11: 6: ‘Without faith it is impossible to please God.’ But
            it is of the highest necessity to please God. Therefore, since
            philosophy is incapable of attaining what is of faith, a doctrine
            which proceeds from the principles of faith is necessary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Again, an effect which is not proportionate to its cause, leads only
            imperfectly to knowledge of the cause. All creatures are such an
            effect with respect to the creator, from whom they are infinitely
            distant. Therefore, they imperfectly lead to knowledge of him. Since
            philosophy proceeds from notions derived from creatures, it is
            insufficient to make God known. Therefore, there must be another
            higher science, which proceeds from revelation, and makes up for the
            defect of philosophy.
          </p>
          <p>SOLUTION:</p>
          <p>
            For light on this it should be known that all right-thinking men
            make contemplation of God the end of human life. But there are two
            kinds of contemplation. The one is through creatures and is
            imperfect, for the reason already given. Aristotle locates happiness
            in this kind of contemplation (<i>Ethics</i> 10)—it is a happiness
            on the way’, of this life. To it is ordered the whole of
            philosophical knowledge which proceeds from concepts of creatures.
            The other is the contemplation of God whereby he is seen immediately
            in his essence. This is perfect and will be had in the Fatherland
            and is possible to man on the supposition of faith. Hence it is
            necessary that the things which are for the sake of the end be
            proportioned to the end, since a man while on the way is led by the
            hand to that contemplation, not through knowledge drawn from
            creatures, but rather as immediately inspired by the divine light.
            This is the doctrine of theology.
          </p>
          <p>
            From this we can draw two conclusions. One, that this science as the
            principal one commands all the others; second, that it uses for its
            own sake all other sciences which are its vassals, as is evident in
            all ordered arts, where the end of one comes under the end of
            another. For example, pharmacy, which is the art of preparing
            remedies, is ordered to the end of medicine, which is health. Thus
            the physician orders the pharmacist and uses the medicines made by
            him for his own end. So too, since the end of philosophy in its
            entirety is below the end of theology, and ordered to it, theology
            ought to order the other sciences and use what is taught in them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ad 1. It should be said that although philosophy treats of existing
            things according to concepts derived from creatures, there must be
            another science which considers existing things according to notions
            received by the inspiration of the divine light.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ad 2. From this the solution to the second objection is clear.
            Philosophy suffices for the perfection of intellect by natural
            knowledge, and of the affections by means of acquired virtue. But
            there must be another science through which intellect is perfected
            in the order of infused knowledge, and the affections by gratuitous
            love.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ad 3. It should be said that in those things which acquire an equal
            goodness for their end, the argument set forth, namely, this is more
            noble than that which cannot achieve its end by itself. But that
            which acquires perfect goodness by many aids and activities is more
            noble than that which acquires an imperfect goodness through fewer
            means, or by itself, as the Philosopher says in
            <i>On the Heavens</i> 12. Thus is man, who is made to participate in
            divine glory itself, compared to other creatures.<br /></p

            <span style="font-weight: bold"
              >Should there be only one doctrine beyond the natural
              sciences?</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>We proceed to the second question thus:</p>
          <p>
            1. It seems that there are several sciences and not just one beyond
            the natural sciences. Whatever a man can learn by concepts drawn
            from creatures, he can also learn by divine notions. But there are
            several sciences which employ creaturely concepts, differing in kind
            and in species, such as moral, natural, etc. Therefore sciences
            proceeding from divine notions ought to be many.
          </p>
          <p>
            2. Again, each science is concerned with one kind of thing, as the
            Philosopher says in <i>Posterior Analytics</i> 1. But God and
            creature, both treated in divine doctrine, cannot be reduced to one
            genus, neither univocally nor analogically. Therefore divine science
            is not one. Proof of the middle. Whatever agree in genus whether
            univocally or analogically, share something the same, whether
            according to prior and posterior—as substance and accident share in
            the notion of being—or equally, as horse and cow share in the notion
            of animal. But God and creature do not share in anything that would
            be prior to and simpler than both. Therefore they are in no way
            reduced to one genus.
          </p>
          <p>
            3. Again, the things we do, like acts of virtue, and the things
            nature does, are not contained in the same science, for the one
            pertains to moral, the other to natural science. But divine science
            deals with the things we do, treating virtues and precepts, and it
            also deals with things which are not our works, like angels and
            other creatures. It seems, then, that it is not one science.
          </p>
          <p>ON THE CONTRARY:</p>
          <p>
            Whatever agree in one notion can belong to the same science. Hence
            all things, insofar as they come together in the notion of being,
            pertain to metaphysics. But divine science treats things under a
            divine formality which embraces them all: all things are from him
            and for him. Therefore, although one, it can treat diverse things.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, things that belong to diverse sciences are treated in
            different books. But Sacred Scripture mixes everything, sometimes
            treating of morals, sometimes of the creator, sometimes of
            creatures, as is evident in practically all its books. Therefore the
            science is not diversified on this basis.
          </p>
          <p>SOLUTION:</p>
          <p>
            I reply that on this question it should be noted that knowledge is
            higher to the degree that it is more unified and extends to more
            things. Hence, God’s intellect, which is highest, has distinct
            knowledge of all things through something one, which is God himself.
            So too, since this science is highest and derives its efficacy from
            the light of divine inspiration itself and, while remaining one and
            undivided, considers diverse things, and not just universally, like
            metaphysics, which considers all things insofar as they are beings,
            without descending to proper knowledge of moral matters or of
            natural things. Since the notion of being is diversified in diverse
            things metaphysics is insufficient for specific knowledge of them.
            But the divine light, remaining one in itself, is efficacious to
            make them manifest, as Dionysius says at the beginning of the
            <i>Celestial Hierarchy</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ad 1. The divine light, from the certitude of which this science
            proceeds, is efficacious in making manifest the many things which
            are treated in the different sciences of philosophy which proceed
            from conceptions of these things to knowledge. Therefore there is no
            need for this science to be divided.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ad 2. The creator and creature are reduced to one, not by a
            community of univocation, but of analogy. This is of two kinds.
            Either it arises from this that things share in something in greater
            or lesser degrees, as potency and act—and substance and
            accident—share the notion of being. Or it arises from this that one
            thing receives its being and definition from another, and such is
            the analogy of creature to creator: the creature exists only to the
            degree that it descends from the primary being, and it is called
            being only because it imitates the first being. Thus it is with
            wisdom and all the other things which are said of the creature.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ad 3. The things we do and the things nature does, taken in their
            proper notions, do not fall to the same science. However, one
            science having its certitude from the divine light, which is
            efficacious for knowledge of both, can consider both.
          </p>
          <p>
            It might also be said that the virtues the theologian considers are
            not our work, but that God effects them in us without us, as
            Augustine says in <i>On Free Will</i>, 2.19.<br /></p

              >Is it practical or speculative?</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>We proceed to the third question:</p>
          <p>
            1. This science seems to be practical. The end of the practical is
            some work, as the Philosopher says in <i>Metaphysics</i> 2. But this
            doctrine, which is of faith, is ordered chiefly to acting well:
            ‘Faith without works is dead’; James 2:26 and, ‘The good is
            understood by all doing it.’ Psalm 110:10. Therefore, it seems to be
            practical.
          </p>
          <p>ON THE CONTRARY:</p>
          <p>
            In the preface to the <i>Metaphysics</i> the Philosopher says that
            the noblest of sciences is sought for its own sake. Practical
            sciences are not sought for their own sake, but for the sake of a
            work. Therefore, since this is the most noble among sciences, it
            will not be practical.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, practical science is concerned only with what is of our
            doing. But this doctrine includes angels and other creatures which
            are not works of ours. Therefore, it is not speculative but
            practical.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold"
              >Sub-question 1: Is it a science?</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            It is further asked whether it is a science, and the answer seems to
            be no:
          </p>
          <p>
            1. No science is concerned with the particular, according to the
            Philosopher in the <i>Posterior Analytics</i>. But Sacred Scripture
            tells of the doings of particular men, like Abraham, Isaac, etc.
            Therefore, it is not a science.
          </p>
          <p>
            2. Moreover, every science proceeds from principles known of
            themselves which are obvious to all. But this science begins with
            believable things, which are not granted by all. Therefore, it is
            not a science.
          </p>
          <p>
            3. Moreover, in every science a habit is acquired through the
            arguments set forth. But no habit is acquired in this science,
            because faith, on which the whole doctrine depends, is an infused,
            not an acquired, habit. Therefore it is not a science.
          </p>
          <p>ON THE CONTRARY:</p>
          <p>
            Augustine in <i>On the Trinity</i> 14 says that theology is the
            science of the things that pertain to man’s salvation. So it is a
            science.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Sub-question 2: Is it wisdom?</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            It is further asked whether it is wisdom, and it seems that it
            isn’t. Because, as the Philosopher says at the beginning of the
            <i>Metaphysics</i>, the wise man is most certain of the causes; but
            in this science no one is most certain because faith, on which this
            doctrine depends, is beneath science and above opinion. Therefore it
            is not wisdom.
          </p>
          <p>ON THE CONTRARY:</p>
          <p>
            1 Corinthians 2:6: ‘Wisdom, however, we speak among those who are
            mature.’ Since he is teaching this doctrine and speaking of it
            there, it seems that it is wisdom.
          </p>
          <p>SOLUTION 1:</p>
          <p>
            I reply that it must be said that this science, though one, is none
            the less perfect and sufficient for every human perfection, because
            of the efficacy of the divine light, something clear from the
            foregoing. Hence it perfects man both in right action and with
            respect to contemplation of the truth. Thus it is in some respects
            practical and in other respects speculative. But since every science
            ought to bethought of in terms of its end, and the ultimate end of
            this science is the contemplation of the First Truth ‘in the
            Fatherland’ of heaven, it is chiefly speculative. And since there
            are three speculative habits, according to the Philosopher in
            <i>Ethics</i> 6.7, namely wisdom, science and understanding, and we
            call something wisdom insofar as it considers the highest causes and
            is as it were the head and principle and commander of all sciences,
            this is more to be called wisdom than is metaphysics, since it
            considers the highest causes in the mode of those causes, because it
            is received from divine inspiration. Metaphysics, on the other hand,
            considers the highest causes through concepts drawn from creatures.
          </p>
          <p>
            This science also has more claim to be called divine than has
            metaphysics because it is divine both as to its subject and to the
            mode of receiving, whereas metaphysics is called divine because of
            its subject alone. Wisdom, as the Philosopher says in
            <i>Ethics</i> 6.8, considers both conclusions and principles,
            therefore wisdom is both science and understanding, since science is
            of conclusions and understanding of principles.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ad 1. It is not a work that is the ultimate end intended in this
            science, hut rather contemplation of First Truth in the Fatherland,
            to which we come after having been purified by good works, as is
            said in Matthew 5:8, ‘Blessed are the pure of heart.’ Therefore, it
            is chiefly speculative rather than practical.
          </p>
          <p>We concede the other two objections.</p>
          <p>SOLUTION 2:</p>
          <p>
            To the further question it should be said that this doctrine is a
            science, as has been said. To the objection about particulars, the
            response is that it is not about particulars as particulars, but
            only insofar as they are examples of things to be done, a practice
            followed in moral science as well because actions are particular and
            about particulars, which is why what pertains to morals is best
            exemplified by particular examples. Or it could be said that in
            science there are two things to consider, namely certitude, since
            not just any knowledge is called science, but only certain
            knowledge, and second that it is the term of learning, since
            everything in a science is ordered to knowing. From these it follows
            that science has two characteristics. From the first, that it is
            concerned with the necessary: contingent things cannot generate
            certitude. From the second, that it follows from principles. This
            varies from science to science, because higher sciences are from
            self-evident principles, for example, geometry, which has principles
            like, ‘Equals taken from equals leave equals.’ Lower sciences, which
            are subalternated to the higher, do not proceed from self-evident
            principles, but presuppose conclusions proved in the higher sciences
            and use them as principles though in truth they are not
            self-evident, but are proved in the higher science from self-evident
            principles. Thus perspective, which is concerned with the visual
            line, is subalternated to geometry from which it presupposes truths
            proved of the line as line. From them, as it were from principles,
            it proves conclusions about the line insofar as it is visual. But a
            science can be higher than another in two ways, either by reason of
            its subject, as geometry which is about magnitude is higher than
            perspective which is about visual magnitude, or by reason of its
            mode of knowing, and thus theology is below the knowledge that is
            God’s. For we imperfectly know what he knows perfectly, and just as
            a science subalternated to a higher presupposes certain things and
            proceeds from these as from principles, so theology presupposes the
            articles of faith which are proved infallibly in God’s knowledge,
            believes them and through them proceeds to prove what follows from
            the articles. Thus theology is as it were a science subalternated to
            the divine science from which it receives its principles.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ad 1. This science has the articles of faith for its first
            principles which through the infused light of faith are known in
            themselves by the one having faith, much as principles are naturally
            instilled in us by the light of the agent intellect. Nor is it to be
            wondered at that they are not known to those who do not have the
            light of faith, since not even naturally instilled principles would
            be instilled in us without the light of the agent intellect. It is
            from such principles, not disdaining common principles, that this
            science proceeds; it has no way of proving them, save to defend them
            against naysayers, but then no scientist proves his principles.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ad 2. It should be said that whereas the habit of first principles
            is not acquired by the other sciences but is had by nature, the
            habit of conclusions deduced from the first principles is acquired.
            So too in this doctrine the habit of faith, which is like the habit
            of principles, is not acquired, but the habit of those things which
            are deduced from them and which contribute to its defence.
          </p>
          <p>We concede the third.</p>
          <p>SOLUTION 3:</p>
          <p>
            To the further question, whether it is wisdom, it should be answered
            that it is wisdom in the most proper sense, as has been said. To the
            objection that no one is most certain about this doctrine, we say it
            is false. The believer more firmly assents to the things that are of
            faith than to the first principles of reason. The statement that
            faith is below science is not true of infused faith, but of acquired
            faith, which is opinion fortified by argument. The habit of these
            principles, namely, of the articles, is called faith and not
            understanding because these principles are above reason and human
            reason is unable to grasp them perfectly. There results a kind of
            defective knowledge, but not from any defect of certitude in the
            things known, but from a defect in the knower. Reason led by faith
            grows in such a way that it more fully comprehends what is believed
            and thus in a way understands them. Hence Isaiah 7:9 says in one
            version, ‘Unless you believe, you will not understand.’<br /></p

              >Is God the subject of this science?</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>We proceed to the fourth article thus:</p>
          <p>
            1. It seems that God is the subject of this science. For a science
            should be entitled and named from its subject. But this science is
            called theology, that is, talk about God. Therefore, it seems that
            God is its subject.
          </p>
          <p>
            ON THE CONTRARY: Boethius in <i>On the Trinity</i> 2 says that a
            simple form cannot be a subject. But such is God. Therefore he
            cannot be a subject.
          </p>
          <p>
            2. Again, following Hugh of St Victor, it seems that its subject is
            the works of redemption, for he says in
            <i>On the Sacraments</i> 1.1.2 that ‘the works of the first
            condition are the matter of other sciences, but the works of
            restoration are the matter of theology’. Therefore...
          </p>
          <p>
            ON THE CONTRARY: Whatever is treated in a science must be contained
            in its subject. But theology considers the works of creation, as is
            evident in Genesis 1. It seems then that the works of restoration
            cannot be its subject.
          </p>
          <p>
            3. Again, it seems that reality and sign are its subject for that on
            which the whole intention of the science bears is its subject. But
            the whole intention of theology bears on reality and sign, as the
            Master of the Sentences says at the beginning of Distinction 1.
            Therefore, reality and sign are the subject.
          </p>
          <p>
            ON THE CONTRARY: Sciences differ from one another by the definitions
            of their subjects, since each science must have its proper subject.
            But other sciences too consider reality and sign. Therefore they are
            not the proper subject of this science.
          </p>
          <p>SOLUTION:</p>
          <p>
            I reply that the subject is compared to the science in at least
            three ways.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first is that whatever falls to a science must be contained
            under its subject. Those considering this condition posit reality
            and sign as the subject of this science, some indeed the whole
            Christ, that is, head and members, because whatever is treated in
            this science can be reduced to this.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second comparison is that what is chiefly sought in a science is
            knowledge of the subject. Hence since this science is chiefly
            ordered to knowledge of God, some posit God as its subject.
          </p>
          <p>
            The third comparison is that a science is distinguished from all
            others by its subject, since sciences are divided somewhat as are
            things, as is said in <i>On the Soul</i> 3:8 and thus some posit the
            believable as the subject of this science. It is the fact that it
            proceeds from the inspiration of faith that distinguishes this
            science from all others. And some opt for the works of restoration,
            since the whole science aims at achieving the effect of restoration.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we want a subject which would include all of these, we can say
            that divine being as knowable through inspiration is the subject of
            this science. Whatever is considered in this science is either God
            or things which are from God or ordered to God as such. So too the
            physician considers symptoms and causes and many other things
            insofar as they are healthy, that is, are in some way related to
            health. Thus to the degree that something more nearly approaches the
            true nature of divinity it deserves prior consideration in this
            science.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ad 1. It should be said that God is not the subject save in the
            sense of What is chiefly intended, in the light of whom everything
            else in the science is considered. To the objection that a simple
            form cannot be a subject, we reply that this is true of an accident
            which none the less can be the subject of a predicate in a
            proposition, and any such thing can be the subject of a science so
            long as a predicate can be proved of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ad 2. The works of restoration are not properly the subject of this
            science save in the sense that whatever is taught in this science is
            in some way ordered to our restoration.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ad 3. Reality and sign, understood generally, are not the subject of
            this science, but only insofar as they are divine.<br /></p

          <p style="text-align: center">
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Article 5</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center">
            <span style="font-weight: bold"
              >Is its mode of proceeding artful?</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>To the fifth article we proceed thus:</p>
          <p>
            1. The most noble science should have the most noble mode. But
            insofar as its mode is more artful it is more noble. Therefore,
            since this science is the most noble, its mode ought to be most
            artful.
          </p>
          <p>
            2. Moreover, the mode of a science ought to be proportioned to the
            science. But this science is pre-eminently one, as has been proved,
            therefore its mode ought to be especially one. But the opposite
            seems true, since sometimes it proceeds by warning, sometimes by
            commanding, sometimes in other ways.
          </p>
          <p>
            3. Widely differing sciences ought not to share the same mode. But
            poetry, which contains the least truth, is far different from this
            science which is most true. Therefore, since the former proceeds by
            way of metaphorical locutions, the mode of this science should be
            different.
          </p>
          <p>
            4. Moreover, Ambrose in <i>On Sacred Power</i> 1 says to Gratian,
            ‘Away with arguments where faith is sought.’ But faith is especially
            sought in sacred science. Therefore its mode should in no way be
            argumentative.
          </p>
          <p>ON THE CONTRARY:</p>
          <p>
            1 Peter 3:15 says, ‘Be ready always with an answer to everyone who
            asks a reason for the hope that is in you.’ But this could not be
            done without arguments. Therefore, it ought sometimes to use
            arguments.
          </p>
          <p>
            The same is found in Titus 1:9: ‘That he may be able both to exhort
            in sound doctrine and to confute opponents.’
          </p>
          <p>SOLUTION:</p>
          <p>
            I respond that it should be said that the mode of any science should
            be sought by considering its matter, as Boethius says in
            <i>On the Trinity</i> 1, and the Philosopher in <i>Ethics</i> 1. The
            principles of this science are received through revelation,
            therefore the mode of receiving these principles ought to be
            revelatory on the part of the one infusing, as in the visions of the
            prophets, and prayerful on the part of the recipient, as is evident
            in the Psalms. But because, apart from the infused light, the habit
            of faith is distinguished by determinate beliefs by the teaching of
            the preacher according to what is said in Romans 10:14—‘And how are
            they to believe him whom they have not heard?’— just as the
            understanding of principles naturally instilled is determined by the
            sensibles received, so the truth of the preacher is confirmed by
            miracles, as is said in Mark 16:20: ‘But they went forth and
            preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed
            the preaching by the signs that followed.’ The mode of this science
            must also be narrative of signs which are done for the confirmation
            of faith. And because these principles are not proportionate to
            human reason in this life, which is accustomed to receive them from
            sensible things, it was necessary to prepare for knowledge of them
            by likenesses of sensible things. That is why the mode of this
            science must be metaphorical, or symbolic, or parabolic.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Sacred Scripture the procedure from these principles leads to
            three things, namely, the destruction of error, which cannot be done
            without arguments, which is why the mode of this science is
            sometimes argumentative, both through authorities and also through
            natural reasons and similitudes. It also leads to moral instruction,
            which is why its mode must be preceptive, as in law, warning and
            promising, as in the prophets, and narrative of examples, as in the
            historical books. Thirdly, it leads to the contemplation of truth in
            the questions of Sacred Scripture; for this reason its mode must
            also be argumentative, which is characteristic of the Fathers and of
            this book which, as it were, brings them all together.
          </p>
          <p>
            This enables us to see the reason for the fourfold way of
            interpreting Sacred Scripture, since insofar as the truth of faith
            is received there is the historical sense. Insofar as from this it
            proceeds to moral instruction, there is the moral sense. Insofar as
            it proceeds to contemplating the truth of things on the way, there
            is the allegorical sense, and of the things in the Fatherland, the
            anagogical sense. Only the literal sense is used for the destruction
            of error, since the other senses are through similitudes and there
            cannot be argumentation by means of terms expressive of similitudes.
            That is why Dionysius says in the Letter to Titus that symbolic
            theology is not argumentative.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ad 1. A mode is called artful when it befits the matter; hence a
            mode which is artful in geometry is not so in ethics. Thus the mode
            of this science is most artful because it is most in conformity with
            its matter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ad 2. Although this science is one, it is none the less of many
            things and avails for many things, which is why its manner must be
            diversified, as is already clear.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ad 3. Poetic knowledge is of things which on account of a defect of
            truth cannot be grasped by reason and that is why reason must be
            seduced by certain likenesses; theology, however, concerns things
            which are above reason. The symbolic mode is common to them both,
            therefore, because neither is proportioned to reason.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ad 4. Away with arguments that would prove the articles of the faith
            indeed, but arguments must be used for the defence of the faith and
            for the discovery of truth in questions dependent on the principles
            of faith. This is what the Apostle too does: 1 Corinthians 15:16,
            ‘For if the dead do not rise, neither is Christ risen.’
