        Immensa divinae largitatis beneficia exhibita populo Christiano

        (tr. from
        <i>Breviary of the Order of Preachers</i>, Dublin, 1967)<br />
        The immeasurable blessings of divine favor, which have been showered
        upon the people of God, confer on them an inestimable dignity. What
        great nation is there, or ever was, that has a God so near to it as te
        Lord our God is to us! For the only-begotten Son of God, willing that we
        should share in his divinity, assumed our nature. He was made man, that
        he might make man divine. And what is more, he gave back to us for our
        salvation, all that he had assumed belonging to us. For he offered to
        God the Father, for our reconciliation, his own body as a victim on the
        altar of the cross. He shed his blood, at one and the same time, a
        ransom and a purification, that being redeemed from wretched slavery we
        might be washed clean of all sins.<br />
        But that the remembrance of so great a favour might remain with us, he
        left to be taken by the faithful, under the appearance of bread and
        wine, his body for food and his blood for drink. O precious and
        wonderful banquet, health-giving and full of all delight! For what can
        be more precious than this banquet, in which not the flesh of calves and
        goats, as in the old law, but Christ true God, is set before us to eat?
        What is more wonderful than this Sacrament? For in it the substance of
        the bread and wine is changed into the body and blood of Christ, and
        therefore Christ, perfect God and man, is contained under the appearance
        of a little bread and wine.

        Manducatur utique a fidelibus sed minime laceratur. Quinimmo diviso
        sacramento integer perseverat. Accidentia etiam sine subiecto in eodem
        subsistunt, ut fides locum habeat, dum visibile invisibiliter sumitur
        aliena specie occultatum, et sensus a deceptione immunes reddantur, qui
        de accidentibus iudicant sibi notis. Nullum etiam sacramentum est isto
        salubrius quo purgantur peccata, virtutes augentur, et mens omnium
        spiritualium charismatum abundantia inpinguatur. Offertur in Ecclesia
        pro vivis et mortuis, ut omnibus prosit, quod est pro salute omnium
        institutum.<br />
        Suavitatem denique huius sacramenti nullus exprimere sufficit, per quod
        spiritualis dulcedo in suo fonte gustatur, et recolitur memoria illius
        quam in sua passione Christus monstravit excellentissimae caritatis.
        Unde ut arctius huius caritatis immensitas cordibus infigeretur
        fidelium, in ultima cena quando Pascha cum discipulis celebrato
        transiturus erat ex hoc mundo ad patrem, hoc sacramentum instituit,
        tamquam passionis suae memoriale perenne, figurarum veterum impletivum,
        miraculorum ab ipso factorum maximum, et de sua contristatis absentia
        solatium singulare reliquit.

        He is therefore eaten by the faithful, but in no way is he mangled.
        Indeed when the Sacrament is divided, he remains whole under each
        particle. The accidents, however, remain here without any subject. And
        this, that faith may be exercised when what is visible is invisibly
        received, hidden under another appearance; furthermore, that the senses,
        which judge of he accidents according to appearances, amy be preserved
        from error. No sacrament is more health-giving than this one, in which
        sins are cleansed, virtues increased, and the mind enriched with
        abundance of all spiritual gifts. It is offered in the Church for the
        living and the dead, so that what was instituted for the salvation of
        all, may profit all.<br />
        Finally, no one can adequately express the sweetness of this sacrament,
        in which spiritual sweetness is tasted in its source, and the memory is
        recalled of that most excellent love that Christ showed in his passion.
        Therefore, to impress the immensity of this love more deeply on the
        hearts of the faithful, at the last supper, after celebrating the
        Passover with his disciples, and about to leave this world and go to the
        Father, he instituted this sacrament as a lasting memorial of his
        passion. Ut fulfilled the foreshaddowing of ancient rites, and was the
        greatest of the miracles he worked, which he left as a unique comfort to
        his disciples saddendd by his absence.

        Convenit itaque devotioni fidelium solemniter recolere institutionem tam
        salutiferi tamque mirabilis sacramenti, ut ineffabilem modum divinae
        praesentiae in sacramento visibili veneremur, et laudetur Dei potentia
        quae in sacramento eodem tot mirabilia operatur, nec non et de tam
        salubri tamque suavi beneficio exsolvantur Deo gratiarum debitae
        actiones. Verum et si in die cenae quando sacramentum praedictum
        noscitur institutum inter Missarum sollemnia de institutione ipsius
        specialis mentio habeatur, totum tamen residuum eiusdem diei officium ad
        Christi passionem pertinet, circa cuius venerationem Ecclesia illo
        tempore occupatur.<br />
        Unde ut integro celebritatis officio institutionem tanti sacramenti
        sollemniter recoleret plebs fidelis, Romanus pontifex Urbanus quartus,
        huius sacramenti devotione affectus, pie statuit praefatae institutionis
        memoriam prima feria quinta post octavas Pentecostes a cunctis fidelibus
        celebrari, ut qui per totum anni circulum hoc sacramento utimur ad
        salutem, eius institutionem illo specialiter tempore recolamus, quo
        spiritus sanctus discipulorum corda edocuit ad plene cognoscenda huius
        mysteria sacramenti. Nam et in eodem tempore coepit hoc sacramentum a
        fidelibus frequentari. Legitur enim in Actibus apostolorum, quod erant
        perseverantes in doctrina apostolorum et communicatione fractionis panis
        et orationibus, statim post sancti spiritus missionem.<br />
        Ut autem praedicta quinta feria et per octavas sequentes eiusdem
        salutaris institutionis honorificentius agatur memoria et solemnitas de
        hoc celebrior habeatur, loco distributionum materialium quae in
        Ecclesiis cathedralibus largiuntur existentibus horis nocturnis
        pariterque diurnis, praefatus Romanus pontifex eis qui huiusmodi horis
        in hac sollemnitate personaliter in Ecclesiis interessent, stipendia
        spiritualia apostolica largitione concessit, quatinus per haec fideles
        ad tanti festi celebritatem avidius et copiosius convenirent. Unde
        omnibus vere poenitentibus et confessis qui matutinali officio huius
        festi praesentialiter in Ecclesia ubi celebraretur adessent centum, qui
        vero Missae totidem, illis autem qui interessent in primis ipsius festi
        vesperis similiter centum, qui vero in secundis totidem. Eis quoque qui
        primae, tertiae, sextae, nonae ac completorii adessent officiis, pro
        qualibet horarum ipsarum, quadraginta; illis vero qui per ipsius festi
        octavas in matutinalibus, vespertinis, Missae ac praedictarum horarum
        officiis praesentes existerent, singulis diebus octavarum ipsarum centum
        dierum indulgentiam misericorditer tribuit perpetuis temporibus
        duraturam.

        For the devotion of the faithful, it is good solemnly to recall the
        institution of such a saving and wonderful sacrament, so that we may
        venerate the ineffable mode of the divine presence in a visible
        sacrament, and praise God's power which works so many miracles in the
        same sacrament, and give God due thanks for such a medicinal and tasty
        benefit. Even though on Holy Thursday, when this sacrament was
        instituted, there is special mention of it in the solemn celebration of
        the Mass, the whole remaining part of the day's office is about the
        passion of Christ, with which the Church is busy venerating at that
        time.<br />
        Therefore, to let the faithful people sollemnly recall the institution
        of such a great sacrement with a whole office of celebration, the Roman
        Pontiff Urban IV, out of devotion to this sacrament, piously decreed
        that the memory of this instituion be celebrated by all the faithful on
        the first Thursday after the Octave of Pentecost. For, even though we
        used this sacrament for our salvation throughout the year, we can
        specially call to mind its institution at that time when the Holy Spirit
        taught the hearts of the disciples fully to understand the mysteries of
        this sacrament. For at that time this sacrament came into use among the
        faithful. For we read in the Acts of the Apostles that "they devoted
        themselves to the teaching of the Apostles and communing in the breaking
        of bread and in prayer" right after the sending of the Holy Spirit.<br />
        That the memory of this saving institution might be more honorably
        celebrated, and its solemn celebration might be enhanced on this
        Thursday and through its Octave, instead of the usual distribution of
        material goods which is done in cathedral churches at the night and day
        hours, the said Roman Pontiff has granted by his apostolic generosity
        spiritual allotments to those who personally assist at these hours in
        church on this feast, so that in this way the faithful may more eagerly
        and in greater numbers participate in this feast. Therefore, to all who
        are truly penitent and after confessing their sins assist personally at
        Matins of this feast, he mercifully grants an indulgence of one hundred
        days. The same holds for attendance at the Mass, to those who attend
        First Vespers, and to those who attend Second Vespers. To those who
        attend Prime, Tierce, Sext, None and Compline, he grants forty days for
        each hour. To those who attend Matins, Vespers, Mass and the preceding
        hours during the Octave, he grands a one hundred days' indulgence for
        each day. This privilege is of perpetual duration.

        Huius sacramenti figura praecessit, quando manna pluit Deus patribus in
        deserto, qui cotidiano caeli pascebantur alimento. Unde dictum est:
        Panem Angelorum manducavit homo. Sed tamen panem illum qui
        manducaverunt, omnes in deserto mortui sunt. Ista autem esca quam
        accipitis, iste panis vivus qui de caelo descendit, vitae aeternae
        substantiam ministrat. Et quicumque hunc panem manducaverit non morietur
        in aeternum, quia corpus Christi est. Considera utrum nunc praestantior
        sit panis Angelorum an caro Christi, quae utique est corpus vitae. Manna
        illud de caelo, hoc super coelum; illud caeli, hoc domini caelorum;
        illud corruptioni obnoxium, si in diem alterum servaretur, hoc alienum
        ab omni corruptione. Quicumque religiose gustaverit, corruptionem
        sentire non poterit. Illis aqua de petra fluxit, tibi sanguis ex
        Christo. Illos ad horam satiavit aqua, te sanguis diluit in aeternum.
        Iudaeus bibit et sitit; tu cum biberis sitire non poteris. Et illud in
        umbra, hoc in veritate. Si illud quod miraris umbra est, quantum istud
        est cuius umbram miraris? Audi quia umbra est, quae apud patres facta
        est: Bibebant, inquit, de spirituali consequente eos petra, petra autem
        erat Christus, sed non in pluribus eorum complacitum est Deo, nam
        prostrati sunt in deserto. Haec autem facta sunt in figura nostri.
        Cognovisti potiora. Potior est enim lux quam umbra, veritas quam figura,
        corpus auctoris quam manna de caelo.

        This sacrament was prefigured when God rained down manna for the fathers
        in the desert and they then ate food from heaven every day. Thus it is
        said: "Man ate the bread of angels". Although they ate that bread, all
        of them died in the desert. But the food which you receive, that living
        bread which comes down from heaven, ministers to you the substance of
        eternal life. Anyone who eats this bread will never die, because it is
        the body of Christ. Now, which is greater, the bread of angels or the
        flesh of Christ, which after all is the body of life? That manna came
        from heaven, but this from above the heaven. That was of heaven, this of
        the Lord of heaven. That would corrupt if it was kept more than a day,
        this is free from all corruption; whoever religiously tastes it cannot
        experience corruption. For them water flowed from a rock, for you blood
        from Christ. Water satisfied them for that hour, but blood soaks you
        forever. The Jews drank and were thirsty, when you drink you cannot
        thirst. That happend in shadow, this in reality. If you are amazed at
        what is a shadow, how much more are you amazed at what that is a shadow
        of? You hear that "God was not pleased with most of them, and they
        collapsed in the desert. These things happend as examples for us." You
        have known the better things. Light is better than shadow, reality than
        a figure, the body of the Author than manna from heaven.

        Maybe you object: "I see something else. How can you tell me that I am
        receiving the body of Christ?" —And this is what it remains for us to
        prove. How many examples can we use to show that this is not what nature
        formed, but what words of blessing consecrated, and that the power of
        the blessing is greater than that of nature, because by the blessing
        nature itself is changed. Thus Moses held a staff, threw it, and it
        became a serpent. Then he took the tail of the serpent and it returned
        to the nature of a staff. Thus you see that by prophetic grace nature
        was changed twice, that of a serpent and that of a staff. The rivers of
        Egypt ran with pure streams of water; suddenly blood erupted from the
        springs and the rivers were undrinkable. Then, at the prayers of the
        prophet, the blood of the rivers stopped, and the natural water flowed
        back. The Hebrew people were surrounded on every side, on one side by
        the Egyptians, on the other by the sea. Moses lifted his staff, and the
        water divided and froze in the form of walls, leaving a walkway in
        between. The Jordan river turned back, against its nature returning to
        its source. Is it not clear that nature, whether of the sea or of a
        river, was changed? The people of the fathers were thirsty; Moses
        touched the rock, and water flowed out. Did grace not operate apart from
        nature, so that a rock would discharge water which it did not have by
        nature?

        Marath fluvius amarissimus erat, ut sitiens populus bibere non posset.
        Moyses misit lignum in aquam, et amaritudinem suam aquarum natura
        deposuit, quam infusa subito gratia temperavit. Sub Helisaeo propheta,
        uni ex filiis prophetarum excussum est ferrum de securi, et statim

        Helisaeus lignum in aquam, et ferrum natavit. Utique etiam hoc praeter
        naturam factum cognovimus. Gravior enim est ferri species, quam aquarum
        liquor. Advertimus enim maiorem esse gratiam quam naturam, et adhuc
        tamen propheticae benedictionis miramur gratiam. Quod si tantum valuit
        humana benedictio ut naturam converteret, quid dicimus de ipsa
        consecratione divina, ubi ipsa verba domini salvatoris operantur? Nam
        sacramentum istud quod accipis, Christi sermone conficitur. Quod si

        Marah is a most bitter river, where the people could not drink. Moses
        put a piece of wood in the water and the bitterness which it had by
        nature was tempered by grace suddenly flowing in. At the time of Elisha
        the prophet, one of the sons of the prophets lost his axehead and it
        sunk in the water. He complained to Elisha, who put a piece of wood in
        the water, and the axehead floated. This too we recognize to have
        happened apart from nature. For the nature of iron is heavier than
        water. So we see that grace is greater than nature, and we admire the
        grace of the prophet's blessing. If a human blessing could be so
        powerful as to change a nature, what do we say about the divine
        consecration where the very words of the Lord Savior are at work? For
        that sacrament which you receive is effected by the pronouncement of
        Christ. If te pronouncement of Elijah was so powerful as to bring fire
        from heaven, is not the pronouncement of Christ strong enough to change
        the nature of elements?

        "As the living Father sent me," he said, "and I live because of the

        our unity with his body and blood, which that eating and drinking

        person lives because of me." He is not talking about that nature by

        himself, that is, he begot a son having live in himself.

        Regarding God's works in the whole world, you have read that "He spoke,
        and they were made," "He commanded and they were created." Therefore
        could not the Word, which could make something from nothing, also change
        what exists into something else? Nothing less can be conceded than to
        admit that he can change things into new natures. What, then? If we use
        his arguments, let us use his examples, and consider the truth of the
        Incarnation. Was the Lord Jesus not aware of the natural process when he
        was to be born of Mary? If we go by the order of nature, a woman has a
        child by intercourse with a man. So it is clear that the Virgin had her
        child outside the order of nature. And what we effect [in the Mass] is
        the body that came from the Virgin. Why should you look for the order of
        nature in [the presence of] Christ's body, when the same Lord Jesus was
        born of the Virgin apart from the order of nature? Yes, it is the true
        flesh of Christ which was crucified and was buried. Therefore it is
        really the sacrament of his body. Our Lord Jesus Christ himself cries
        out: "This is my body." Before the heavenly words of blessing it was a
        different thing. After the consecration it is designated his body. He
        said [the same] with regard to his blood. Before the consecration it was
        called one thing; after the consecration is is designated his body. You
        say "Amen. This is true." What you speak, may you also feel in your
        heart.

        Panis est in altari usitatus ante verba sacramentorum. Ubi accessit

        Deo offertur, oratione petitur pro populo, pro regibus, pro ceteris. Ubi
        autem sacramentum conficitur, iam non suis sermonibus sacerdos, sed
        utitur sermonibus Christi. Ergo sermo Christi hoc conficit sacramentum.
        Quis sermo Christi? Hic nempe quo facta sunt omnia: caelum, terra,
        maria. Vides ergo quam operarius sit sermo Christi. Si ergo tanta vis
        est in sermone domini Iesu Christi, ut inciperet esse quod non erat,
        quanto magis operarius est ut sint quae erant et in aliud convertantur?
        Et sic quod erat panis ante consecrationem iam corpus Christi post
        consecrationem est, quia sermo Christi creaturam mutat, et sic ex pane

        Bread was handled on the altar before the sacramental words. At the
        consecration, from bread there became the flesh of Christ. But how could
        it belong to bread to be the body of Christ? The consecration happens,
        therefore, by which words and whose pronouncement?—Those of the Lord
        Jesus. All the rest that is said [in Mass] is praise offered to God, or
        petitions made for the people, for kings, and for others. But when the
        sacrament is effected, the priest does not use his own words, but the
        words of Christ. Therefore the pronouncement of Christ effects this
        sacrament. What is the pronouncement of Christ?—That by which everything
        was made: heaven, earth, the seas. So you see how efficacious is the
        pronouncement of Christ. Therefore, if there is so much power in the
        pronouncement of Christ, that something could come to exist from
        nothing, how much more efficacious is it in converting something that
        previously existed into something else? And so, what was bread before
        the consecration is right away the body of Christ after the
        consecration, because the pronouncement of Christ changes a creature,
        and thus from bread there becomes the body of Christ. And the wine mixed
        with water in the chalice becomes by the consecration the blood of the
        heavenly Word.

        But you may object: "I do not see the appearance of blood, but only
        something like it." Just as you took on the likeness of his death, so
        you drink the blood of Christ in its likeness, so that there would be no
        revulsion at the blood, while the price of redemption is at work. You
        have learned that you receive the body of Christ. Do you want to know by
        which heavenly words it is consecrated? Here are the words. The priest
        says, "Let this offering for us be certified, reasonable,
        acceptable—which is a figure of the body and blood of the Lord Jesus
        Christ—who, before he suffered, blessed it, broke it, and gave it to his
        Apostles and his disciples, saying: 'Take this, all of you, and eat from
        it. This is my body, which will be broken for many.' When supper was
        ended, likewise he took the chalice, looked up to heaven, to you, holy
        Father, almighty and eternal God, and giving thanks blessed it and gave
        it to his disciples saying: 'Take this and drink from it, all of you.
        For this is my blood.'" All the preceding are the words of the
        Evangelist, up to "Take this body" or "this blood". So it is Christ who
        says: "Take and drink from it, all of you. For this is my blood."
        Observe the details. It is said, "Before he suffered, he took bread in
        his sacred hands." Before it was consecrated it was bread. And before
        the words of Christ, the chalice was full of wine and water. But when
        the words of Christ took effect, then it became the blood which redeems
        the people. Therefore see how powerful is the pronouncment of Christ to
        convert it wholly. Then Jesus himself testifies that we receive his body
        and his blood, and we have no right to doubt his trustworthiness and
        testimony.
