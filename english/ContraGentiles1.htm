<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THE OFFICE OF THE WISE MAN</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">&#8220;My mouth shall meditate truth, and my lips shall hate impiety&#8221; (Prov. 8:7).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] The usage of the multitude, which according to the Philosopher is to be followed in giving
names to things, has commonly held that they are to be called wise who order things rightly and
govern them well. Hence, among other things that men have conceived about the wise man, the
Philosopher includes the notion that &#8220;it belongs to the wise man to order.&#8221; Now, the rule of
government and order for all things directed to an end must be taken from the end. For, since the
end of each thing is its good, a thing is then best disposed when it is fittingly ordered to its end.
And so we see among the arts that one functions as the governor and the ruler of another because
it controls its end. Thus, the art of medicine rules and orders the art of the chemist because health,
with which medicine is concerned, is the end of all the medications prepared by the art of the
chemist. A similar situation obtains in the art of ship navigation in relation to shipbuilding, and
in the military art with respect to the equestrian art and the equipment of war. The arts that rule
other arts are called architectonic, as being the ruling arts. That is why the artisans devoted to
these arts, who are called master artisans, appropriate to themselves the name of wise men. But,
since these artisans are concerned, in each case, with the ends of certain particular things, they
do not reach to the universal end of all things. They are therefore said to be wise with respect to
this or that thing; in which sense it is said that &#8220;as a wise architect, I have laid the foundation&#8221;
(1 Cor. 3:10). The name of the absolutely wise man, however, is reserved for him whose
consideration is directed to the end of the universe, which is also the origin of the universe. That
is why, according to the Philosopher, it belongs to the wise man to consider the highest causes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] Now, the end of each thing is that which is intended by its first author or mover. But the first
author and mover of the universe is an intellect, as will be later shown. The ultimate end of the
universe must, therefore, be the good of an intellect. This good is truth. Truth must consequently
be the ultimate end of the whole universe, and the consideration of the wise man aims principally
at truth. So it is that, according to His own statement, divine Wisdom testifies that He has
assumed flesh and come into the world in order to make the truth known: &#8220;For this was I born,
and for this came I into the world, that I should give testimony to the truth&#8221; (John 18:37). The
Philosopher himself establishes that first philosophy is the science of truth, not of any truth, but
of that truth which is the origin of all truth, namely, which belongs to the first principle whereby
all things are. The truth belonging to such a principle is, clearly, the source of all truth; for things
have the same disposition in truth as in being.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] It belongs to one and the same science, however, both to pursue one of two contraries and to
oppose the other. Medicine, for example, seeks to effect health and to eliminate illness. Hence,
just as it belongs to the wise man to meditate especially on the truth belonging to the first
principle and to teach it to others, so it belongs to him to refute the opposing falsehood.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Appropriately, therefore, is the twofold office of the wise man shown from the mouth of
Wisdom in our opening words: to meditate and speak forth of the divine truth, which is truth in
person (Wisdom touches on this in the words my mouth shall meditate truth), and to refute the
opposing error (which Wisdom touches on in the words and my lips shall hate impiety). By
impiety is here meant falsehood against the divine truth. This falsehood is contrary to religion,
which is likewise named piety. Hence, the falsehood contrary to it is called impiety.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.125in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">&#160;</p>
<A NAME="2"><p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">Chapter 2</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THE AUTHOR&#8217;S INTENTION IN THE PRESENT WORK</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] Among all human pursuits, the pursuit of wisdom is more perfect, more noble, more useful,
and more full of joy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">It is more perfect because, in so far as a man gives himself to the pursuit of wisdom, so far does
he even now have some share in true beatitude. And so a wise man has said: &#8220;Blessed is the man
that shall continue in wisdom&#8221; (Sirach 14:22).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">It is more noble because through this pursuit man especially approaches to a likeness to God Who
&#8220;made all things in wisdom&#8221; (Ps. 103:24). And since likeness is the cause of love, the pursuit of
wisdom especially joins man to God in friendship. That is why it is said of wisdom that &#8220;she is
an infinite treasure to men! which they that use become the friends of God&#8221; (Wis. 7:14).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">It is more useful because through wisdom we arrive at the kingdom of immortality. For &#8220;the
desire of wisdom leads to the everlasting kingdom&#8221; (Wis. 6:21).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">It is more full of joy because &#8220;her conversation has no bitterness, nor her company any
tediousness, but joy and gladness&#8221; (Wis. 7:16).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] And so, in the name of the divine Mercy, I have the confidence to embark upon the work of
a wise man, even though this may surpass my powers, and I have set myself the task of making
known, as far as my limited powers will allow, the truth that the Catholic faith professes, and of
setting aside the errors that are opposed to it. To use the words of Hilary: &#8220;I am aware that I owe
this to God as the chief duty of my life, that my every word and sense may speak of Him&#8221; [<i>De
Trinitate</i> I, 37].</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] To proceed against individual errors, however, is a difficult business, and this for two
reasons. In the first place, it is difficult because the sacrilegious remarks of individual men who
have erred are not so well known to us so that we may use what they say as the basis of
proceeding to a refutation of their errors. This is, indeed, the method that the ancient Doctors of
the Church used in the refutation of the errors of the Gentiles. For they could know the positions
taken by the Gentiles since they themselves had been Gentiles, or at least had lived among the
Gentiles and had been instructed in their teaching. In the second place, it is difficult because
some of them, such as the Mohammedans and the pagans, do not agree with us in accepting the
authority of any Scripture, by which they may be convinced of their error. Thus, against the Jews
we are able to argue by means of the Old Testament, while against heretics we are able to argue
by means of the New Testament. But the Muslims and the pagans accept neither the one nor the
other. We must, therefore, have recourse to the natural reason, to which all men are forced to give
their assent. However, it is true, in divine matters the natural reason has its failings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Now, while we are investigating some given truth, we shall also show what errors are set
aside by it; and we shall likewise show how the truth that we come to know by demonstration
is in accord with the Christian religion.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.125in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">&#160;</p>
<A NAME="3"><p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">Chapter 3</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">ON THE WAY IN WHICH DIVINE TRUTH IS TO BE MADE KNOWN</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] The way of making truth known is not always the same, and, as the Philosopher has very well
said, &#8220;it belongs to an educated man to seek such certitude in each thing as the nature of that
thing allows.&#8221; The remark is also introduced by Boethius [<i>De Trinitate</i> II]. But, since such is the
case, we must first show what way is open to us in order that we may make known the truth
which is our object.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] There is a twofold mode of truth in what we profess about God. Some truths about God
exceed all the ability of the human reason. Such is the truth that God is triune. But there are some
truths which the natural reason also is able to reach. Such are that God exists, that He is one, and
the like. In fact, such truths about God have been proved demonstratively by the philosophers,
guided by the light of the natural reason.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] That there are certain truths about God that totally surpass man&#8217;s ability appears with the
greatest evidence. Since, indeed, the principle of all knowledge that the reason perceives about
some thing is the understanding of the very substance of that being (for according to Aristotle
&#8220;what a thing is&#8221; is the principle of demonstration) [<i>Posterior Analytics</i> II, 3], it is necessary that
the way in which we understand the substance of a thing determines the way in which we know
what belongs to it. Hence, if the human intellect comprehends the substance of some thing, for
example, that of a stone or of a triangle, no intelligible characteristic belonging to that thing
surpasses the grasp of the human reason. But this does not happen to us in the case of God. For
the human intellect is not able to reach a comprehension of the divine substance through its
natural power. For, according to its manner of knowing in the present life, the intellect depends
on the sense for the origin of knowledge; and so those things that do not fall under the senses
cannot be grasped by the human intellect except in so far as the knowledge of them is gathered
from sensible things. Now, sensible things cannot lead the human intellect to the point of seeing
in them the nature of the divine substance; for sensible things are effects that fall short of the
power of their cause. Yet, beginning with sensible things, our intellect is led to the point of
knowing about God that He exists, and other such characteristics that must be attributed to the
First Principle. There are, consequently, some intelligible truths about God that are open to the
human reason; but there are others that absolutely surpass its power.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] We may easily see the same point from the gradation of intellects. Consider the case of two
persons of whom one has a more penetrating grasp of a thing by his intellect than, does the other.
He who has the superior intellect understands many things that the other cannot grasp at all. Such
is the case with a very simple person who cannot at all grasp the subtle speculations of
philosophy. But the intellect of an angel surpasses the human intellect much more than the
intellect of the greatest philosopher surpasses the intellect of the most uncultivated simple
person; for the distance between the best philosopher and a simple person is contained within the
limits of the human species, which the angelic intellect surpasses. For the angel knows God on
the basis of a more noble effect than does man; and this by as much as the substance of an angel,
through which the angel in his natural knowledge is led to the knowledge of God, is nobler than
sensible things and even than the soul itself, through which the human intellect mounts to the
knowledge of God. The divine intellect surpasses the angelic intellect much more than the
angelic surpasses the human. For the divine intellect is in its capacity equal to its substance, and
therefore it understands fully what it is, including all its intelligible attributes. But by his natural
knowledge the angel does not know what God is, since the substance itself of the angel, through
which he is led to the knowledge of God, is an effect that is not equal to the power of its cause.
Hence, the angel is not able, by means of his natural knowledge, to grasp all the things that God
understands in Himself; nor is the human reason sufficient to grasp all the things that the angel
understands through his own natural power. Just as, therefore, it would he the height of folly for
a simple person to assert that what a philosopher proposes is false on the ground that he himself
cannot understand it, so (and even more so) it is the acme of stupidity for a man to suspect as
false what is divinely revealed through the ministry of the angels simply because it cannot be
investigated by reason.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] The same thing, moreover, appears quite clearly from the defect that we experience every day
in our knowledge of things. We do not know a great many of the properties of sensible things,
and in most cases we are not able to discover fully the natures of those properties that we
apprehend by the sense. Much more is it the case, therefore, that the human reason is not equal
to the task of investigating all the intelligible characteristics of that most excellent substance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] The remark of Aristotle likewise agrees with this conclusion. He says that &#8220;our intellect is
related to the prime beings, which are most evident in their nature, as the eye of an owl is related
to the sun&#8221; [<i>Metaphysics</i> Ia, 1]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] Sacred Scripture also gives testimony to this truth. We read in Job: &#8220;Do you think you can
comprehend the depths of God, and find the limit of the Almighty?&#8221; (11:7). And again: &#8220;Behold,
God is great, exceeding our knowledge&#8221; (Job 36:26). And St. Paul: &#8220;We know in part&#8221; (1 Cor.
13:9).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[8] We should not, therefore, immediately reject as false, following the opinion of the
Manicheans and many unbelievers, everything that is said about God even though it cannot be
investigated by reason.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.125in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">&#160;</p>
<A NAME="4"><p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">Chapter 4</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THAT THE TRUTH ABOUT GOD TO WHICH THE NATURAL REASON
REACHES IS FITTINGLY PROPOSED TO MEN FOR BELIEF</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] Since, therefore, there exists a twofold truth concerning the divine being, one to which the
inquiry of the reason can reach, the other which surpasses the whole ability of the human reason,
it is fitting that both of these truths be proposed to man divinely for belief. This point must first
be shown concerning the truth that is open to the inquiry of the reason; otherwise, it might
perhaps seem to someone that, since such a truth can be known by the reason, it was uselessly
given to men through a supernatural inspiration as an object of belief.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] Yet, if this truth were left solely as a matter of inquiry for the human reason, three awkward
consequences would follow.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] The first is that few men would possess the knowledge of God. For there are three reasons
why most men are cut off from the fruit of diligent inquiry which is the discovery of truth. Some
do not have the physical disposition for such work. As a result, there are many who are naturally
not fitted to pursue knowledge; and so, however much they tried, they would be unable to reach
the highest level of human knowledge which consists in knowing God. Others are cut off from
pursuing this truth by the necessities imposed upon them by their daily lives. For some men must
devote themselves to taking care of temporal matters. Such men would not be able to give so
much time to the leisure of contemplative inquiry as to reach the highest peak at which human
investigation can arrive, namely, the knowledge of God. Finally, there are some who are cut off
by indolence. In order to know the things that the reason can investigate concerning God, a
knowledge of many things must already be possessed. For almost all of philosophy is directed
towards the knowledge of God, and that is why metaphysics, which deals with divine things, is
the last part of philosophy to be learned. This means that we are able to arrive at the inquiry
concerning the aforementioned truth only on the basis of a great deal of labor spent in study.
Now, those who wish to undergo such a labor for the mere love of knowledge are few, even
though God has inserted into the minds of men a natural appetite for knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] The second awkward effect is that those who would come to discover the abovementioned
truth would barely reach it after a great deal of time. The reasons are several. There is the
profundity of this truth, which the human intellect is made capable of grasping by natural inquiry
only after a long training. Then, there are many things that must be presupposed, as we have said.
There is also the fact that, in youth, when the soul is swayed by the various movements of the
passions, it is not in a suitable state for the knowledge of such lofty truth. On the contrary, &#8220;one
becomes wise and knowing in repose,&#8221; as it is said in the <i>Physics</i> [VII, 3]. The result is this. If
the only way open to us for the knowledge of God were solely that of the reason, the human race
would remain in the blackest shadows of ignorance. For then the knowledge of God, which
especially renders men perfect and good, would come to be possessed only by a few, and these
few would require a great deal of time in order to reach it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] The third awkward effect is this. The investigation of the human reason for the most part has
falsity present within it, and this is due partly to the weakness of our intellect in judgment, and
partly to the admixture of images. The result is that many, remaining ignorant of the power of
demonstration, would hold in doubt those things that have been most truly demonstrated. This
would be particularly the case since they see that, among those who are reputed to be wise men,
each one teaches his own brand of doctrine. Furthermore, with the many truths that are
demonstrated, there sometimes is mingled something that is false, which is not demonstrated but
rather asserted on the basis of some probable or sophistical argument, which yet has the credit
of being a demonstration. That is why it was necessary that the unshakeable certitude and pure
truth concerning divine things should be presented to men by way of faith.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Beneficially, therefore, did the divine Mercy provide that it should instruct us to hold by faith
even those truths that the human reason is able to investigate. In this way, all men would easily
be able to have a share in the knowledge of God, and this without uncertainty and error.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] Hence it is written: &#8220;Henceforward walk not as the Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind,
having their understanding darkened&#8221; (Eph. 4:17-18). And again: &#8220;All your children shall be
taught of the Lord&#8221; (Is. 54:13).</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THAT THE TRUTHS THE HUMAN REASON IS NOT ABLE TO INVESTIGATE
ARE FITTINGLY PROPOSED TO MEN FOR BELIEF</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] Now, perhaps some will think that men should not be asked to believe what the reason is not
adequate to investigate, since the divine Wisdom provides in the case of each thing according to
the mode of its nature. We must therefore prove that it is necessary for man to receive from God
as objects of belief even those truths that are above the human reason.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] No one tends with desire and zeal towards something that is not already known to him. But,
as we shall examine later on in this work, men are ordained by the divine Providence towards a
higher good than human fragility can experience in the present life. That is why it was necessary
for the human mind to be called to something higher than the human reason here and now can
reach, so that it would thus learn to desire something and with zeal tend towards something that
surpasses the whole state of the present life. This belongs especially to the Christian religion,
which in a unique way promises spiritual and eternal goods. And so there are many things
proposed to men in it that transcend human sense. The Old Law, on the other hand, whose
promises were of a temporal character, contained very few proposals that transcended the inquiry
of the human reason. Following this same direction, the philosophers themselves, in order that
they might lead men from the pleasure of sensible things to virtue, were concerned to show that
there were in existence other goods of a higher nature than these things of sense, and that those
who gave themselves to the active or contemplative virtues would find much sweeter enjoyment
in the taste of these higher goods.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] It is also necessary that such truth be proposed to men for belief so that they may have a truer
knowledge of God. For then only do we know God truly when we believe Him to be above
everything that it is possible for man to think about Him; for, as we have shown, the divine
substance surpasses the natural knowledge of which man is capable. Hence, by the fact that some
things about God are proposed to man that surpass his reason, there is strengthened in man the
view that God is something above what he can think.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Another benefit that comes from the revelation to men of truths that exceed the reason is the
curbing of presumption, which is the mother of error. For there are some who have such a
presumptuous opinion of their own ability that they deem themselves able to measure the nature
of everything; I mean to say that, in their estimation, everything is true that seems to them so, and
everything is false that does not. So that the human mind, therefore, might be freed from this
presumption and come to a humble inquiry after truth, it was necessary that some things should
be proposed to man by God that would completely surpass his intellect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] A still further benefit may also be seen in what Aristotle says in the <i>Ethics</i> [X, 7]. There was
a certain Simonides who exhorted people to put aside the knowledge of divine things and to
apply their talents to human occupations. He said that &#8220;he who is a man should know human
things, and he who is mortal, things that are mortal.&#8221; Against Simonides Aristotle says that &#8220;man
should draw himself towards what is immortal and divine as much as he can.&#8221; And so he says
in the <i>De animalibus</i> [I, 5] that, although what we know of the higher substances is very little,
yet that little is loved and desired more than all the knowledge that we have about less noble
substances. He also says in the <i>De caelo et mundo</i> [II, 12] that when questions about the heavenly
bodies can be given even a modest and merely plausible solution, he who hears this experiences
intense joy. From all these considerations it is clear that even the most imperfect knowledge
about the most noble realities brings the greatest perfection to the soul. Therefore, although the
human reason cannot grasp fully the truths that are above it, yet, if it somehow holds these truths
at least by faith, it acquires great perfection for itself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Therefore it is written: &#8220;For many things are shown to you above the understanding of men&#8221;
(Sirach 3:75). Again: &#8220;So the things that are of God no man knows but the Spirit of God. But to
us God has revealed them by His Spirit&#8221; (1 Cor. 2:11, 10).</p>

EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE ABOVE REASON</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] Those who place their faith in this truth, however, &#8220;for which the human reason offers no
experimental evidence,&#8221; do not believe foolishly, as though &#8220;following artificial fables&#8221; (2 Peter
2:16). For these &#8220;secrets of divine Wisdom&#8221; (Job 11:6) the divine Wisdom itself, which knows
all things to the full, has deigned to reveal to men. It reveals its own presence, as well as the truth
of its teaching and inspiration, by fitting arguments; and in order to confirm those truths that
exceed natural knowledge, it gives visible manifestation to works that surpass the ability of all
nature. Thus, there are the wonderful cures of illnesses, there is the raising of the dead, and the
wonderful immutation in the heavenly bodies; and what is more wonderful, there is the
inspiration given to human minds, so that simple and untutored persons, filled with the gift of
the Holy Spirit, come to possess instantaneously the highest wisdom and the readiest eloquence.
When these arguments were examined, through the efficacy of the abovementioned proof, and
not the violent assault of arms or the promise of pleasure, and (what is most wonderful of all) in
the midst of the tyranny of the persecutors, an innumerable throng of people, both simple and
most learned, flocked to the Christian faith. In this faith there are truths preached that surpass
every human intellect; the pleasures of the flesh are curbed; it is taught that the things of the
world should be spurned. Now, for the minds of mortal men to assent to these things is the
greatest of miracles, just as it is a manifest work of divine inspiration that, spurning visible
things, men should seek only what is invisible. Now, that this has happened neither without
preparation nor by chance, but as a result of the disposition of God, is clear from the fact that
through many pronouncements of the ancient prophets God had foretold that He would do this.
The books of these prophets are held in veneration among us Christians, since they give witness
to our faith.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] The manner of this confirmation is touched on by St. Paul: &#8220;Which,&#8221; that is, human salvation,
&#8220;having begun to be declared by the Lord, was confirmed to us by them that hear Him: God also
bearing them witness of signs, and wonders, and divers miracles, and distributions of the Holy
Spirit&#8221; (Heb. 7:3-4).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] This wonderful conversion of the world to the Christian faith is the clearest witness of the
signs given in the past; so that it is not necessary that they should be further repeated, since they
appear most clearly in their effect. For it would be truly more wonderful than all signs if the
world had been led by simple and humble men to believe such lofty truths, to accomplish such
difficult actions, and to have such high hopes. Yet it is also a fact that, even in our own time, God
does not cease to work miracles through His saints for the confirmation of the faith.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] On the other hand, those who founded sects committed to erroneous doctrines proceeded in
a way that is opposite to this, The point is clear in the case of Muhammad. He seduced the people
by promises of carnal pleasure to which the concupiscence of the flesh goads us. His teaching
also contained precepts that were in conformity with his promises, and he gave free rein to carnal
pleasure. In all this, as is not unexpected, he was obeyed by carnal men. As for proofs of the truth
of his doctrine, he brought forward only such as could be grasped by the natural ability of anyone
with a very modest wisdom. Indeed, the truths that he taught he mingled with many fables and
with doctrines of the greatest falsity. He did not bring forth any signs produced in a supernatural
way, which alone fittingly gives witness to divine inspiration; for a visible action that can be only
divine reveals an invisibly inspired teacher of truth. On the contrary, Muhammad said that he was
sent in the power of his arms&#8212;which are signs not lacking even to robbers and tyrants. What is
more, no wise men, men trained in things divine and human, believed in him from the beginning,
Those who believed in him were brutal men and desert wanderers, utterly ignorant of all divine
teaching, through whose numbers Muhammad forced others to become his followers by the
violence of his arms. Nor do divine pronouncements on the part of preceding prophets offer him
any witness. On the contrary, he perverts almost all the testimonies of the Old and New
Testaments by making them into fabrications of his own, as can be. seen by anyone who
examines his law. It was, therefore, a shrewd decision on his part to forbid his followers to read
the Old and New Testaments, lest these books convict him of falsity. It is thus clear that those
who place any faith in his words believe foolishly.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THAT THE TRUTH OF REASON IS NOT OPPOSED TO THE TRUTH OF THE
CHRISTIAN FAITH</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] Now, although the truth of the Christian faith which we have discussed surpasses the capacity
of the reason, nevertheless that truth that the human reason is naturally endowed to know cannot
be opposed to the truth of the Christian faith. For that with which the human reason is naturally
endowed is clearly most true; so much so, that it is impossible for us to think of such truths as
false. Nor is it permissible to believe as false that which we hold by faith, since this is confirmed
in a way that is so clearly divine. Since, therefore, only the false is opposed to the true, as is
clearly evident from an examination of their definitions, it is impossible that the truth of faith
should be opposed to those principles that the human reason knows naturally.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] Furthermore, that which is introduced into the soul of the student by the teacher is contained
in the knowledge of the teacher&#8212;unless his teaching is fictitious, which it is improper to say of
God. Now, the knowledge of the principles that are known to us naturally has been implanted in
us by God; for God is the Author of our nature. These principles, therefore, are also contained
by the divine Wisdom. Hence, whatever is opposed to them is opposed to the divine Wisdom,
and, therefore, cannot come from God. That which we hold by faith as divinely revealed,
therefore, cannot be contrary to our natural knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Again. In the presence of contrary arguments our intellect is chained, so that it cannot proceed
to the knowledge of the truth. If, therefore, contrary knowledges were implanted in us by God,
our intellect would be hindered from knowing truth by this very fact. Now, such an effect cannot
come from God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] And again. What is natural cannot change as long as nature does not. Now, it is impossible
that contrary opinions should exist in the same knowing subject at the same time. No opinion or
belief, therefore, is implanted in man by God which is contrary to man&#8217;s natural knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Therefore, the Apostle says: &#8220;The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth and in thy heart. This
is the word of faith, which we preach&#8221; (Rom. 10:8). But because it overcomes reason, there are
some who think that it is opposed to it: which is impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] The authority of St. Augustine also agrees with this. He writes as follows: &#8220;That which truth
will reveal cannot in any way be opposed to the sacred books of the Old and the New Testament&#8221;
[<i>De genesi ad litteram</i> II, 18].</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] From this we evidently gather the following conclusion: whatever arguments are brought
forward against the doctrines of faith are conclusions incorrectly derived from the first and self-evident principles imbedded in nature. Such conclusions do not have the force of demonstration;
they are arguments that are either probable or sophistical. And so, there exists the possibility to
answer them.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">HOW THE HUMAN REASON IS RELATED TO THE TRUTH OF FAITH</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] There is also a further consideration. Sensible things, from which the human reason takes the
origin of its knowledge, retain within themselves some sort of trace of a likeness to God. This
is so imperfect, however, that it is absolutely inadequate to manifest the substance of God. For
effects bear within themselves, in their own way, the likeness of their causes, since an agent
produces its like; yet an effect does not always reach to the full likeness of its cause. Now, the
human reason is related to the knowledge of the truth of faith (a truth which can be most evident
only to those who see the divine substance) in such a way that it can gather certain likenesses of
it, which are yet not sufficient so that the truth of faith may be comprehended as being
understood demonstratively or through itself. Yet it is useful for the human reason to exercise
itself in such arguments, however weak they may be, provided only that there be present no
presumption to comprehend or to demonstrate. For to be able to see something of the loftiest
realities, however thin and weak the sight may be, is, as our previous remarks indicate, a cause
of the greatest joy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] The testimony of Hilary agrees with this. Speaking of this same truth, he writes as follows
in his <i>De Trinitate</i> [II, 10, ii]: &#8220;Enter these truths by believing, press forward, persevere. And
though I may know that you will not arrive at an end, yet I will congratulate you in your progress.
For, though he who pursues the infinite with reverence will never finally reach the end, yet he
will always progress by pressing onward. But do not intrude yourself into the divine secret, do
not, presuming to comprehend the sum total of intelligence, plunge yourself into the mystery of
the unending nativity; rather, understand that these things are incomprehensible.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] It is clearly apparent, from what has been said, that the intention of the wise man ought to be
directed toward the twofold truth of divine things, and toward the destruction of the errors that
are contrary to this truth. One kind of divine truth the investigation of the reason is competent
to reach, whereas the other surpasses every effort of the reason. I am speaking of a &#8220;twofold truth
of divine things,&#8221; not on the part of God Himself, Who is truth one and simple, but from the
point of view of our knowledge, which is variously related to the knowledge of divine things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] Now, to make the first kind of divine truth known, we must proceed through demonstrative
arguments, by which our adversary may become convinced. However, since such arguments are
not available for the second kind of divine truth, our intention should not be to convince our
adversary by arguments: it should be to answer his arguments against the truth; for, as we have
shown, the natural reason cannot be contrary to the truth of faith. The sole way to overcome an
adversary of divine truth is from the authority of Scripture&#8212;an authority divinely confirmed by
miracles. For that which is above the human reason we believe only because God has revealed
it. Nevertheless, there are certain likely arguments that should be brought forth in order to make
divine truth known. This should be done for the training and consolation of the faithful, and not
with any idea of refuting those who are adversaries. For the very inadequacy of the arguments
would rather strengthen them in their error, since they would imagine that our acceptance of the
truth of faith was based on such weak arguments.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] This, then, is the manner of procedure we intend to follow. We shall first seek to make known
that truth which faith professes and reason investigates. This we shall do by bringing forward
both demonstrative and probable arguments, some of which were drawn from the books of the
philosophers and of the saints, through which truth is strengthened and its adversary overcome
[Books I-III]. Then, in order to follow a development from the more manifest to the less manifest,
we shall proceed to make known that truth which surpasses reason, answering the objections of
its adversaries and setting forth the truth of faith by probable arguments and by authorities, to the
best of our ability [Book IV].</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] We are aiming, then, to set out following the way of the reason and to inquire into what the
human reason can investigate about God. In this aim the first consideration that confronts us is
of that which belongs to God in Himself [Book I]. The second consideration concerns the coming
forth of creatures from God [Book II]. The third concerns the ordering of creatures to God as to
their end [Book III].</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Now, among the inquiries that we must undertake concerning God in Himself, we must set
down in the beginning that whereby His Existence is demonstrated, as the necessary foundation
of the whole work. For, if we do not demonstrate that God exists, all consideration of divine
things is necessarily suppressed.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THE OPINION OF THOSE WHO SAY THAT THE EXISTENCE OF GOD, BEING SELF-EVIDENT, CANNOT BE DEMONSTRATED</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] There are some persons to whom the inquiry seeking to demonstrate that God exists may
perhaps appear superfluous. These are the persons who assert that the existence of God is self-evident, in such wise that its contrary cannot be entertained in the mind. It thus appears that the
existence of God cannot be demonstrated, as may be seen from the following arguments.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] Those propositions are said to be self-evident that are known immediately upon the
knowledge of their terms. Thus, as soon as you know the nature of a whole and the nature of a
part, you know immediately that every whole is greater than its part. The proposition God exists
is of this sort. For by the name God we understand something than which a greater cannot be
thought. This notion is formed in the intellect by one who hears and understands the name God.
As a result, God must exist already at least in the intellect. But He cannot exist solely in the
intellect, since that which exists both in the intellect and in reality is greater than that which
exists in the intellect alone. Now, as the very definition of the name points out, nothing can be
greater than God. Consequently, the proposition that God exists is self-evident, as being evident
from the very meaning of the name God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Again, it is Possible to think that something exists whose non-existence cannot be thought.
Clearly, such a being is greater than the being whose non-existence can be thought.
Consequently, if God Himself could be thought not to be, then something greater than God could
be thought. This, however, is contrary to the definition of the name God. Hence, the proposition
that God exists is self-evident.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Furthermore, those propositions ought to be the most evident in which the same thing is
predicated of itself, for example, man is man, or whose predicates are included in the definition
of their subjects, for example, Man is an animal. Now, in God, as will be shown in a later
chapter, it is pre-eminently the case that His being is His essence, so that to the question what is
He? and to the question is He? the answer is one and the same. Thus, in the proposition God
exists, the predicate is consequently either identical with the subject or at least included in the
definition of the subject. Hence, that God exists is self-evident.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] What is naturally known is known through itself, for we do not come to such propositions
through an effort of inquiry. But the proposition that God exists is naturally known since, as will
be shown later on, the desire of man naturally tends towards God as towards the ultimate end.
The proposition that God exists is, therefore, self-evident.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] There is also the consideration that that through which all the rest are known ought itself to
be self-evident. Now, God is of this sort. For just as the light of the sun is the principle of all
visible perception, so the divine light is the principle of all intelligible knowledge; since the
divine light is that in which intelligible illumination is found first and in its highest degree. That
God exists, therefore, must be self-evident.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] These, then, and others like them are the arguments by which some think that the proposition
God exists is so self-evident that its contrary cannot be entertained by the mind.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">A REFUTATION OF THE ABOVEMENTIONED OPINION AND A SOLUTION OF THE ARGUMENTS</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] In part, the above opinion arises from the custom by which from their earliest days people are
brought up to hear and to call upon the name of God. Custom, and especially custom in a child
comes to have the force of nature. As a result, what the mind is steeped in from childhood it
clings to very firmly, as something known naturally and self-evidently.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] In part, however, the above opinion comes about because of a failure to distinguish between
that which is self-evident in an absolute sense and that which is self-evident in relation to us. For
assuredly that God exists is, absolutely speaking, self-evident, since what God is is His own
being. Yet, because we are not able to conceive in our minds that which God is, that God exists
remains unknown in relation to us. So, too, that every whole is greater than its part is, absolutely
speaking, self-evident; but it would perforce be unknown to one who could not conceive the
nature of a whole. Hence it comes about, as it is said in <i>Metaphysics</i> II [Ia, 1], that &#8220;our intellect
is related to the most knowable things in reality as the eye of an owl is related to the sun.&#8221;&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] And, contrary to the Point made by the first argument, it does not follow immediately that,
as soon as we know the meaning of the name God, the existence of God is known. It does not
follow first because it is not known to all, even including those who admit that God exists, that
God is that than which a greater cannot be thought. After all, many ancients said that this world
itself was God. Furthermore, no such inference can be drawn from the interpretations of the name
God to be found in Damascene [<i>De fide orthodoxa</i> I, 9]. What is more, granted that everyone
should understand by the name God something than which a greater cannot be thought, it will
still not be necessary that there exist in reality something than which a greater cannot be thought.
For a thing and the definition of a name are posited in the same way. Now, from the fact that that
which is indicated by the name God is conceived by the mind, it does not follow that God exists
save only in the intellect. Hence, that than which a greater cannot be thought will likewise not
have to exist save only in the intellect. From this it does not follow that there exists in reality
something than which a greater cannot be thought. No difficulty, consequently, befalls anyone
who posits that God does not exist. For that something greater can be thought than anything
given in reality or in the intellect is a difficulty only to him who admits that there is something
than which a greater cannot be thought in reality.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Nor, again, is it necessary, as the second argument advanced, that something greater than God
can be thought if God can be thought not to be. For that He can be thought not to be does not
arise either from the imperfection or the uncertainty of His own being, since this is in itself most
manifest. It arises, rather, from the weakness of our intellect, which cannot behold God Himself
except through His effects and which is thus led to know His existence through reasoning.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] This enables us to solve the third argument as well. For just as it is evident to us that a whole
is greater than a part of itself, so to those seeing the divine essence in itself it is supremely self-evident that God exists because His essence is His being. But, because we are not able to see His
essence, we arrive at the knowledge of His being, not through God Himself, but through His
effects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] The answer to the fourth argument is likewise clear. For man naturally knows God in the
same way as he naturally desires God. Now, man naturally desires God in so far as he naturally
desires beatitude, which is a certain likeness of the divine goodness. On this basis, it is not
necessary that God considered in Himself be naturally known to man, but only a likeness of God.
It remains, therefore, that man is to reach the knowledge of God through reasoning by way of the
likenesses of God found in His effects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] So, too, with the fifth argument, an easy solution is available. For God is indeed that by which
all things are known, not in the sense that they are not known unless He is known (as obtains
among self-evident principles), but because all our knowledge is caused in us through His
influence.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THE OPINION OF THOSE WHO SAY THAT THE EXISTENCE OF GOD CANNOT
BE DEMONSTRATED BUT IS HELD BY FAITH ALONE</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] There are others who hold a certain opinion, contrary to the position mentioned above,
through which the efforts of those seeking to prove the existence of God would likewise be
rendered futile. For they say that we cannot arrive at the existence of God through the reason; it
is received by way of faith and revelation alone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] What led some persons to hold this view was the weakness of the arguments which had been
brought forth by others to prove that God exists.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Nevertheless, the present error might erroneously find support in its behalf in the words of
some philosophers who show that in God essence and being are identical, that is, that that which
answers to the question what is it? is identical with that which answers to the question is it? Now,
following the way of the reason we cannot arrive at a knowledge of what God is. Hence, it seems
likewise impossible to demonstrate by the reason that God exists.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Furthermore, according to the logic of the Philosopher, as a principle to demonstrate whether
a thing is we must take the signification of the name of that thing [<i>Posterior Analytics</i> II, 9]; and,
again according to the Philosopher [<i>Metaphysics</i> IV, 7], the meaning signified by a name is its
definition. If this be so, if we set aside a knowledge of the divine essence or quiddity, no means
will be available whereby to demonstrate that God exists.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Again, if, as is shown in the <i>Posterior Analytics</i> [I, 18], the knowledge of the principles of
demonstration takes its origin from sense, whatever transcends all sense and sensibles seems to
be indemonstrable. That God exists appears to be a proposition of this sort and is therefore
indemonstrable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] The falsity of this opinion is shown to us, first, from the art of demonstration which teaches
us to arrive at causes from their effects. Then, it is shown to us from the order of the sciences.
For, as it is said in the <i>Metaphysics</i> [IV, 3], if there is no knowable substance higher than sensible
substance, there will be no science higher than physics. It is shown, thirdly, from the pursuit of
the philosophers, who have striven to demonstrate that God exists. Finally, it is shown to us by
the truth in the words of the Apostle Paul: &#8220;For the invisible things of God... are clearly seen,
being understood by the things that are made&#8221; (Rom. 1:20).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] Nor, contrary to the first argument, is there any problem in the fact that in God essence and
being are identical. For this is understood of the being by which God subsists in Himself. But we
do not know of what sort this being is, just as we do not know the divine essence. The reference
is not to the being that signifies the composition of intellect. For thus the existence of God does
fall under demonstration; this happens when our mind is led from demonstrative arguments to
form such a proposition of God whereby it expresses that He exists.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[8] Now, in arguments proving the existence of God, it is not necessary to assume the divine
essence or quiddity as the middle term of the demonstration. This was the second view proposed
above. In place of the quiddity, an effect is taken as the middle term, as in demonstrations <i>quia</i>.
It is from such effects that the meaning of the name God is taken. For all divine names are
imposed either by removing the effects of God from Him or by relating God in some way to His
effects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[9] It is thereby likewise evident that, although God transcends all sensible things and the sense
itself, His effects, on which the demonstration proving His existence is based, are nevertheless
sensible things. And thus, the origin of our knowledge in the sense applies also to those things
that transcend the sense.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">ARGUMENTS IN PROOF OF THE EXISTENCE OF GOD</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] We have now shown that the effort to demonstrate the existence of God is not a vain one. We
shall therefore proceed to set forth the arguments by which both philosophers and Catholic
teachers have proved that God exists.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] We shall first set forth the arguments by which Aristotle proceeds to prove that God exists.
The aim of Aristotle is to do this in two ways, beginning with motion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Of these ways the first is as follows. Everything that is moved is moved by another. That
some things are in motion&#8212;for example, the sun&#8212;is evident from sense. Therefore, it is moved
by something else that moves it. This mover is itself either moved or not moved. If it is not, we
have reached our conclusion&#8212;namely, that we must posit some unmoved mover. This we call
God. If it is moved, it is moved by another mover. We must, consequently, either proceed to
infinity, or we must arrive at some unmoved mover. Now, it is not possible to proceed to infinity.
Hence, we must posit some prime unmoved mover.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] In this proof, there are two propositions that need to be proved, namely, that everything that
is moved is moved by another, and that in movers and things moved one cannot proceed to
infinity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] The first of these propositions Aristotle proves in three ways. The first way is as follows. If
something moves itself, it must have within itself the principle of its own motion; otherwise, it
is clearly moved by another. Furthermore, it must be primarily moved. This means that it must
be moved by reason of itself, and not by reason of a part of itself, as happens when an animal is
moved by the motion of its foot. For, in this sense, a whole would not be moved by itself, but a
part, and one part would be moved by another. It is also necessary that a self-moving being be
divisible and have parts, since, as it is proved in the <i>Physics</i> [VI, 4], whatever is moved is
divisible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] On the basis of these suppositions Aristotle argues as follows. That which is held to be moved
by itself is primarily moved. Hence, when one of its parts is at rest, the whole is then at rest. For
if, while one part was at rest, another part in it were moved, then the whole itself would not be
primarily moved; it would be that part in it which is moved while another part is at rest. But
nothing that is at rest because something else is at rest is moved by itself; for that being whose
rest follows upon the rest of another must have its motion follow upon the motion of another. It
is thus not moved by itself. Therefore, that which was posited as being moved by itself is not
moved by itself. Consequently, everything that is moved must be moved by another.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] Nor is it an objection to this argument if one might say that, when something is held to move
itself, a part of it cannot be at rest; or, again, if one might say that a part is not subject to rest or
motion except accidentally, which is the unfounded argument of Avicenna. For, indeed, the force
of Aristotle&#8217;s argument lies in this: if something moves itself primarily and through itself, rather
than through its parts, that it is moved cannot depend on another. But the moving of the divisible
itself, like its being, depends on its parts; it cannot therefore move itself primarily and through
itself. Hence, for the truth of the inferred conclusion it is not necessary to assume as an absolute
truth that a part of a being moving itself is at rest. What must rather be true is this conditional
proposition: if the part were at rest, the whole would be at rest. Now, this proposition would be
true even though its antecedent be impossible. In the same way, the following conditional
proposition is true: if man is an ass, he is irrational.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[8] In the second way, Aristotle proves the proposition by induction [<i>Physics</i> VIII, 4]. Whatever
is moved by accident is not moved by itself, since it is moved upon the motion of another. So,
too, as is evident, what is moved by violence is not moved by itself. Nor are those beings moved
by themselves that are moved by their nature as being moved from within; such is the case with
animals, which evidently are moved by the soul. Nor, again, is this true of those beings, such as
heavy and light bodies, which are moved through nature. For such beings are moved by the
generating cause and the cause removing impediments. Now, whatever is moved is moved
through itself or by accident. If it is moved through itself, then it is moved either violently or by
nature; if by nature, then either through itself, as the animal, or not through itself, as heavy and
light bodies. Therefore, everything that is moved is moved by another.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[9] In the third way, Aristotle proves the proposition as follows [VIII, 5]. The same thing cannot
be at once in act and in potency with respect to the same thing. But everything that is moved is,
as such, in potency. For motion is the act of something that is in potency inasmuch as it is in
potency. That which moves, however, is as such in act, for nothing acts except according as it
is in act. Therefore, with respect to the same motion, nothing is both mover and moved. Thus,
nothing moves itself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[10] It is to be noted, however, that Plato, who held that every mover is moved [<i>Phaedrus</i>],
understood the name motion in a wider sense than did Aristotle. For Aristotle understood motion
strictly, according as it is the act of what exists in potency inasmuch as it is such. So understood,
motion belongs only to divisible bodies, as it is proved in the <i>Physics</i> [VI, 4]. According to Plato,
however, that which moves itself is not a body. Plato understood by motion any given operation,
so that to understand and to judge are a kind of motion. Aristotle likewise touches upon this
manner of speaking in the <i>De anima</i> [III, 7]. Plato accordingly said that the first mover moves
himself because he knows himself and wills or loves himself. In a way, this is not opposed to the
reasons of Aristotle. There is no difference between reaching a first being that moves himself,
as understood by Plato, and reaching a first being that is absolutely unmoved, as understood by
Aristotle.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[11] The second proposition, namely, that there is no procession to infinity among movers and
things moved, Aristotle proves in three ways.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[12] The first is as follows [VII, 1]. If among movers and things moved we proceed to infinity,
all these infinite beings must be bodies. For whatever is moved is divisible and a body, as is
proved in the <i>Physics</i> [VI, 4]. But every body that moves some thing moved is itself moved while
moving it. Therefore, all these infinites are moved together while one of them is moved. But one
of them, being finite, is moved in a finite time. Therefore, all those infinites are moved in a finite
time. This, however, is impossible. It is, therefore, impossible that among movers and things
moved one can proceed to infinity.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.125in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[13] Furthermore, that it is impossible for the abovementioned infinites to be moved in a finite
time Aristotle proves as follows. The mover and the thing moved must exist simultaneously. This
Aristotle proves by induction in the various species of motion. But bodies cannot be
simultaneous except through continuity or contiguity. Now, since, as has been proved, all the
aforementioned movers and. things moved are bodies, they must constitute by continuity or
contiguity a sort of single mobile. In this way, one infinite is moved in a finite time. This is
impossible, as is proved in the <i>Physics</i> [VII, 1].</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[14] The second argument proving the same conclusion is the following. In an ordered series of
movers and things moved (this is a series in which one is moved by another according to an
order), it is necessarily the fact that, when the first mover is removed or ceases to move, no other
mover will move or be moved. For the first mover is the cause of motion for all the others. But,
if there are movers and things moved following an order to infinity, there will be no first mover,
but all would be as intermediate movers. Therefore, none of the others will be able to be moved,
and thus nothing in the world will be moved.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[15] The third proof comes to the same conclusion, except that, by beginning with the superior,
it has a reversed order. It is as follows. That which moves as an instrumental cause cannot move
unless there be a principal moving cause. But, if we proceed to infinity among movers and things
moved, all movers will be as instrumental causes, because they will be moved movers and there
will be nothing as a principal mover. Therefore, nothing will be moved.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[16] Such, then, is the proof of both propositions assumed by Aristotle in the first demonstrative
way by which he proved that a first unmoved mover exists.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[17] The second way is this. If every mover is moved, this proposition is true either by itself or
by accident. If by accident, then it is not necessary, since what is true by accident is not
necessary. It is something possible, therefore, that no mover is moved. But if a mover is not
moved, it does not move: as the adversary says. It is therefore possible that nothing is moved.
For, if nothing moves, nothing is moved. This, however, Aristotle considers to be
impossible&#8212;namely, that at any time there be no motion. Therefore, the first proposition was not
possible, since from a false possible, a false impossible does not follow. Hence, this proposition,
every mover is moved by another, was not true by accident.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[18] Again, if two things are accidentally joined in some being, and one of them is found without
the other, it is probable that the other can be found without it. For example, if white and musical
are found in Socrates, and in Plato we find musical but not white, it is probable that in some other
being we can find the white without the musical. Therefore, if mover and thing moved are
accidentally joined in some being, and the thing moved be found without the mover in some
being, it is probable that the mover is found without that which is moved. Nor can the example
of two things, of which one depends on the other, be brought as an objection against this. For the
union we are speaking of is not essential, but accidental.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[19] But, if the proposition that every mover is moved is true by itself, something impossible or
awkward likewise follows. For the mover must be moved either by the same kind of motion as
that by which he moves, or by another. If the same, a cause of alteration must itself be altered,
and further, a healing cause must itself be healed, and a teacher must himself be taught and this
with respect to the same knowledge. Now, this is impossible. A teacher must have science,
whereas he who is a learner of necessity does not have it. So that, if the proposition were true,
the same thing would be possessed and not possessed by the same being&#8212;which is impossible.
If, however, the mover is moved by another species of motion, so that (namely) the altering cause
is moved according to place, and the cause moving according to place is increased, and so forth,
since the genera and species of motion are finite in number, it will follow that we cannot proceed
to infinity. There will thus be a first mover, which is not moved by another. Will someone say
that there will be a recurrence, so that when all the genera and species of motion have been
completed the series will be repeated and return to the first motion? This would involve saying,
for example, that a mover according to place would be altered, the altering cause would be
increased, and the increasing cause would be moved according to place. Yet this whole view
would arrive at the same conclusion as before: whatever moves according to a certain species of
motion is itself moved according to the same species of motion, though mediately and not
immediately.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[20] It remains, therefore, that we must posit some first mover that is not moved by any exterior
moving cause.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[21] Granted this conclusion&#8212;namely, that there is a first mover that is not moved by an exterior
moving cause&#8212;it yet does not follow that this mover is absolutely unmoved. That is why
Aristotle goes on to say that the condition of the first mover may be twofold [VIII, 5]. The first
mover can be absolutely unmoved. If so, we have the conclusion we are seeking: there is a first
unmoved mover. On the other hand, the first mover can be self-moved. This may be argued,
because that which is through itself is prior to what is through another. Hence, among things
moved as well, it seems reasonable that the first moved is moved through itself and not by
another.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[22] But, on this basis, the same conclusion again follows. For it cannot be said that, when a
mover moves himself, the whole is moved by the whole. Otherwise, the same difficulties would
follow as before: one person would both teach and be taught, and the same would be true among
other motions. It would also follow that a being would be both in potency and in act; for a mover
is, as such, in act, whereas the thing moved is in potency. Consequently, one part of the self-moved mover is solely moving, and the other part solely moved. We thus reach the same
conclusion as before: there exists an unmoved mover.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[23] Nor can it be held that both parts of the self-moved mover are moved, so that one is moved
by the other, or that one moves both itself and the other, or that the whole moves a part, or that
a part moves the whole. All this would involve the return of the aforementioned difficulties:
something would both move and be moved according to the same species of motion; something
would be at once in potency and in act; and, furthermore, the whole would not be primarily
moving itself, it would move through the motion of a part. The conclusion thus stands: one part
of a self-moved mover must be unmoved and moving the other part.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[24] But there is another point to consider. Among self-moved beings known to us, namely,
animals, although the moving part, which is to say the soul, is unmoved through itself, it is yet
moved by accident. That is why Aristotle further shows that the moving part of the first self-moving being is not moved either through itself or by accident [VIII, 6]. For, since self-moving
beings known to us, namely, animals, are corruptible, the moving part in them is moved by
accident. But corruptible self-moving beings must be reduced to some first self-moving being
that is everlasting. Therefore, some self-moving being must have a mover that is moved neither
through itself nor by accident.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[25] It is further evident that, according to the position of Aristotle, some self-moved being must
be everlasting. For if, as Aristotle supposes, motion is everlasting, the generation of self-moving
beings (this means beings that are generable and corruptible) must be endless. But the cause of
this endlessness cannot be one of the self-moving beings, since it does not always exist. Nor can
the cause be all the self-moving beings together, both because they would be infinite and because
they would not be simultaneous. There must therefore be some endlessly self-moving being,
causing the endlessness of generation among these sublunary self-movers. Thus, the mover of
the self-moving being is not moved, either through itself or by accident.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[26] Again, we see that among beings that move themselves some initiate a new motion as a
result of some motion. This new motion is other than the motion by which an animal moves
itself, for example, digested food or altered air. By such a motion the self-moving mover is
moved by accident. From this we may infer that no self-moved being is moved everlastingly
whose mover is moved either by itself or by accident. But the first self-mover is everlastingly in
motion; otherwise, motion could not be everlasting, since every other motion is caused by the
motion of the self-moving first mover. Ile first self-moving being, therefore, is moved by a mover
who is himself moved neither through himself nor by accident.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[27] Nor is it against this argument that the movers of the lower spheres produce an everlasting
motion and yet are said to be moved by accident. For they are said to be moved by accident, not
on their own account, but on account of their movable subjects, which follow the motion of the
higher sphere.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[28] Now, God is not part of any self-moving mover. In his <i>Metaphysics</i> [XII, 7], therefore,
Aristotle goes on from the mover who is a part of the self-moved mover to seek another
mover&#8212;God&#8212;who is absolutely separate. For, since everything moving itself is moved through
appetite, the mover who is part of the self-moving being moves because of the appetite of some
appetible object. This object is higher, in the order of motion, than the mover desiring it; for the
one desiring is in a manner a moved mover, whereas an appetible object is an absolutely
unmoved mover. There must, therefore, be an absolutely unmoved separate first mover. This is
God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[29] Two considerations seem to invalidate these arguments. The first consideration is that, as
arguments, they presuppose the eternity of motion, which Catholics consider to be false.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[30] To this consideration the reply is as follows. The most efficacious way to prove that God
exists is on the supposition that the world is eternal. Granted this supposition, that God exists is
less manifest. For, if the world and motion have a first beginning, some cause must clearly be
posited to account for this origin of the world and of motion. That which comes to be anew must
take its origin from some innovating cause; since nothing brings itself from potency to act, or
from non-being to being.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[31] The second consideration is that the demonstrations given above presuppose that the first
moved being, namely, a heavenly body, is self-moved. This means that it is animated, which
many do not admit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[32] The reply to this consideration is that, if the prime mover is not held to be self-moved, then
it must be moved immediately by something absolutely unmoved. Hence, even Aristotle himself
proposed this conclusion as a disjunction: it is necessary either to arrive immediately at an
unmoved separate first mover, or to arrive at a self-moved mover from whom, in turn, an
unmoved separate first mover is reached.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[33] In <i>Metaphysics</i> II [Ia, 2] Aristotle also uses another argument to show that there is no infinite
regress in efficient causes and that we must reach one first cause&#8212;God. This way is as follows.
In all ordered efficient causes, the first is the cause of the intermediate cause, whether one or
many, and this is the cause of the last cause. But, when you suppress a cause, you suppress its
effect. Therefore, if you suppress the first cause, the intermediate cause cannot be a cause. Now,
if there were an infinite regress among efficient causes, no cause would be first. Therefore, all
the other causes, which are intermediate, will be suppressed. But this is manifestly false. We
must, therefore, posit that there exists a first efficient cause. This is God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[34] Another argument may also be gathered from the words of Aristotle. In <i>Metaphysics</i> II [Ia,
1] he shows that what is most true is also most a being. But in <i>Metaphysics</i> IV [4] he shows the
existence of something supremely true from the observed fact that of two false things one is more
false than the other, which means that one is more true than the other. This comparison is based
on the nearness to that which is absolutely and supremely true. From these Aristotelian texts we
may further infer that there is something that is supremely being. This we call God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[35] Damascene proposes another argument for the same conclusion taken from the government
of the world [<i>De fide orthodoxa</i> I, 3]. Averroes likewise hints at it [In II <i>Physicorum</i>]. The
argument runs thus. Contrary and discordant things cannot, always or for the most part, be parts
of one order except under someone&#8217;s government, which enables all and each to tend to a definite
end. But in the world we find that things of diverse natures come together under one order, and
this not rarely or by chance, but always or for the most part. There must therefore be some being
by whose providence the world is governed. This we call God.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THAT TO KNOW GOD WE MUST USE THE WAY OF REMOTION</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] We have shown that there exists a first being, whom we call God. We must, accordingly, now
investigate the properties of this being.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] Now, in considering the divine substance, we should especially make use of the method of
remotion. For, by its immensity, the divine substance surpasses every form that our intellect
reaches. Thus we are unable to apprehend it by knowing what it is. Yet we are able to have some
knowledge of it by knowing what it is not. Furthermore, we approach nearer to a knowledge of
God according as through our intellect we are able to remove more and more things from Him.
For we know each thing more perfectly the more fully we see its differences from other things;
for each thing has within itself its own being, distinct from all other things. So, too, in the case
of the things whose definitions we know. We locate them in a genus, through which we know
in a general way what they are. Then we add differences to each thing, by which it may be
distinguished from other things. In this way, a complete knowledge of a substance is built up.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] However, in the consideration of the divine substance we cannot take a what as a genus; nor
can we derive the distinction of God from things by differences affirmed of God. For this reason,
we must derive the distinction of God from other beings by means of negative differences. And
just as among affirmative differences one contracts the other, so one negative difference is
contracted by another that makes it to differ from many beings. For example, if we say that God
is not an accident, we thereby distinguish Him from all accidents. Then, if we add that He is not
a body, we shall further distinguish Him from certain substances. And thus, proceeding in order,
by such negations God will be distinguished from all that He is not. Finally, there will then be
a proper consideration of God&#8217;s substance when He will be known as distinct from all things.
Yet, this knowledge will not be perfect, since it will not tell us what God is in Himself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] As a principle of procedure in knowing God by way of remotion, therefore, let us adopt the
proposition which, from what we have said, is now manifest, namely, that God is absolutely
unmoved. The authority of Sacred Scripture also confirms this. For it is written: &#8220;I am the Lord
and I change not&#8221; (Mal. 3:6); ...&#8220;with whom there is no change&#8221; (James 2:17). Again: &#8220;God is
not man... that He should be changed (Num. 23:19).</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THAT GOD IS ETERNAL</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] From what we have said it is further apparent that God is eternal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] Everything that begins to be or ceases to be does so through motion or change. Since,
however, we have shown that God is absolutely immutable, He is eternal, lacking all beginning
or end.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Again. Those beings alone are measured by time that are moved. For time, as is made clear
in <i>Physics</i> IV [11], is &#8220;the number of motion.&#8221; But God, as has been proved, is absolutely without
motion, and is consequently not measured by time. There is, therefore, no before and after in
Him; He does not have being after non-being, nor non-being after being, nor can any succession
be found in His being. For none of these characteristics can be understood without time. God,
therefore, is without beginning and end, having His whole being at once. In this consists the
nature of eternity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] What is more, if it were true that there was a time when He existed after not existing, then
He must have been brought by someone from non-being to being. Not by Himself, since what
does not exist cannot act. If by another, then this other is prior to God. But we have shown that
God is the first cause. Hence, He did not begin to be, nor consequently will He cease to be, for
that which has been everlastingly has the power to be everlastingly. God is, therefore, eternal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] We find in the world, furthermore, certain beings, those namely that are subject to generation
and corruption, which can be and not-be. But what can be has a cause because, since it is equally
related to two contraries, namely, being and non-being, it must be owing to some cause that being
accrues to it. Now, as we have proved by the reasoning of Aristotle, one cannot proceed to
infinity among causes. We must therefore posit something that is a necessary being. Every
necessary being, however, either has the cause of its necessity in an outside source or, if it does
not, it is necessary through itself. But one cannot proceed to infinity among necessary beings the
cause of whose necessity lies in an outside source. We must therefore posit a first necessary
being, which is necessary through itself. This is God, since, as we have shown, He is the first
cause. God, therefore, is eternal, since whatever is necessary through itself is eternal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] From the everlastingness of time, likewise, Aristotle shows the everlastingness of motion
[<i>Physics</i> VIII, 1], from which he further shows the everlastingness of the moving substance [VIII,
6]. Now, the first moving substance is God. God is therefore everlasting. If we deny the
everlastingness of time and motion, we are still able to prove the everlastingness of the moving
substance. For, if motion had a beginning, it must have done so through some moving cause. If
this moving cause began, it did so through the action of some cause. Hence, either one will
proceed to infinity, or he will arrive at a moving cause that had no beginning.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] To this truth divine authority offers witness. The Psalmist says: &#8220;But You, Lord, endure
forever&#8221;; and he goes on to say: &#8220;But You art always the selfsame: and Your years shall not fail&#8221;

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] If God is eternal, of necessity there is no potency in Him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] The being whose substance has an admixture of potency is liable not to be by as much as it
has potency; for that which can be, can not-be. But, God, being everlasting, in His substance
cannot not-be. In God, therefore, there is no potency to being.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Though a being that is sometime in potency and sometime in act is in time in potency before
being in act, absolutely speaking act is prior to potency. For potency does not raise itself to act;
it must be raised to act by something that is in act. Hence, whatever is in some way in potency
has something prior to it. But, as is evident from what was said above, God is the first being and
the first cause. Hence, He has no admixture of potency in Himself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Moreover, that which is a necessary being through itself is in no way a possible being, since
that which is through itself a necessary being has no cause, whereas, as we have shown above,
whatever is a possible being has a cause. But God is through Himself a necessary being. He is,
therefore, in no way a possible being, and so no potency is found in His substance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Again, each thing acts in so far as it is in act. Therefore, what is not wholly act acts, not with
the whole of itself, but with part of itself. But what does not act with the whole of itself is not the
first agent, since it does not act through its essence but through participation in something. The
first agent, therefore, namely, God, has no admixture of potency but is pure act.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Further, just as each thing naturally acts in so far as it is in act, so it is naturally receptive in
so far as it is in potency; for motion is the act of that which exists in potency. But God is
absolutely impassible and immutable, as is clear from what we have said. He has, therefore, no
part of potency&#8212;that is, passive potency.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] Then, too, we see something in the world that emerges from potency to act. Now, it does not
educe itself from potency to act, since that which is in potency, being still in potency, can
therefore not act. Some prior being is therefore needed by which it may be brought forth from
potency to act. This cannot go on to infinity. We must, therefore, arrive at some being that is only
in act and in no wise in potency. This being we call God.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THAT THERE IS NO MATTER IN GOD</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] From this it is likewise evident that God is not matter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] Whatever matter is, it is in potency.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Matter, furthermore, is not a principle of acting. That is why, according to Aristotle, the
efficient cause and matter do not coincide [<i>Physics</i> II, 7]. But, as we have said, it belongs to God
to be the first efficient cause of things. Therefore, He is not matter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Moreover, for those who reduced all things to matter as to the first cause it follows that
natural things exist by chance. Aristotle argues against these thinkers in <i>Physics</i> II [8]. Hence,
if God, Who is the first cause, is the material cause of things, it follows that all things exist by
chance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Again, matter does not become the cause of something actual except by being altered and
changed. But if, as we have proved, God is absolutely immobile, He cannot in any way be the
cause of things according to the mode of matter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Now, the Catholic faith professes this truth, namely, it asserts that God has created all things,
not out of His own substance, but out of nothing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] On this point, however, the madness of David of Dinant stands confounded. He dared to
assert that God is the same as prime matter on the ground that, if He were not, He would have
to differ from it by some differences, and thus they would not be simple. For in the being that
differs from another by a difference, the difference itself produces a composition. David&#8217;s
position was the result of ignorance. He did not know how to distinguish between difference and
diversity. The different, as is determined in <i>Metaphysics</i> X [3], is said relationally, for every
different is different by something. Something is called diverse, however, absolutely, from the
fact that it is not the same. Difference, therefore, must be sought among those things that agree
in something, for we must point to something in them according to which they differ: for
example, two species agree in genus and must therefore be distinguished by differences. But in
things that agree in nothing we need not seek the whereby they differ; they are diverse by
themselves. In the same way, opposite differences are distinguished from one another. For they
do not share in the genus as a part of their essence, and therefore, since they are by themselves
diverse, there is no need to seek that by which they differ. In this way, too, God and prime matter
are distinguished: one is pure act, the other is pure potency, and they agree in nothing.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THAT THERE IS NO COMPOSITION IN GOD</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] From what we have set down we can conclude that there is no composition in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] In every composite there must be act and potency. For several things cannot become
absolutely one unless among them something is act and something potency. Now, beings in act
are not united except by being, so to speak, bound or joined together, which means that they are
not absolutely one. Their parts, likewise, are brought together as being in potency with respect
to the union, since they are united in act after being potentially unitable. But in God there is no
potency. Therefore, there is no composition in Him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Every composite, moreover, is subsequent to its components. The first being, therefore, which
is God, has no components.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Every composite, furthermore, is potentially dissoluble. This arises from the nature of
composition, although in some composites there is another element that resists dissolution. Now,
what is dissoluble can not-be. This does not befit God, since He is through Himself the necessary
being. There is, therefore, no composition in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Every composition, likewise, needs some composer. For, if there is composition, it is made
up of a plurality, and a plurality cannot be fitted into a unity except by some composer. If, then,
God were composite, He would have a composer. He could not compose Himself, since nothing
is its own cause, because it would be prior to itself, which is impossible. Now, the composer is
the efficient cause of the composite. Thus, God would have an efficient cause. Thus, too, He
would not be the first cause&#8212;which was proved above.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Again, in every genus the simpler a being, the more noble it is: e.g., in the genus of the hot,
Ere, which has no admixture of cold. That, therefore, which is at the peak of nobility among all
beings must be at the peak of simplicity. But the being that is at the peak of nobility among all
beings we call God, since He is the first cause. For a cause is nobler than an effect. God can,
therefore, have no composition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] Furthermore, in every composite the good belongs, not to this or that part, but to the
whole&#8212;and I say good according to the goodness that is proper to the whole and its perfection.
For parts are imperfect in comparison with the whole, as the parts of man are not a man, the parts
of the number six do not have the perfection of six, and similarly the parts of a line do not reach
the perfection of the measure found in the whole line. If, then, God is composite, His proper
perfection and goodness is found in the whole, not in any part of the whole. Thus, there will not
be in God purely that good which is proper to Him. God, then, is not the first and highest good.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[8] Again, prior to all multitude we must find unity. But there is multitude in every composite.
Therefore, that which is before all things, namely, God, must be free of all composition.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] From this Aristotle concludes that in God there can be nothing violent or unnatural.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] Everything in which there is found something violent and outside nature has something added
to itself, for what belongs to the substance of a thing can be neither violent nor outside nature.
Now, nothing simple has anything added to itself, since this would render it composite. Since,
then, God is simple, as we have shown, nothing in Him can be violent or outside nature.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Furthermore, the necessity of coaction is a necessity from another. But in God there is no
necessity from another; He is necessary through Himself and the cause of necessity for other
things. Therefore, nothing in God is due to coaction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Again, wherever there is something violent, there can be something beyond what befits a
thing through itself; for the violent is opposed to what is according to nature. But in God there
cannot be anything beyond what befits Him according to Himself; for God, as we have shown,
is of Himself the necessary being. There can, therefore, be nothing violent in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Then, too, everything in which there can be something violent or unnatural is by nature able
to be moved by another. For the violent is &#8220;that whose source is from the outside, the receiver
being completely passive.&#8221; Now, as we have shown, God is absolutely immobile. There can,
therefore, be nothing violent or unnatural in Him.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THAT GOD IS NOT A BODY</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] From the preceding remarks it is also shown that God is not a body.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] Every body, being a continuum, is composite and has parts. But, as we have shown, God is
not composite, and is, therefore, not a body.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Again, everything possessed of quantity is in a certain manner in potency. For a continuum
is potentially divisible to infinity, while numbers can be increased to infinity. But every body has
quantity and is therefore in potency. But God is not in potency, being pure act, as has been
shown. Therefore, God is not a body.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Furthermore, if God is a body, He must be some natural body, since, as the Philosopher
proves, a mathematical body is not something self-existing, since dimensions are accidents. But
God is not a natural body, being immobile, as we have shown, whereas every natural body is
movable. God is, therefore, not a body.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Again, every body is finite, as is proved in <i>De caelo</i> I [I, 5] of a circular body and a rectilinear
body. Now, we can transcend any given finite body by means of the intellect and the imagination.
If, then, God is a body, our intellect and imagination can think of something greater than God.
God is thus not greater than our intellect&#8212;which is awkward. God is, therefore, not a body.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Intellectual knowledge, moreover, is more certain than sensitive knowledge. In nature we find
an object for the sense and therefore for the intellect as well. But the order and distinction of
powers is according to the order of objects. Therefore, above all sensible things there is
something intelligible among things. Now, every body having actual existence is sensible.
Therefore, we can find something nobler above all bodies. Hence, if God is a body, He will not
be the first and greatest being.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] A living thing, likewise, is nobler than any non-living body, and the life of a living body is
nobler than it, since it is this life that gives to the living body its nobility above other bodies.
Therefore, that than which nothing is nobler is not a body. Ibis is God. God is, therefore, not a
body.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[8] Then, too, there are the arguments of the philosophers to the same effect, based on the eternity
of motion. They are as follows. In every everlasting motion, the first mover cannot be moved
either through Himself or by accident, as is clear from the above. Now, the body of the heavens
is moved in a circle with an everlasting motion. Therefore, its first mover is not moved either
through Himself or by accident. Now, no body moves locally unless it be moved, since the mover
and the moved must be together. The moving body must thus be moved in order to be together
with the moved body. But no power in a body moves unless it itself be moved by accident, since,
when a body is moved, its power is by accident moved. The first mover of the heavens, therefore,
is neither a body nor a power in a body. Now, that to which the motion of the heavens is
ultimately reduced as to its first unmoved mover is God. God is, therefore, not a body.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[9] Again, no infinite power is a power in a magnitude. But the power of the prime mover is an
infinite power. Therefore, it is not in any magnitude. Therefore, God, Who is the prime mover,
is neither a body nor a power in a body.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[10] The first proposition is proved thus. If the power of some magnitude is infinite, it will be
the power either of a finite magnitude or an infinite one. But there is no infinite magnitude, as
is proved in <i>Physics</i> III [5] and <i>De caelo</i> I [5]. But a finite magnitude cannot have an infinite
power. Therefore, an infinite power cannot reside in any magnitude. That an infinite power
cannot reside in a finite magnitude is proved thus. A greater power produces an equal effect in
a shorter time than a lesser power does in a longer time. This is true whether that effect be
according to alteration, local motion, or any other motion whatever. But an infinite power is
greater than every finite power. Therefore, by moving more swiftly, it should produce its effect
in a shorter time than any finite power. Nor can it be in something lesser that still is in time,
Therefore, this will be in an indivisible point of time. And thus to move, to be moved, and
motion will take place in an instant&#8212;of which the contrary has been proved in <i>Physics</i> VI [3].
That an infinite power in a finite magnitude cannot move in time is likewise proved as follows.
Let there be an infinite power A. Let us assume a part of that power to be AB. This part will,
therefore, move in a greater time. Yet there must be some proportion of this time to the time in
which the whole power moves, since both times are finite. Let these two times be related to one
another in the proportion of one to ten, since for the present argument this proportion will do as
well as any other. Now, if we add to the aforementioned finite power, we must diminish its time
according to the proportion of the addition to the power; for a greater power moves in a lesser
time. If the decuple be added, that power will move in a time that will be a tenth part of the time
in which the first assumed part of the infinite power, namely, AB, moved. And yet this power,
which is its decuple, is a finite power, since it has a determinate proportion to the finite power.
Therefore, the finite and the infinite power will move in the same time&#8212;which is impossible.
Therefore, the infinite power of a finite magnitude cannot move in time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[11] That the power of the first mover is infinite is proved thus. No finite power can move in an
infinite time. But the power of the first mover moves in an infinite time because the first motion
is endless. Therefore, the power of the prime mover is infinite. Ile first proposition is proved thus.
If the finite power of some body moves in an infinite time, a part of that body, having a part of
the power, will move in a shorter time; for the greater the power of a mover, the more it will be
able to keep up its motion in a longer time. Thus, the aforementioned part will move in a finite
time, and a greater part will be able to move in a longer time. Thus, as we add to the power of
the mover, we shall always add to the time according to the same proportion. But after a certain
addition has been made, the addition win reach the quantity of the whole or even exceed it. So,
too, an addition of time will reach the quantity of time in which it moves the whole. But the time
in which it moved the whole was said to be infinite. Therefore, a finite time will measure an
infinite time&#8212;which is impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[12] But against this reasoning there are several objections.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[13] One objection is this. It can be assumed that the body that moves the first moved is not
divisible, as is the case with a heavenly body. But the preceding proof is based on the division
of the first body.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[14] The reply to this objection is as follows. There can be a true conditional proposition whose
antecedent is impossible. If there is something that destroys the truth of this conditional
proposition, it is then impossible. For example, if someone destroys the truth of the conditional
proposition, <i>If man flies, he has wings</i>, it would be impossible. It is in this manner that the above
proof is to be understood. For the following conditional proposition is true: <i>If a heavenly body
is divided, a part of it will have less power than the whole</i>. Now, the truth of this conditional
proposition is taken away if it be posited that the first mover is a body; and the reason is the
impossibilities that follow from it. Therefore, to posit this is impossible. A similar reply can be
given if objection is made concerning the increase of finite powers. We cannot assume powers
in nature according to all proportions of time to any given time. Nevertheless, the proposition
required in the above proof is a true conditional proposition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[15] The second objection is this. Although a body is divided, it is possible to find in a given
body a power that is not divided when the body is divided. For example, the rational soul is not
divided if the body is divided.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[16] The reply is as follows. The above argument does not prove that God is not joined to a body
as the rational soul is joined to the human body; it proves that He is not a power in a body in the
manner of a material power, which is divided upon the division of the body. So, too, it is said of
the human intellect that it is not a body or a power in a body. However, that God is not joined to
a body as the soul is, this is another issue.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[17] The third objection is this. If some given body has a finite power, as the above argument
shows, and if through a finite power nothing can endure through an infinite time, it will follow
that no body can endure through an infinite time. Thus, a heavenly body will of necessity be
corrupted.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[18] To this objection some reply that, as far as its own power is concerned, a heavenly body can
fail, but it acquires an eternal duration from another being of an infinite power. Plato [<i>Timaeus</i>]
seems to speak for this solution when he introduces God addressing the heavenly bodies as
follows: &#8220;By your natures you are dissoluble, but through my will you are indissoluble; for my
will is greater than your bond.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[19] The Commentator attacks this position in <i>Metaphysics</i> XI. According to him, it is
impossible that what can of itself not-be should acquire a perpetuity of being from another. This
would mean that something corruptible becomes incorruptible, which according to him is
impossible. Hence, Averroes answers the objection as follows. All the potency that is in a
heavenly body is finite, but there is no reason why a heavenly body should have every potency.
For, according to Aristotle in <i>Metaphysics</i> VIII, there is in a heavenly body potency with respect
to place, but not with respect to being. Hence, a heavenly body need not have a potency to non-being.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[20] This reply of the Commentator, however, is not sufficient. Even if we should grant that in
a heavenly body there is no sort of a passive potency to being, which is the potency of matter, yet
there is in it a potency of an active kind, which is the power of being. For Aristotle expressly says
in <i>De caelo</i> I [I, 3] that the heavens have the power to be forever.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[21] Hence, it is better to reply as follows. Since potency is said relatively to act, we must judge
of potency according to the mode of the act. Now, according to its nature, motion has quantity
and extension, and hence its infinite duration requires that the potency moving it be infinite. But
being does not have any quantitative extension, especially in the case of a thing, such as the
heavens, whose being is without change. Hence, the power of being need not be infinite in a
finite body, even though it will endure to infinity. For it is one and the same whether through that
power something will endure for an instant or for an infinite time, since its changeless being is
not touched by time except by accident.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[22] The fourth objection is this. In those beings that in moving are not themselves altered, it
does not seem necessary that what moves in an infinite time should have an infinite power. For
such a motion consumes nothing of their power, so that after they have moved for a time they are
able to move for no less a time than before. Thus, the power of the sun is finite, and because its
active power is not lessened by acting, it is able, according to its nature, to act on the sublunary
world during an infinite time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[23] To this the reply is, as we have proved, that a body does not move unless it be moved. If,
then, it should happen that a certain body is not moved, that body will consequently not move.
But in everything that is moved there is a potency towards opposites, since the termini of motion
are opposites. Therefore, of itself, every body that is moved can also not-be-moved. But what can
not-be-moved is not of itself able to be moved through endless time, and hence neither to move
through endless time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[24] The above demonstration, consequently, holds of the finite power of a finite body, which
power of itself cannot move in an infinite time. But a body that of itself can be moved and not-moved, move and not-move, can acquire perpetuity of motion from another. This must be
incorporeal. The first mover must, therefore, be incorporeal. Thus, according to its nature,
nothing prevents a finite body, which acquires from another a perpetuity in being moved, from
likewise having a perpetuity in moving. For the first heavenly body itself, according to its nature,
can revolve the lower heavenly bodies with a perpetual motion, according as sphere moves
sphere. Nor, according to the Commentator, is it impossible (as it was impossible in the me of
perpetuity of being) that what of itself can be moved and not-moved should acquire perpetuity
of motion from another. For motion is a certain flow out of the mover to the thing moved, and
hence something moved can acquire from another a perpetuity of motion that it does not have
of itself. To be, on the other hand, is something fixed and at rest in being, and, therefore, that
which of itself is in potency to non-being cannot, as Averroes himself says [<i>In XII
Metaphysicorum</i>], following the course of nature acquire from another a perpetuity of being.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[25] The fifth objection is that, following the above reasoning, there does not seem to be a greater
reason why an infinite power is not in a magnitude rather than outside a magnitude. For in either
case it will follow that it moves in null time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[26] To this the reply is that, in magnitude, time, and motion, finite and infinite are found
according to one and the same notion, as is proved in <i>Physics</i> III [4] and VI [2, 7]. Therefore, the
infinite in one of them removes a finite proportion in the others. But in beings without magnitude
there is no finite or infinite except equivocally. Hence, the aforementioned method of
demonstration is not applicable among such potencies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[27] There is, however, another and better answer. The heavens have two movers, a proximate
one with a finite power, which is responsible for the fact that they have a finite velocity, and a
remote mover with an infinite power, which is responsible for the fact that their motion can be
of an infinite duration. And thus it is evident that an infinite power that is not in a magnitude can
move a body in time, but not immediately. But a power that is in a magnitude must move
immediately, since no body moves except by being moved. Hence, if it did move, it would follow
that it would move in null time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[28] An even better reply is this. A power that is not in a magnitude is an intellect, and moves
by will. For we have proved that the intellect is not a corporeal power. Therefore, it moves
according to the needs of the movable body and not the proportion of its power; whereas a power
that is in a magnitude can move only through the necessity of nature. Thus, of necessity, it moves
according to the proportion of its quantity. Hence, if it moves, it moves in an instant.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[29] Thus, with the removal of the preceding objections, we see that the argumentation of
Aristotle stands.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[30] No motion, furthermore, which is from a corporeal mover can be continuous and regular,
because in local motion a corporeal mover moves by pulling and pushing. Now, what is pulled
or pushed is not uniformly disposed towards its mover from the beginning to the end of the
motion, since at times it will be nearer and at other times farther away. Thus, no body can move
with a continuous and regular motion. But the first motion is continuous and regular, as is proved
in <i>Physics</i> VIII [7]. Therefore, the mover of the first motion is not a body.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[31] Again, no motion to an end that passes from potency to act can be endless, since when it
reaches act the motion comes to rest. If, then, the first motion is endless, it must aim at an end
that is always and in all ways in act. But such an end is not a body or a power in a body, since all
such things are movable either through themselves or by accident. Therefore, the end of the first
motion is neither a body nor a power in a body. But the end of the first motion is the first mover,
which moves as something desired. This, however, is God. God, therefore, is neither a body nor
a power in a body.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[32] However, although according to our faith it is false that the motion of the heavens is
perpetual, as will be made evident later on, yet it is true that it will not fail either through a failure
of power in the mover or through the corruption of the substance in the moved; for there is no
evidence that the passing of time has slowed down the motion of the heavens. Hence, the above
demonstrations do not lose their force.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[33] With this demonstrated truth divine authority stands in agreement. For it is said in John
(4:24): &#8220;God is a spirit, and they that adore Him must adore Him in spirit and in truth.&#8221; It is
likewise said: &#8220;To the King of ages. immortal, invisible, the only God&#8221; (1 Tim. 1:17). Again:
&#8220;The invisible things of God... are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made&#8221;
(Rom. 1:20); for what is seen, not by sight, but by the intellect, is incorporeal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[34] Thereby is destroyed the error of the early natural philosophers, who posited only material
causes, such as fire or water or the like, and who thus said that the first principles of things were
bodies and called them gods. Among them there were some who further posited friendship and
strife as moving causes. (They, too, were refuted through the above arguments.) For since,
according to them, strife and friendship are in bodies, it will follow that the first moving
principles are bodily powers. They also held that God is composed of the four elements and
friendship, which would give us to understand that for them God was a heavenly body. Among
the early thinkers, Anaxagoras alone approached the truth by positing that an intellect moved all
things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[35] By this truth, too, are refuted the Gentiles, who, taking their beginning in the errors of the
philosophers we have listed, posited that the elements of the world and the powers in them are
gods; for example, the sun, the moon, the earth, water, and the like.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[36] By the same arguments, moreover, are set aside the wild fantasies of the simple Jews,
Tertullian, the Vodiani or Anthropomorphite heretics, who endowed God with a bodily figure;
and also of the Manicheans, who thought that God was a certain infinite substance of light,
stretched out through an infinite space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[37] The occasion of all these errors was that, in thinking of divine things, men were made the
victims of their imagination, through which it is not possible to receive anything except the
likeness of a body. This is why, in meditating on what is incorporeal, we must stop following the
imagination.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] From what has been laid down we can infer that God is His essence, quiddity, or nature.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] There must be some composition in every being that is not its essence or quiddity. Since,
indeed, each thing possesses its own essence, if there were nothing in a thing outside its essence
all that the thing is would be its essence; which would mean that the thing is its essence. But, if
some thing were not its essence, there should be something in it outside its essence. Thus, there
must be composition in it. Hence it is that the essence in composite things is signified as a part,
for example, humanity in man. Now, it has been shown that there is no composition in God. God
is, therefore, His essence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Moreover, only that which does not enter the definition of a thing seems to be outside its
essence or quiddity; for the definition signifies what a thing is. But it is only the accidents of a
thing that do not fall in the definition; and therefore only the accidents in any thing are outside
its essence. But, as will be shown, in God there are no accidents. There is, therefore, nothing in
God outside His essence; and hence He is His essence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Furthermore, forms that are not predicated of subsisting things, whether these be considered
universally or each is taken singly, are forms that do not subsist through themselves as singulars
individuated in themselves. We do not say that Socrates, or man, or animal is whiteness, because
whiteness does not subsist as a singular through itself but is individuated through its subsisting
subjects. In the same way, also, natural forms do not subsist as singulars through themselves but
are individuated in their proper matters. That is why we do not say that this fire, or fire, is its own
form. The very essences or quiddities of genera and species are individuated through the
designated matter of this or that individual, even though the quiddity of the genus or the species
should include common form and matter. That is why we do not say that Socrates or man is
humanity. But the divine essence exists through itself as a singular existent and individuated
through itself; for, as we have shown, it is not in any matter. The divine essence is predicated of
God, therefore, so that we may say: God is His essence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Again, the essence of a thing is either the thing itself or is related to the thing in some way
as its cause; for a thing derives its species through its essence. But nothing can in any way be the
cause of God, since, as we have shown, He is the first being. God is, therefore, His essence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Then, too, what is not its essence is related to its essence, according to some part of itself, as
potency to act. That is why the essence is signified in the manner of a form, for example,
humanity. But, as was shown above, there is no potentiality in God. He must, therefore, be His
essence.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] From what was proved above, however, we can further prove that His essence or quiddity is
not something other than His being.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] For it was shown above that there is some being that must be through itself, and this is God.
If, then, this being that must be belongs to an essence that is not that which it is, either it is
incompatible with that essence or repugnant to it, as to exist through itself is repugnant to the
quiddity of whiteness, or it is compatible with it or appropriate to it, as to be in another is to
whiteness. If the first alternative be the case, the being that is through itself necessary will not
befit that quiddity, just as it does not befit whiteness to exist through itself. If the second
alternative be the case, either such being must depend on the essence, or both must depend on
another cause, or the essence must depend on the being. The first two alternatives are contrary
to the nature of that which is through itself a necessary being; for if it depends on another, it is
no longer a necessary being. From the third alternative it follows that that quiddity is added
accidentally to the thing that is through itself a necessary being; for what follows upon a thing&#8217;s
being is accidental to it and hence not its quiddity. God, therefore, does not have an essence that
is not His being.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] But against this conclusion it can be objected that that being does not absolutely depend on
that essence, so as not to be unless the essence existed; it depends, rather, on the essence with
reference to the union by which it is joined to it. Thus, that being is through itself necessary, but
its union with the essence is not.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] However, this reply does not escape the aforementioned difficulties. For, if that being can be
understood without that essence, it will follow that the essence is related to that being in an
accidental way. But that being is that which is through itself a necessary being. Therefore, that
essence is related in an accidental way to that which is through itself a necessary being. It is,
therefore, not its essence. But that which is through itself a necessary being is God. That essence,
then, is not the essence of God, but some essence below God. On the other hand, if that being
cannot be understood without that essence, it depends absolutely on that on which its union to
that essence depends. We then reach the same impasse as before.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">15] Another argument. Each thing is through its own being. Hence, that which is not its own
being is not through itself a necessary being. But God is through Himself a necessary being. He
is, therefore, His own being.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Again, if God&#8217;s being is not His essence, and cannot be part of that essence, since, as we have
shown, the divine essence is simple, such a being must be something outside the divine essence.
But whatever belongs to a thing and is yet not of its essence belongs to it through some cause;
for, if things that are not through themselves one are joined, they must be joined through some
cause. Being, therefore, belongs to that quiddity through some cause. This is either through
something that is part of the essence of that thing, or the essence itself, or through something
else. If we adopt the first alternative, and it is a fact that the essence is through that being, it
follows that something is the cause of its own being. This is impossible, because, in their notions,
the existence of the cause is prior to that of the effect. If, then, something were its own cause of
being, it would be understood to be before it had being&#8212;which is impossible, unless we
understand that something is the cause of its own being in an accidental order, which is being in
an accidental way. This is not impossible. It is possible that there be an accidental being that is
caused by the principles of its subject before the substantial being of its subject is understood as
given. Here, however, we are speaking of substantial being, not accidental being. On the other
hand, if the being belongs to the essence through some other cause, then this follows: given that
what acquires its being from another cause is something caused, and is not the first cause,
whereas God, as was demonstrated above, is the first cause and has no cause, the quiddity that
acquires its being from another is not the quiddity of God. God's being must, therefore, be His
quiddity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] Being, furthermore, is the name of an act, for a thing is not said to be because it is in potency
but because it is in act. Everything, however, that has an act diverse from it is related to that act
as potency to act; for potency and act are said relatively to one another. If, then, the divine
essence is something other than its being, the essence and the being are thereby related as potency
and act. But we have shown that in God there is no potency, but that He is pure act. God's
essence, therefore, is not something other than His being.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[8] Moreover, if something can exist only when several elements come together, it is composite.
But no thing in which the essence is other than the being can exist unless several elements come
together, namely, the essence and the being. Hence, every thing in which the essence is other than
the being is composite. But, as we have shown, God is not composite. Therefore, God's being is
His essence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[9] Every thing, furthermore, exists because it has being. A thing whose essence is not its being,
consequently, is not through its essence but by participation in something, namely, being itself.
But that which is through participation in something cannot be the first being, because prior to
it is the being in which it participates in order to be. But God is the first being, with nothing prior
to Him. His essence is, therefore, His being.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[10] This sublime truth Moses was taught by our Lord. When Moses asked our Lord: &#8220;If the
children of Israel say to me: what is His name? What shall I say to them?&#8221; The Lord replied: &#8220;I
AM WHO AM.... You shall say to the children of Israel: HE WHO IS has sent me to you&#8221; (Exod.
3:13, 14). By this our Lord showed that His own proper name is HE WHO IS. Now, names have
been devised to signify the natures or essences of things. It remains, then, that the divine being
is God's essence or nature.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[11] Catholic teachers have likewise professed this truth. For Hilary writes in his book <i>De
Trinitate</i> [II]: &#8220;Being is not an accident in God but subsisting truth, the abiding cause and the
natural property His nature.&#8221; Boethius also says in his own work <i>De Trinitate</i> [II]: &#8220;The divine
substance is being itself, and from it comes being.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THAT NO ACCIDENT IS FOUND IN GOD</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] It follows necessarily from this truth that nothing can come to God beyond His essence, nor
can there be anything in Him in an accidental way.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] For being cannot participate in anything that is not of its essence, although that which is can
participate in something. The reason is that nothing is more formal or more simple than being,
which thus participates in nothing. But the divine substance is being itself, and therefore has
nothing that is not of its substance. Hence, no accident can reside in it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Furthermore, what is present in a thing accidentally has a cause of its presence, since it is
outside the essence of the thing in which it is found. If, then, something is found in God
accidentally, this must be through some cause. Now, the cause of the accident is either the divine
essence itself or something else. If something else, it must act on the divine essence, since
nothing will cause the introduction of some form, substantial or accidental, in some receiving
subject except by acting on it in some way. For to act is nothing other than to make something
actual, which takes place through a form. Thus, God will suffer and receive the action of some
cause&#8212;which is contrary to what we already established. On the other hand, let us suppose that
the divine substance is the cause of the accident inhering in it. Now it is impossible that it be, as
receiving it, the cause of the accident, for then one and the same thing would make itself to be
actual in the same respect. Therefore, if there is an accident in God, it will be according to
different respects that He receives and causes that accident, just as bodily things receive their
accidents through the nature of their matter and cause them through their form. Thus, God will
be composite. But, we have proved the contrary of this proposition above.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Every subject of an accident, moreover, is related to it as potency to act, since the accident
is a certain form making the subject to be actual according to an accidental being. But, as we
have shown above, there is no potentiality in God. There can, therefore, be no accident in Him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Then, too, when a being has an accident inhering in it, it is in some way mutable according
to its nature, since an accident can inhere or not-inhere. If, then, God has something belonging
to Him in an accidental way, He will consequently be mutable. But the contrary of this was
demonstrated above.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Again, that which has an accident inhering in it is not whatever it has in itself, since an
accident is not part of the essence of the subject. But God is what He has in Himself. There is,
therefore, no accident in God. The minor proposition is proved thus. Everything is found in a
more noble way in the cause than in an effect. But God is the cause of all things. Hence, whatever
is in Him is there in the most noble way. Now, what a thing itself is, this belongs to it in a most
perfect way. For this is some thing more perfectly one than when something is joined to
something else substantially as form to matter; just as substantial union is more perfect than when
something inheres in something else as an accident. God, then, is whatever He has.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] It is also a fact that a substance does not depend on an accident, although an accident depends
on a substance. But what does not depend on something can sometimes be found without it.
Some substance, then, can be found without an accident. This seems especially to fit the
substance that is most simple, such as the divine substance is. The divine substance, therefore,
has no accidents whatever.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[8] In dealing with this problem, Catholics likewise give assent to this opinion. Whence
Augustine says in his <i>De Trinitate</i> [V, 4] that &#8220;there is no accident in God.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[9] The proof of this truth serves as a refutation of the error of some Saracen theologians &#8220;who
posit certain intentions superadded to the divine essence.</p>

SOME SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCE</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] We can likewise show from what we have said that nothing can be added to the divine being
to determine it with an essential determination, as a genus is determined by its differences.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] Nothing can be in act unless everything that determines its substantial act of being exists.
Thus, there cannot be an actual animal unless it be a rational or an irrational animal. Hence, the
Platonists themselves, in positing the Ideas, did not posit self-existing Ideas of genera, which are
determined to the being of their species through essential differences; rather, they posited self-existing Ideas solely of species, which for their determination need no essential differences. If,
then, the divine being is determined essentially through something else superadded to it, it will
be in act only if what is superadded is present. But the divine being, as we have shown, is the
divine substance itself. Therefore the divine substance cannot be in act without the presence of
something added; from which it can be concluded that it is not through itself a necessary being.
But, we have proved the contrary of this proposition above.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Moreover, what needs an addition in order to be is in potency in relation to this addition. But,
as we have shown, the divine substance is not in any way in potency; rather, the divine substance
is its being. The divine being, therefore, cannot be determined in its substance through something
superadded to it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Again, that through which a thing derives being in act and is intrinsic to it is either the whole
essence of that thing or a part of the essence. But that which determines something in an essential
way makes that thing to be in act and is intrinsic to the determined thing; otherwise, the thing
could not be determined substantially by it. It must therefore be either the essence itself or a part
of the essence. But, if something is added to the divine being, this cannot be the whole essence
of God, since it has already been shown that God&#8217;s being is not other than His essence. It must,
then, be a part of the essence, which means that God will be composed of essential parts. But,
we have proved the contrary of this above.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Furthermore, what is added to a thing to give it a certain essential determination does not
constitute its nature but only its being in act. For rational added to animal gains for animal being
in act, but it does not constitute the nature of animal as animal, since the difference does not enter
the definition of the genus. But, if something is added in God by which He is determined in His
essence, that addition must constitute for the being to which it is added the nature of its own
quiddity or essence, since what is thus added gains for a thing its being in act. But in God this
&#8220;being in act&#8221; is the divine essence itself, as we have shown above. It remains, then, that to the
divine being nothing can be added that determines it in an essential way, as the difference
determines the genus.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] Every thing in a genus has something within it by which the nature of the genus is determined
to its species; for nothing is in a genus that is not in some species of that genus. But, as we have

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] If, moreover, God is in a genus, either He is in the genus of accident or in that of substance.
He is not in the genus of accident, since the first being and the first cause cannot be an accident.
Neither can God be in the genus of substance, since the substance that is a genus is not being
itself; otherwise, every substance would be its being and would thus not be caused by
another&#8212;which is impossible, as is evident from what we have said. Therefore, God is not in
some genus.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Again, whatever is in a genus differs in being from the other things in that genus; otherwise,
the genus would not be predicated of many things. But all the things that are in the same genus
must agree in the quiddity of the genus, since the genus is predicated of all things in it in terms
of what they are. In other words, the being of each thing found in a genus is outside the quiddity
of the genus. This is impossible in God. God, therefore, is not in a genus.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Then, too, each thing is placed in a genus through the nature of its quiddity, for the genus is
a predicate expressing what a thing is. But the quiddity of God is His very being. Accordingly,
God is not located in a genus, because then being, which signifies the act of being, would be a
genus. Therefore, God is not in a genus.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Now, that being cannot be a genus is proved by the Philosopher in the following way
[<i>Metaphysics</i> III, 3]. If being were a genus we should have to find a difference through which to
contract it to a species. But no difference shares in the genus in such a way that the genus is
included in the notion of the difference, for thus the genus would be included twice in the
definition of the species. Rather, the difference is outside what is understood in the nature of the
genus. But there can be nothing that is outside that which is understood by being, if being is
included in the concept of the things of which it is predicated. Thus, being cannot be contracted
by any difference. Being is, therefore, not a genus. From this we conclude necessarily that God
is not in a genus.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] From this it is likewise evident that God cannot be defined, for every definition is constituted
from the genus and the differences.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[8] It is also clear that no demonstration is possible about God, except through an effect; for the
principle of demonstration is the definition of that of which the demonstration is made.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[9] Now it can seem to someone that, although the name substance cannot properly apply to God
because God does not substand accidents, yet the thing signified by the name is appropriate and
thus God is in the genus of substance. For a substance is a being through itself. Now, this is
appropriate to God, since we have proved that He is not an accident.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[10] To this contention we must reply, in accord with what we have said, that being through itself
is not included in the definition of substance. For, if something is called being, it cannot be a
genus, since we have already proved that being does not have the nature of a genus. Neither can
what is through itself be a genus, since the expression seems to indicate nothing more than a
negation. Something is said to be a being through itself because it is not in another. This is a pure
negation, which likewise cannot constitute the nature of a genus; for a genus would then say, not
what a thing is, but what it is not. The nature of substance, therefore, must be understood as
follows. A substance is a thing to which it belongs to be not in a subject. The name thing takes
its origin from the quiddity, just as the name being comes from to be. In this way, the definition
of substance is understood as that which has a quiddity to which it belongs to be not in another.
Now, this is not appropriate to God, for He has no quiddity save His being. In no way, then, is
God in the genus of substance. Thus, He is in no genus, since we have shown that He is not in
the genus of accident.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THAT GOD IS NOT THE FORMAL BEING OF ALL THINGS</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] We are now able to refute the error of certain persons who said that God is nothing other than
the formal being of each thing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] This being is divided into the being of substance and the being of accident. Now, we have
proved that the divine being is neither the being of substance nor that of accident. God, therefore,
cannot be that being by which each thing formally is.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Furthermore, things are not distinguished from one another in having being, for in this they
agree. If, then, things differ from one another, either their being must be specified through certain
added differences, so that diverse things have a diverse being according to their species, or things
must differ in that the being itself is appropriate to natures that are diverse in species. The first
of these alternatives is impossible, since, as we have said, no addition can be made to a being in
the manner in which a difference is added to a genus. It remains, then, that things differ because
they have diverse natures, to which being accrues in a diverse way. Now, the divine being does
not accrue to a nature that is other than it; it is the nature itself, as we have said. If, therefore, the
divine being were the formal being of all things, all things would have to be absolutely one.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Then, too, a principle is naturally prior to that whose principle it is. Now, in certain things
being has something that is as its principle. For the form is said to be a principle of being, and
so is the agent, that makes things to be in act. If, therefore, the divine being is the being of each
thing, it will follow that God, Who is His own being, has some cause. Thus, He is not through
Himself a necessary being. But, we have proved the contrary of this conclusion above.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Moreover, that which is common to many is not outside the many except by the reason alone.
Thus, animal is not something outside Socrates and Plato and the other animals except in the
intellect that apprehends the form of animal stripped of all its individuating and specifying
characteristics. For man is that which truly is animal; otherwise, it would follow that in Socrates
and Plato there are several animals, namely, common animal itself, common man, and Plato
himself. Much less, then, is common being itself something outside all existing things, save only
for being in the intellect. Hence, if God is common being, the only thing that will exist is that
which exists solely in the intellect. But we showed above that God is something not only in the
intellect but also in reality. Therefore, God is not the common being of all things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Again, strictly speaking, generation is the way to being and corruption the way to non-being.
For form is not the terminus of generation, and privation is not the terminus of corruption, except
because a form causes being and privation non-being. If a form did not cause being, a thing
which received such a form would not be said to be generated. Hence, if God is the formal being
of all things, He will consequently be the terminus of generation. This is false, since, as we have
shown above, God is eternal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] It will also follow that the being of each thing has existed from eternity. Generation or
corruption is therefore impossible. If it does exist, pre-existing being must accrue to something
anew. It will therefore accrue either to something pre-existing or to something in no way pre-existing. In the first instance, since according to the above position the being of all existing things
is one, it will follow that a thing that is said to be generated acquires, not a new being, but a new
mode of being. The result is alteration, not generation. But, if the generated thing in no way pre-existed, it will follow that it is produced from nothing&#8212;which is contrary to the nature of
generation. This position, therefore, entirely ruins generation and corruption and, as a
consequence, is evidently impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[8] Sacred Teaching as well casts aside this error in confessing that God is &#8220;high and elevated,&#8221;
according to Isaiah (6:1), and that He is &#8220;over all,&#8221; according to Romans (9:5). For, if He is the
being of all things, He is part of all things, but not over them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[9] So, too, those who committed this error are condemned by the same judgment as are the
idolaters who &#8220;gave the incommunicable name,&#8221; that is, of God, &#8220;to wood and stones,&#8221; as it is
written (Wis. 14:21). If, indeed, God is the being of all things, there will be no more reason to
say truly that a stone is a being than to say that a stone is God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[10] Four factors seem to have contributed to the rise of this error. The first is the warped
interpretation of certain authoritative texts. There is in Dionysius this remark [<i>De caelisti
hierarchia</i> IV, 1]: &#8220;The being of all things is the super-essential divinity.&#8221; From this remark they
wished to infer that God is the formal being of all things, without considering that this
interpretation could not square with the words themselves. For, if the divinity is the formal being
of all things, it will not be over all but among all, indeed a part of all. Now, since Dionysius said
that the divinity was above all things, he showed that according to its nature it was distinct from
all things and raised above all things. And when he said that the divinity is the being of all things,
he showed that there was in all things a certain likeness of the divine being, coming from God.
Elsewhere Dionysius has rather openly set aside this warped interpretation. He has said: &#8220;God
neither touches nor is in any way mingled with other things, as a point touches a line or the figure
of a seal touches wax&#8221; [<i>De divinis nominibusi </i>II, 5].</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[11] The second cause leading them to this error is a failure of reason. For, since that which is
common is specified or individuated through addition, they thought that the divine being, which
receives no addition, was not some proper being but the common being of all things. They
ignored the fact that what is common or universal cannot exist without addition, but is considered
without addition. For animal cannot be without the difference rational or the difference irrational,
although it is considered without these differences. What is more, although a universal may be
considered without addition, it is not without the receptibility of addition; for, if no difference
could be added to animal, it would not be a genus. The same is true of all other names. But the
divine being is without addition not only in thought but also in reality; and not only without
addition but also without the receptibility of addition. From the fact, then, that it neither receives
nor can receive addition we can rather conclude that God is not common being but proper being;
for His being is distinguished from all the rest by the fact that nothing can be added to it. Hence
the Commentator says in the Book of Causes that, out of the purity of its goodness, the first cause
is distinguished from the rest and in a manner individuated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[12] The third factor that led them into this error concerns the divine simplicity. God is at the
peak of simplicity. They therefore thought that the last point of resolution in our way of seeing
things is God, as being absolutely simple. For it is not possible to proceed to infinity in
composition among the things we know. Their reason also failed because they did not observe
that what is most simple in our understanding of things is not so much a complete thing as a part
of a thing. But, simplicity is predicated of God as of some perfect subsisting thing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[13] A fourth factor that could have led them to their error is the mode of expression we use
when we say that God is in all things. By this we do not mean that God is in things as a part of
a thing, but as the cause of a thing that is never lacking to its effect. For we do not say that a form
is in matter as a sailor is in a ship.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THAT GOD IS NOT THE FORM OF ANY BODY</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] Having shown that God is not the being of all things, we can likewise show that He is not the
form of any thing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] As we have shown, the divine being cannot belong to any quiddity that is not being itself.
Now, only God is the divine being itself. It is impossible, therefore, for God to be the form of
some other being.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Furthermore, the form of a body is not the being itself, but a principle of being. But God is
being itself. He is, therefore, not the form of a body.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Again, the union of form and matter results in a composite, which is a whole with respect to
the matter and the form. But the parts are in potency in relation to the whole. In God, however,
there is no potentiality. Therefore, God cannot be a form united to some thing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Moreover, that which has being through itself is nobler than that which has being in another.
But every form of a body has being in another. Since, then, God, as the first cause of being, is the
noblest being, He cannot be the form of any being.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] The same conclusion can also be reached in the following way from the eternity of motion.
If God is the form of some movable body, since He is the first mover, the composite will be self-moving. But something self-moving can be moved and not-moved. Both possibilities are found
in it. But such a being does not of itself have an indefectibility of motion. Above the self-moving
being, therefore, we must posit another first mover, which gives to the self-moving being the
endlessness of its motion. Thus, God, Who is the first mover, is not the form of a self-moving
body.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] This argumentation is suitable for those who posit the eternity of motion. Those who do not
posit it can reach the same conclusion from the regularity of the motion of the heavens. For just
as a self-mover can be at rest and in motion, so it can be moved more swiftly and less so. The
necessity in the uniformity of the motion of the heavens, therefore, depends on some higher and
absolutely immobile principle, which is not a part of a self-moving body as the form of that body.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[8] The authority of Scripture is in agreement with this truth. For it is said in a Psalm (8:2):
&#8220;Your magnificence is elevated above the heavens&#8221;; and in Job (11:8, 9): &#8220;He is higher than
heaven, and what will you do?... His measure is longer than the earth and deeper than the sea.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[9] Thus, then, is removed the error of the Gentiles, who said that God is the soul of the heavens,
or even the soul of the whole world. Thereby they defended the error of idolatry, by saying that
the whole world was God not by reason of the body but by reason of the soul; just as man is said
to be wise not by reason of the body but by reason of the soul. On the basis of this error the
Gentiles thought it to follow that, not unfittingly, divine worship should be shown to the world
and its parts. The Commentator also says that this point was the place where the Zabii stumbled
and fell from wisdom&#8212;because, namely, they posited that God is the form of the heavens [<i>In XII
Metaphysicorum</i>].</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] Although the things that exist and live are more perfect than the things that merely exist,
nevertheless, God, Who is not other than His being, is a universally perfect being. And I call
universally perfect that to which the excellence of no genus is lacking.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] Every excellence in any given thing belongs to it according to its being. For man would have
no excellence as a result of his wisdom unless through it he were wise. So, too, with the other
excellences. Hence, the mode of a thing&#8217;s excellence is according to the mode of its being. For
a thing is said to be more or less excellent according as its being is limited to a certain greater or
lesser mode of excellence. Therefore, if there is something to which the whole power of being
belongs, it can lack no excellence that is proper to some thing. But for a thing that is its own
being it is proper to be according to the whole power of being. For example, if there were a
separately existing whiteness, it could not lack any of the power of whiteness. For a given white
thing lacks something of the power of whiteness through a defect in the receiver of the whiteness,
which receives it according to its mode and perhaps not according to the whole power of
whiteness. God, therefore, Who is His being, as we have proved above, has being according to
the whole power of being itself. Hence, He cannot lack any excellence that belongs to any given
thing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] But just as every excellence and perfection is found in a thing according as that thing is, so
every defect is found in it according as in some way it is not. Now, just as God bas being wholly,
so non-being is wholly absent from Him. For as a thing has being, in that way is it removed from
non-being. Hence, all defect is absent from God. He is, therefore, universally perfect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Those things that merely exist are not imperfect because of an imperfection in absolute being.
For they do not possess being according to its whole power; rather, they participate in it through
a certain particular and most imperfect mode.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Furthermore, everything that is imperfect must be preceded by something perfect. Thus, the
seed is from the animal or the plant. The first being must, therefore, be most perfect. But we have
shown that God is the first being. He is, therefore, most perfect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Again, each thing is perfect according as it is in act, and imperfect according as it is in
potency and lacking act. Hence, that which is in no way in potency, but is pure act, must be most
perfect. Such, however, is God. God is, therefore, most perfect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] Nothing, moreover, acts except as it is in act. Hence, action follows the mode of act in the
agent. It is therefore impossible that an effect brought forth by an action be of a more excellent
act than is the act of the agent. On the other hand, it is possible that the act of the effect be less
perfect than the act of the efficient cause, since an action can become weakened through the
effect in which it terminates. Now, in the genus of the efficient cause there is a reduction to one
cause, called God, as is evident from what we have said; and from this cause, as we shall show
later on, all things come. Hence, it is necessary that whatever is found in act in any thing
whatever must be found in God in a more eminent way than in that thing itself. But the converse
is not true. God, therefore, is most perfect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[8] In every genus, furthermore, there is something that is most perfect for that genus, acting as
a measure for all other things in the genus. For each thing is shown to be more or less perfect
according as it approaches more or less to the measure of its genus. Thus, white is said to be the
measure among all colors, and the virtuous man among all men. Now, the measure of all beings
cannot be other than God, Who is His own being. No perfection, consequently, that is appropriate
to this or that thing is lacking to Him; otherwise, He would not be the common measure of all
things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[9] This is why, when Moses asked to see the divine countenance or glory, he received this reply
from the Lord: &#8220;I will show you all good,&#8221; as it is written in Exodus (33:18, 19); by which the
Lord gave Moses to understand that the fullness of all goodness was in Him. Dionysius likewise
says: &#8220;God does not exist in a certain way; He possesses, and this before all others, all being
within Himself absolutely and limitlessly&#8221; [<i>De div. nom.</i> V, 4].</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[10] We must note, however, that perfection cannot be attributed to God appropriately if we
consider the signification of the name according to its origin; for it does not seem that what is not
made [<i>factum</i>] can be called perfect [<i>perfectum</i>]. But everything that comes to be is brought forth
from potency to act and from non-being to being when it has been made. That is why it is rightly
said to be perfect, as being completely made, at that moment when the potency is wholly reduced
to act, so that it retains no non-being but has a completed being. By a certain extension of the
name, consequently, perfect is said not only of that which by way of becoming reaches a
completed act, but also of that which, without any making whatever, is in complete act. It is thus
that, following the words of Matthew (5:48), we say that God is perfect: &#8220;Be perfect as your
heavenly Father is perfect.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] In the light of what we have said, we are able to consider how a likeness to God is and is not
possible in things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] Effects that fall short of their causes do not agree with them in name and nature. Yet, some
likeness must be found between them, since it belongs to the nature of action that an agent
produce its like, since each thing acts according as it is in act. The form of an effect, therefore,
is certainly found in some measure in a transcending cause, but according to another mode and
another way. For this reason the cause is called an equivocal cause. Thus, the sun causes heat
among these sublunary bodies by acting according as it is in act. Hence, the heat generated by the
sun must bear some likeness to the active power of the sun, through which beat is caused in this
sublunary world; and because of this beat the sun is said to be hot, even though not in one and
the same way. And so the sun is said to be somewhat like those things in which it produces its
effects as an efficient cause. Yet the sun is also unlike all these things in so far as such effects do
not possess heat and the like in the same way as they are found in the sun. So, too, God gave
things all their perfections and thereby is both like and unlike all of them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Hence it is that Sacred Scripture recalls the likeness between God and creatures, as when it
is said in Genesis (1:26): &#8220;Let us make man to our image and likeness.&#8221; At times the likeness is
denied, as in the text of Isaiah (40:18): &#8220;To whom then have you likened God, and what image
will you make for Him?&#8221; or in the Psalm (82:1) [Vulgate]: &#8220;O God, who is like You?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Dionysius is in agreement with this argument when he says: &#8220;The same things are both like
and unlike God. They are like according as they imitate as much as they can Him Who is not
perfectly imitable, they are unlike according as effects are lesser than their causes&#8221; [<i>De div. nom.</i>
IX, 7].</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] In the light of this likeness, nevertheless, it is more fitting to say that a creature is like God
rather than the converse. For that is called like something which possesses a quality or form of
that thing. Since, then, that which is found in God perfectly is found in other things according
to a certain diminished participation, the basis on which the likeness is observed belongs to God
absolutely, but not to the creature. Thus, the creature has what belongs to God and, consequently,
is rightly said to be like God. But we cannot in the same way say that God has what belongs to
the creature. Neither, then, can we appropriately say that God is like a creature, just as we do not
say that man is like his image, although the image is rightly said to be like him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] All the less proper, moreover, is the expression that God is likened to a creature. For likening
expresses a motion towards likeness and thus belongs to the being that receives from another that
which makes it like. But a creature receives from God that which makes it like Him. The
converse, however, does not hold. God, then, is not likened to a creature; rather, the converse is
true.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] From what we have said we can further consider what it is possible to say or not to say of
God, what is said of Him alone, and also what is said of Him and other things together.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] Since it is possible to find in God every perfection of creatures, but in another and more
eminent way, whatever names unqualifiedly designate a perfection without defect are predicated
of God and of other things: for example, goodness, wisdom, being, and the like. But when any
name expresses such perfections along with a mode that is proper to a creature, it can be said of
God only according to likeness and metaphor. According to metaphor, what belongs to one thing
is transferred to another, as when we say that a man is a stone because of the hardness of his
intellect. Such names are used to designate the species of a created thing, for example, man and
stone, for to each species belongs its own mode of perfection and being. The same is true of
whatever names designate the properties of things, which are caused by the proper principles of
their species. Hence, they can be said of God only metaphorically. But the names that express
such perfections along with the mode of supereminence with which they belong to God are said
of God alone. Such names are the highest good, the first being, and the like.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] I have said that some of the aforementioned names signify a perfection without defect. This
is true with reference to that which the name was imposed to signify; for as to the mode of
signification, every name is defective. For by means of a name we express things in the way in
which the intellect conceives them. For our intellect, taking the origin of its knowledge from the
senses, does not transcend the mode which is found in sensible things, in which the form and the
subject of the form are not identical owing to the composition of form and matter. Now, a simple
form is indeed found among such things, but one that is imperfect because it is not subsisting;
on the other hand, though a subsisting subject of a form is found among sensible things, it is not
simple but rather concreted. Whatever our intellect signifies as subsisting, therefore, it signifies
in concretion; but what it signifies as simple, it signifies, not as that which is, but as that by
which something is. As a result, with reference to the mode of signification there is in every
name that we use an imperfection, which does not befit God, even though the thing signified in
some eminent way does befit God. This is clear in the name goodness and good. For goodness
has signification as something not subsisting, while good has signification as something
concreted. And so with reference to the mode of signification no name is fittingly applied to God;
this is done only with reference to that which the name has been imposed to signify. Such names,
therefore, as Dionysius teaches [<i>De divinis nominibus</i> I, 5, <i>De caelesti hierarchia </i>II, 3], can be
both affirmed and denied of God. They can be affirmed because of the meaning of the name; they
can be denied because of the mode of signification.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Now, the mode of supereminence in which the abovementioned perfections are found in God
can be signified by names used by us only through negation, as when we say that God is eternal
or infinite, or also through a relation of God to other things, as when He is called the first cause
or the highest good. For we cannot grasp what God is, but only what He is not and how other
things are related to Him, as is clear from what we said above.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THAT THE DIVINE PERFECTION AND THE PLURALITY OF DIVINE NAMES
ARE NOT OPPOSED TO THE DIVINE SIMPLICITY</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] From what has been said it can likewise be seen that the divine perfection and the plurality
of names said of God are not opposed to His simplicity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] We have said that all the perfections found in other things are attributed to God in the same
way as effects are found in their equivocal causes. These effects are in their causes virtually, as
heat is in the sun. For, unless the power of the sun belonged to some extent to the genus of heat,
the sun acting through this power would not generate anything like itself. The sun, then, is said
to be hot through this power not only because it produces heat, but also because the power
through which it does this has some likeness to heat. But through the same power through which
it produces heat, the sun produces also many other effects among sublunary bodies-for example,
dryness. And thus heat and dryness, which in fire are diverse qualities, belong to the sun through
one and the same power. So, too, the perfections of all things, which belong to the rest of things
through diverse forms, must be attributed to God through one and the same power in Him. This
power is nothing other than His essence, since, as we have proved, there can be no accident in
God. Thus, therefore, God is called wise not only in so far as He produces wisdom, but also
because, in so far as we are wise, we imitate to some extent the power by which He makes us
wise. On the other hand, God is not called a stone, even though He has made stones, because in
the name stone there is understood a determinate mode of being according to which a stone is
distinguished from God. But the stone imitates God as its cause in being and goodness, and other
such characteristics, as do also the rest of creatures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] A similar situation obtains among the knowing and operative powers of man. For by its single
power the intellect knows all the things that the sensitive part of the soul grasps through a
diversity of powers-and many other things as well. So, too, the higher an intellect is, the more
it can know more things through one likeness, while a lesser intellect manages to know many
things only through many likenesses. So, too, a ruling power extends to all those things to which
diverse powers under it are ordered. In this way, therefore, through His one simple being God
possesses every kind of perfection that all other things come to possess, but in a much more
diminished way, through diverse principles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] From this we see the necessity of giving to God many names. For, since we cannot know Him
naturally except by arriving at Him from His effects, the names by which we signify His
perfection must be diverse, just as the perfections belonging to things are found to be diverse.
Were we able to understand the divine essence itself as it is and give to it the name that belongs
to it, we would express it by only one name. This is promised to those who will see God through
His essence: &#8220;In that day there shall be one Lord, and His name shall be one&#8221; (Zach. 14:9).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] It is thereby evident that nothing can be predicated univocally of God and other things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] An effect that does not receive a form specifically the same as that through which the agent
acts cannot receive according to a univocal predication the name arising from that form. Thus,
the heat generated by the sun and the sun itself are not called univocally hot. Now, the forms of
the things God has made do not measure up to a spccific likeness of the divine power; for the
things that God has made receive in a divided and particular way that which in Him is found in
a simple and universal way. It is evident, then, that nothing can be said univocally of God and
other things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] If, furthermore, an effect should measure up to the species of its cause, it will not receive the
univocal predication of the name unless it receives the same specific form according to the same
mode of being. For the house that is in the art of the maker is not univocally the same house that
is in matter, for the form of the house does not have the same being in the two locations. Now,
even though the rest of things were to receive a form that is absolutely the same as it is in God,
yet they do not receive it according to the same mode of being. For, as is clear from what we have
said, there is nothing in God that is not the divine being itself, which is not the case with other
things. Nothing, therefore, can be predicated of God and other things univocally.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Moreover, whatever is predicated of many things univocally is either a genus, a species, a
difference, an accident, or a property. But, as we have shown, nothing is predicated of God as a
genus or a difference; and thus neither is anything predicated as a definition, nor likewise as a
species, which is constituted of genus and difference. Nor, as we have shown, can there be any
accident in God, and therefore nothing is predicated of Him either as an accident or a property,
since property belongs to the genus of accidents. It remains, then, that nothing is predicated
univocally of God and other things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Again, what is predicated of many things univocally is simpler than both of them, at least in
concept. Now, there can be nothing simpler than God either in reality or in concept. Nothing,
therefore, is predicated univocally of God and other things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Everything, likewise, that is predicated univocally of many things belongs through
participation to each of the things of which it is predicated; for the species is said to participate
in the genus and the individual in the species. But nothing is said of God by participation, since
whatever is participated is determined to the mode of that which is participated and is thus
possessed in a partial way and not according to every mode of perfection. Nothing, therefore, can
be predicated univocally of God and other things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] Then, too, what is predicated of some things according to priority and posteriority is certainly
not predicated univocally. For the prior is included in the definition of the posterior, as substance
is included in the definition of accident according as an accident is a being. If, then, being were
said univocally of substance and accident, substance would have to be included in the definition
of being in so far as being is predicated of substance. But this is clearly impossible. Now nothing
is predicated of God and creatures as though they were in the same order, but, rather, according
to priority and posteriority. For all things are predicated of God essentially. For God is called
being as being entity itself, and He is called good as being goodness itself. But in other beings
predications are made by participation, as Socrates is said to be a man, not because he is
humanity itself, but because he possesses humanity. It is impossible, therefore, that anything be
predicated univocally of God and other things.</p>

EQUIVOCAL WAY</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] From what we have said it likewise appears that not everything predicated of God and other
things is said in a purely equivocal way, in the manner of equivocals by chance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] For in equivocals by chance there is no order or reference of one to another, but it is entirely
accidental that one name is applied to diverse things: the application of the name to one of them
does not signify that it has an order to the other. But this is not the situation with names said of
God and creatures, since we note in the community of such names the order of cause and effect,
as is clear from what we have said. It is not, therefore, in the manner of pure equivocation that
something is predicated of God and other things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Furthermore, where there is pure equivocation, there is no likeness in things themselves; there
is only the unity of a name. But, as is clear from what we have said, there is a certain mode of
likeness of things to God. It remains, then, that names are not said of God in a purely equivocal
way.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Moreover, when one name is predicated of several things in a purely equivocal way, we
cannot from one of them be led to the knowledge of another; for the knowledge of things does
not depend on words, but on the meaning of names. Now, from what we find in other things, we
do arrive at a knowledge of divine things, as is evident from what we have said. Such names,
then, are not said of God and other things in a purely equivocal way.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Again, equivocation in a name impedes the process of reasoning. If, then, nothing was said
of God and creatures except in a purely equivocal way, no reasoning proceeding from creatures
to God could take place. But, the contrary is evident from all those who have spoken about God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] It is also a fact that a name is predicated of some being uselessly unless through that name
we understand something of the being. But, if names are said of God and creatures in a purely
equivocal way, we understand nothing of God through those names; for the meanings of those
names are known to us solely to the extent that they are said of creatures. In vain, therefore,
would it be said or proved of God that He is a being, good, or the like.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] Should it be replied that through such names we know only what God is not, namely, that
God is called living because He does not belong to the genus of lifeless things, and so with the
other names, it will at least have to be the case that living said of God and creatures agrees in the
denial of the lifeless. Thus, it will not be said in a purely equivocal way.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THAT NAMES SAID OF GOD AND CREATURES ARE SAID ANALOGICALLY</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] From what we have said, therefore, it remains that the names said of God and creatures are
predicated neither univocally nor equivocally but analogically, that is, according to an order or
reference to something one.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] This can take place in two ways. In one way, according as many things have reference to
something one. Thus, with reference to one health we say that an animal is healthy as the subject
of health, medicine is healthy as its cause, food as its preserver, urine as its sign.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] In another way, the analogy can obtain according as the order or reference of two things is
not to something else but to one of them. Thus, being is said of substance and accident according
as an accident has reference to a substance, and not according as substance and accident are
referred to a third thing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Now, the names said of God and things are not said analogically according to the first mode
of analogy, since we should then have to posit something prior to God, but according to the
second mode.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] In this second mode of analogical predication the order according to the name and according
to reality is sometimes found to be the same and sometimes not. For the order of the name
follows the order of knowledge, because it is the sign of an intelligible conception. When,
therefore, that which is prior in reality is found likewise to be prior in knowledge, the same thing
is found to be prior both according to the meaning of the name and according to the nature of the
thing. Thus, substance is prior to accident both in nature, in so far as substance is the cause of
accident, and in knowledge, in so far as substance is included in the definition of accident.
Hence, being is said of substance by priority over accident both according to the nature of the
thing and according to the meaning of the name. But when that which is prior in nature is
subsequent in our knowledge, then there is not the same order in analogicals according to reality
and according to the meaning of the name. Thus, the power to heal, which is found in all health-giving things, is by nature prior to the health that is in the animal, as a cause is prior to an effect;
but because we know this healing power through an effect, we likewise name it from its effect.
Hence it is that the health-giving is prior in reality, but animal is by priority called healthy
according to the meaning of the name.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Thus, therefore, because we come to a knowledge of God from other things, the reality in the
names said of God and other things belongs by priority in God according to His mode of being,
but the meaning of the name belongs to God by posteriority. And so He is said to be named from
His effects.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] It is likewise shown from what has been said that, although names said of God signify the
same reality, they are yet not synonyms because they do not signify the same notion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] For just as diverse things are likened through their diverse forms to the one simple reality that
God is, so our intellect through its diverse conceptions is to some extent likened to God in so far
as it is led through the diverse perfections of creatures to know Him. Therefore, in forming many
conceptions of one thing, our intellect is neither false nor futile, because the simple being of God,
as we have shown, is such that things can be likened to it according to the multiplicity of their
forms. But in accord with its diverse conceptions our intellect devises diverse names that it
attributes to God. Hence, since these names are not attributed to God according to the same
notion, it is evident that they are not synonyms, even though they signify a reality that is
absolutely one. For the signification of the name is not the same, since a name signifies the
conception of the intellect before it signifies the thing itself understood by the intellect.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] From this it is further evident that, although God is absolutely simple, it is not futile for our
intellect to form enunciations concerning God in His simplicity by means of composition and
division.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] For although, as we have said, our intellect arrives at the knowledge of God through diverse
conceptions, it yet understands that what corresponds to all of them is absolutely one. For the
intellect does not attribute its mode of understanding to the things that it understands; for
example, it does not attribute immateriality to a stone even though it knows the stone
immaterially. It therefore sets forth the unity of a thing by a composition of words, which is a
mark of identity, when it says, God is good or goodness. The result is that if there is some
diversity in the composition, it is referred to the intellect, whereas the unity is referred to the
thing understood by the intellect. On the same basis, our intellect sometimes forms an
enunciation about God with a certain mark of diversity in it, through the use of a preposition, as
when we say, there is goodness in God. Here, too, there is indicated a certain diversity, which
belongs to the intellect, and a certain unity, which must be referred to the reality.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THAT GOD IS GOOD</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] From the divine perfection, which we have shown, we can conclude to the goodness of God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] For that by which each thing is called good is the virtue that belongs to it; for &#8220;the virtue of
each thing is what makes its possessor and his work good.&#8221; Now, virtue &#8220;is a certain perfection,
for each thing is then called perfect when it reaches the virtue belonging to it,&#8221; as may be seen
in <i>Physics</i> VII [3]. Hence, each thing is good from the fact that it is perfect. That is why each
thing seeks its perfection as the good belonging to it. But we have shown that God is perfect.
Therefore, He is good.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Again, it was shown above that there is a certain first unmoved mover, namely, God&#8217;s This
mover moves as a completely unmoved mover, which is as something desired. Therefore, since
God is the first unmoved mover, He is the first desired. But something is desired in two ways,
namely, either because it is good or because it appears to be good. The first desired is what is
good, since the apparent good does not move through itself but according as it has a certain
appearance of the good, whereas the good moves through itself. The first desired, therefore, God,
is truly good.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Furthermore, &#8220;the good is that which all things desire.&#8221; The Philosopher introduces this
remark as a &#8220;felicitous saying&#8221; in <i>Ethics</i> I [1]. But all things, each according to its mode, desire
to be in act; this is clear from the fact that each thing according to its nature resists corruption.
To be in act, therefore, constitutes the nature of the good. Hence it is that evil, which is opposed
to the good, follows when potency is deprived of act, as is clear from the Philosopher in
<i>Metaphysics</i> IX [9]. But, as we have shown, God is being in act without potency. Therefore, He
is truly good.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Moreover,.the communication of being and goodness arises from goodness. This is evident
from the very nature and definition of the good. By nature, the good of each thing is its act and
perfection. Now, each thing acts in so far as it is in act, and in acting it diffuses being and
goodness to other things. Hence, it is a sign of a being&#8217;s perfection that it &#8220;can produce its like,&#8221;
as may be seen from the Philosopher in <i>Meteorologica</i> IV [3]. Now, the nature of the good comes
from its being something appetible. This is the end, which also moves the agent to act. That is
why it is said that the good is diffusive of itself and of being. But this diffusion befits God
because, as we have shown above, being through Himself the necessary being, God is the cause
of being for other things. God is, therefore, truly good.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] That is why it is written in a Psalm (72:1): &#8220;How good is God to Israel, to those who are of
a right heart!&#8221; And again: &#8220;The Lord is good to those who hope in Him, to the soul that seeks
Him&#8221; (Lam. 3:25).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] From this we can conclude that God is His goodness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] To be in act is for each being its good. But God is not only a being in act; He is His very act
of being, as we have shown. God is, therefore, goodness itself, and not only good.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Again, as we have shown, the perfection of each thing is its goodness. But the perfection of
the divine being is not affirmed on the basis of something added to it, but because the divine
being, as was shown above, is perfect in itself. The goodness of God, therefore, is not something
added to His substance; His substance is His goodness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Moreover, each good thing that is not its goodness is called good by participation. But that
which is named by participation has something prior to it from which it receives the character
of goodness. This cannot proceed to infinity, since among final causes there is no regress to
infinity, since the infinite is opposed to the end [<i>finis</i>]. But the good has the nature of an end. We
must, therefore, reach some first good, that is not by participation good through an order toward
some other good, but is good through its own essence. This is God. God is, therefore, His own
goodness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Again, that which is can participate in something, but the act of being can participate in
nothing. For that which participates is in potency, and being is an act. But God is being itself, as
we have proved. He is not, therefore, by participation good; He is good essentially.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Furthermore, in a simple being, being and that which is are the same. For, if one is not the
other, the simplicity is then removed. But, as we have shown, God is absolutely simple.
Therefore, for God to be good is identical with God. He is, therefore, His goodness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] It is thereby likewise evident that no other good is its goodness. Hence it is said in Matthew
(19:17): &#8220;One is good, God.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] From this it is quite evident that there cannot be evil in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] For being and goodness, and all names that are predicated essentially, have nothing
extraneous mixed with them, although that which is or good can have something besides being
and goodness. For nothing prevents the subject of one perfection from being the subject of
another, just as that which is a body can be white and sweet. Now, each nature is enclosed within
the limits of its notion, so that it cannot include anything extraneous within itself. But, as we have
proved, God is goodness, and not simply good. There cannot, therefore, be any non-goodness in
Him. Thus, there cannot possibly be evil in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Moreover, what is opposed to the essence of a given thing cannot befit that thing so long as
its essence remains. Thus, irrationality or insensibility cannot befit man unless he ceases to be
a man. But the divine essence is goodness itself, as we have shown. Therefore, evil, which is the
opposite of good, could have no place in God&#8212;unless He ceased to be God, which is impossible,
since He is eternal, as we have shown.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Furthermore, since God is His own being, nothing can be said of Him by participation, as is
evident from the above argument. If, then, evil is said of God, it will not be said by participation,
but essentially. But evil cannot be so said of anything as to be its essence, for it would lose its
being, which is a good, as we have shown. In evil, however, there can be nothing extraneous
mixed with it, as neither in goodness. Evil, therefore, cannot be said of God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Again, evil is the opposite of good. But the nature of the good consists in perfection, which
means that the nature of evil consists in imperfection. Now, in God, Who is universally perfect,
as we have shown above, there cannot be defect or imperfection. Therefore, evil cannot be in
God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Then, too, a thing is perfect according as it is in act. A thing will therefore be imperfect
according as it falls short of act. Hence, evil is either a privation or includes privation. But the
subject of privation is potency, which cannot be in God. Neither, therefore, can evil.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] If, moreover, the good is &#8220;that which is sought by all,&#8221; it follows that every nature flees evil
as such. Now, what is in a thing contrary to the motion of its natural appetite is violent and
unnatural. Evil in each thing, consequently, is violent and unnatural, so far as it is an evil for that
thing; although, among composite things, evil may he natural to a thing according to something
within it. But God is not composite, nor, as we have shown, can there be anything violent or
unnatural in Him. Evil, therefore, cannot be in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[8] Scripture likewise confirms this. For it is said in the canonic Epistle of John (I, 1:5): &#8220;God
is light and in Him there is no darkness&#8221;; and in Job (34:10) it is written: &#8220;Far from God be
wickedness; and iniquity from the Almighty.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] From the foregoing it is also shown that God is &#8220;the good of every good.&#8221;&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] For the goodness of each thing is its perfection, as we have said. But, since God is absolutely
perfect, in His perfection He comprehends the perfections of all things, as has been shown. His
goodness, therefore, comprehends every goodness. Thus, He is the good of every good.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Moreover, that which is said to be of a certain sort by participation is said to be such only so
far as it has a certain likeness to that which is said to be such by essence. Thus iron is said to be
on fire in so far as it participates in a certain likeness of fire. But God is good through His
essence, whereas all other things are good by participation, as has been shown. Nothing, then,
will be called good except in so far as it has a certain likeness of the divine goodness. Hence,
God is the good of every good.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Since, furthermore, each thing is appetible because of the end, and since the nature of the
good consists in its being appetible, each thing must be called good either because it is the end
or because it is ordered to the end. It is the last end, then, from which all things receive the nature
of good. As will be proved later on, this is God. God is, therefore, the good of every good.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Hence it is that God, promising to Moses a vision of Himself, says: &#8220;I will show you all
good&#8221; (Exod. 33:19). And in Wisdom (7:11), it is said of the divine wisdom: &#8220;All good things
come to me together with her.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THAT GOD IS THE HIGHEST GOOD</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] From this conclusion we prove that God is the highest good.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] For the universal good stands higher tlpn any particular good, just as &#8220;the good of the people
is better than the good of an individual,&#8221; since the goodness and perfection of the whole stand
higher than the goodness and perfection of the part. But the divine goodness is compared to all
others as the universal good to a particular good, being, as we have shown, the good of every
good. God is, therefore, the highest good.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Furthermore, what is said essentially is said more truly than what is said by participation. But
God is good essentially, while other things are good by participation, as we have shown. God is,
therefore, the highest good.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Again, &#8220;what is greatest in any genus is the cause of the rest in that genus,&#8221; for a cause ranks
higher than an effect. But, as we have shown, it is from God that all things have the nature of
good. God is, therefore, the highest good.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Moreover, just as what is not mixed with black is more white, so what is not mixed with evil
is more good. But Cod is most unmixed with evil, because evil can be in God neither in act nor
in potency; and this belongs to God according to His nature, as we have shown. God is, therefore,
the highest good.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Hence what is written in 1 Samuel (2:2): &#8220;There is none holy as the Lord is.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THAT GOD IS ONE</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] From what has been shown it is evident that God is one.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] For it is not possible that there be two highest goods, since that which is said by
superabundance is found in only one being. But God, as we have shown, is the highest good. God
is, therefore, one.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Again, it has been shown that God is absolutely perfect, lacking no perfection. If, then, there
are many gods, there must be many such perfect beings. But this is impossible. For, if none of
these perfect beings lacks some perfection, and does not have any admixture of imperfection,
which is demanded for an absolutely perfect being, nothing will be given in which to distinguish
the perfect beings from one another. It is impossible, therefore, that there be many gods.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Again, that which is accomplished adequately through one supposition is better done through
one than through many. But the order of things is the best it can be, since the power of the first
cause does not fail the potency in things for perfection. Now, all things are sufficiently fulfilled
by a reduction to one first principle. There is, therefore, no need to posit many principles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Moreover, it is impossible that there be one continuous and regular motion from many
movers. For, if they move together, none of them is a perfect mover, but all together rather take
the place of one perfect mover. This is not befitting in the first mover, for the perfect is prior to
the imperfect. If, however, they do not move together, each of them at times moves and at times
does not. It follows from this that motion is neither continuous nor regular. For a motion that is
continuous and one is from one mover. Furthermore, a mover that is not always moving is found
to move irregularly, as is evident among lesser movers among whom a violent motion is stronger
in the beginning and weaker at the end, whereas a natural motion proceeds conversely. But, as
the philosophers have proved, the first motion is one and continuous. Therefore, its first mover
must be one.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Furthermore, a corporeal substance is ordered to a spiritual substance as to its good. For there
is in the spiritual substance a fuller goodness to which the corporeal substance seeks to liken
itself, since whatever exists desires the best so far as this is possible. But all the motions of the
corporeal creature are seen to be reduced to one first motion, beyond which there is no other first
motion that is not in some way reduced to it. Therefore, outside the spiritual substance that is the
end of the first motion, there is none that is not reduced to it. But this is what we understand by
the name of God. Hence, there is only one God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] Among all the things that are ordered to one another, furthermore, their order to one another
is for the sake of their order to something one; just as the order of the parts of an army among
themselves is for the sake of the order of the whole army to its general. For that some diverse
things should be united by some relationship cannot come about from their own natures as
diverse things, since on this basis they would rather be distinguished from one another. Nor can
this unity come from diverse ordering causes, because they could not possibly intend one order
in so far as among themselves they are diverse. Thus, either the order of many to one another is
accidental, or we must reduce it to some one first ordering cause that orders all other things to
the end it intends. Now, we find that all the parts of this world are ordered to one another
according as some things help some other things. Thus, lower bodies are moved by higher bodies,
and these by incorporeal substances, as appears from what was said above. Nor is this something
accidental, since it takes place always or for the most part. Therefore, this whole world has only
one ordering cause and governor. But there is no other world beyond this one. Hence, there is
only one governor for all things, whom we call God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[8] Then, too, if there are two beings of which both are necessary beings, they must agree in the
notion of the necessity of being. Hence, they must be distinguished by something added either
to one of them only, or to both. This means that one or both of them must be composite. Now,
as we have shown, no composite being is through itself a necessary being. It is impossible
therefore that there be many beings of which each is a necessary being. Hence, neither can there
be many gods.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[9] Furthermore, given two gods that are posited as agreeing in the necessity of being, either that
in which they differ is in some way required for the completion of their necessity of being, or it
is not. If it is not, then it is something accidental, because that which accrues to a thing without
contributing to its being is an accident. Hence, this accident has a cause, which is, consequently,
either the essence of the necessary being or something else. If its essence, then, since the
necessity itself of being is its essence, as is evident from what was said above, the necessity of
being will be the cause of that accident. But the necessity of being is found in both gods.
Therefore, both will have that accident, and thus will not be distinguished with reference to it.
If, however, the cause of the accident is something else, it follows that, unless that something else
existed, this accident would not exist; and unless this accident existed, the aforesaid distinction
would not exist. Therefore, unless that something else existed, these two supposed necessary
beings would not be two but one. Therefore, the proper being of each depends on the other, and
thus neither of them is through itself a necessary being.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[10] If, however, that in which they are distinguished is required to complete the necessity of
their being, either this will be because it is included in the nature of this necessity of being, as
animate is included in the definition of animal, or this will be because their necessity of being
is specified by it, as animal is completed by rational. If the first is the case, wherever the necessity
of being is found there must be present that which is included in its nature, just as animate
belongs to whatever being to which animal belongs. And thus, since the necessity of being is
attributed to both the aforementioned beings, they will not thereby be distinguished. If the second
is the case, this too is impossible. A difference specifying a genus does not complete the nature
of the genus, but rather through it the genus comes to be in act. For the nature of animal is
complete before the addition of rational. Rather, the fact is that there cannot be an animal in act
that is not rational or irrational. Thus, therefore, something completes the necessity of being as
to being in act, and not as to the notion of the necessity of being. This is impossible on two
counts. First, because the quiddity of a necessary being is its being, as was proved above. Second,
because, were it true, the necessary being would acquire being through something else, which is
impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[11] It is, therefore, not possible to posit many beings of which each is through itself a necessary
being.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[12] What is more, if there are two gods, either the name God is predicated of both univocally,
or equivocally. If equivocally, this is outside our present purpose. Nothing prevents any given
thing from being equivocally named by any given name, provided we admit the usage of those
who express the name. But if it be used univocally, it must be predicated of both according to one
notion, which means that, in notion, there must be in both one nature. Either, therefore, this
nature is in both according to one being, or according to a being that is other in each case. If
according to one, there will not be two gods, but only one, since there cannot be one being for
two things that are substantially distinguished. If each has its own being, therefore in neither
being will the quiddity be its being. Yet this must be posited in God, as we have proved.
Therefore, neither of these two beings is what we understand by the name God. It is, therefore,
impossible to posit two gods.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[13] Again, nothing that belongs to this designated thing as such can belong to another, for the
singularity of some thing belongs to none other than to that singular thing. But its necessity of
being belongs to the necessary being so far as it is this designated being. Therefore, it cannot
belong to another, and therefore there cannot be several beings of which each is a necessary
being. It is, consequently, impossible that there be several gods.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[14] The proof of the minor. If the necessary being is not this designated being as a necessary
being, the designation of its being is not necessary through itself but depends on another. But so
far as each thing is in act it is distinct from all other things; this is to be this designated thing.
Therefore, the necessary being depends on another to be in act; which is against the nature of the
necessary being. Therefore, the necessary being must be necessary according as it is this
designated being.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[15] Furthermore, either the nature signified by the name God is individuated through itself in
this God, or it is individuated through something else. If through something else, composition
must result. If through itself, then it cannot possibly belong to another, since the principle of
individuation cannot be common to several, It is impossible, therefore, that there be several gods.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[16] If, again, there are several gods, the nature of the godhead cannot be numerically one in two
of them. There must, therefore, be something distinguishing the divine nature in this and in that
god. But this is impossible, because, as we have shown above, the divine nature receives the
addition neither of essential differences nor of accidents. Nor yet is the divine nature the form
of any matter, to be capable of being divided according to the division of matter. It is impossible,
therefore, that there be two gods.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[17] Then, too, the proper being of each thing is only one. But God is His being, as we have
shown. There can, therefore, be only one God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[18] Moreover, a thing has being in the manner it possesses unity. Hence, each thing struggles
as much as it can against any division of itself, lest thereby it tend to nonbeing. But the divine
nature has being most powerfully. There is therefore, in it the greatest unity, and hence no
plurality is in any way distinguished within it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[19] Furthermore, we notice in each genus that multitude proceeds from some unity. This is why
in every genus there is found a prime member that is the measure of all the things found in that
genus. In whatever things, therefore, we find that there is an agreement in one respect, it is
necessary that this depend upon one source. But all things agree in being. There must, therefore,
be only one being that is the source of all things. This is God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[20] Again, in every rulership he who rules desires unity. That is why among the forms of
rulership the main one is monarchy or kingship. So, too, for many members there is one head,
whereby we see by an evident sign that he to whom rulership belongs should have unity. Hence,
we must admit that God, Who is the cause of all things, is absolutely one.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[21] This confession of the divine unity we can likewise gather from holy Scripture. For it is said
in Deuteronomy (6:4): &#8220;Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God is one God&#8221;; and in Exodus (20:3):
&#8220;You shall not have strange gods before Me&#8221;; and in Ephesians (4:5): &#8220;One Lord, one faith, one
baptism.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[22] Now by this truth are refuted those Gentiles who accepted a multitude of gods. However,
many of them said that there was one highest God, by whom all the others whom they named
gods were according to them caused. For they attributed the name of divinity to all everlasting
substances, and this especially because of their wisdom and felicity and the rulership of things.
This manner of speaking is found also in Sacred Scripture, in which the holy angels, or even men,
or judges, are called gods. Thus, this verse of the Psalms (85:8): &#8220;There is none among the gods
like You, O Lord&#8221;; and elsewhere: &#8220;I have said: You are gods&#8221; (Ps. 81:6). Many such expressions
are found in different places in Scripture.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[23] Hence, it is mainly the Manicheans who seem opposed to this truth, in that they posit two
first principles of which one is not the cause of the other.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[24] The Arians likewise attacked this truth by their errors, in confessing that the Father and the
Son are not one but several gods; although the authority of Scripture forces e to believe that the
Son is true God.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THAT GOD IS INFINITE</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] Since, as the philosophers teach, &#8220;the infinite accompanies quantity,&#8221; infinity cannot be
attributed to God on the ground of multitude. For we have shown that there is only one God and
that no composition of parts or accidents is found in Him. Nor, again, according to continuous
quantity can God be called infinite, since we have shown that He is incorporeal. It remains, then,
to investigate whether according to spiritual magnitude it befits God to be infinite.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] We speak of spiritual magnitude with reference to two points: namely, power and the
goodness or completeness of one&#8217;s own nature. For something is said to be more or less white
according to the mode in which its whiteness is completed. The magnitude of its power likewise
is measured from the magnitude of its action or its works. Of these magnitudes one follows the
other. For, from the fact that something is in act it is active, and hence the mode of the magnitude
of its power is according to the mode in which it is completed in its act. Thus, it remains that
spiritual beings are called great according to the mode of their completion. Augustine himself
says that &#8220;in beings that are great but not in bulk, to be greater is the same as to be better.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] We must therefore show that God is infinite according to the mode of this sort of magnitude.
The infinite here will not be taken in the sense of privation, as in the case of dimensive or
numerical quantity. For this quantity is of a nature to have a limit, so that such things are called
infinites according as there is removed from them the limits they have by nature; which means
that in their case the infinite designates an imperfection. But in God the infinite is understood
only in a negative way, because there is no terminus or limit to His perfection: He is supremely
perfect. It is thus that the infinite ought to be attributed to God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] For everything that according to its nature is finite is determined to the nature of some genus.
God, however, is not in any genus; His perfection, as was shown above, rather contains the
perfections of all the genera. God is, therefore, infinite.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5) Again, every act inhering in another is terminated by that in which it inheres, since what is
in another is in it according to the mode of the receiver. Hence, an act that exists in nothing is
terminated by nothing. Thus, if whiteness were self-existing, the perfection of whiteness in it
would not be terminated so as not to have whatever can be had of the perfection of whiteness.
But God is act in no way existing in another, for neither is He a form in matter, as we have
proved, nor does His being inhere in some form or nature, since He is His own being, as was
proved above. It remains, then, that God is infinite.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Furthermore, in reality we find something that is potency alone, namely, prime matter,
something that is act alone, namely, God, as was shown above, and something that is act and
potency, namely, the rest of things. But, since potency is said relatively to act, it cannot exceed
act either in a particular case or absolutely. Hence, since prime matter is infinite in its
potentiality, it remains that God, Who is pure act, is infinite in His actuality.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] Moreover, an act is all the more perfect by as much as it has less of potency mixed with it.
Hence, every act with which potency is mixed is terminated in its perfection. But, as was shown
above, God is pure act without any potency. He is, therefore, infinite.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[8] Again, considered absolutely, being is infinite, since there are infinite and infinite modes in
which it can be participated. If, then, the being of some thing is finite, that being must be limited
by something other that is somehow its cause. But there can be no cause of the divine being, for
God is a necessary being through Himself. Therefore, His being is infinite, and so is He.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[9] Then, too, what has a certain perfection is the more perfect as it participates in that perfection
more fully. But there cannot be a mode of perfection, nor is one thinkable, by which a given
perfection is possessed more fully than it is possessed by the being that is perfect through its
essence and whose being is its goodness. In no way, therefore, is it possible to think of anything
better or more perfect than God. Hence, God is infinite in goodness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[10] Our intellect, furthermore, extends to the infinite in understanding; and a sign of this is that,
given any finite quantity, our intellect can think of a greater one. But this ordination of the
intellect would be in vain unless an infinite intelligible reality existed. There must, therefore, be
some infinite intelligible reality, which must be the greatest of beings. This we call God. God is,
therefore, infinite.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[11] Again, an effect cannot transcend its cause. But our intellect can be only from God, Who
is the first cause of all things. Our intellect, therefore, cannot think of anything greater than God.
If, then, it can think of something greater than every finite thing, it remains that God is not finite.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[12] There is also the argument that an infinite power cannot reside in a finite essence. For each
thing acts through its form, which is either its essence or a part of the essence, whereas power
is the name of a principle of action. But God does not have a finite active power. For He moves
in an infinite time, which can be done only by an infinite power, as we have proved above. It
remains, then, that God&#8217;s essence is infinite.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[13] This argument, however, is according to those who posit the eternity of the world. If we do
not posit it, there is all the greater confirmation for the view that the power of God is infinite. For
each agent is the more powerful in acting according as it reduces to act a potency more removed
from act; just as a greater power is needed to heat water than air. But that which in no way exists
is infinitely distant from act, nor is it in any way in potency. If, then, the world was made after
previously not being at all, the power of its maker must be infinite.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[14] This argument holds in proving the infinity of the divine power even according to those who
posit the eternity of the world. For they acknowledge that God is the cause of the substance of
the world, though they consider this substance to be everlasting. They say that God is the cause
of an everlasting world in the same way as a foot would have been the cause of an imprint if it
had been pressed on sand from all eternity. If we adopt this position, according to our previous
argumentation it still follows that the power of God is infinite. For, whether God produced things
in time, as we hold, or from all eternity, according to them, nothing can be in reality that God did
not produce; for God is the universal source of being. Thus, God produced the world without the
supposition of any pre-existent matter or potency. Now, we must gather the proportion of an
active power according to the proportion of a passive potency, for the greater the potency that
preexists or is presupposed, by so much the greater active power will it be brought to actual
fulfillment. It remains, therefore, that, since a finite power produces a given effect by
presupposing the potency of matter, the power of God, which presupposes no potency, is infinite,
not finite. Thus, so is His essence infinite.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[15] Each thing, moreover, is more enduring according as its cause is more efficacious. Hence,
that being whose duration is infinite must have been from a cause of infinite efficaciousness. But
the duration of God is infinite, for we have shown above that He is eternal. Since, then, He has
no other cause of His being than Himself, He must be infinite.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[16] The authority of Sacred Scripture is witness to this truth. For the psalmist says: &#8220;Great is the
Lord, and greatly to be praised: and of His greatness there is no end&#8221; (Ps. 144:3).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[17] The sayings of the most ancient philosophers are likewise a witness to this truth. They all
posited an infinite first principle of things, as though compelled by truth itself.&#8221; Yet they did not
recognize their own voice. They judged the infinity of the first principle in terms of discrete
quantity, following Democritus, who posited infinite atoms as the principles of things, and also
Anaxagoras, who posited infinite similar parts as the principles of things. Or they judged infinity
in terms of continuous quantity, following those who posited that the first principle of all things
was some element or a confused infinite body. But, since it was shown by the effort of later
philosophers that there is no infinite body, given that there must be a first principle that is in
some way infinite, we conclude that the infinite which is the first principle is neither a body nor
a power in a body.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] From what has been said we can show that God is intelligent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] We have shown above that among movers and things moved we cannot proceed to infinity,
but must reduce all movable things, as is demonstrable, to one first self-moving being. The self-moving being moves itself only by appetite and knowledge, for only such beings are found to
move themselves, because to be moved and not moved lies in their power. The moving part in
the first self-moving being must he appetitive and apprehending. Now, in a motion that takes
place through appetite and apprehension, he who has the appetite and the apprehension is a
moved mover, while the appetible and apprehended is the unmoved mover. Since, therefore, the
first mover of all things, whom we call God, is an absolutely unmoved mover, He must be related
to the mover that is a part of the self-moving being as the appetible is to the one who has the
appetite. Not, however, as something appetible by sensible appetite, since sensible appetite is not
of that which is good absolutely but of this particular good, since the apprehension of the sense
is likewise particular; whereas that which is good and appetible absolutely is prior to that which
is good and appetible here and now. The first mover, then, must be appetible as an object of
intellect, and thus the mover that desires it must be intelligent. All the more, therefore, will the
first appetible be intelligent, since the one desiring it is intelligent in act by being joined to it as
an intelligible. Therefore, making the supposition that the first mover moves himself, as the
philosophers intended, we must say that God is intelligent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Moreover, the same conclusion must follow if the reduction of movable beings is, not to a
first self-moving being, but to an absolutely unmoved mover. For the first mover is the universal
source of motion. Therefore, since every mover moves through a form at which it aims in
moving, the form through which the first mover moves must be a universal form and a universal
good. But a form does not have a universal mode except in the intellect. Consequently, the first
mover, God, must be intelligent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] In no order of movers, furthermore, is it the case that an intellectual mover is the instrument
of a mover without an intellect. Rather, the converse is true. But all movers in the world are to
the first mover, God, as instruments are related to a principal agent. Since, then, there are in the
world many movers endowed with intelligence, it is impossible that the first mover move without
an intellect. Therefore, God must be intelligent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Again, a thing is intelligent because it is without matter. A sign of this is the fact that forms
are made understood in act by abstraction from matter. And hence the intellect deals with
universals and not singulars, for matter is the principle of individuation. But forms that are
understood in act become one with the intellect that understands them in act. Therefore, if forms
are understood in act because they are without matter, a thing must be intelligent because it is
without matter. But we have shown that God is absolutely immaterial. God is, therefore,
intelligent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Then, too, as was shown above, no perfection found in any genus of things is lacking to God.
Nor on this account does any composition follow in Him. But among the perfections; of things
the greatest is that something be intelligent, for thereby it is in a manner all things, having within
itself the perfections of all things. God is, therefore, intelligent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] Again, that which tends determinately to some end either has set itself that end or the end has
been set for it by another. Otherwise, it would tend no more to this end than to that. Now, natural
things tend to determinate ends. They do not fulfill their natural needs by chance, since they
would not do so always or for the most part, but rarely, which is the domain of chance. Since,
then, things do not set for themselves an end, because they have no notion of what an end is, the
end must be set for them by another, who is the author of nature. He it is who gives being to all
things and is through Himself the necessary being. We call Him God, as is clear from what we
have said. But God could not set an end for nature unless He had understanding. God is,
therefore, intelligent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[8] Furthermore, everything imperfect derives from something perfect; for the perfect is naturally
prior to the imperfect, as is act to potency. But the forms found in particular things are imperfect
because they are there in a particular way and not according to the community of their natures.
They must therefore be derived from some forms that are perfect and not particular. But such
forms cannot exist unless by being understood, since no form is found in its universality except
in the intellect. Consequently, these forms must be intelligent, if they be subsistent; for only thus
do they have operation. God, then, Who is the first subsistent act, from whom all other things are
derived, must be intelligent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[9] This truth the Catholic faith likewise confesses. For it is said of God in Job (9:4): &#8220;He is wise
of heart, and mighty in strength&#8221;; and later on (12:16): &#8220;With Him is strength and wisdom.&#8221; So,
too, in the Psalms (138:6): &#8220;Your knowledge has become wonderful to me&#8221;; and Romans
(21:33): &#8220;O the depth of the riches of the wisdom and of the knowledge of God.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[10] The truth of this faith was so strong among men that they named God from the act of
understanding. For theos [&#952;&#949;&#959;&#962;], which among the Greeks signifies God, comes from <i>theaste</i>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] From the fact that God is intelligent it follows that His act of understanding is His essence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] To understand is the act of one understanding, residing in him, not proceeding to something
outside as heating proceeds to the heated thing. For, by being understood, the intelligible suffers
nothing; rather, the one understanding is perfected. Now, whatever is in God is the divine
essence. God&#8217;s act of understanding, therefore, is His essence, it is the divine being, God
Himself. For God is His essence and His being.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Furthermore, the act of understanding is to the intellect as being [<i>esse</i>] is to essence
[<i>essentia</i>]. But, as we have proved, God&#8217;s being is His essence. Therefore, God&#8217;s understanding
is His intellect. But the divine intellect is God&#8217;s essence; otherwise, it would be an accident in
God. Therefore, the divine understanding is His essence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Again, second act is more perfect than first act, as consideration is more perfect than
knowledge. But the knowledge or intellect of God is His essence, if, as we have proved, He is
intelligent; for, as is clear from the above, no perfection belongs to Him by participation but
rather by essence. If, therefore, His consideration is not His essence, something will be nobler
and more perfect than His essence. Thus, God will not be at the summit of perfection and
goodness and hence will not be first.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Moreover, to understand is the act of the one understanding. If, therefore, God in
understanding is not His understanding, God must be related to it as potency to act. Thus, there
will be potency and act in God, which is impossible, as we proved above.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Then, too, every substance exists for the sake of its operation. If, then, the operation of God
is other than the divine substance, the end of God will be something other than God. Thus, God
will not be His goodness, since the good of each thing is its end.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] If, however, God&#8217;s understanding is His being, His understanding must be simple, eternal and
unchangeable, existing only in act, and including all the perfections that have been proved of the
divine being. Hence, God is not potentially understanding, nor does He begin to understand
something anew, nor still does He have any change or composition in understanding.</p>

HIS ESSENCE</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] From what has been shown above it appears with evidence that the divine intellect
understands through no other intelligible species than through His essence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] The intelligible species is the formal principle of intellectual operation, just as the form of any
agent is the principle of its own operation. Now, as we have shown, the divine intellectual
operation is God&#8217;s essence. If, then, the divine intellect understood by an intelligible species
other than the divine essence, something other would be added to the divine essence as principle
and cause. This is opposed to what was shown above.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Furthermore, the intellect becomes understanding in act through an intelligible species, just
as the sense becomes sensing in act through a sensible species. The intelligible species is to the
intellect, therefore, as act to potency. If, then, the divine intellect understood through some
intelligible species other than itself, it would be in potency with respect to something. This is
impossible, as we proved above.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Moreover, an intelligible species in the intellect that is other than the intellect&#8217;s essence has
an accidental being, which is why our knowledge is numbered among the accidents. But in God,
as we have shown, there can be no accident. Therefore, there is not in the divine intellect any
species other than the divine essence itself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Again, the intelligible species is the likeness of something understood. If, then, there is in the
divine intellect an intelligible species other than the divine essence, it will be the likeness of
something understood. It will thus be the likeness either of the divine essence or of some other
thing. It cannot be the likeness of the divine essence, because then the divine essence would not
be intelligible through itself, but that species would make it intelligible. Nor can there be in the
divine intellect a species other than the divine intellect that is the likeness of some other being.
For that likeness would then be impressed on the divine intellect by some being. Not by itself,
since then the same being would be agent and receiver, and also because there would be an agent
that impressed, not its own likeness, but that of another on the receiver, and thus it would not be
true that every agent produced its like. Nor by another, for there would then be an agent prior to
God. It is, therefore, impossible that there be in God an intelligible species other than His
essence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Furthermore, God&#8217;s understanding, as we have shown, is His essence. If, therefore, God
understood through a species that was not His essence, it would be through something other than
His essence. This is impossible. Therefore, God does not understand through a species that is not
His essence.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] From this it further appears that God understands Himself perfectly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] Since through the intelligible species the intellect is directed to the thing understood, the
perfection of intellectual operation depends on two things. One is that the intelligible species be
perfectly conformed to the thing understood. The second is that it be perfectly joined to the
intellect, which is realized more fully according as the intellect has greater power in
understanding. Now, the divine essence, which is the intelligible species by which the divine
intellect understands, is absolutely identical with God and it is also absolutely identical with His
intellect. Therefore, God understands Himself most perfectly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Furthermore, a material thing is made intelligible by being separated from matter and the
conditions of matter. Therefore, that which is through its nature separate from all matter and
material conditions is intelligible in its nature. Now every intelligible is understood by being one
in act with the one understanding. But, as we have proved, God is intelligent. Therefore, since
He is absolutely immaterial, and most one with Himself, He understands Himself perfectly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Again, a thing is Understood in act because the intellect in act and the understood in act are
one. But the divine intellect is always an intellect in act, since there is no potency or imperfection
in God. On the other hand, the divine essence is through itself perfectly intelligible, as is clear
from what we have said. Since, therefore, the divine intellect and the divine essence are one, it
is evident from what we have said that God understands Himself perfectly. For God is His
intellect and His essence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Moreover, what is in something in an intelligible way is understood by it. The divine essence
is in God in an intelligible way, for the natural being of God and His intelligible being are one
and the same, since His being is His understanding. God, therefore, understands His essence, and
hence Himself, since He is His essence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] The acts of the intellect, furthermore, like those of the other powers of the soul, are
distinguished according to their objects. The operation of the intellect will be more perfect as the
intelligible object is more perfect. But the most perfect intelligible object is the divine essence,
since it is the most perfect and the first truth. The operation of the divine intellect is likewise the
most noble, since, as we have shown, it is the divine being. Therefore, God understands Himself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] Again, the perfections of all things are found supremely in God. Now, among other
perfections found in created things the greatest is to understand God. For the intellectual nature,
whose perfection is understanding, excels all the others; and the most noble intelligible object
is God. God, therefore, knows Himself supremely.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[8] This is confirmed by divine authority. For the Apostle says: &#8220;The spirit searches all things,
yea, the deep things of God&#8221; (1 Cor. 2:10).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] Now, it appears from what we have said that primarily. and essentially God knows only
Himself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] That thing alone is primarily and essentially known by the intellect by whose species the
intellect understands; for an operation is proportioned to the form that is the principle of the
operation. But, as we have proved, that by which God understands is nothing other than His
essence. Therefore, the primary and essential object of His intellect is nothing other than Himself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] It is, furthermore, impossible to understand a multitude primarily and essentially, since one
operation cannot be terminated by many. But, as we have proved, God at some time understands
Himself. If, therefore, He understands something other than Himself as the primary and essential
object of His understanding, His intellect must change from a consideration of Himself to the
consideration of this something else. This something else is less noble than God. The divine
intellect is thus changed for the worse, which is impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Moreover, the operations of the intellect are distinguished according to their objects. If, then,
God understands Himself and something other than Himself as the principal object, He will have
several intellectual operations. Therefore, either His essence will be divided into several parts,
or He will have an intellectual operation that is not His substance. Both of these positions have
been proved to be impossible. It remains, then, that nothing other than the divine essence is
known by God as the primary and essential object of His intellect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Again, in so far as the intellect is different from its object, it is in potency to it. If, then,
something other than Himself is God's primary and essential object, it will follow that He is in
potency to something else. This is impossible, as is clear from what we have said.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.125in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] The thing understood, likewise, is the perfection of the one understanding. For the intellect
is perfect according as it understands in act, and this obtains through the fact that the intellect is
one with what is understood. If, then, something other than Himself is primarily understood by
God, something else will be His perfection, and more noble than He. This is impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] Furthermore, the knowledge of the one understanding is comprised of many things
understood. If, then, God knows many things as the principal and essential objects of His
knowledge, it will follow that the knowledge of God is composed of many things. Thus, either
the divine essence will be composite, or knowledge will be an accident in God. From what we
have said, it is clear that both of these suppositions are impossible. It remains, therefore, that
what is primarily and essentially understood by God is nothing other than His substance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[8] Again, intellectual operation derives its specification and nobility from that which is
essentially and primarily understood by it. If, then, God understood something other than Himself
as His essential and primary object, His intellectual operation would have its specification and
nobility according to something other than God. This, however, is impossible, since, as we have
shown, God&#8217;s operation is His essence. Thus, it is impossible that what is understood primarily
and essentially by God be other than He.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] From the fact that God understands Himself primarily and essentially we must posit that He
knows in Himself things other than Himself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] An effect is adequately known when its cause is known. So &#8220;we are said to know each thing
when we know the cause.&#8221; But God Himself is through His essence the cause of being for other
things. Since He has a most full knowledge of His essence, we must posit that God also knows
other things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Moreover, the likeness of every effect somehow preexists in its cause; for every agent
produces its like. But whatever is in something is in it according to the mode of that in which it
is. If, then, God is the cause of certain things, since according to His nature He is intellectual, the
likeness of what He causes will exist in Him in an intelligible way. But what is in something in
an intelligible way is understood by it. God, therefore, understands within Himself things other
than Himself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Again, whoever knows perfectly a given thing knows whatever can be truly said of it and
whatever befits it according to its nature. But it befits God according to His nature to be the cause
of other things. Since, then, God knows Himself perfectly, He knows Himself to be a cause. This
cannot be unless He somehow knows what He causes. This is other than He, since nothing is the
cause of itself. Therefore, God knows things other than Himself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] If we put together these two conclusions, it appears that God knows Himself as primarily and
essentially known, whereas He knows other things as seen in His essence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] This truth is expressly taught by Dionysius. He says: &#8220;In seeing them, God does not insert
Himself in singulars, but He knows them as contained within a single cause&#8221; [<i>De dev. nom.</i> VII,
2]. And later on: &#8220;the divine wisdom, knowing itself, knows other things.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] To this judgment, too, the authority of Sacred Scripture bears witness. For it is said of God
in the Psalms (101:20): &#8220;He looked forth from His high sanctuary&#8221;; as though to say that God
sees other things from His own height.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] Some have said that God has only a universal knowledge of other things. He knows them, that
is, in so far as they are beings because He knows the nature of being through a knowledge of
Himself. For this reason, it remains for us to show that God knows all other things as they are
distinct from one another and from Himself. This is to know things according to their proper
natures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] In order to show this point, let us suppose that God is the cause of every being, as is
somewhat evident from what we said above and will be more fully shown later on. Thus, there
is consequently nothing in any thing that is not caused by God, mediately or immediately. Now,
when the cause is known, the effect is known. Whatever is in each and every thing can be known
if we know God and all the causes that are between God and things. But God knows Himself and
all the intervening causes between Himself and any given thing. Now, we have already shown
that God knows Himself perfectly. By knowing Himself, God knows whatever proceeds from
Him immediately. When this is known, God once more knows what proceeds from it
immediately; and so on for all intermediate causes down to the last effect. Therefore, God knows
whatever is found in reality. But this is to have a proper and complete knowledge of a thing,
namely, to know all that there is in that thing, both what is common and what is proper.
Therefore, God has a proper knowledge of things, in so far as they are distinct from one another.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Furthermore, whatever acts through an intellect knows what it does according to the proper
nature of its work; for the knowledge of the maker determines the form for the thing made. Now,
God causes things through His intellect, since His being is His understanding and each thing acts
in so far as it is in act. God, therefore, has a proper knowledge of what He causes, so far as it is
distinct from the others.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Moreover, the distinction of things cannot be from chance, because it has a fixed order. The
distinction in things must therefore be from the intention of some cause. It cannot be from the
intention of a cause acting through a necessity of nature, for nature is determined to one course
of action, and thus the intention of no thing acting through the necessity of nature can terminate
in many effects in so far as these are distinct. It remains, then, that distinction in things comes
from the intention of a knowing cause. But it seems to be proper to the intellect to consider the
distinction of things; and so Anaxagoras called the intellect the source of distinction. Now, the
universal distinction of things cannot be from the intention of some secondary cause, because all
such causes belong to the world of distinct effects. It belongs to the first cause, that is through
itself distinguished from all other things, to aim at the distinction of all things. God, therefore,
knows things as distinct.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Again, whatever God knows He knows most perfectly. For, as was shown above, there is all
perfection in God as in the absolutely perfect being. Now, what is known only in a general way
is not perfectly known, since one does not yet know what is most important in that thing, namely,
the ultimate perfections, by which its proper being is completed; so that by such a knowledge a
thing is known potentially rather than actually. Since, then, by knowing His own essence God
knows things in a universal way, He must also have a proper knowledge of things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Then, too, whoever knows a certain nature knows the essential accidents of that nature. The
essential accidents of being as being are one and many, as is proved in <i>Metaphysics</i> IV [3]. If,
then, by knowing His essence, God knows the nature of being in a universal way, it follows that
He knows multitude. But multitude cannot be understood without distinction. Therefore, God
knows things as they are distinct from one another.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] Whoever, furthermore, perfectly knows a universal nature knows the mode in which that
nature can be possessed. In the same way, he who knows whiteness knows that which receives
it more and less. But the grades of beings are established from the diverse mode of being. If, then,
by knowing Himself, God knows the universal nature of being, and this not imperfectly, since,
as we have shown, every imperfection is remote from Him, God must know all grades of beings.
Thus, God will have a proper knowledge of things other than Himself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[8] Furthermore, he who knows something perfectly knows all that is in it. But God knows
Himself perfectly. Therefore, He knows all that is in Him according to His active power. But all
things, in their proper forms, are in Him according to His active power, since God is the principle
of every being. Therefore, God has a proper knowledge of all things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[9] Again, he who knows a certain nature knows whether that nature is communicable. He who
did not know that the nature of animal is communicable to many would not know it perfectly.
Now, the divine nature is communicable by likeness. God, therefore, knows in how many modes
there can be something like His essence. But the diversities of forms arise from the fact that
things imitate the divine essence diversely; and so the Philosopher has called a natural form
&#8220;something divine.&#8221; Therefore, God has a knowledge of things in terms of their proper forms.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[10] Moreover, men and other knowing beings know things as distinct from one another in their
multitude. If, then, God does not know things in their distinction, it follows that He is the most
foolish being of all, as He must have been for those who held that God did not know strife, a
thing known to all-an opinion that the Philosopher considers to be untenable in <i>De anima</i> I
[5]and <i>Metaphysics</i> III [4].</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[11] We likewise receive this teaching from the canonic Scriptures. For it is said in Genesis
(1:31): &#8220;And God saw all things that He had made, and they were very good.&#8221; And in Hebrews
(4:13): &#8220;Neither is there any creature invisible in His sight: but all things are naked and open to

they would be added to the divine essence, and thus there would be some accident in God, which
we have shown above to be impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Nor, again, can such intelligible forms be posited as existing in themselves. This is what
Plato, avoiding the above difficulties, seems to have posited by introducing the Ideas. For the
forms of natural things cannot exist without matter, since neither are they understood without
matter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] And, even if this position were held, it would not enable us to posit that God has
understanding of a multitude. For, since the aforementioned forms are outside God&#8217;s essence, if
God could not understand the multitude of things without them, as the perfection of His intellect
requires, it would follow that His perfection in understanding depended on something else, and
consequently so would His perfection in being, since His being is His understanding. The
contrary of this was shown above.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Furthermore, since whatever is outside His essence must be caused by Him, as will be shown
later on it is necessary that, if the aforementioned forms are to be found outside God, they must
be caused by Him. But God is the cause of things through His intellect, as will be shown later on.
Therefore, so that these intelligibles may have existence, it is required according to the order of
nature that God first understand them. Hence, God does not have knowledge of multitude by the
fact that many intelligibles are found outside Him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Furthermore, the intelligible in act is the intellect in act, just as the sensible in act is the sense
in act. According as the intelligible is distinguished from the intellect, both are in potency, as
likewise appears in the case of the sense. For neither the sight is seeing in act, nor is the visible
object seen in act, except when the sight is informed by the species of the visible object, so that
thereby from the sight and the object something one results. If, then, the intelligible objects of
God are outside His intellect, it will follow that His intellect is in potency, as are also its
intelligible objects. Thus, some cause reducing them to act would be needed, which is
impossible, since there is nothing prior to God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] Then, too, the understood must be in him who understands. Therefore, to posit the forms of
things as existing in themselves outside the divine intellect does not suffice for God to
understand a multitude of things; these intelligibles must be in the divine intellect itself.</p>
<A NAME="52"><p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[8] [Chapter 52] From the same arguments it likewise appears that the multitude of the
aforementioned intelligibles cannot reside in any intellect other than the divine intellect&#8212;for
example, that of a soul or an angel or intelligence. If this were true, the divine intellect would
depend on a lower intellect for some operation. But this is impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[9] Then, too, just as self-subsisting things are from God, so is whatever inheres in them. Hence,
the divine understanding, by which God is a cause, is a prerequisite for the being of the
aforementioned intelligibles in some lower intellect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[10] It likewise follows that the divine intellect is in potency, since its intelligible objects are not
joined to it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[11] Furthermore, just as each thing has its own being, so it has its own operation. It cannot
happen, then, that because some intellect is disposed for operation another intellect will perform
an intellectual operation; rather, the very same intellect in which the disposition is present will
do this, just as each thing is through its own essence, not through the essence of another.
Therefore, by the fact that there are many intelligible objects in some secondary intellect it could
not come about that the first intellect knows a multitude.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THE SOLUTION OF THE ABOVE DIFFICULTY</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] We can solve the above difficulty with ease if we examine diligently how the things that are
understood by the intellect exist within the intellect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] So far as it is possible, let us proceed from our intellect to the knowledge that the divine
intellect has. Let us consider the fact that an external thing understood by us does not exist in our
intellect according to its own nature; rather, it is necessary that its species be in our intellect, and
through this species the intellect comes to be in act. Once in act through this species as through
its own form, the intellect knows the thing itself. This is not to be understood in the sense that
the act itself of understanding is an action proceeding to the thing understood, as heating
proceeds to the heated thing. Understanding remains in the one understanding, but it is related
to the thing understood because the abovementioned species, which is a principle of intellectual
operation as a form, is the likeness of the thing understood.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] We must further consider that the intellect, having been informed by the species of the thing,
by an act of understanding forms within itself a certain intention of the thing understood, that is
to say, its notion, which the definition signifies. This is a necessary point, because the intellect
understands a present and an absent thing indifferently. In this the imagination agrees with the
intellect. But the intellect has this characteristic in addition, namely, that it understands a thing
as separated from material conditions, without which a thing does not exist in reality. But this
could not take place unless the intellect formed the abovementioned intention for itself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Now, since this understood intention is, as it were, a terminus of intelligible operation, it is
distinct from the intelligible species that actualizes the intellect, and that we must consider the
principle of intellectual operation, though both are a likeness of the thing understood. For, by the
fact that the intelligible species, which is the form of the intellect and the principle of
understanding, is the likeness of the external thing, it follows that the intellect forms an intention
like that thing, since such as a thing is, such are its works. And because the understood intention
is like some thing, it follows that the intellect, by forming such an intention) knows that thing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Now, the divine intellect understands by no species other than the divine essence, as was
shown above. Nevertheless, the divine essence is the likeness of all things. Thereby it follows
that the conception of the divine intellect as understanding itself, which is its Word, is the
likeness not only of God Himself understood, but also of all those things of which the divine
essence is the likeness. In this way, therefore, through one intelligible species, which is the divine
essence, and through one understood intention, which is the divine Word, God can understand
many things.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">HOW THE DIVINE ESSENCE, BEING ONE AND SIMPLE, IS THE PROPER LIKENESS OF ALL INTELLIGIBLE OBJECTS</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] But, again, it can seem to someone difficult or impossible that one and the same simple being,
the divine essence for example, is the proper model or likeness of diverse things. For, since
among diverse things there is a distinction by reason of their proper forms, whatever is like
something according to its proper form must turn out to be unlike something else. To be sure,
according as diverse things have something in common, nothing prevents them from having one
likeness, as do man and a donkey so far as they are animals. But from this it will follow that God
does not have a proper knowledge of things, but a common one; for the operation that knowledge
is follows the mode in which the likeness of the known is in the knower. So, too, heating is
according to the mode of the heat. For the likeness of the known in the knower is as the form by
which the operation takes place. Therefore, if God has a proper knowledge of many things, He
must be the proper model of singulars. How this may be we must investigate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] As the Philosopher says in <i>Metaphysics</i> VIII [3], the forms of things and the definitions that
signify them are like numbers. Among numbers, the addition or subtraction of unity changes the
species of a number, as appears in the numbers two and three. It is the same among definitions:
the addition or subtraction of one difference changes the species. For sensible substance, with
the difference rational taken away and added, differs in species.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Now, with reference to things that contain a multitude, the intellect and nature are differently
disposed. For what is required for the being of something the nature of that thing does not permit
to be removed. For the nature of an animal will not survive if the soul is taken away from the
body. But what is joined in reality the intellect can at times receive separately, when one of the
elements is not included in the notion of the other. Thus, in the number three the intellect can
consider the number two only, and in the rational animal it can consider that which is sensible
only. Hence, that which contains several elements the intellect can take as the proper notion of
the several elements by apprehending one of them without the others. It can, for example, take
the number ten as the proper notion of nine by subtracting unity, and similarly as the proper
notion of each of the numbers included under it. So, too, it can take in man the proper exemplar
of irrational animal as such, and of each of its species, except that they would add some positive
differences. On this account a certain philosopher, Clement by name, said that the nobler beings
in reality are the exemplars of the less noble [cf. Pseudo-Dionysius, <i>De div. nom.</i> V, 9].</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] But the divine essence comprehends within itself the nobilities of all beings, not indeed
compositely, but, as we have shown above, according to the mode of perfection. Now, every
form, both proper and common, considered as positing something, is a certain perfection; it
includes imperfection only to the extent that it falls short of true being. The intellect of God,
therefore, can comprehend in His essence that which is proper to each thing by understanding
wherein the divine essence is being imitated and wherein each thing falls short of its perfection.
Thus, by understanding His essence as imitable in the mode of life and not of knowledge, God
has the proper form of a plant; and if He knows His essence as imitable in the mode of
knowledge and not of intellect, God has the proper form of animal, and so forth. Thus, it is clear
that, being absolutely perfect, the divine essence can be taken as the proper exemplar of
singulars. Through it, therefore, God can have a proper knowledge of all things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Since, however, the proper exemplar of one thing is distinguished from the proper exemplar
of another thing, and distinction is the source of plurality, we must observe in the divine intellect
a certain distinction and plurality of understood exemplars, according as that which is in the
divine intellect is the proper exemplar of diverse things. Hence, since this obtains according as
God understands the proper relation of resemblance that each creature has to Him, it remains that
the exemplars of things in the divine intellect are many or distinct only according as God knows
that things can be made to resemble Him by many and diverse modes. In accord with this,
Augustine says that God made man and a horse by distinct exemplars. He also says that the
exemplars of things are a plurality in the divine mind. This conclusion likewise saves to some
extent the opinion of Plato and his doctrine of Ideas, according to which would be formed
everything that is found among material things.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THAT GOD UNDERSTANDS ALL THINGS TOGETHER</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] From this it is further apparent that God understands all things together.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] Our intellect cannot understand in act many things together. The reason is that, since &#8220;the
intellect in act is its object in act,&#8221; if the intellect did understand many things together, it would
follow that the intellect would be at one and the same time many things according to one
genus&#8212;which is impossible. I say &#8220;according to one genus&#8221; because nothing prevents the same
subject from being informed by diverse forms of diverse genera, just as the same body is figured
and colored. Now, the intelligible species, by which the intellect is formed so as to be the objects
that are understood in act, all belong to one genus; for they have one manner of being in the order
of intelligible being, even though the things whose species they are do not have one manner of
being. Hence, the species are not contrary through the contrariety of the things that are outside
the soul. It is in this way that, when certain things that are many are considered as in any way
united, they are understood together. For the intellect understands a continuous whole all at once,
not part after part. So, too, it understands a proposition all at once, not first the subject and then
the predicate, since it knows all the parts according to one species of the whole.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] From these remarks we can infer that, whenever several things are known through one
species, they can be known together. But all that God knows He knows through one species,
which is His essence. Therefore, God can understand all things together.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Again, a knowing power does not know anything in act unless the intention be present. Thus,
the phantasms preserved in the organ are not always actually imagined because the intention is
not directed to them. For among voluntary agents the appetite moves the other powers to act. We
do not understand together, therefore, many things to which the intention is not directed at the
same time. But things that must fall under one intention must be understood together; for he who
is considering a comparison between two things directs his intention to both and sees both
together.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Now, all the things that are in the divine knowledge must fall under one intention. For God
intends to see His essence perfectly, which is to see it according to its whole power, under which
are contained all things. Therefore God, by seeing His essence, sees all things together.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Furthermore, the intellect of one considering successively many things cannot have only one
operation. For since operations differ according to their objects, the operation by which the first
is considered must be different from the operation by which the second is considered. But the
divine intellect has only one operation, namely, the divine essence, as we have proved. Therefore,
God considers all that He knows, not successively, but together.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] Moreover, succession cannot be understood without time nor time without motion, since time
is &#8220;the number of motion according to before and after.&#8221; But there can be no motion in God, as
may be inferred from what we have said. There is, therefore, no succession in the divine
consideration. Thus, all that He knows God considers together.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[8] Then, too, God&#8217;s understanding is His being, as is clear from what we have said. But there
is no before and after in the divine being; everything is together, as was shown above. Neither,
therefore, does the consideration of God contain a before and after, but, rather, understands all
things together.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[9] Every intellect, furthermore, that understands one thing after the other is at one time
potentially understanding and at another time actually understanding. For while it understands
the first thing actually it understands the second thing potentially. But the divine intellect is never
potentially, but always actually, understanding. Therefore, it does not understand things
successively but rather understands them together.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[10] Sacred Scripture bears witness to this truth. For it is written: &#8220;With God there is no change
nor shadow of alteration&#8221; (James 1:17).</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THAT GOD&#8217;S KNOWLEDGE IS NOT HABITUAL</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] From this it appears that there is no habitual knowledge in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] Where there is habitual knowledge, not all things are known together; some are known
actually, and some habitually. But, as we have proved, God has actual understanding of all things
together. There is, therefore, no habitual knowledge in Him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Furthermore, he who has a habit and is not using it is in a manner in potency, though
otherwise than prior to understanding. But we have shown that the divine intellect is in no way
in potency. In no way, therefore, is there habitual knowledge in it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Moreover, if an intellect knows something habitually, its essence is other than its intellectual
operation, which is the consideration itself. For an intellect that knows habitually is lacking its
operation, but its essence cannot be lacking to it. In God, however, as we have proved, His
essence is His operation. There is, therefore, no habitual knowledge in His intellect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Again, an intellect that knows only habitually is not at its highest perfection. That is why
happiness, which is something best, is posited in terms of act, not in terms of habit. If, therefore,
God is habitually knowing through His substance, considered in His substance He will not be
universally perfect. We have shown the contrary of this conclusion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] It has also been shown that God understands through His essence, but not through any
intelligible species added to His essence. Now, every habitual intellect understands through some
species. For either a habit confers on the intellect a certain ability to receive the intelligible
species by which it becomes understanding in act, or else it is the ordered aggregate of the species
themselves existing in the intellect, not according to a complete act, but in a way intermediate
between potency and act. There is therefore no habitual knowledge in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] Then, again, a habit is a certain quality. But no quality or accident can be added to God, as
we have proved. Habitual knowledge, therefore, does not befit God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[8] But because the disposition by which one is only habitually considering or willing or doing
is likened to the disposition of one sleeping, hence it is that, in order to remove any habitual
disposition from God, David says: &#8220;Behold He neither slumbers nor sleeps, who keeps Israel&#8221;
(Ps. 120:4). Hence, also, what is said in Sirach (23:28): &#8220;The eyes of the Lord are far brighter
than the sun&#8221;; for the sun is always shining.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THAT GOD&#8217;S KNOWLEDGE IS NOT DISCURSIVE</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] We thereby further know that the divine consideration is not ratiocinative or discursive.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] Our consideration is ratiocinative when we proceed from the consideration of one thing to
another, as when in syllogistic reasoning we proceed from principles to conclusions. For, when
someone examines how a conclusion follows from premises and considers both together, he is
not on this account reasoning or discoursing, since this takes place, not by arguing, but by
judging the arguments. So, too, knowledge is not material because it judges material things. Now,
it has been shown that God does not consider one thing after the other as it were in succession,
but all together. His knowledge, therefore, is not ratiocinative or discursive, although He knows
all discourse and ratiocination.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Everyone reasoning sees the principle by one consideration and the conclusions by another.
There would be no need to proceed to conclusions after the consideration of the principles if by
considering the principles we also considered the conclusions. But God knows all things by one
operation, His essence, as we proved above. His knowledge is, therefore, not ratiocinative.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Again, all ratiocinative knowledge contains some potency and some act, for conclusions are
in principles potentially. But in the divine intellect potency has no place, as was proved above.
God&#8217;s intellect, therefore, is not discursive.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Moreover, in all discursive knowledge there must be something caused, since principles are
in a manner the efficient cause of the conclusion. Hence, demonstration is said to be &#8220;a syllogism
making one to know.&#8221; But in the divine knowledge there can be nothing caused, since it is God
Himself, as is clear from what has preceded. God&#8217;s knowledge, therefore, cannot be discursive.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] What is naturally known, furthermore, is known to us without ratiocination. But in God there
can be only natural knowledge, indeed, only essential knowledge; for, as was proved above, His
knowledge is His essence. God&#8217;s knowledge, therefore, is not ratiocinative.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] Again, every motion must be reduced to a first mover that is only mover and not moved. That
from which the first motion originates, therefore, must be an absolutely unmoved mover. This,
as was proved above, is the divine intellect. The divine intellect must, therefore, be an absolutely
unmoved mover. But ratiocination is a certain motion of the intellect proceeding from one thing
to another. Hence, the divine intellect is not ratiocinative.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[8] Then, too, what is highest in us is lower than what is in God, for the lower reaches the higher
only in its own highest part. But what is highest in our knowledge is, not reason, but intellect,
which is the origin of reason. God&#8217;s knowledge, then, is not ratiocinative but solely intellectual.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[9] Moreover, since God is absolutely perfect, as we proved above, every defect must be removed
from Him. But ratiocinative knowledge arises from an imperfection in intellectual nature. For
that which is known through another is less known than what is known through itself; nor is the
nature of the knower sufficient for knowing that which is known through another without that
through which it is made known. But in ratiocinative knowledge something is made known
through another, whereas that which is known intellectually is known through itself, and the
nature of the knower is able to know it without an external means. Hence, it is manifest that
reason is a certain defective intellect. Therefore, the divine knowledge is not ratiocinative.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[10] Furthermore, those things whose species are in the knower are comprehended without
discursive reasoning. For the sight does not proceed discursively to know the stone whose
likeness it possesses. But the divine essence, as was shown above, is the likeness of all things.
Hence, it does not proceed to know something through discursive reasoning.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[11] The solution of those difficulties that seem to introduce discursiveness into the divine
knowledge is likewise at hand. First, because God knows other things through His essence. For
it was shown that this does not take place discursively, since God&#8217;s essence is related to other
things, not as a principle to conclusions, but as a species to things known. Secondly, because
some might think it unbefitting if God were not able to syllogize. For God possesses the
knowledge of syllogizing as one judging, and not as one proceeding by syllogizing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[12] To this truth, which has been rationally proved, Sacred Scripture likewise gives witness. For
it is written: &#8220;And things are naked and open to His sight&#8221; (Heb. 4:13). For what we know by
reasoning is not through itself naked and revealed to us, but is opened and laid bare by reason.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THAT GOD DOES NOT UNDERSTAND BY COMPOSING AND DIVIDING</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] Through the same means we can also show that the divine intellect does not understand in
the manner of a composing and dividing intellect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] For the divine intellect knows all things by knowing its own essence. Now it does not know
its own essence by composing and dividing, since it knows itself as it is and there is no
composition in it. It does not, therefore, know in the manner of a composing and dividing
intellect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Moreover, what is composed and divided by the intellect is of a nature to be considered
separately by it. For there would be no need of composition and division if by apprehending the
essence of a thing we grasped what belonged in it and what did not. If, then, God understood in
the manner of a composing and dividing intellect, it would follow that He did not consider all
things by one intuition but each thing separately. We have shown the contrary of this above.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Furthermore, there can be no before and after in God. But composition and division come
after the consideration of the essence, which is their principle. Hence, composition and division
cannot be found in the operation of the divine intellect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Again, the proper object of the intellect is what a thing is. Hence, in relation to what a thing
is the intellect suffers no deception except by accident, whereas as concerns composition and
division it is deceived. So, too, a sense dealing with its proper sensibles is always true, but in
other cases it is deceived. But in the divine intellect there is nothing accidental, but only that
which is substantial. In the divine intellect, therefore, there is no composition and division, but
only the simple apprehension of a thing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Furthermore, in the case of a proposition formed by a composing and dividing intellect, the
composition itself exists in the intellect, not in the thing that is outside the soul. If the divine
intellect should judge of things in the manner of a composing and dividing intellect, the intellect
itself will be composite. This is impossible, as is clear from what has been said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] Again, the composing and dividing intellect judges diverse things by diverse compositions,
for the composition of the intellect does not exceed the terms of the composition. Hence, the
intellect does not judge the triangle to be a figure by the same composition by which it judges
man to be an animal. Now, composition or division is a certain operation of the intellect. If, then,
God considers things by means of composing and dividing, it will follow that His understanding
is not solely one but many. And thus His essence, as well, will not be solely one, since His
intellectual operation is His essence, as was proved above.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[8] But it is not on this account necessary for us to say that God does not know enunciables. For
His essence, being one and simple, is the exemplar of all manifold and composite things. And
thus God knows through His essence all multitude and composition both of nature and of reason.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[9] With these conclusions the authority of Sacred Scripture is in harmony. For it is said in Isaiah
(55:8): &#8220;For My thoughts are not your thoughts.&#8221; Yet it is said in a Psalm (93:11): &#8220;The Lord
knows the thoughts of men,&#8221; which thoughts evidently proceed through composition and division

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THAT THE TRUTH OF ENUNCIABLES IS NOT EXCLUDED FROM GOD</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] From this it may be seen that, although the knowledge of the divine intellect is not of the sort
belonging to an intellect that composes and divides, truth, which according to the Philosopher
is found only in the composition and division of the intellect [<i>Metaph.</i> V, 4; <i>De anima</i> III, 6], is
yet not excluded from it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] For, since the truth of the intellect is &#8220;the adequation of intellect and thing,&#8221; inasmuch as the
intellect says that what is is and what is not is not, truth belongs to that in the intellect which the
intellect says, not to the operation by which it says it. For the intellect to be true it is not required
that its act of understanding be adequated to the thing known, since the thing is sometimes
material whereas the act of understanding is immaterial. Rather, what the intellect in
understanding says and knows must be adequated to the thing, so that, namely, the thing be such
as the intellect says it to be. Now, by His simple understanding, in which there is no composition
and division, God knows not only the quiddities of things but also enunciations, as has been
shown. Hence, that which the divine intellect says in understanding is composition and division.
Therefore, truth is not excluded from the divine intellect by reason of its simplicity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] When the incomplex is said or understood, the incomplex, of itself, is neither equated to a
thing nor unequal to it. For equality and inequality are by relation, whereas the incomplex, of
itself, does not imply any relation or application to a thing. Hence, of itself, it can be said to be
neither true nor false; but the complex can, in which the relation of the incomplex to a thing is
designated by a sign of composition or division. Nevertheless, the incomplex intellect in
understanding what a thing is apprehends the quiddity of a thing in a certain relation to the thing,
because it apprehends it as the quiddity of that thing. Hence although the incomplex itself, or
even a definition, is not in itself true or false, nevertheless the intellect that apprehends what a
thing is is always said to be through itself true, as appears in <i>De anima</i> III [6], although it can be
by accident false, in so far as a definition includes some composition either of the parts of a
definition with one another or of the whole definition with the thing defined. Hence, according
as the definition is understood to be the definition of this or that thing, as it is received by the
intellect, it will be called absolutely false if the parts of the definition do not belong together, as
if we should say <i>insensible animal</i>; or it will be called false with reference to a given thing, as
when the definition of a circle is taken as that of a triangle. Given, therefore, by an impossible
supposition, that the divine intellect knew only incomplexes, it would still be true in knowing
its own quiddity as its own.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Again, the divine simplicity does not exclude perfection, because it possesses in its simple
being whatever of perfection is found in other things through a certain aggregation of perfections
or forms, as was shown above. But in apprehending incomplexes, our intellect does not yet reach
its ultimate perfection, because it is still in potency to composition or division. So, too, among
natural things, the simple are in potency with reference to the mixed, and the parts with reference
to the whole. According to His simple understanding, therefore, God has that perfection of
knowledge that our intellect has through both knowledges, that of complexes and that of
incomplexes. But our intellect reaches truth in its perfect knowledge, that is to say, when it
already has arrived at composition. Therefore, in the simple understanding of God as well there
is truth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Again, since God is the good of every good, as having every goodness in Himself, as has been
shown above, the goodness of the intellect cannot be lacking to Him. But the true is the good of
the intellect, as appears from the Philosopher [<i>Ethics</i> VI, 2]. Therefore, truth is in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] And this is what is said in a Psalm: &#8220;But God is true&#8221; (Rom. 3:4).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] From the foregoing it is evident that God Himself is truth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] Truth is a certain perfection of understanding or of intellectual operation, as has been said.
But the understanding of God is His substance. Furthermore, since this understanding is, as we
have shown, the divine being, it is not perfected through any superadded perfection; it is perfect
through itself, in the same manner as we have shown of the divine being. It remains, therefore,
that the divine substance is truth itself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Again, according to the Philosopher, truth is a certain goodness of the intellect. But God is
His own goodness, as we have shown above. Therefore, He is likewise His own truth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Furthermore, nothing can be said of God by participation, since He is His own being, which
participates in nothing. But, as was shown above, there is truth in God. If, then, it is not said by
participation, it must be said essentially. Therefore, God is His truth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Moreover, although, according to the Philosopher, the true is properly not in things but in the
mind, a thing is at times said to be true when it reaches in a proper way the act of its own nature.
Hence, Avicenna says in his <i>Metaphysics</i> that &#8220;the truth of a thing is the property of the being
established in each thing&#8221; [VIII, 6]. This is so in so far as each thing is of a nature to give a true
account of itself and in so far as it imitates the model of itself which is in the divine mind. But
God is His essence. Therefore, whether we speak of the truth of the intellect or of the truth of a
thing, God is His truth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] This is confirmed by the authority of our Lord, Who says of Himself: &#8220;I am the way, and the
truth, and the life&#8221; (John 14:6).</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THAT GOD IS THE PUREST TRUTH</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] It is clear from this demonstration that in God there is pure truth, with which no falsity or
deception can be mingled.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] For truth is not compatible with falsity, as neither is whiteness with blackness. But God is not
only true, He is truth itself. Therefore, there can be no falsity in Him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Moreover, the intellect is not deceived in knowing what a thing is, just as the sense is not
deceived in its proper sensible. But, as we have shown, all the knowledge of the divine intellect
is in the manner of an intellect knowing what a thing is. It is impossible, therefore, that there be
error or deception or falsity in the divine knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Furthermore, the intellect does not err in the case of first principles; it errs at times in the case
of conclusions at which it arrives by reasoning from first principles. But the divine intellect, as
we have shown above, is not ratiocinative or discursive. Therefore, there cannot be falsity or
deception in it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Again, the higher a knowing power, so much the more universal is its proper object,
containing several objects under it. Thus, that which sight knows by accident the common sense
or the imagination apprehends as contained under its proper object. But the power of the divine
intellect is at the very peak of elevation in knowing. Hence, all knowable objects are related to
it as knowable properly ,and essentially and not by accident. In such cases, however, the knowing
power does not err. Therefore, the divine intellect cannot err in the case of any knowable object.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Moreover, intellectual virtue is a certain perfection of the intellect in knowing. But according
to intellectual virtue no intellect expresses what is false, but always what is true; for to speak the
true is the good of the act of the intellect, and it belongs to virtue &#8220;to make an act good.&#8221; But the
divine intellect, being at the peak of perfection, is more perfect through its nature than the human
intellect is through the habit of virtue. It remains, therefore, that there cannot be falsity in the
divine intellect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] Furthermore, the knowledge of the human intellect is in a manner caused by things. Hence
it is that knowable things are the measure of human knowledge; for something that is judged to
be so by the intellect is true because it is so in reality, and not conversely. But the divine intellect
through its knowledge is the cause of things. Hence, its knowledge is the measure of things, in
the same way as an art is the measure of artifacts, each one of which is perfect in so far as it
agrees with the art. The divine intellect, therefore, is related to things as things are related to the
human intellect. But the falsity that is caused by the lack of equality between the human intellect
and a thing is not in reality but in the intellect. If, therefore, there were no adequation whatever
of the divine intellect to things, the falsity would be found in things and not in the divine
intellect. Nevertheless, there is no falsity in things, because, so far as each thing has being, to that
extent does it have truth. There is, therefore, no inequality between the divine intellect and things,
nor can there be any falsity in the divine intellect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[8] Again, as the true is the good of the intellect, so the false is its evil. For we naturally seek to
know the truth and flee from being deceived by the false. But, as we have proved, there can be
no evil in God. Hence, there can be no falsity in Him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[9] Hence it is written: &#8220;But God is true&#8221; (Rom. 3:4); and in Numbers (23:19): &#8220;God is not a
man, that He should lie&#8221;; and in John (I, 1:5): &#8220;God is light, and in Him there is no darkness.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] From what we have shown it clearly results that the divine truth is the first and highest truth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] As is clear from the Philosopher, things are disposed in truth as they are disposed in being.
The reason for this is that the true and being follow one another; for the true then exists when that
which is is said to be and that which is not is said not to be. But the divine being is first and most
perfect. Therefore, its truth is the first and highest truth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Again, what belongs to a thing essentially belongs to it most perfectly. But, as we have
shown, truth is said of God essentially. Therefore, His truth is the highest and first truth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Furthermore, there is truth in our intellect because it is adequated to the thing that the intellect
understands. But, as can be seen in <i>Metaphysics</i> V [15], unity is the cause of equality. Since,
then, in the divine intellect the intellect and that which it understands are absolutely one, its truth
is the first and highest truth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Moreover, that which is the measure in any given genus is most perfect in that genus. That
is why all colors are measured by white. But the divine truth is the measure of all truth. For the
truth of our intellect is measured by the thing outside the soul, since our intellect is said to be true
because it is in agreement with the thing that it knows. On the other hand, the truth of a thing is
measured by the divine intellect, which is the cause of things, as will later on be proved. In the
same way, the truth of artifacts comes from the art of the artisan, for a chest is then true when it
agrees with its art. And since God is the first intellect and the first intelligible, the truth of any
given intellect must be measured by the truth of His intellect&#8212;if, as the Philosopher teaches,
each thing is measured by that which is first in its genus. The divine truth, therefore, is the first,
highest, and most perfect truth.</p>

<A NAME="63"><p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">Chapter 63</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THE ARGUMENTS OF THOSE WHO WISH TO TAKE AWAY THE KNOWLEDGE OF SINGULARS FROM GOD</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] Now, there are certain persons who are trying to take away the knowledge of singulars from
the perfection of the divine knowledge. They use seven ways to confirm their position.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] The first way is based on the very condition of singularity. For the principle of singularity is
designated matter, and hence it seems that singulars cannot be known by any immaterial power,
given that all knowledge takes place through a certain assimilation. So, too, in our own case only
those powers apprehend singulars that make use of material organs, for example, the imagination,
the senses, and the like. But because it is immaterial, our intellect does not know singulars. Much
less, therefore, does the divine intellect know singulars, being the most removed from matter.
Thus, in no way does it seem that God can know singulars.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] The second way is based on the fact that singulars do not always exist. Therefore, either they
will be known by God always, or they will be known at some time and not at another. The first
alternative is impossible, since of that which does not exist there can be no knowledge;
knowledge deals only with what is true, and what does not exist cannot be true. Nor is the second
alternative possible, since, as we have shown, the knowledge of the divine intellect is absolutely
unchangeable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] The third way is based on the fact that not all singulars come to be of necessity but some
happen contingently. Hence, there can be a certain knowledge of them only when they exist.
Now, that knowledge is certain which cannot be deceived. But all knowledge of the contingent
can be deceived when the contingent is future, since the opposite of what is held by knowledge
can happen; for, if it could not happen, it would then be necessary. Hence it is that we cannot
have any knowledge of future contingents, but only a certain conjectural estimation. Now, we
must suppose that all God&#8217;s knowledge is, as we have shown, most certain and infallible. And
because of His immutability, as we have said, it is impossible for God to begin to know
something anew. From all this it seems to follow that God does not know contingent singulars.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] The fourth way is based on the fact that the will is the cause of some singulars. Before it
exists, an effect can be known only in its cause, since, before it begins to be, this is the only way
for an effect to exist. But the motions of the will can be known with certitude only by the one
willing, in whose power they lie. It seems impossible, therefore, that God should have an eternal
knowledge of such singulars as are caused by the will.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] The fifth way is based on the infinity of singulars. The infinite as such is unknown.
Everything that is known is in a manner measured by the comprehension of the knower, since
this &#8220;measure&#8221; is nothing other than a certain certification of the measured thing. That is why
every art repudiates the infinite. But singulars are infinite, at least potentially. It seems
impossible, then, that God knows singulars.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] The sixth way is based on the very lowliness of singulars. Since the dignity of a science is in
a way determined from the dignity of its object, the lowliness of the knowable object likewise
seems to redound to the lowliness of the science. But the divine intellect is most noble. Its
nobility, therefore, forbids that it should know certain of the lowliest among singulars.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[8] The seventh way is based on the evil found in some singulars. For, since that which is known
is found in the knower in a certain way, and there can be no evil in God, as was shown abovc,
it seems to follow that God has absolutely no knowledge of evil and privation. This is known
only by an intellect that is in potency, for privation can exist only in potency. From this it follows
that God has no knowledge of the singulars in which there is evil and privation.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] To remove this error, and likewise to show the perfection of the divine knowledge, we must
diligently look into the truth of each of the above ways, so that what is opposed to the truth may
be refuted. We shall first show, then, that the divine intellect knows singulars. Second, we shall
show that it knows what does not exist in act. Third, that it knows future contingents with an
infallible knowledge. Fourth, that it knows the motions of the will. Fifth, that it knows infinite
things. Sixth, that it knows every lowly and least thing among beings. Seventh, that it knows
evils and all privations and defects.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THAT GOD KNOWS SINGULARS</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] We shall therefore first show that the knowledge of singulars cannot be lacking to God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] It was shown above that God knows other things in so far as He is their cause. Now, singular
things are God's effects. God causes things in so far as He makes them to be in act. Universals,
on the other hand, are not subsisting things, but rather have being only in singulars, as is proved
in <i>Metaphysics</i> VII [13]. God, therefore, knows things other than Himself, not only universally,
but also in the singular.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Again, by knowing the principles of which the essence of a thing is composed, we necessarily
know that thing itself. Thus, by knowing a rational soul and a certain sort of body, we know man.
Now, the singular essence is composed of designated matter and individuated form. Thus, the
essence of Socrates is composed of this body and this soul, just as the universal essence of man
is composed of soul and body, as may be seen in <i>Metaphysics</i> VII [10]. Hence, just as the latter
principles fall within the definition of universal man, so the former principles would fall in the
definition of Socrates if he could be defined. Hence, whoever has a knowledge of matter and of
what designates matter, and also of form individuated in matter, must have a knowledge of the
singular. But the knowledge of Cod extends to matter and to individuating accidents and forms.
For, since His understanding is His essence, He must understand all things that in any way are
in His essence. Now, within His essence, as within the first source, there are virtually present all
things that in any way have being, since He is the first and universal principle of being. Matter
and accidents are not absent from among these things, since matter is a being in potency and an
accident is a being in another. Therefore, the knowledge of singulars is not lacking to God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Moreover, the nature of a genus cannot be known perfectly unless its first differences and
proper attributes are known. The nature of number would not be known perfectly if the even and
the odd were not known. But universal and singular are differences or essential attributes of
being. If, then, in knowing His essence God knows perfectly the common nature of being, He
must know the universal and the singular perfectly. But, just as He would not know the universal
perfectly if He knew the intention of universality and did not know the universal reality, for
example, man or animal, so He would not know the singular perfectly if He knew the nature of
singularity and did not know this or that singular. Therefore, God must know singular things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Furthermore, just as God is His being, so, as we have shown, He is His knowing. Now, since
He is His being, all the perfections of being must be found in Him as in the first origin of being,
as was shown above. Therefore, there must be found in His knowledge, as in the first source of
knowledge, the perfection of all knowledge. But this would not be so if the knowledge of
singulars were lacking to Him; for the perfection of some knowers consists in this knowledge.
Therefore, it is impossible for God not to have a knowledge of singulars.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Furthermore, among all ordered powers it is commonly found that the higher power, though
one, extends to several things, whereas a lower power extends to fewer things and is nevertheless
multiplied by its relation to them. This happens in the case of the imagination and the sense. The
one power of the imagination extends to all the things that the five powers of the senses know,
and to more besides. But the knowing power in God is higher than it is in man. Therefore,
whatever man knows by means of diverse powers, namely, the intellect, the imagination, and the
sense, this God considers by His one simple intellect. God, therefore, knows the singulars that
we apprehend by the sense and the imagination.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] Moreover, the divine intellect does not gather its knowledge from things, as ours does; rather,
as will be shown later on, it is through its knowledge the cause of things. The knowledge that the
divine intellect has of other things is after the manner of practical knowledge. Now, practical
knowledge is not perfect unless it reaches to singulars. For the end of practical knowledge is
operation, which belongs to the domain of singulars. Therefore, the knowledge that God has of
other things extends to singulars.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[8] Furthermore, as was shown above, the first movable is moved by a mover moving through
intellect and appetite. Now, a mover could not cause motion through his intellect unless he
moved the movable in so far as it is of a nature to be moved in place. But this is true of the
movable in so far as it is here and now, and consequently in so far as it is singular. Therefore, the
intellect that is the mover of the first movable knows the first movable in so far as it is singular.
Now, this mover is either held to be God, in which case we have made our point, or it is held to
be some being below God. But, if the intellect of such a being can by its power know the
singular, which our intellect cannot, all the more will the intellect of God be able to do this.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[9] Again, the agent is more noble than the patient or thing acted upon, as act is more noble than
potency. Hence, a form of a lower grade cannot by acting extend its likeness to a higher grade;
rather, the higher form by acting can extend its likeness to a lower grade. Thus, from the
incorruptible powers of the stars there are produced corruptible forms among sublunary things;
but a corruptible power cannot produce an incorruptible form. Now, all knowledge takes place
through the assimilation of the knower and the known. There is this difference, however, that the
assimilation in human knowledge takes place through the action of sensible things on man&#8217;s
knowing powers, whereas in the case of God&#8217;s knowledge the assimilation takes place
contrariwise through the action of the forms of the divine intellect on the things known. Hence,
since the form of the sensible thing is individuated through its materiality, it cannot extend the
likeness of its singularity so that it be absolutely immaterial. It can extend its likeness to the level
of the powers that use material organs; it reaches the intellect only through the power of the agent
intellect in so far as it is completely divested of the conditions of matter. Thus, the likeness of
the singularity of a sensible form cannot reach up to the human intellect. But the likeness of a
form in the divine intellect, by reaching to the least of things to which its causality reaches,
extends to the singularity of the sensible and material form. The divine intellect, therefore, can
know singulars, but not the human intellect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[10] Then, too, if God does not know singulars which even men know, there would follow the
difficulty that the Philosopher raises against Empedocles, namely, that God is the most foolish
of beings [<i>De anima</i> I, 5; <i>Metaph.</i> III, 4].</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[11] This truth that we have proved is likewise strengthened by the authority of Sacred Scripture.
For it is said in Hebrews (4:13): &#8220;Neither is there any creature invisible in His sight.&#8221; The
contrary error likewise is removed by Sirach (16:16): &#8220;Do not say: I shall be hidden from God,
and who shall remember me from on high?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[12] It is also clear from what has been said how the objection to the contrary does not conclude
properly. For, although that by which the divine intellect understands is immaterial, it is
nevertheless the likeness of both form and matter, being the first productive principle of both.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] As is clear from what we have said above, the relation of the divine knowledge to the things
known is the same as the relation of the things that we know to our knowledge. Now, the relation
of a thing known to our knowledge is this, namely, that the known thing can exist without our
having a knowledge of it, as Aristotle illustrates of the squaring of a circle; but the converse is
not true. The relation of the divine knowledge to other things, therefore, win be such that it can
be even of non-existing things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Again, the knowledge of the divine intellect is to other things as the knowledge of an artisan
to artifacts, since through His knowledge God is the cause of things. Now, the artisan knows
through his art even those things that have not yet been fashioned, since the forms of his art flow
from his knowledge to external matter for the constitution of the artifacts. Hence, nothing forbids
that there be in the knowledge of an artisan forms that have not yet come out of it. Thus, nothing
forbids God to have knowledge of the things that are not.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Furthermore, through His essence God knows things other than Himself in so far as His
essence is the likeness of the things that proceed from Him. This is clear from what we have said.
But since, as was shown above, the essence of God is of an infinite perfection, whereas every
other thing has a limited being and perfection, it is impossible that the universe of things other
than God equal the perfection of the divine essence. Hence, its power of representation extends
to many more things than to those that are. Therefore, if God knows completely the power and
perfection of His essence, His knowledge extends not only to the things that are but also to the
things that are not.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Moreover, by that operation through which it knows what a thing is our intellect can know
even those things that do not actually exist. It can comprehend the essence of a lion or a horse
even though all such animals were to be destroyed. But the divine intellect knows, in the manner
of one knowing what a thing is, not only definitions but also enunciables, as is clear from what
we have said. Therefore, it can know even the things that are not.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Furthermore, an effect can be pre-known in its cause even before it exists. Thus, an
astronomer pre-knows a future eclipse from a consideration of the order of the heavenly motions.
But God knows all things through a cause; for, by knowing Himself, Who is the cause of other
things, He knows other things as His effects, as was shown above. Nothing, therefore, prevents
God from knowing even the things that are not.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] Moreover, God&#8217;s understanding has no succession, as neither does His being. He is therefore
an ever-abiding simultaneous whole-which belongs to the nature of eternity. On the other hand,
the duration of time is stretched out through the succession of the before and after. Hence, the
proportion of eternity to the total duration of time is as the proportion of the indivisible to
something continuous; not, indeed, of that indivisible that is the terminus of a continuum, which
is not present to every part of a continuum (the instant of time bears a likeness to such an
indivisible), but of that indivisible which is outside a continuum and which nevertheless co-exists
with any given part of a continuum or with a determinate point in the continuum. For, since time
lies within motion, eternity, which is completely outside motion, in no way belongs to time.
Furthermore, since the being of what is eternal does not pass away, eternity is present in its
presentiality to any time or instant of time. We may see an example of sorts in the case of a
circle. Let us consider a determined point on the circumference of a circle. Although it is
indivisible, it does not co-exist simultaneously with any other point as to position, since it is the
order of position that produces the continuity of the circumference. On the other hand, the center
of the circle, which is no part of the circumference, is directly opposed to any given determinate
point on the circumference. Hence, whatever is found in any part of time coexists with what is
eternal as being present to it, although with respect to some other time it be past or future.
Something can be present to what is eternal only by being present to the whole of it, since the
eternal does not have the duration of succession. The divine intellect, therefore, sees in the whole
of its eternity, as being present to it, whatever takes place through the whole course of time. And
yet what takes place in a certain part of time was not always existent. It remains, therefore, that
God has a knowledge of those things that according to the march of time do not yet exist.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[8] Through these arguments it appears that God has a knowledge of non-being. But not all non-beings have the same relation to His knowledge. For those things that are not, nor will be, nor
ever were, are known by God as possible to His power. Hence, God does not know them as in
some way existing in themselves, but as existing only in the divine power. These are said by
some to be known by God according to a knowledge of simple understanding. The things that
are present, past, or future to us God knows in His power, in their proper causes, and in
themselves. The knowledge of such things is said to be a knowledge of vision. For of the things
that for us are not yet God sees not only the being that they have in their causes but also the being
that they have in themselves, in so far as His eternity is present in its indivisibility to all time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[9] Nevertheless, whatever being a thing has God knows through His essence. For His essence
can be represented by many things that are not, nor will be, nor ever were. His essence is likewise
the likeness of the power of every cause, through which effects pre-exist in their causes. And the
being that each thing has in itself comes from the divine essence as from its exemplary source.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[10] Thus, therefore, God knows non-beings in so far as in some way they have being, namely,
in His power, or in their causes, or in themselves. This is not incompatible with the nature of
knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[11] The authority of Sacred Scripture likewise offers witness to what has preceded. For it is said
in Sirach (23:29): &#8220;For all things were known to the Lord God before they were created: so also
after they were perfected He beholds all things.&#8221; And in Jeremias (1:5): &#8220;Before I formed you in
the bowels of your mother I knew you.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[12] It is also clear from what has preceded that we are not forced to say, as some said, that God
knows singulars universally because He knows them only in universal causes, just as one would
know a particular eclipse not in itself but as it arises from the position of the stars. For we have
shown that the divine knowledge extends to singulars in so far as they are in themselves.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.125in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">&#160;</p>
<A NAME="67"><p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">Chapter 67</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THAT GOD KNOWS FUTURE CONTINGENT SINGULARS</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] From this we can begin to understand somewhat that God had from eternity an infallible
knowledge of contingent singulars, and yet they do not cease to be contingent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] The contingent is opposed to the certitude of knowledge only so far as it is future, not so far
as it is present. For when the contingent is future, it can not-be. Thus, the knowledge of one
conjecturing that it will be can be mistaken: it will be mistaken if what he conjectures as future
will not take place. But in so far as the contingent is present, in that time it cannot not-be. It can
not-be in the future, but this affects the contingent not so far as it is present but so far as it is
future. Thus, nothing is lost to the certitude of sense when someone sees a man running, even
though this judgment is contingent. All knowledge, therefore, that bears on something contingent
as present can be certain. But the vision of the divine intellect from all eternity is directed to each
of the things that take place in the course of time, in so far as it is present, as shown above. It
remains, therefore, that nothing prevents God from having from all eternity an infallible
knowledge of contingents.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Again, the contingent differs from the necessary according to the way each of them is found
in its cause. The contingent is in its cause in such a way that it can both not-be and be from it;
but the necessary can only be from its cause. But according to the way both of them are in
themselves, they do not differ as to being, upon which the true is founded. For, according as it
is in itself, the contingent cannot be and not-be, it can only be, even though in the future it can
not-be. Now, the divine intellect from all eternity knows things not only according to the being
that they have in their causes, but also according to the being that they have in themselves.
Therefore, nothing prevents the divine intellect from having an eternal and infallible knowledge
of contingents.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Moreover, just as from a necessary cause an effect follows with certitude, so it follows from
a complete contingent cause if it be not impeded. But since, as appears from what was said
above, God knows all things, He knows not only the causes of contingent things but also those
things by which these causes may be impeded. Therefore, He knows with certitude whether
contingent things are or are not.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Furthermore, an effect cannot exceed the perfection of its cause, though sometime it falls
short of it. Hence, since our knowledge comes to us from things, it happens at times that we
know what is necessary not according to the mode of necessity but according to that of
probability. Now, just as in us things are the cause of knowledge, so the divine knowledge is the
cause of the things known. Therefore, nothing prevents those things from being contingent in
themselves of which God has a necessary knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Again, an effect whose cause is contingent cannot be a necessary one; otherwise, the effect
could be even though the cause were removed. Now, of the most remote effect there is both a
proximate and a remote cause. If, then, the proximate cause were contingent, its effect would
have to be contingent even though the remote cause is necessary. Thus, plants do not bear fruit
of necessity, even though the motion of the sun is necessary, because the intermediate causes are
contingent. But the knowledge of God, though it is the cause of the things known through it, is
yet a remote cause. Therefore, the contingency of the things known is not in conflict with this
necessity, since it may be that the intermediate causes are contingent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] The knowledge of God, furthermore, would not be true and perfect if things did not happen
in the way in which God knows them to happen. Now, since God knows all being, and is its
source, He knows every effect not only in itself but also in its order to each of its causes. But the
order of contingent things to their proximate causes is that they come forth from these causes in
a contingent way. Hence, God knows that some things are taking place, and this contingently.
Thus, therefore, the certitude and truth of the divine knowledge does not remove the contingency
of things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[8] From what has been said, it is therefore clear bow the objection impugning a knowledge of
contingents in God is to be repulsed. For change in that which comes later does not induce
change in that which has preceded; for it is possible that from prime necessary causes there
proceed ultimate contingent effects. Now, the things that are known by God are not prior to His
knowledge, as is the case with us, but, rather, subsequent to it. It does not therefore follow that,
if something known by God can change, His knowledge of it can be deceived or in any way
changed. We shall be deceived in the consequent therefore, if, because our knowledge of
changeable things is itself changeable, we suppose on this account that such is necessarily the
case in all knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[9] Again, when it is said that God knows or knew this future thing, a certain intermediate point
between the divine knowledge and the thing known is assumed. This is the time when the above
words are spoken, in relation to which time that which is known by God is said to be future. But
this is not future with reference to the divine knowledge, which, abiding in the moment of
eternity, is related to all things as present to them. If with respect to the divine knowledge we
remove from its intermediate position the time when the words are spoken, we cannot say that
this is known by God as non-existent, so as to leave room for the question whether it can not-be;
rather, it will be said to be known by God in such a way that it is seen by Him already in its own
existence. On this basis there is no room for the preceding question. For that which already is
cannot, with respect to that moment of time, not be. We are therefore deceived by the fact that
the time in which we are speaking is present to eternity, as is likewise past time (designated by
the words God knew). Hence, the relation of past or present time to the future is attributed to
eternity, to which such a relation does not belong. It is thus that we commit the fallacy of
accident.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">There is more. If each thing is known by God as seen by Him in the present, what is known by
God will then have to be. Thus, it is necessary that Socrates be seated from the fact that he is seen
seated. But this is not absolutely necessary or, as some say, with the necessity of the consequent;
it is necessary conditionally, or with the necessity of the consequence. For this is a necessary
conditional proposition: if he is seen sitting, he is sitting. Hence, although the conditional
proposition may be changed to a categorical one, to read what is seen sitting must necessarily be
sitting, it is clear that the proposition is true if understood of what is said, and compositely; but
it is false if understood of what is meant, and dividedly. Thus, in these and all similar arguments
used by those who oppose God&#8217;s knowledge of contingents, the fallacy of composition and
division takes place.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[11] That God knows future contingents is also shown by the authority of Sacred Scripture. For
it is said of the divine wisdom: &#8220;She knows signs and wonders before they be done, and the
events of times and ages&#8221; (Wis. 8:8). And in Sirach (39:24-25) it is said: &#8220;There is nothing
hidden from His eyes. He sees from eternity to eternity.&#8221; And in Isaiah (48:5): &#8220;I foretold you of
old, before they came to pass I told you.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THAT GOD KNOWS THE MOTIONS OF THE WILL</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] We must now show that God knows the thoughts of the mind and the motions of the will.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] As was shown above, whatever in any way exists is known by God in so far as He knows His
own essence. There is a certain being in the soul and a certain being in things outside the soul.
God, therefore, knows all these differences of being and what is contained under them. But the
being that is in the soul is that which is in the will or in thought. It remains, therefore, that God
knows that which is in thought and in the will.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Moreover, in knowing His essence, God knows other things in the same way as an effect is
known through a knowledge of the cause. By knowing His essence, therefore, God knows all
things to which His causality extends. But it extends to the operations of the intellect and the
will. For, since each thing acts through its form, from which the thing has a certain being, so the
fount and source of all being, from which is also every form, must be the source of all operation;
for the effects of second causes are grounded more principally in first causes. Therefore, God
knows the thoughts and affections of the mind.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Again, just as God&#8217;s being is prime and for this reason the cause of all being, so His
understanding is prime and on this account the cause of all intellectual operation. Hence, just as
God, by knowing His being knows the being of each thing, so by knowing His understanding and
willing He knows every thought and will.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Moreover, as is clear from what was said above, God knows things not only so far as they are
in themselves, but also so far as they are in their causes; for He knows the order of a cause to its
effect. But artifacts are in artisans through their intellect and will, just as natural things are in
their causes through the powers of these causes. For just as natural things through their active
powers assimilate their effects to themselves, so an artisan through his intellect induces into the
artifact the form through which it is assimilated to his art. The situation is the same for all things
that proceed intentionally from an agent. Therefore, od knows the thoughts and affections of the
mind.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Again, God knows intelligible substances no less than He knows or we know sensible
substances; for intellectual substances are more knowable, since they are in act. Now, both God
and we know how sensible substances are informed and inclined. Since, then, the soul&#8217;s thinking
is a certain information of the soul itself and its affection is a certain inclination of the soul
towards something (so, too, we likewise caH the inclination of a natural thing a natural appetite),
it remains that God knows the thoughts and affections of the mind.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] This is confirmed by the testimony of Sacred Scripture. For it is said in a Psalm (7:10): &#8220;The
searcher of hearts and reins is God.&#8221; And in the Proverbs (15:11): &#8220;Hell and destruction are
before the Lord: how much more the hearts of the children of men?&#8221; And John (2:25): &#8220;He knew
what was in man.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[8] As for the dominion that the will has over its acts, through which it lies in the power of the
will to will or not to will, this excludes the determination of the power to one effect and any
violence from a cause acting from the outside; but it does not exclude the influence of a higher
cause from which come its being and operation. Thus, the causality in the first cause, which is
God, is not removed with respect to the motions of the will. Hence, God, by knowing Himself,
can know such motions.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THAT GOD KNOWS INFINITE THINGS</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] After this we must show that God knows infinite things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] By knowing Himself to be the cause of things God knows things other than Himself, as is
clear from the above. But God is the cause of infinite things, if there are infinite things, since He
is the cause of all things that are. Therefore, God knows infinite things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Again, as is clear from what we have said, God knows His own power perfectly. But a power
cannot be known perfectly unless all that it can do is known, since this is how the magnitude of
a power is in a manner gauged. But since, as was shown above, His power is infinite, it extends
to infinite things. Therefore, God knows infinite things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Moreover, if the knowledge of God extends to all things that in any way are, as was shown,
He must know not only that which is actual but also that which is potential. But among natural
things there is the infinite in potency, though not in act, as the Philosopher proves in <i>Physics</i> III
[6]. God, therefore, knows infinite things. So, too, unity, which is the source of number, would
know the infinite species of number if it knew whatever was in it potentially; for unity is
potentially every number.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Furthermore, God knows other things by His essence as through a certain exemplary means.
But, since His essence is of an infinite perfection, as was shown above, an infinite number of
things having finite perfections can be derived from it. For no one thing or any number of things
copied from the divine essence can equal the perfection of their cause. There thus always remains
a new way in which some copy is able, to imitate the divine essence. Hence, nothing prevents
God from knowing infinite things through His essence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Besides, God&#8217;s being is His understanding. Hence, just as His being is infinite, as we have
shown, so His understanding is infinite. But as the finite is to the finite, so the infinite is to the
infinite. If, then, we are able to grasp finite things according to our understanding, which is finite,
so God according to His understanding can grasp infinite things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] Moreover, the intellect that knows the greatest intelligible, all the more, rather than less,
knows lesser intelligibles, as is clear from the Philosopher in <i>De anima</i> III [4]. This arises
because the intellect is not corrupted by an excelling intelligible, as is the sense, but is rather
perfected by it. Now, let us take infinite things, whether of the same species (for example, an
infinite number of men) or of infinite species, and let us even assume that some or all of them
were infinite in quantity, were this possible the universe of these things would be of a lesser
infinity than is God. For each of them, and all of them together, would have a being that is
received and limited to a given species or genus and would thus be finite in some respect. Hence,
it would fall short of the infinity of God, Who is absolutely infinite, as was shown above.
Therefore, since God knows Himself perfectly, nothing prevents Him from also knowing that
sum of infinite things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[8] Again, the more an intellect is more efficacious and penetrating in knowing, the more it can
know many things through one means. So, too, every power is more united the more strong it is.
But the divine intellect, as is clear from the above, is infinite in power or in perfection. Therefore,
it can know infinite things through one means, namely, the divine essence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[9] Moreover, the divine intellect, like the divine essence, is absolutely perfect. Hence, no
intelligible perfection is lacking to it. But that to which our own intellect is in potency is its
intelligible perfection. Now, our intellect is in potency to all intelligible species. But such species
are infinite, since the species of both numbers and figures are infinite. It remains, then, that God
knows all such infinites.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[10] Again, since our intellect can know infinite things in potency, being able to multiply the
species of numbers infinitely, if the divine intellect did not know infinite things also in act, it
would follow either that the human intellect knew more than did the divine intellect, or that the
divine intellect did not know in act all the things that it knew in potency. Both alternatives are
impossible, as appears from what was said above.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[11] Again, the infinite cannot be known in so far as it cannot be numbered, for it is in itself
impossible to number the parts of the infinite, as implying a contradiction. But to know
something by the numbering of its parts belongs to an intellect that knows one part after the
other; it does not belong to an intellect that comprehends the diverse parts together. Therefore,
since the divine intellect knows all things together without succession, it is no more prevented
from knowing infinite things than from knowing finite things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[12] Moreover, all quantity consists in a certain multiplication of parts, and this is why number
is the first of quantities. Where, therefore, plurality does not bring about any difference, there
neither does anything that follows quantity bring about any difference. Now, in the case of God&#8217;s
knowledge, many things are known as one, since they are known not through diverse species but
through one species, namely, the divine essence. Hence, many things are also known together by
God, so that in this way plurality introduces no difference in the divine knowledge. Neither,
therefore, does the infinite that accompanies quantity. Hence, to know infinite and finite objects
makes no difference to the divine intellect. Thus, since God knows finite things, nothing prevents
Him from also knowing infinite things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[13] What is said in a Psalm (146:5) agrees with this: &#8220;And of His wisdom there is no number.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[14] Now, from what has been said it is evident why our intellect does not know the infinite, as
does the divine intellect. For our intellect is distinguished from the divine intellect on four points
which bring about this difference. The first point is that our intellect is absolutely finite whereas
the divine intellect is infinite. The second point is that our intellect knows diverse things through
diverse species. This means that it does not extend to infinite things through one act of
knowledge as does the divine intellect. The third point follows from the second. Since our
intellect knows diverse things through diverse species it cannot know many things at one and the
same time. Hence, it can know infinite things only successively by numbering them. This is not
the case with the divine intellect which sees many things together as grasped through one species.
The fourth point is that the divine intellect knows both the things that are and the things that are
not, as has been shown.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[15] It is likewise evident how the statement of Aristotle, who says that the infinite as infinite is
unknown, is not opposed to the present conclusion. For, since the nature of the infinite belongs
to quantity, as he himself says, the infinite as infinite would be known if it were known through
the measurement of its parts, for this is the proper knowledge of quantity. But God does not know
in this way. God, therefore, so to speak, does not know the infinite in so far as it is infinite, but,
as we have shown, in so far as it is related to His knowledge as though it were something finite.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[16] It must be observed, however, that God does not know infinite things with the knowledge
of vision, to make use of an expression employed by others. For there neither are nor have been
nor will be infinite things in act, since, according to the Catholic faith, generation is not infinite
at either end. But God knows the infinite with the knowledge of simple understanding. For He
knows the infinite things which neither are nor will be nor have been, which yet lie in the potency
of the creation. God likewise knows the infinite things that are in His power, which neither are
nor will be nor have been.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[17] Hence, as concerns the question of the knowledge of singulars, we may reply by denying the
major. There are not infinite singulars. However, if there were, God would still know them.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.125in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">&#160;</p>
<A NAME="70"><p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">Chapter 70</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THAT GOD KNOWS LOWLY THINGS</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] Having achieved this conclusion, we must show that God knows lowly things, and that this
is not opposed to the nobility of His knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] The stronger a given active power is, the more does its action extend to more remote effects.
This is also evident in the actions of sensible things. Now, the power of the divine intellect in
knowing things is like an active power. For God knows things not by receiving anything from
them, but, rather, by exercising His causality on them. Hence, since God is of an infinite power
in understanding, as is clear from what has preceded, His knowledge must extend even to the
most remote things. But the gradation of nobility and lowliness among all things is measured
according to their nearness to and distance from God, Who is at the peak of nobility. Therefore,
because of the perfect power of His intellect, God knows the lowliest possible among beings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Furthermore, everything that is, in that it is or in what it is, is in act and the likeness of the
first act, and on this account has nobility. Whatever is in potency likewise participates in nobility
from its order to act; for it is thus that it is said to be. It remains, then, that, considered in itself,
each thing is noble, but is called lowly with respect to something more noble. Now, the most
noble of creatures are no less distant from God than the lowest of creatures are distant from the
highest. Hence, if this distance prevented God from knowing them, all the more would the
previous distance. It would thus follow that God did not know anything other than Himself. This
was disproved above. If, then, God knows something other than Himself, however supreme in
nobility it may be, by the same reason He knows anything whatever, however exceedingly lowly
it may be called.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Moreover, the good of the order of the universe is more noble than any part of the universe,
since the individual parts are ordered, as to an end, to the good of the order that is in the whole.
Ibis is evident from the Philosopher in <i>Metaphysics</i> XI [10]. Hence, if God knows some other
noble nature, He especially knows the order of the universe. But this order cannot be known
without a knowledge both of the things that are more noble and of the things that are more lowly,
in whose distances and relations the order of the universe consists. It remains, therefore, that God
knows not only noble things but also the things that are deemed lowly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Again, the lowliness of the things known does not of itself redound to the knower. For it
belongs to the nature of knowledge that the knower should contain the species of the thing known
according to his own manner. Accidentally, however, the lowliness of the things known can
redound to the knower. This may be either because, while he is considering lowly things, his
mind is turned away from thinking of more noble things; or it may be because, as a result of
considering lowly things, he is inclined towards certain unbefitting affections. This, however, is
not possible in God, as is clear from what has been said. The knowledge of lowly things,
therefore, does not detract from the divine nobility, but rather belongs to the divine perfection
according as it pre-contains all things in itself, as was shown above.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Furthermore, a power is not judged to be small because it can do small things but because it
is limited to small things; for a power that can do great things can likewise do small ones. Hence,
a knowledge that extends at the same time to both noble and lowly things is not to be judged as
being lowly; rather, that knowledge is to be judged lowly which extends only to lowly things, as
happens in our own case. For we examine divine and human things by different considerations,
and the knowledge of the one is not the knowledge of the other, so that by comparison with the
more noble knowledge the lower knowledge is deemed to be lowlier. But it is not thus in God.
By one and the same knowledge and consideration He considers both Himself and all other
things. No lowliness, therefore, is ascribed to His knowledge from the fact that He knows any
lowly things whatever.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] What is said of the divine wisdom is in harmony with this conclusion. Wisdom &#8220;reaches
everywhere by reason of her purity... and therefore no defiled thing cometh into her&#8221; (Wis. 7:24-25).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[8] Now, from what has been said it is evident that the argument advanced on the opposite side
is not opposed to the truth we have shown. For the nobility of knowledge is measured in terms
of those things to which knowledge is principally directed, and not in terms of all the things that
fall within knowledge. For in the most noble among the knowledges that we have there are
included not only the highest beings but also the lowest. For first philosophy extends its
consideration from the first being to being in potency, which is the lowest being. Thus, under
divine science are included the lowest of beings as being known along with its principal object.
For the divine essence is the principal object known by God and in this object, as was shown
above, all others are known.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[9] It is also evident that this truth is not opposed to what the Philosopher says in <i>Metaphysics</i>
XI [9]. Aristotle there intends to show that the divine intellect does not know anything other than
itself that is its perfection in the sense of being its principal known object. In this sense he says
that it is better not to know lowly things than to know them. This is the case, namely, when the
knowledge of the lowly is different from the knowledge of the noble and the consideration of
lowly things impedes the consideration of noble things.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THAT GOD KNOWS EVILS</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] It now remains to show that God likewise knows evils.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] When a good is known, the opposite evil is known. But God knows all particular goods, to
which evils are opposed. Therefore, God knows evils.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Furthermore, the notions of contraries are themselves not contraries in the soul; otherwise,
they would not be in the soul together nor would they be known together. The notion, therefore,
by which evil is known is not opposed to the good but belongs, rather, to the notion of the good.
Hence, if all the notions of goodness are found in God because of His absolute perfection, as was
proved above, it follows that there is in Him the notion by which evil is known. And thus God
also knows evils.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Again, the true is the good of the intellect. For an intellect is said to be good because it knows
the true. But it is true not only that the good is good but also that evil is evil; for just as it is true
that that which is is, so it is true that that which is not is not. The good of the intellect, therefore,
also consists in the knowledge of evil. But, since the divine intellect is perfect in goodness, no
intellectual perfection can be lacking to it. Therefore, it has a knowledge of evils.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Moreover, as was shown above, God knows the distinction of things. But negation is found
within the notion of distinction; for those things are distinct of which one is not the other. Hence,
the first notions, which are distinguished by themselves, mutually include a negation of one
another. That is why the negative propositions among them are immediate: for example, no
quantity is a substance. God, therefore, knows negation. But privation is a certain negation in a
determinate subject, as is shown in <i>Metaphysics</i> IV [2]. God, therefore, knows privation.
Consequently, He knows evil, which is nothing other than the privation of a due perfection.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Furthermore, if God knows all the species of things, as was proved above, and is likewise
conceded and proved by certain philosophers, He must know contraries. This is so because the
species of certain genera are contraries and also because the differences of genera are contraries,
as is proved in <i>Metaphysics</i> X [8]. But between contraries there is included the opposition of
form and privation, as is said in the same reference. Therefore, God must know privation and
consequently evil.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] Again, as was shown above, God knows not only form but also matter. But, since matter is
a being in potency, it cannot be known perfectly unless those things to which its potency extends
are known. This is the case with all other potencies. Now, the potency of matter extends both to
form and to privation, since that which can be can also not-be. Therefore, God knows privation,
and consequently He knows evil.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[8] Again, if God knows something other than Himself, He especially knows that which is the
best. Ibis is the order of the universe to which, as to the end, all particular goods are ordered. But
in the order of the universe certain things exist to ward off dangers that may come about from
certain other things. This is clear from what is given to animals for their own protection.
Therefore, God knows such dangers. Hence, He knows evils.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[9] Furthermore, in our own case the knowledge of evil is not considered blameworthy according
to that which essentially belongs to knowledge, namely, the judgment that we have of evil things.
But it is considered blameworthy by accident, in so far as through the consideration of evil one
is sometimes inclined to evil things. This is not the case in God, because, as was shown above,
He is immutable. Nothing, therefore, prevents God from knowing evils.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[10] What is said in Wisdom (7:30) harmonizes with this conclusion: &#8220;No evil can overcome&#8221;
the &#8220;wisdom&#8221; of God. And in Proverbs (15:11) it is said: &#8220;Hell and destruction are before the
Lord.&#8221; And in the Psalm (68:6): &#8220;My offenses are not hidden from you.&#8221; And in Job (11:11) it
is said: &#8220;For He knows the vanity of men, and when He sees iniquity, does He not consider it?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[11] We must observe, however, that on the knowledge of evil and privation the divine intellect
and our own are differently disposed. For, since our intellect knows singular things through
singular species that are proper and diverse, that which it is in act it knows through an intelligible
species through which it is made an intellect in act. Hence, it can also know potency in so far as
it is sometimes in potency to such a species; so that just as it knows act through act, so likewise
it knows potency through potency. And because potency belongs to the nature of privation, since
privation is a negation whose subject is a being in potency, it follows that it is suitable to our
intellect in a certain manner to know privation in so far as it is of a nature to be in potency.
Nevertheless, it can also be said that the knowledge of potency and privation follows from the
knowledge of act.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[12] The divine intellect, on the other hand, which is in no way in potency, does not know
privation or anything else in the above given way. For, if it knew something through a species
that is not itself, it would necessarily follow that its proportion to that species would be as the
proportion of potency to act. God must therefore understand solely through the species that is His
own essence. It follows, consequently, that He understands only Himself as the first object of His
intellect. But in understanding Himself He understands other things, as was proved above. And
He knows not only acts, but also potencies and, privations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[13] This is the meaning of the words that the Philosopher sets down in <i>De anima</i> III [6], when
he says: &#8220;How does it apprehend evil or something black? For in a manner it knows contraries.
But the knower must be potentially what it knows and this must be in it. But, if no contrary is
present to a certain knower&#8221;&#8212;that is, in potency&#8212;&#8220;this knower knows itself and is in act and
separable.&#8221;&#8220; Nor must we adopt the interpretation of Averroes, who takes the position that it
follows from this text that the intellect that is solely in act in no way knows privation. Rather, the
sense is that it does not know privation by the fact of being in potency to something else; it
knows privation because it knows itself and is always in act.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[14] Moreover, we must observe that, if God knew Himself in such a way that, by knowing
Himself, He did not know other beings, which are particular goods, then in no way would He
know privation and evil. For to the good that He is there is no contrary privation, since privation
and its opposite bear on the same thing, and thus to that which is pure act no privation is
opposed. And, consequently, neither is evil. Hence, granted that God knows only Himself, by
knowing the good that He is He will not know evil. But because, in knowing Himself, He knows
the beings that are by nature subject to privations, He must know the privations and the evils that
are opposed to particular goods.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[15] We must likewise observe, as was shown above, that just as God in knowing Himself knows
other things without any discursiveness of the intellect, so likewise it is not necessary that His
knowledge be discursive if He knows the evil through the good. For the good is as the principle
of the knowledge of what is evil. Hence, evils are known through goods as things are known
through their definitions, not as conclusions are known through their principles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[16] Nor, again, does it mean that there is imperfection in the divine knowledge if God knows
evils through the privation of goods. For the position says that evil exists only in so far as it is
the privation of good. Hence, in this way alone is it knowable, for each thing is knowable to the
extent that it has being.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THAT GOD HAS WILL</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] Having dealt with what concerns the knowledge of the divine intellect, it remains for us to
deal with God&#8217;s will.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] From the fact that God is endowed with intellect it follows that He is endowed with will. For,
since the understood good is the proper object of the will, the understood good is, as such, willed.
Now that which is understood is by reference to one who understands. Hence, he who grasps the
good by his intellect is, as such, endowed with will. But God grasps the good by His intellect,
For, since the activity of His intellect is perfect, as appears from what has been said, He
understands being together with the qualification of the good. He is, therefore, endowed with
will.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Again, whoever possesses some form is related through that form to things in reality. For
example, white wood is through its whiteness like some things and unlike other things. But in
one understanding and sensing there is the form of the understood and sensed thing, since all
knowledge is through some likeness. There must, therefore, be a relation of the one
understanding and sensing to understood and sensed things according as these are in reality. But
this is not because of the fact that these beings understand and sense, since thereby we rather find
a relation of things to the one understanding and sensing; for to understand and to sense exist
according as things are in the intellect and the sense, following the mode of each. He who senses
and understands has a relation to the thing outside the soul through his will and appetite. Hence,
all sensing and understanding beings have appetite and will. Properly speaking, however, the will
is in the intellect. Since, then, God is intelligent, He must be endowed with will.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Moreover, that which accompanies every being belongs to being inasmuch as it is in being.
This accompaniment must be found in a supreme way in that which is the first being. Now, it
belongs to every being to seek its perfection and the conservation of its being, and this in the case
of each being according to its mode: for intellectual beings through will, for animals through
sensible appetite, and to those lacking sense through natural appetite. To seek perfection belongs
differently to those that have it and those that have it not. For those that have it not tend by desire,
through the appetitive power proper to them, to acquire what is lacking to their desire, whereas
those that have it rest in it. Hence, this cannot be lacking to the first being, which is God. Since,
then, God is intelligent, there is in Him a will by which His being and His goodness are pleasing
to Him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Again, the more perfect understanding is, the more delightful it is to the one understanding,
But God understands and His understanding is most perfect, as was shown above. Therefore, His
understanding is most full of delight. But intelligible delight is through the will, as sensible
delight is through the appetite of concupiscence. There is, therefore, will in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Furthermore, a form considered by the intellect does not move or cause anything except
through the will, whose object is the end and the good, by which someone is moved to act.
Hence, the speculative intellect does not move, nor does the imagination alone without an act of
the estimative power. But the form of the divine intellect is the cause of motion and being in
other things, since God produces things by His intellect, as will be shown later on. Therefore,
God must be endowed with will.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] Again, among moving powers in beings possessing an intellect, the first is found to be the
will. For the will sets every power to its act: we understand because we will, we imagine because
we will, and so with the rest. The will has this role because its object is the end; although it is
also a fact that the intellect, though not in the manner of an efficient and moving cause, but in
that of a final cause, moves the will by proposing to it its object, namely, the end. It therefore
belongs supremely to the first mover to have a will.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[8] Furthermore, &#8220;that is free which is for its own sake,&#8221; and thus the free has the nature of that
which is through itself. Now, first and primarily, will has liberty in acting, for according as
someone acts voluntarily he is said to perform any given action freely. To act through will,
therefore, supremely befits the first agent, whom it supremely befits to act through himself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[9] Moreover, the end and the agent to the end are always found to be of one order in reality; and
hence the proximate end that is proportioned to an agent falls into the same species as the agent
both among natural things and artificial things. For the form of the art through which the artisan
works is the species of the form that is in matter, which is the end of the artisan; and the form by
which the generating fire acts is of the same species as the form of the generated fire, which is
the end of generation. But nothing is co-ordered with God, as within the same order, except
Himself; otherwise, there would be several first beings&#8212;whose contrary was proved above. He
is therefore the first agent because of the end that He is Himself. He is therefore not only the
appetible end, but also the seeker of Himself as the end, so to speak. And this He is with an
intellectual appetite, since He is intelligent. This is will. There is, therefore, will in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[10] The testimony of Sacred Scripture is witness to the divine will. For it is said in a Psalm
(134:6): &#8220;Whatever the Lord pleased He has done.&#8221; And Romans (9:19): &#8220;Who resists His will?&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THAT THE WILL OF GOD IS HIS ESSENCE</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] From this it appears that God&#8217;s will is not other than His essence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] It belongs to God to be endowed with will in so far as He is intelligent, as has been shown.
But God has understanding by His essence, as was proved above. So, therefore, does He have
will. God&#8217;s will, therefore, is His very essence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Again, as to understand is the perfection of the one understanding, so to will is the perfection
of the one willing; for both are actions remaining in the agent and not going out (as does heat)
to some receiving subject. But the understanding of God is His being, as was proved above. For,
since the divine being is in itself most perfect, it admits of no superadded perfection, as was
proved above. The divine willing also is, therefore, His being; and hence the will of God is His
essence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Moreover, since every agent acts in so far as it is in act, God, Who is pure act, must act
through His essence. Willing, however, is a certain operation of God. Therefore, God must be
endowed with will through His essence. Therefore, His will is His essence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Furthermore, if will were something added to the divine substance, since the divine substance
is something complete in being it would follow that will would be added to it as an accident to
a subject, that the divine substance would be related to it as potency to act, and that there would
be composition in God. All this was refuted above. Hence, it is not possible that the divine will
be something added to the divine substance.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] From this it further appears that the principal object of the divine will is the divine essence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] The understood good is the object of the will, as has been said. But that which is principally
understood by God is the divine essence, as was proved above. The divine essence, therefore, is
principally the object of the divine will.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Again, the appetible is to appetite as the mover to the moved, as was said above. Similar, too,
is the relation of the object of the will to the will, since the will belongs to the class of appetitive
powers. If, then, the principal object of the divine will be other than the divine essence, it will
follow that there is something higher than the divine will moving it. The contrary of this is
apparent from what has been said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Moreover, the principal object willed is for each one willing the cause of his willing. For
when we say, I will to walk in order to become healed, we are of the impression that we are
assigning a cause. If, then, it be asked, why do you want to become healed? causes will be
assigned one after the other until we arrive at the ultimate end. This is the principal object of the
will, which is through itself the cause of willing. If, then, God should principally will something
other than Himself, it will follow that something other is the cause of His willing. But His willing
is His being, as has been shown.&#8221; Hence, something other will be the cause of His being&#8212;which
is contrary to the nature of the first being.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Furthermore, for each being endowed with a will the principal object willed is the ultimate
end. For the end is willed through itself, and through it other things become objects of will. But
the ultimate end is God Himself, since He is the highest good, as has been shown. Therefore, God
is the principal object of His will.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Moreover, every power is proportioned with equality to its principal object, for the power of
a thing is measured according to its objects, as may be seen through the Philosopher in <i>De caelo
et mundo</i> [11], But the will is proportioned with equality to its principal object, and similarly the
intellect and likewise the sense. Now, nothing is proportioned with equality to the divine will
save only God&#8217;s essence. Therefore, the principal object of the divine will is the divine essence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] But since the divine essence is God&#8217;s understanding and all else that is said to be in Him, it
is further manifest that in the same way He principally wills Himself to understand, to will, to
be one, and other such attributes.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.125in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">&#160;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] Thereby it can be shown, however, that in willing Himself God also wills other things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] For to whom it belongs to win the end principally, to him it belongs to will the things that are
ordered to the end for the sake of the end. Now, God Himself is the ultimate end of things, as
appears somewhat from what has been said. Hence, because He wills Himself to be, He likewise
wills other things, which are ordered to Him as to the end.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Again, everyone desires the perfection of that which is willed and loved by him for its own
sake. For the things that we love for their own sake we want to be most perfect, and always to
become better and be multiplied as much as possible. But God wills and loves His essence for
its own sake. Now, the divine essence cannot be increased or multiplied in itself, as is manifest
from what has been said; it can be multiplied solely according to its likeness, which is
participated by many. God, therefore, wills the multitude of things in willing and loving His own
essence and perfection.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Moreover, whoever loves something in itself and for its own sake consequently loves all the
things in which it is found: for example, he who loves sweetness for itself must love all sweet
things. But God wills and loves His own being in itself and for its own sake, as shown above.
Every other being, however, is by way of likeness a certain participation of His being, as appears
somewhat from what has been said. It remains, then, that God, in that He wills and loves
Himself, wills and loves other things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Furthermore, in willing Himself God wills all that is in Him. But all things in a certain
manner pre-exist in Him through their proper models, as was shown above. God, therefore, in
willing Himself likewise wills other things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Then, again, the more perfect the power of a being, by so much does its causality extend to
more, and more remote, things, as was said above. But the causality of the end consists in this,
that other things are desired for its sake. The more perfect an end, therefore, and the more willed,
by so much does the will of one willing the end extend to more things for the sake of that end.
But the divine essence is most perfect as goodness and as end. It will, therefore, supremely
diffuse its causality to many, so that many things may be willed for its sake; and especially so by
God, Who wills the divine essence perfectly according to its power.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] Moreover, will accompanies intellect. But by His intellect God principally understands
Himself, and He understands other things in Himself. In the same way, therefore, He principally
wills Himself, and wills all other things in willing Himself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[8] This is confirmed by the authority of Sacred Scripture. For it is said in Wisdom (11:25): &#8220;For
You love all things that are, and hate none of the things which You have made.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THAT GOD WILLS HIMSELF AND OTHER THINGS BY ONE ACT OF WILL</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] From this result it follows that God wills Himself and other things by one act of will.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2.] Every power is directed to its object and to the formal notion of the object by one operation
or one act. For example, by the same sight we see light and color, which becomes visible in act
through light. Now, when we will something solely for the sake of the end, that which is desired
for the sake of the end derives the nature of something willed from the end; and thus the end is
to it as the formal notion of the object is to the object, for example, as light is to color. Since,
then, God wills other things for His own sake as for the sake of the end, as has been shown, He
wills Himself and other things by one act of will.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Moreover, what is perfectly known and desired is known and desired according to its whole
power. But the power of the end is measured not only according as it is desired in itself, but also
according as other things become desirable for its sake. Hence, whoever desires an end perfectly
desires it in both ways. But there is no act of will in God by which He wills Himself and does not
do so perfectly, since there is nothing imperfect in Him. Therefore, by whatever act God wills
Himself, He wills Himself absolutely and other things for His sake. But He does not will things
other than Himself except in so far as He wills Himself, as has been proved. It remains, then, that
God does not will Himself and other things by different acts of will, but by one and the same act.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Furthermore, as appears from what has been said, discursiveness is found in the act of a
cognitive power according as we know principles by themselves and from them we arrive at
conclusions. For, if we saw conclusions in principles by knowing the principles themselves, there
would be no discursiveness, as likewise there is not when we see something in a mirror. But as
principles are to conclusions in speculative matters, so ends are to the things ordered to them in
operative and appetitive matters; for, just as conclusions are known through principles, so the
appetite and doing of the things ordered to the end proceed from the end. If, then, someone wills
separately the end and the things ordered to the end, there will be a certain discursiveness in His
will. But this cannot be in God, since He is outside all motion. It remains, then, that God wills
Himself and other things together and in the same act of will.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Again, since God wills Himself always, if He wills Himself and other things by different acts
it will follow that there are at once two acts of will in Him. This is impossible, since one simple
power does not have at once two operations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Furthermore, in every act of the will the object willed is to the one willing as a mover to the
moved. If, then, there be some action of the divine will, by which God wills things other than
Himself, which is diverse from the action by which He wills Himself, there will be in Him some
other mover of the divine will. This is impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] Moreover, God&#8217;s willing is His being, as has been proved. But in God there is only one being.
Therefore, there is in Him only one willing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[8] Again, willing belongs to God according as He is intelligent. Therefore, just as by one act He
understands Himself and other things, in so far as His essence is the exemplar of all things, so
by one act He wills Himself and other things, in so far as His goodness is the likeness of all
goodness.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THAT THE MULTITUDE OF THE OBJECTS OF THE WILL IS NOT OPPOSED
TO THE DIVINE SIMPLICITY</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] From this it follows that the multitude of the objects of the will is not opposed to the unity
and simplicity of the divine substance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] For acts are distinguished according to their objects. If, then, the many objects that God wills
caused a multitude in Him, it would follow that there was not in Him solely one operation of the
will. This is against what has been proved above.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Again, it has been shown that God wills other things in so far as He wills His own goodness.
Hence, other things are to His will in the manner in which they are comprehended by His
goodness. But all things in His goodness are one, since other things are in Him according to His
way, namely, &#8220;the material immaterially and the many unitedly,&#8221; as appears from what has been
said. It remains, then, that the multitude of the objects of the will does not multiply the divine
substance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Moreover, the divine intellect and will are of an equal simplicity, for both are the divine
substance, as has been proved. But the multitude of intellectual objects does not cause a
multitude in the divine essence, nor a composition in the divine intellect. Neither, therefore, does
a multitude of the objects of the will cause either a diversity in the divine essence or a
composition in the divine will.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Furthermore, there is this difference between knowledge and appetite, that knowledge takes
place according as the known is in some way in the knower, whereas appetite does not take place
in this way, but rather conversely, according as the appetite is related to the appetible thing,
which the one pursuing seeks or in which be rests. And on this account good and evil, which
have reference to appetite, are in things, whereas the true and the false, which have reference to
knowledge, are in the mind, as the Philosopher says in <i>Metaphysics</i> VI [4]. Now, that something
be related to many is not opposed to its simplicity, since unity itself is the principle of numerical
multitude. Hence, the multitude of the objects willed by God is not opposed to His simplicity.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THAT THE DIVINE WILL EXTENDS TO SINGULAR GOODS</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] From this it is likewise apparent that, for the purpose of conserving the divine simplicity, we
should not say that God wills other goods in a certain general way, in so far as He wills Himself
to be the principle of the goods that can come forth from Him, but that He does not will them in
the particular.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] For to will implies a relationship of the one willing to the thing willed. But the divine
simplicity does not forbid -its being related even to many particulars; for God is said to be
something best and first in relation to singulars. Therefore, His simplicity does not forbid Him
from willing things other than Himself in the concrete or the particular.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Again, the will of God is related to other things in so far as they participate in goodness in
virtue of their order to the divine goodness, which is for God the reason of His willing. But not
only the totality of goods, but even each one of them derives its goodness from the divine
goodness, as well as its being. Therefore, the will of God extends to singular goods.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Moreover, according to the Philosopher, in <i>Metaphysics</i> XI [10], a twofold good of order is
found in the universe: one according to which the whole universe is ordered to what is outside
the universe, as the army is ordered to its general; the other according as the parts of the universe
are ordered to one another, as are the parts of the army. Now, the second order is for the sake of
the first. But God, from the fact of willing Himself as the end, wills other things that are ordered
to Him as to the end, as has been proved. He therefore wills the good of the order that the whole
universe has to Him, as well as the good of the order that the universe has in the mutual relations
of its parts. But the good of an order arises from singular goods. Therefore, God also wills
singular goods.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Furthermore, if God does not will the singular goods of which the universe is composed, it
follows that in the universe the good that order is is by chance. For it is not possible that some
part of the universe should bring together all the particular goods into the order of the universe;
only the universal cause of the whole universe, God, Who acts through His will, as will later be
shown, can do this. Now, that the order of the universe be by chance is impossible, since it would
follow that the consequences of the order would all the more be by chance. It remains, then, that
God wills even singulars among goods.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Again, the understood good, as such, is what is willed. But God understands even particular
goods, as was proved above. He therefore wills even particular goods.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] This is confirmed by the authority of Scripture, which, in the first chapter of Genesis (1:4,
31), shows the pleasure of the divine will with each single work, in the words: &#8220;God saw the light
that it was good,&#8221; and similarly of His other works, and then of all the works together: &#8220;And God
saw all the things that He had made, and they were very good.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THAT GOD WILLS EVEN THE THINGS THAT ARE NOT YET</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] If willing implies a relationship of the one willing to the thing willed, it can possibly seem
to someone that God cannot will save only the things that are. For relatives ought to be together,
and when one is destroyed so is the other, as the Philosopher teaches. If, then, willing implies the
relationship of the one willing to the thing willed, no one can will save the things that are.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] Furthermore, will is said in relation to the things that are willed, and similarly with cause and
creator. But not even God can be called Creator, or Lord, or Father, save of the things that are.
Therefore, neither can He be said to will save the things that are.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] From this it could be further concluded that, if the divine willing is unchangeable as is the
divine being, and God does not will save the things that are in act, He wills nothing that does not
always exist.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] To these difficulties some answer that the things that are not in themselves are in God and
in His intellect. Hence, nothing prevents God from willing the things that do not exist in
themselves in so far as they are in Him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] But this does not seem to be a sufficient reply. For someone with a will is said to will
something in so far as his will is related to the thing willed. If, then, the divine will is not related
to the thing willed save only in so far as it exists in Him or in His intellect, it will follow that God
does not will that thing except because He wills it to be in His being or in His intellect. But this
is not the intention of those who bold the position; they intend that God wills such not-yet-existents to be even in themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Again, if the will is related to the thing willed through its object, the understood good, and
the intellect understands not only that the good exists in it but that it exists in its own nature, the
will likewise is related to the thing willed not only as it is in the knower, but likewise as it is in
itself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] Let us therefore reply that, since the apprehended good moves the will, the act of will itself
must follow the condition of apprehension; just as the motions of the other movers follow the
conditions of the mover that is the cause of motion. But the relation of the apprehension to the
thing apprehended follows upon the apprehension itself, because one who apprehends is related
to the apprehended thing in that he apprehends it. Now, he who apprehends does not apprehend
a thing solely as it is in him, but as it is in its own nature; for not only do we know that a thing
is understood by us because it is in the intellect, but we know also that it exists or has existed or
will exist in its own nature. Therefore, although at that moment the thing does not exist save only
in the intellect, the relation following upon the apprehension is to the thing, not as it exists in the
knower, but as it is in its own nature, which the one apprehending apprehends.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[8] The relation of the divine will, therefore, is to the non-existing thing according as it exists in
its proper nature at a certain time, and not only according as it is in God knowing it. The thing
that does not now exist God wills to be at a certain time; He does not will solely the fact that He
understands it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[9] The relations of the one willing to the thing willed, of creator to created, and of maker to
thing made, or of Lord to His subject creature, are not similar. For willing is an action remaining
in the one willing, and hence does not require that something existing outside the will be
understood. But to make, to create, and to govern signify an action terminating in an exterior
effect, without whose existence such an action cannot be understood.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THAT HIS OWN BEING AND HIS OWN GOODNESS GOD WILLS NECESSARILY</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] From what was shown above it follows that God wills His own being and His own goodness
in a necessary way, and cannot will the contrary.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] For it was shown above that God wills His own being and His own goodness as His principal
object, which is for Him the reason for willing other things. In everything willed, therefore, God
wills His own being and His own goodness, just as the sight in every color sees light. But it is
impossible for God not to will something in act, for He would be willing only in potency, which
is impossible, since His willing is His being. It is therefore necessary that God will His own
being and His own goodness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Again, every being endowed with will necessarily wills his own ultimate end: for example,
man necessarily wills his own beatitude and cannot will misery. But God wills Himself to be as
the ultimate end, as appears from what has been said. Therefore, He necessarily wills Himself
to be, nor can He will Himself not to be.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Moreover, in appetitive and operative matters the end functions as an indemonstrable
principle does in speculative matters. For just as in speculative matters the conclusions are
reached from principles, so in active and appetitive matters the principle of all the things to be
done and sought is taken from the end. But in speculative matters the intellect necessarily assents
to the first and indemonstrable principles, and can in no way assent to their contraries. Therefore,
the will necessarily inheres to the ultimate end, so as to be unable to will the contrary. Thus, if
the divine will has no end other than itself, it necessarily wills itself to be.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Again, all things in so far as they are, are likened to God Who is primarily and supremely
being. But all things, in so far as they are, in their own way naturally love their own being. All
the more, then, does God naturally love His own being. But His nature is a being necessary
through itself, as was shown above. Therefore, God of necessity wills Himself to be.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Furthermore, every perfection and goodness found in creatures is proper to God in an
essential way, as was proved above. But to love God is the highest perfection of the rational
creature, since thereby it is somehow united to God. Therefore, this love is found in God in an
essential way. Therefore, of necessity God loves Himself. And thus He wills Himself to be.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THAT GOD DOES NOT WILL OTHER THINGS IN A NECESSARY WAY</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] But, if the divine will of necessity wills the divine goodness and the divine being, it might
seem to someone that it wills of necessity other things as well, since God wills all other things
in willing His own goodness, as was proved above. Nevertheless, if we consider the matter
correctly, it appears that He does not will other things necessarily.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] For God wills other things as ordered to the end of His goodness. But the will is not directed
to what is for the sake of the end if the end can be without it. For, on the basis of his intention
to heal, a doctor does not necessarily have to give to a sick person the medicine without which
the sick person can nevertheless be healed. Since, then, the divine goodness can be without other
things, and, indeed, is in no way increased by other things, it is under no necessity to will other
things from the fact of willing its own goodness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Furthermore, since the understood good is the object of the will, the will can will anything
conceived by the intellect in which the nature of the good is present. Hence, although the being
of any given thing is as such a good and its non-being an evil, the non-being of something can
fall under the will (though not by necessity) because of some adjoined good that is preserved;
since it is a good that something be, even though something else does not exist. Therefore,
according to its own nature, the will cannot not will that good whose non-existence causes the
nature of the good entirely to be lost. But there is no such good apart from God. According to its
nature, therefore, the will can will the non-existence of anything whatever apart from God. But
in God will is present according to its whole range, since all things in Him are universally
perfect. God, therefore, can will the non-existence of anything whatever apart from Himself.
Hence, it is not of necessity that things other than Himself exist.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Moreover, God, in willing His own goodness, wills things other than Himself to be in so far
as they participate in His goodness. But, since the divine goodness is infinite, it can be
participated in infinite ways, and in ways other than it is participated in by the creatures that now
exist. if, then, as a result of willing His own goodness, God necessarily willed the things that
participate in it, it would follow that He would will the existence of an infinity of creatures
participating in His goodness in an infinity of ways. This is patently false, because, if He willed
them, they would be, since His will is the principle of being for things, as will be shown later on.
Therefore, God does not necessarily will even the things that now exist.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Again, the will of a wise man, by the fact of dealing with a cause, deals also with the effect
that necessarily follows from the cause. For it would be foolish to wish the sun to be overhead
and yet that it should not be daylight. But, as to an effect that does not follow of necessity from
a cause, it is not necessary that someone will it because he wills the cause. Now, other things
proceed from God Without necessity, as will be shown later on. It is not necessary, therefore, that
God will other things from the fact of willing Himself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Moreover, things proceed from God as artifacts from an artisan, as will be shown later on.
But, although the artisan wishes to have the art, he does not necessarily wish to produce the
artifacts. Neither, therefore, does God necessarily will that there be things other than Himself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] We must therefore consider why it is that God necessarily knows things other than Himself,
but does not necessarily will them, even though from the fact that He understands and wills
Himself He understands and wills other things. The reason is as follows. That he who
understands should understand something arises from the fact that he is disposed in a certain way,
since something is understood in act in so far as its likeness is in the one understanding. But that
he who wills should will something arises from the fact that what is willed is disposed in a
certain way. For we will something either because it is the end or because it is ordered to the end.
Now, that all things be in God, so that they can be understood in Him, is necessarily required by
the divine perfection; but the divine goodness does not necessarily require that other things exist,
which are ordered to it as to the end. That is why it is necessary that God know other things, but
not necessary that He will them. Hence, neither does God will all the things that can have an
order to His goodness; but He knows all things that have any order whatever to His essence, by
which He understands.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">ARGUMENTS LEADING TO AWKWARD CONSEQUENCES IF GOD DOES NOT NECESSARILY WILL THINGS OTHER THAN HIMSELF</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] Awkward consequences seem to follow if God does not will necessarily the things that He
wills.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] For, if with respect to certain objects the will of God is not determined to them, it would seem
to be disposed to opposites. But every power that is disposed to opposites is in a manner in
potency, since &#8220;to opposites&#8221; is a species of the contingent possible. Therefore, there is potency
in the will of God, which will consequently not be the substance of God, in which there is no
potency, as was shown above.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] If being in potency, as such, is of a nature to be moved , because what can be can not-be, it
follows that the divine will is changeable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Furthermore, if it is natural to God to will something about His effects, it is necessary. Now
there can be nothing unnatural in God, since there cannot be anything accidental or violent in
Him, as was proved above.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Again, if what is open to opposites, being indifferently disposed, tends no more to one thing
than to another unless it be determined by another, it is necessary either that God will none of the
things towards which He is disposed to opposites, of which the contrary was proved above, or
that God be determined to one effect by another. Thus, there will be something prior to Him,
determining Him to one effect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] But of these conclusions none necessarily follows. For to be open to opposites belongs to a
certain power in a twofold way: in one way, from the side of itself; in another way, from the side
of its object. From the side of itself, when it has not yet achieved its perfection, through which
it is determined to one effect. This openness redounds to the imperfection of a power, and
potentiality is shown to be in it; as appears in the case of an intellect in doubt, which has yet not
acquired the principles from which to be determined to one alternative. From the side of its
object, a certain power is found open to opposites when the perfect operation of the power
depends on neither alternative, though both can be. An example is an art which can use diverse
instruments to perform the same work equally well. This openness does not pertain to the
imperfection of a power, but rather to its eminence, in so far as it dominates both alternatives,
and thereby is determined to neither, being open to both. This is bow the divine will is disposed
in relation to things other than itself. For its end depends on none of the other things, though it
itself is most perfectly united to its end. Hence, it is not required that any potentiality be posited
in the divine will.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] Mutability, similarly, is not required- For, if there is no potentiality in the divine will, God
does not thus prefer one of the opposites among His effects as if He should be thought as being
in potency to both, so that He first wills both in potency and afterward He wills in act; rather, He
wills in act whatever He wills, not only in relation to Himself but also in relation to His effects.
The reason rather is because the object willed does not have a necessary order to the divine
goodness, which is the proper object of the divine will; just as we call enunciables, not necessary,
but possible when there is not a necessary order of the predicate to the subject. Hence, when it
is said, God wills this effect, it is manifest that it is not a necessary enunciable but a possible one,
not in the sense in which something is said to be possible according to some power, but in the
sense in which the possible is that whose existence is neither necessary nor impossible, as the
Philosopher teaches in <i>Metaphysics</i> V [12]. For example, for a triangle to have two equal sides
is a possible enunciable, but not according to some power, since in mathematics there is neither
power nor motion. The exclusion of the aforesaid necessity, therefore, does not take away the
immutability of the divine will. This Sacred Scripture professes: &#8220;But the triumpher in Israel will
not spare, and will not be moved to repentance&#8221; (1 Samuel 15:29).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[8] However, although the divine will is not determined to its effects, we yet cannot say that it
wills none of them, or that in order to will one of them it is determined by an exterior agent. For,
since the apprehended good determines the will as its proper object, and the divine intellect is
not outside God&#8217;s will, because both are His essence, if God&#8217;s will is determined to will
something through the knowledge of His intellect, this determination of the divine will will not
be due to something extraneous. For the divine intellect apprehends not only the divine being,
which is God&#8217;s goodness, but also other goods, as was shown above. These goods it apprehends
as certain likenesses of the divine goodness and essence, not as its principles. And thus, the
divine will tends to them as befitting its goodness, not as necessary to it. The same thing happens
in the case of our own will. When it is inclined to something as absolutely necessary to the end,
it is moved to it with a certain necessity; but when it tends to something only because of a certain
befittingness, it tends to it without necessity. Hence, neither does the divine will tend to its effects
in a necessary way.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[9] Nor, furthermore, is it necessary because of the foregoing to posit something unnatural in
God. For His will wills itself and other things by one and the same act. But its relation to itself
is necessary and natural, whereas its relation to other things is according to a certain
befittingness, not indeed necessary and natural, nor violent and unnatural, but voluntary; for the
voluntary need be neither natural nor violent.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THAT GOD WILLS SOMETHING OTHER THAN HIMSELF WITH THE NECESSITY OF SUPPOSITION</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] From this we may infer that, although among His effects God wills nothing with absolute
necessity, yet He does will something with the necessity of supposition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] For it has been shown that the divine will is immutable. Now, if something is found in any
immutable being, it cannot afterwards not be; for we say that a thing has moved if it is otherwise
disposed now than it was previously. If, then, the divine will is immutable, assuming that it wills
something, God must by supposition will this thing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Again, everything eternal is necessary. Now, that God should will some effect to be is eternal,
for, like His being, so, too, His willing is measured by eternity, and is therefore necessary. But
it is not necessary considered absolutely, because the will of God does not have a necessary
relation to this willed object. Therefore, it is necessary by supposition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Furthermore, whatever God could He can, for His power is not decreased, as neither is His
essence. But He cannot now not will what He is posited as having willed, because His will cannot
be changed. Therefore, at no time could He not will what He has willed. It is therefore necessary
by supposition that He willed whatever He willed, and also that He wills it; neither, however, is
absolutely necessary, but, rather, possible in the aforementioned way.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Moreover, whoever wills something, necessarily wills whatever it necessarily required for it,
unless there be a defect in him either because of ignorance or because he is led astray through
passion from the right choice of that which leads to the intended end. This cannot be said of God.
If God, then, in willing Himself wills something other than Himself, it is necessary that He will
for this object whatever is necessarily required by it. Thus, it is necessary that God will the
rational soul to exist supposing that He wills man to exist.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THAT THE WILL OF GOD IS NOT OF WHAT IS IN ITSELF IMPOSSIBLE</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] From this it appears that the will of God cannot be of the things that are impossible in
themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">For these have a contradiction in themselves, for example, that man is an ass, in which the
rational and the irrational are included. For what is incompatible with something excludes some
of the things that are necessary to it, as to be an ass excludes man&#8217;s reason. If, then, God
necessarily wills the things that are required for what He wills by supposition, it is impossible
for Him to will what is incompatible with these things. Thus, it is impossible for God to will the
absolutely impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Again, as was shown above, in willing His own being, which is His own goodness, God wills
all other things in so far as they bear His likeness. But in so far as a thing is opposed to the nature
of being as such, there cannot be preserved in it the likeness of the first being, namely, the divine
being, which is the source of being. Hence, God cannot will something that is opposed to the
nature of being as such. But just as it is opposed to the nature of man as man to be irrational, so
it is opposed to the nature of being as such that something be at once being and nonbeing. God,
therefore, cannot will that affirmation and negation be true together. But this is included in
everything that is of itself impossible, which has an opposition with itself as implying a
contradiction. The will of God, therefore, cannot be of that which is of itself impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Moreover, the will is only of the understood good. Hence, whatever cannot be the object of
the intellect is not an object of the will. But that which is of itself impossible is not an object of
the intellect, since it is self-contradictory, except, of course, through the fault of one who does
not understand what belongs to things&#8212;which cannot be said of God. Therefore, that which is
of itself impossible cannot be the object of the will.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Furthermore, as a thing is disposed toward being, so it is disposed toward goodness. But the
impossible is that which cannot be. Therefore, it cannot be good, and hence cannot be willed by
God, Who does not will save only the things that are or can be good.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THAT THE DIVINE WILL DOES NOT REMOVE CONTINGENCY FROM THINGS, NOR DOES IT IMPOSE ABSOLUTE NECESSITY ON THEM</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] From what has been said it results that the divine will does not remove contingency from
things, nor does it impose absolute necessity on things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] God wills whatever is required for a thing that He wills, as has been said. But it befits certain
things, according to the mode of their nature, that they be contingent and not necessary.
Therefore, God wills that some things be contingent. Now, the efficacy of the divine will requires
not only that something be that God wills to be, but also that it be as He wills it to be. For, among
natural agents as well, when the acting power is strong it assimilates its effect to itself not only
as to species but also as to the accidents, which are certain modes of that thing. Therefore, the
efficacy of the divine will does not remove contingency.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Moreover, God wills the good of the universe of His effects more principally than He does
any particular good, according as a fuller likeness of His goodness is found in it. But the
completeness of the universe requires that there be some contingent things; otherwise, not all
grades of beings would be contained in the universe. Therefore, God wills that there be some
contingent things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Furthermore, the good of the universe is seen in a certain order, as appears in <i>Metaphysics</i>
XI [10]. But the order of the universe requires that there be some changeable causes, since bodies
are part of the perfection of the universe, and they do not move unless they be moved. Now,
contingent effects follow from a changeable cause, for an effect cannot have a more stable being
than its cause. Hence we see that, even though the remote cause is necessary, provided the
proximate cause is contingent, the effect is contingent, as may be seen in the things that happen
among sublunary bodies, which are contingent because of the contingency of the proximate
causes even though the remote causes, which are the heavenly motions, are necessary. God,
therefore, wills something to come to pass contingently.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] The necessity of supposition in the cause, moreover, does not require an absolute necessity
in the effect. But God wills something in the creature, not by absolute necessity, but only by a
necessity of supposition, as was shown above. From the divine will, therefore, an absolute
necessity in created things cannot be inferred. But only this excludes contingency, for even the
contingents open to opposites are made necessary by supposition: for example, that Socrates be
moved, if he runs, is necessary. Therefore, the divine will does not exclude contingency from the
things it wills.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Hence, it does not follow, if God wills something, that it will of necessity take place. But this
conditional is true and necessary: If God wills something, it will be. But the consequent does not
have to be necessary.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THAT A REASON CAN BE ASSIGNED TO THE DIVINE WILL</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] From what has been said we can infer that a reason can be assigned to the divine will.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] The end is the reason for willing the things that are for the sake of the end. But God wills His
own goodness as the end, and other things He wills as things that are for the sake of the end. His
goodness, therefore, is the reason why He wills the other things which are different from Himself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Again, a particular good is ordered to the good of the whole as to its end, as the imperfect to
the perfect. Now, some things fall under the divine will according to their disposition in the order
of the good. It remains, then, that the good of the universe is the reason why God wills each
particular good in the universe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Again, as was shown above, on the supposition that God wills something, it follows
necessarily that He wills the things required for it. But that which imposes necessity on another
is the reason why that other exists. Therefore, the reason why God wills the things that are
required for each thing is that that thing be for which they are required.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Thus, therefore, can we proceed in assigning the reason of the divine will. God wills man to
have a reason in order that man be; He wills man to be so that the universe may be complete; and
He wills that the good of the universe be because it befits His goodness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] However, this threefold reason does not proceed according to the same relationship. For the
divine goodness neither depends on the perfection of the universe nor is anything added to it from
this perfection. For, although the perfection of the universe necessarily depends on certain
particular goods that are its essential parts, yet on some of them it does not depend of necessity,
but nevertheless a certain goodness or adornment accrues to the universe from them, as from
those things that exist only for the support or adornment of the other parts of the universe. A
particular good depends necessarily on the things that are absolutely required for it, even though
this too has certain things that are for its embellishment. Hence, at times the reason of the divine
will contains only a befittingness; at other times, usefulness; at still other times, a necessity of
supposition; but a necessity that is absolute only when it wills itself.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] Now, although a certain reason of the divine will can be assigned, it does not follow that
anything is the cause of the divine will.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] For to the will the cause of its willing is the end. But the end of the divine will is its goodness.
Hence, it is the cause of God&#8217;s willing, just as it is also His act of will.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] As to the other objects willed by God, none is the cause of willing for God. But one of them
is the cause for the other to have an order to the divine goodness. And thus God is understood
to will one of them for the sake of another.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] It is nevertheless manifest that no discursiveness is to be posited in the divine will. For where
there is one act that is no discursiveness, as was shown above in connection with the intellect.
But by means of one act God wills His goodness and all other things, since His action is His
essence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Through the foregoing is set aside the error of certain persons who said that all things proceed
from God according to His simple will, which means that we are not to give an explanation of
anything except that God wills it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] This view is likewise opposed to Sacred Scripture, which proclaims that God made all things
according to the order of His wisdom, as is said in the Psalm (103:24): &#8220;You made all things in

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] From what has been said it can be shown that free choice is found in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] Free choice is said in relation to the things that one wills, not of necessity, but of his own
accord. Thus, there is in us free choice in relation to our willing to run or to walk. But God wills
things other than Himself without necessity, as was shown above. Therefore, to have free choice
befits God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Again, towards the things to which it is not determined by nature the divine will is in a
manner inclined through its intellect, as was shown above. But on this account is man said to
have free choice as opposed to the other animals because he is inclined to willing by the
judgment of the reason and not by the impulse of nature, as are the brutes. Therefore, in God
there is free choice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Furthermore, according to the Philosopher in <i>Ethics</i> III [5], &#8220;will is of the end, but election
is of that which is for the sake of the end.&#8221; Since, then, God wills Himself as the end, and other
things as what is for the sake of the end, it follows that with reference to Himself God has only
will, but with reference to other things He has election. But election is made by choice.
Therefore, free choice befits God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Moreover, because he has free choice, man is said to be master of his acts. But this supremely
befits the first agent, whose act does not depend on another. Therefore, God has free choice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] This can likewise be gathered from the very meaning of the name. For &#8220;that is free which is
for its own sake,&#8221; according to the Philosopher in the beginning of the <i>Metaphysics</i> [I, 2]. But
this befits no being more than the first cause, God.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THAT IN GOD THERE ARE NOT THE PASSIONS OF THE APPETITES</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] From what has preceded we can know that the passions of the appetites are not in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] Now, according to intellective appetite there is no passion, but only according to sensitive
appetite, as is proved in <i>Physics</i> VII [3]. But no such appetite can be in God, since He does not
have sensitive knowledge, as is manifest from what has been said above. Therefore, there is no
passion of the appetite in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Moreover, every passion of the appetite takes place through some bodily change, for example,
the contraction or distension of the heart, or something of the sort. Now, none of this can take
place in God, since He is not a body or a power in a body, as was shown above. There is,
therefore, no passion of the appetite in Him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Again, in every passion of the appetite the patient is somehow drawn out of his usual, calm,
or connatural disposition. A sign of this is that such passions, if intensified, bring death to
animals. But it is not possible for God to be somehow drawn outside His natural condition, since
He is absolutely immutable, as has been shown. It appears, then, that such passions cannot be
found in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Moreover, every affection arising from a passion is directed determinately to one thing
according to the manner and measure of the passion. For passion has an impulse to something
one, as does nature, and on this account it must be curbed and regulated by reason. But the divine
will is not determined in itself to something one among creatures, except out of the order of its
wisdom, as was shown above. Therefore, there is no passion of the appetite in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Furthermore, every passion belongs to something existing in potency. But God is completely
free from potency, since He is pure act. God, therefore, is solely agent, and in no way does any
passion have a place in Him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] Thus, therefore, by reason of its genus, passion is excluded in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[8] Some passions, however, are excluded from God not only by reason of their genus, but also
by reason of their species. For every passion is specified by its object. That passion, therefore,
whose subject is absolutely unbefitting to God is removed from God even according to the nature
of its proper species.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[9] Such a passion, however, is sorrow or pain, for its subject is the already present evil, just as
the object of joy is the good present and possessed. Sorrow and pain, therefore, of their very
nature cannot be found in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[10] Furthermore, the notion of the object of a given passion is derived not only from good and
evil, but also from the fact that one is disposed in a certain way towards one of them. For it is
thus that hope and joy differ. If, then, the mode itself in which one is disposed toward the object
that is included in the notion of passion is not befitting to God, neither can the passion itself befit
Him, even through the nature of its proper species. Now, although hope has as its object
something good, yet it is not a good already possessed, but one to be possessed. This cannot befit
God, because of His perfection, which is so great that nothing can be added to it. Hope, therefore,
cannot be found in God, even by reason of its species. And likewise, neither can the. desire of
something not possessed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[11] Moreover, just as the divine perfection excludes from God the potency of the addition of
some good to be obtained, so likewise, and all the more, does it exclude the potency to evil. Fear
has reference to the evil that can threaten, as hope has reference to a good to be obtained. By a
twofold reason of its species, therefore, is fear excluded from God: both because it belongs only
to one existing in potency and because it has for its object a threatening evil.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[12] Again, repentance implies a change of affection. Therefore, the nature of repentance
likewise is repugnant to God, not only because it is a species of sadness, but also because it
implies a change of will.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[13] Furthermore, without an error of the cognitive power it is impossible that what is good be
apprehended as evil. Nor is it possible that the evil of one be the good of another, except among
particular goods in which &#8220;the corruption of one is the generation of another.&#8221; But the universal
good does not lose anything because of the existence of some particular good, but is rather
mirrored by each one. God, however, is the universal good, and by participating in His likeness
all things are called good. The evil of no thing, therefore, can be His good. Nor is it possible that
what is absolutely good, and is not evil to itself, He should apprehend as something evil; for His
knowledge is without error, as has been shown. Envy, therefore, cannot be found in God, even
according to the nature of its species, not only because it is a species of sadness, but also because
it is saddened by the good of another and thus takes his good as its own evil.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[14] Moreover, to be saddened over a good and to seek evil are of the same nature, for the first
arises because the good is judged to be evil, while the second arises because evil is judged to be
good. Anger is the appetite of another&#8217;s evil for the sake of revenge. Anger, therefore, is far from
God according to the nature of its species, not only because it is an effect of sadness, but likewise
because it is an appetite for revenge arising from sadness due to an injury received.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[15] Again, whatever other passions are species of these or are caused by them, are for the same
reason removed from God.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THAT IN GOD THERE ARE DELIGHT AND JOY, BUT THEY ARE NOT OPPOSED TO THE DIVINE PERFECTION</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] There are certain passions which, though they do not befit God as passions, do not signify
anything by the nature of their species that is repugnant to the divine perfection.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] Among these passions are joy and delight. Delight is of a present good. Neither, therefore,
by reason of its object, which is a good, nor by reason of its disposition towards its object, which
is possessed in act, is joy, according to the nature of its species, repugnant to the divine
perfection.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] From this it is manifest that joy or delight is properly in God. For just as the apprehended
good and evil are the object of sensible appetite, so, too, are they of intellective appetite. It
belongs to both to seek good and avoid evil, whether truly or by estimation. There is the
difference that the object of intellective appetite is more common than that of the sensitive
appetite, because intellective appetite has reference to good and evil absolutely, whereas sensitive
appetite has reference to good or evil according to the sense. So, too, the object of the intellect
is more common than that of the sense. But the operations of appetite derive their species from
their objects. Hence, there are found in intellective appetite, which is the will, operations that in
the nature of their species are similar to the operations of the sensitive appetite, differing in that
in the sensitive appetite there are passions because of its union to a bodily organ, whereas in the
intellective appetite there are simple operations; for just as through the passion of fear, which
resides in the sensitive appetite, someone flees a future evil, so without passion the intellective
appetite does the same thing. Since, then, joy and delight are not repugnant to God according to
their species, but only in so far as they are passions, and since they are found in the will
according to their species but not as passions, it remains that they are not lacking even to the
divine will.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Again, joy and delight are a certain resting of the will in its object. But God, Who is His own
principal object willed, is supremely at rest in Himself, as containing all abundance in Himself.
God, therefore, through His will supremely rejoices in Himself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Furthermore, delight is a certain perfection of operation, as appears from the Philosopher in
Ethics X [4]; &#8220;for it perfects operation, as does beauty youth.&#8221; But God has the most perfect
operation in understanding, as appears from what has been said. If, then, our understanding is
delightful because of its perfection, the divine understanding will be most full of delight.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Moreover, each thing takes joy in its like as in something agreeable, except by accident in so
far as it may interfere with one&#8217;s own advantage: for example, &#8220;potters quarrel among
themselves&#8221; because one interferes with the profit of the other. Now, every good is a likeness of
the divine good, as was said above, nor does God lose any good because of some good. It
remains, then, that God takes joy in every good.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] joy and delight, then, are properly in God. Now, joy and delight differ in notion. For delight
arises from a really conjoined good, whereas joy does not require this, but the resting of the will
in the object willed suffices for the nature of joy. Hence, delight is only of the conjoined good
if it be taken properly, whereas joy is of a non-conjoined good. From this it is apparent that God
properly delights in Himself, but He takes joy both in Himself and in other things.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] In the same way, there must be love in God according to the act of His will.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] For this belongs properly to the nature of love, that the lover will the good of the one he
loves. Now, God wills His own good and that of others, as appears from what has been said. This
means, therefore, that God loves Himself and other things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Again, for true love it is required that we will someone&#8217;s good as his good. For if we will
someone&#8217;s good only in so far as it leads to the good of another, we love this someone by
accident, just as he who wishes to store wine in order to drink it or loves a man so that this man
may be useful or enjoyable to him, loves the wine or the man by accident, but essentially he loves
himself. But God wills the good of each thing according as it is the good of each thing; for He
wills each thing to be according as it is in itself good (although He likewise orders one thing to
another&#8217;s use). God, then, truly loves Himself and other things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Moreover, since each thing in its own way wills and seeks its proper good, if it is the nature
of love that the lover will and seek the good of the one he loves, it follows that the lover is to the
loved as to that which in some way is one with him. From this the proper nature of love is seen
to consist in this, that the affection of the one tends to the other as to someone who is somehow
one with him. On this account it is said by Dionysius that love is a &#8220;unitive power&#8221; [<i>De div. nom.</i>
IV, 13]. Therefore, the more that through which the lover is one with the one he loves is greater,
the more is the love intense. For we love those whom the origin of birth joins to us, or the way
of life, or something of the sort, more than those whom the community of human nature alone
joins to us. Again, the more the source of the union is intimate to the lover, by so much the
stronger becomes the love. Hence, at times, the love arising from some passion becomes more
intense than the love that is of natural origin or from some habit; but it passes more easily. But
the source whence all things are joined to God, namely, His goodness, which all things imitate,
is what is supreme and most intimate in God, since it is His goodness. There is, therefore, in God
not only a true love, but also a most perfect and a most enduring love.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Again, from the side of its object love does not signify anything repugnant to God, since its
object is the good; neither does it from the mode of its disposition towards its object. For we love
some thing, not less, but more when we have it, because a good is closer to us when we have it.
So, too, a motion to an end among natural things becomes intensified from the nearness of the
end. (The contrary sometimes happens by accident, namely, when in the one we love we
experience something repugnant to love; then the object loved is loved less when it is gained.)
Hence, love is not repugnant to the divine perfection according to the nature of its species.
Therefore, it is found in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Moreover, it belongs to love to move towards union, as Dionysius says. For since, because
of a likeness or congeniality between the lover and the one he loves, the affection of the lover is
in a manner united to the one loved, his appetite tends to the perfection of the union, so that,
namely, the union that has already begun in affection may be completed in act. Hence, it is also
the privilege of friends to take joy in one another&#8217;s presence, in living together, and in
conversation. But God moves all things to union, for in so far as He gives them being and other
perfections, He joins them to Himself in the manner in which this is possible. God, therefore,
loves Himself and other things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] Again, the principle of every affection is love. For joy and desire are only of a good that is
loved, and fear and sadness are only of an evil that is opposed to the good that is loved; and from
these all the other affections take their origin. But in God there is joy and delight, as was shown
above. Therefore, in God there is love.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[8] Now, it might seem to someone that God does not love this thing more than that. For, if
increase or decrease in intensity properly belongs to a changeable nature, it cannot befit God,
from whom all mutability is absent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[9] Again, none of the other things that are said of God in terms of operation are said of Him
according to more and less; for neither does He know one thing more than another, nor does He
take more joy over this thing than over that.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[10] We must therefore observe that, although the other operations of the soul deal with only one
object, love alone seems to be directed to two objects. For by the fact that we understand and
rejoice, we must be somehow related to some object. Love, however, wills something for
someone, for we are said to love the thing to which we wish some good, as explained above.
Hence, the things that we want, absolutely and properly we are said to desire, but not to love;
rather, we love ourselves for whom we want those things: whence it is by accident and
improperly that such things are said to be loved. Now, then, the other operations are susceptible
of more and less only according to the vigor of the action. This cannot take place in God. For the
vigor of an action is measured according to the power by which it is done, and every divine
action belongs to one and the same power. On the other hand, love is said according to more and
less in a twofold way. In one way, from the good that we will to someone, and according to this
we are said to love him more to whom we will the greater good. In a second way, from the vigor
of the action, and in this way we are said to love him more to whom we will with greater fervor
and efficacity, though not a greater good, yet an equal good.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[11] In the first way, nothing prevents us from saying that God loves one thing more than
another, according as He wills it a greater good. In the second way, this cannot be said, for the
same reason that was given in the case of the other operations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[12] It is therefore apparent from what has been said that, from among our affections, there is
none that can properly exist in God save only joy and love; although even these are not in God
as passions, as they are in us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[13] That there are joy and delight in God is confirmed by the authority of Sacred Scripture. For
it is said in a Psalm (15:11): &#8220;At Your right hand there are delights even to the ends.&#8221; In the
Proverbs (8:30), divine Wisdom, which is God, as we have shown, says: &#8220;I... was delighted every
day playing before Him at all times.&#8221; And Luke (15:10): &#8220;There is joy in heaven before the angels
of God upon one sinner doing penance.&#8221; The Philosopher likewise says in <i>Ethics</i> VII [14] that
&#8220;God ever rejoices with one simple delight.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[14] Sacred Scripture likewise records the love of God: &#8220;He hath loved the people&#8221; (Deut. 33:3);
&#8220;I have loved you with an everlasting love&#8221; (Jer. 31:3); &#8220;For the Father Himself loves you&#8221; (John
16:27). Certain philosophers likewise made God&#8217;s love to be the principle of things. With this
view the words of Dionysius agree when he says that &#8220;the divine love did not allow Him to be
without offspring&#8221; [<i>De div. nom.</i> IV, 11].</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[15] It must be noted, however, that the other affections, which in their species are repugnant to
the divine perfection, are also said of God in Sacred Scripture, not indeed properly, as has been
proved, but metaphorically, because of a likeness either in effects or in some preceding affection.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[16] I say of effects because the will at times, following the order of wisdom, tends to that effect
to which someone is inclined because of a defective passion; for a judge punishes from justice,
as the angry man punishes from anger. Hence, God is at times called angry in so far as, following
the order of His wisdom, He wills to punish someone, according to a Psalm (2:13): &#8220;When His
wrath shall be kindled in a short time.&#8221; On the other hand, God is called merciful in so far as out
of His loving-kindness He takes away the miseries of men, just as we do the same thing through
the passion of mercy. Hence the Psalm (102:8): &#8220;The Lord is compassionate and merciful:
longsuffering and plenteous in mercy.&#8221; Sometimes, too, God is said to repent in so far as
according to the eternal and immutable order of His providence He makes what He previously
had destroyed, or destroys what He had previously had made&#8212;as those who are moved by
repentance are found doing. Hence Genesis (6:7): &#8220;I repent that I have made man.&#8221; That this
cannot be taken at the letter appears from what is said in 1 Samuel (15:29): &#8220;But the triumpher
in Israel will not spare, and will not be moved to repentance.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[17] And I say in some preceding affection since love and joy, which are properly in God, are the
principles of the other affections, love in the manner of a moving principle and joy in the manner
of an end. Hence, those likewise who punish in anger rejoice as having gained their end. God,
then, is said to be saddened in so far as certain things take place that are contrary to what He
loves and approves; just as we experience sadness over things that have taken place against our
will. This is apparent in Isaiah ( 59:15-16): God &#8220;saw, and it appeared evil in His eyes, because
there is no judgment. And He saw that there is not a man, and He stood astonished, because there
is none to oppose Himself.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[18] Now, what we have said sets aside the error of certain Jews who attributed anger, sadness,
repentance, and all such passions in their proper sense to God, failing to distinguish what in
Sacred Scripture is said properly and what metaphorically.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">HOW VIRTUES MAY BE HELD TO BE IN GOD</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] Following what has been said, it remains to show how virtues may be posited in God. For just
as God&#8217;s being is universally perfect, containing in itself the perfections of all beings, so His
goodness must in a manner contain the goodness in each and every thing. Now, virtue is a certain
goodness in the virtuous, for &#8220;according to it is one called good, and his work good.&#8221; Therefore,
the divine goodness must contain in its way all the virtues.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] As a consequence, none of them is posited as a habit in God, as happens in our case. For it
does not befit God to be good through something else superadded to Him, but through His
essence, since He is absolutely simple. Nor, likewise, does He act through something added to
His essence, since His action is His being, as has been shown. Hence, His virtue is not some
habit, but His essence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Again, a habit is an imperfect act, as being intermediate between potency and act; hence,
those possessing a habit are compared to those who are asleep. But in God there is most perfect
act. Act, therefore, is not in Him as a habit, for example, science, but as the act of considering,
which is an ultimate and perfect act.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Further, habit is perfective of a power. But in God there is nothing in potency, but only in act.
A habit, therefore, cannot be found in Him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Moreover, a habit is in the genus of accident, which in no way is found in God, as was shown
above. Neither, therefore, is any virtue said of God as a habit, but only according to His essence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Now, since human virtues are those by which human life is directed, and human life is
twofold, contemplative and active, the virtues belonging to the active life, so far as they perfect
this life, cannot befit God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] For man&#8217;s active life consists in the use of bodily goods, and hence the active life is directed
by the virtues by which we make a right use of these goods. Such goods, however, cannot befit
God, nor, therefore, can such virtues so far as they direct this life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[8] Furthermore, such virtues perfect the ways of men in the domain of political life. Hence, for
those who do not take part in such a life the active virtues do not seem very suitable. Much less,
therefore, can they suit God, whose conduct and life is far removed from the manner of human
life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[9] Of the virtues that deal with the active life some, likewise, direct the passions. These we
cannot posit in God. For the virtues that deal with the passions take their species from the
passions as from their proper objects; and so temperance differs from fortitude so far as it deals
with desires, whereas the latter with fear and daring. But in God there are no passions, as has
been shown, and therefore neither can such virtues be found in Him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[10] Again, such virtues are not found in the intellective part of the soul but in the sensitive part,
in which alone passions can be found, as is proved in <i>Physics</i> VII [3]. In God, however, there is
no sensitive part, but only intellect. It remains, then, that such virtues cannot be in God even
according to their proper natures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[11] Of the passions, with which the virtues deal, some exist according to the inclination of the
appetite to some corporeal good that is delightful to the sense, for example, food, drink, and sex.
For the desires of these passions there are <i>sobriety</i> and <i>chastity</i>, and, in general, <i>temperance</i> and
<i>continence</i>. Hence, because bodily delights are absolutely foreign to God, the aforesaid virtues
neither befit God properly, since they deal with passions, nor are they said of God even
metaphorically in Scripture, because there is no available likeness of them in God in terms of a
likeness of some effect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[12] Some passions, however, follow the inclination of the appetite to some spiritual good, such
as honor, power, victory, revenge, and the like; and concerned with their hopes, their darings, and
in general their desires there are <i>fortitude, magnanimity, gentleness</i>, and other like virtues. These,
properly speaking, cannot be found in God, since they deal with passions, but in Scripture they
are said metaphorically of God, because of a likeness in effects. For example, what is said in 1
Samuel (2:2): &#8220;There is no one as strong as our God&#8221;; and Micah [rather, Zephaniah 2:31: &#8220;Seek
the just, seek the meek.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THAT IN GOD THERE ARE THE MORAL VIRTUES THAT DEAL WITH ACTIONS</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] Now, there are some virtues directing the active life of man that do not deal with passions,
but with actions: for example, truth, justice, liberality, magnificence, prudence, and art.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] Since, however, virtue derives its species from its object or its matter, and since the actions
that are the matter or the objects of such virtues are not repugnant to the divine perfection, neither
do these virtues, according to their proper species, have anything on whose account they are
excluded from the divine perfection.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Again, these virtues are certain perfections of the intellect and the will, which are principles
of operation without passion. But in God there are intellect and will, lacking no perfection.
Therefore, these virtues cannot be absent from God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Moreover, of the things that come into being from God the proper model is in the divine
intellect, as was shown above. Now, the model in the mind of the maker of the thing to be made
is art. Hence, the Philosopher says in <i>Ethics</i> VI [4] that &#8220;art is the true model of things to be
made.&#8221; Art, then, is properly in God. And therefore it is said in Wisdom (7:21): &#8220;the artisan of
all things has taught me wisdom.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Again, the divine will, with reference to things other than God, is determined to one effect
by His knowledge, as was shown above. But the knowledge directing the will to act is prudence;
for, according to the Philosopher in <i>Ethics</i> VI [5], &#8220;prudence is the true notion of the things to
be done.&#8221; There is, therefore, prudence in God. And this is what is said in Job (12:13): &#8220;With
Him is prudence and strength.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Furthermore, it was shown above that because God wills something He also wills those things
that are necessary to it. But that which is necessary to the perfection of each thing is due to it.
Therefore, there is justice in God, to which it belongs to give to each one what belongs to him.
Hence it is said in a Psalm (3.o:8): &#8220;The Lord is just and loves justice.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] Moreover, as was shown above, the ultimate end for which God wills all things in no way
depends on the things that exist for the sake of the end, and this either as to being or as to some
perfection. Hence, He does not will to give to someone His goodness so that thereby something
may accrue to Himself, but because for Him to make such a gift befits Him as the fount of
goodness. But to give something not for the sake of some benefit expected from the giving, but
because of the goodness and befittingness of the giving, is an act of liberality, as appears from
the Philosopher in <i>Ethics</i> IV [1]. God, therefore, is supremely liberal; and, as Avicenna says, He
alone can truly be called liberal, for every agent other than God acquires some good from his
action, which is the intended end.&#8221; Scripture sets forth this liberality of God, saying in a Psalm
(103:28): &#8220;When You open Your hand, they shall all be filled with good&#8221;; and in James (1:5):
&#8220;Who gives to all men abundantly without reproaching.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[8] Again, all things that receive being from God must bear His likeness in so far as they are, are
good, and have their proper models in the divine intellect, as was shown above. But it belongs
to the virtue of truth, as appears from the Philosopher in <i>Ethics</i> IV [7], for someone in his deeds
and words to show himself such as he is. Therefore, there is in God the virtue of truth. Hence,
Romans (3:4): &#8220;But God is true&#8221;; and the Psalm (118:151): &#8220;All Your ways are truth.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[9] But, if there are any virtues that deal with notions belonging to subordinates in relation to
their superiors, such cannot befit God: for example, obedience, worship, or something of the sort
that is due a superior.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[10] If, furthermore, some of the aforementioned virtues have certain imperfect acts, the virtues
in question cannot be attributed to God according to those acts. Thus, prudence, according to the
act of taking good counsel, does not befit God. For, since counsel is &#8220;a certain inquiry,&#8221; as is said
in <i>Ethics</i> VI [9], and the divine knowledge is not inquiring, as was shown above, to take counsel
cannot befit God. Hence Job (26:3): &#8220;How you have counseled him who has no wisdom!&#8221;; and
Isaiah (40:14): &#8220;Whom has He consulted: and who has instructed Him?&#8221; But as to the act that
consists in judging the matter of counsel and choosing what has been approved, nothing prevents
prudence from being said of God. Nevertheless, counsel is at times said of God. This is either
because of the likeness in privacy, since counsels take place in private, so that what is hidden in
the divine wisdom is called by likeness counsel, as appears in Isaiah in the other version: &#8220;May
Your ancient counsel be verified&#8221; (25:1 Septuagint); or in so far as He gives satisfaction to those
who seek His counsel, since one who has understanding can, even without any discursiveness,
instruct the inquiring.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[11] In the same way, justice, as concerns the act of commutative justice, cannot befit God, since
He does not receive anything from anyone. Hence Romans (11:35): &#8220;Who hath first given to Him
and recompense shall be made him?&#8221; And Job (41:2): &#8220;Who hath given me before that I should
repay him?&#8221; Through a likeness, however, we are said to give some things to God in so far as
God looks with favor upon our gifts. Commutative justice, therefore, does not befit God, but only
distributive. Hence, Dionysius says that &#8220;God is praised for His justice as giving to all according
to their worth&#8221; [<i>De div. nom.</i> VIII, 3]. And in the words of Matthew (25:15): &#8220;He gave... to every
one according to his proper ability.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[12] We must observe, however, that the actions with which the above virtues deal, do not
according to their natures depend on man; for to judge of the things that are to be done, or to give
or distribute something, does not belong to man alone but to any being possessing an intellect.
Yet, in so far as these are narrowed to the human sphere, in a manner they receive their species
from them, as the curvature in a nose produces the species of the snub. The aforementioned
virtues, therefore, according as they order man&#8217;s active life, are ordered to these actions in so far
as they are narrowed to human affairs and take their species from them. In this manner they
cannot befit God. But in so far as the aforementioned actions are taken in their generality, they
can be attributed even to divine things. For just as man is a distributor of human goods, such as
money and honor, so too God is the distributor of all the goods of the universe. The
aforementioned virtues, therefore, are of a more universal extension in God than in man; for as
the justice of man is to the community or the household, so the justice of God is to the whole
universe. Hence, the divine virtues are said to be the exemplar virtues of ours; for the things that
are contracted and particularized are the likenesses of certain absolute beings, just as the light of
a candle is to the light of the sun. As for the other virtues, which do not properly befit God, they
do not have an exemplar in the divine nature, but only in the divine wisdom, which contains the
proper likenesses of all beings: this is the case with other corporeal beings.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] Concerning the contemplative virtues there can be no doubt that they supremely befit God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] For if wisdom consists in the knowledge of the highest causes, according to the Philosopher
in the beginning of the <i>Metaphysics</i> [I, 2], and if God especially knows Himself, and does not
know anything, as has been proved, except by knowing Himself Who is the first cause of all
things, it is manifest that wisdom must most especially be attributed to Him. Hence Job (9:4):
&#8220;He is wise in heart&#8221;; and Sirach (1:1): &#8220;All wisdom is from the Lord God, and hath been always
with Him.&#8221; The Philosopher also says in the beginning of the <i>Metaphysics</i> [I, 2] that wisdom is
a divine possession, not a human one.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Again, if science is the knowledge of a thing through its cause, and if God knows the order
of all causes and effects, and thereby knows the proper causes of singulars, as was shown above,
it is manifest that in a proper sense there is science in Him. Nevertheless, this is not the science
caused by ratiocination, as our science is caused by demonstration. Hence 1 Samuel (2:3): &#8220;For
the Lord is the God of all knowledge.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Furthermore, if the immaterial knowledge of some things without discursiveness is intellect,
and God has such knowledge of all things, as was shown above, there is therefore intellect in
God. Hence Job (12:13): &#8220;He hath counsel and understanding.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] These virtues, likewise, are in God the exemplars of ours, as the perfect of the imperfect.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] From what has been said it can be shown that God cannot will evil.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] For the virtue of a being is that by which he operates well. Now every operation of God is an
operation of virtue, since His virtue is His essence, as was shown above. Therefore, God cannot
will evil.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Again, the will never aims at evil without some error existing in the reason, at least with
respect to a particular object of choice. For, since the object of the will is the apprehended good,
the will cannot aim at evil unless in some way it is proposed to it as a good; and this cannot take
place without error. But in the divine knowledge there cannot be error, as was shown above.
God&#8217;s will cannot, therefore, tend towards evil.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Moreover, God is the highest good, as has been shown. But the highest good cannot bear any
mingling with evil, as neither can the highest hot thing bear any mingling with the cold. The
divine will, therefore, cannot be turned to evil.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Furthermore, since the good has the nature of an end, evil cannot enter the will except by
turning away from the end. But the divine will cannot be turned from the end, since it can will
nothing except by willing itself. Therefore, it cannot will evil.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] And thus it appears that free choice in God naturally stands abiding in the -good.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] This is what is said in Deuteronomy (32:4): &#8220;God is faithful and without any iniquity&#8221;; and

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] For as love is to the good, so hatred is to evil; for to those we love we will good, and to those
we hate, evil. If, then, the will of God cannot be inclined to evil, as has been shown, it is
impossible that He should hate anything.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Again, the will of God is directed to things other than Himself, as has been shown, in so far
as, by willing and loving His own being and His own goodness, God wills it to be diffused as
much as possible through the communication of likeness. This, then, is what God wills in other
things, that there be in them the likeness of His goodness. But this is the good of each thing,
namely, to participate in the likeness of God; for every other goodness is nothing other than a
certain likeness of the first goodness. Therefore, God wills good to each thing. Hence, He hates
nothing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Furthermore, from the first being all the others take the origin of their being. If, then, God
hates anything among the things that are, He wills it not to be, since to be is each thing&#8217;s good.
He wills, therefore, the non-existence of His own action by which that thing is brought into being
either mediately or immediately. For it was shown above that, if God wills something, He must
will the things that are necessary for it. Now, this is impossible. This is apparent if things come
into being through His will, for then the action by which things are produced must be voluntary.
The same is the case if God is by nature the cause of things, for, just as His nature is pleasing to
Him, so whatever His nature requires is pleasing to Him. God, therefore, does not hate anything.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Moreover, that which is found in all naturally active causes must be especially found in the
first cause. But all agents in their own way love their effects as such: thus, parents love their
children, poets their poetry, and artists their works. All the more, then, does God not hate
anything, since He is the cause of all things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] This is what is said in Wisdom (11:25): &#8220;For You lovest all the things that are, and batest
none of the things which You hast made.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] However, God is said by similitude to hate some things, and this in a twofold way. In the first
way, because God, in loving things and by willing the existence of their good, wills the non-existence of the contrary evil. Hence, He is said to have a hatred of evils, for we are said to hate
what we will not to exist. In the words of Zechariah (8:17): &#8220;And let none of you imagine evil
in your hearts against his friend and love not a false oath. For all these are the things that I hate,
saith the Lord.&#8221; These, however, are not effects in the manner of subsisting things, to which
properly love and hate refer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[8] The second way arises from the fact that God wills some greater good that cannot be without
the loss of some lesser good. And thus He is said to hate, although this is rather to love. For thus,
inasmuch as He wills the good of justice or of the order of the universe, which cannot exist
without the punishment or corruption of some things, God is said to hate the things whose
punishment or corruption He wills. In the words of Malachi (1:3): &#8220;I have hated Esau&#8221;; and the
Psalms (5:7): &#8220;You hate all workers of iniquity: You destroy all who speak a lie. The bloody and
the deceitful man the Lord will abhor.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THAT GOD IS LIVING</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] From what has already been proved it necessarily follows that God is living.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] For it has been shown that God is understanding and willing, and the acts of understanding
and willing belong only to a living being. Therefore, God is living.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Again, to live is attributed to some beings because they are seen to move themselves, but not
to be moved by another. And on this account the things that seem to be moved by themselves,
whose movers people in general do not perceive, we call by similitude living: for example, the
living water of a flowing spring, but not the water of a cistern or a stagnant pool; or quicksilver,
which appears to have a certain movement. For, in a proper sense, those things move through
themselves that move themselves, being composed of a mover and something moved, for
example, animate things. These alone we properly say are living, while all other things are moved
by some exterior agent, be it a generating cause, or one removing an obstacle, or an impelling
cause. And because all sensible operations involve motion, everything that moves itself to its
own operations is further said to live, though this be not with motion; and so understanding,
appetition, and sensing are actions of life. But it is supremely true of God that He does not act
from another, but through Himself, since He is the first agent. Therefore, to live belongs to Him
in a supreme way.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Again, the divine being comprehends every perfection of being, as has been shown. But to
live is a certain perfection, which is why living things in the order of being are higher than non-living things. Hence, the divine being is living. Therefore, God is living.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] This is likewise confirmed by the authority of the divine Scripture. For it is said in
Deuteronomy (32:40) in the person of the Lord: &#8220;I will say: I live forever&#8221;; and in a Psalm (83:3):
&#8220;My heart and my flesh have rejoiced in the living God.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] From this it further appears that God is His life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] For the life of the living being is the very act of living signified in an abstract manner, as
running is in reality nothing other than to run. Now, &#8220;to live is for the living their very being,&#8221;
as appears from the Philosopher in <i>De anima</i> II [4]. For, since an animal is said to be living
because it has a soul, through which it has being as through its proper form, it follows that to live
is nothing other than such a being arising from such a form. But God is His own being, as was
proved above. Therefore, He is His own act of living and His own life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Again, understanding is a certain way of living, as appears from the Philosopher in <i>De anima</i>
II [2]; for to live is the act of a living being. But God is His own understanding, as was shown
above, and therefore He is His own act of living and His own life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Moreover, if God were not His life, since He is living, as has been shown, it would follow
that He would be living through the participation of life. But everything that is through
participation is reduced to that which is through itself. Therefore, God would be reduced to
something prior, through which He would be living. This is impossible, as is apparent from what
has been said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Furthermore, if God is living, as has been shown, there must be life in Him. If, then, He is not
His own life, there will be something in Him that is not He.. Thus, He will be composite, which
has been disproved.&#8221; Therefore, God is His life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] This is what is said in John (14:6): &#8220;I am... the life.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] From this it appears that God&#8217;s life is everlasting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] Nothing ceases to live except through separation from life. But nothing can be separated from
God, since every separation takes place through the division of something from something. It is
therefore impossible that God cease to live, since He is His life, as has been shown.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Again, everything that at times is and at times is not is through some cause, for nothing leads
itself from nonbeing to being, since that which does not yet exist does not act. But the divine life
has no cause, as neither does the divine being. Hence, God is not at times living and at times not-living, but He always lives. Therefore, His life is everlasting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Furthermore, in every operation the agent abides, even though at times the operation passes
through succession. Hence, in motion likewise, the movable remains the same in subject during
the whole motion, although not in situation. Where, therefore, the action is the agent itself, of
necessity nothing there passes through succession, but the whole remains all together. But the
understanding and living of God are God Himself, as has been shown. Therefore, His life has no
succession, but is life all together. Therefore, it is everlasting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Moreover, God is absolutely immobile, as was shown above. But what begins to live and
ceases to live, or in living suffers succession, is mutable. For one&#8217;s life begins through
generation, it ceases through corruption, and as to succession, it exists because of some motion.
But God neither began to live, nor will He cease to live, not in living does He suffer any
succession. Therefore, His life is everlasting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Hence what is said in Deuteronomy (32:40) in the person of the Lord: &#8220;I live forever&#8221;; and

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in">THAT GOD IS BLESSED</span>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] It remains from the foregoing to show that God is blessed.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] The proper good of every intellectual nature is blessedness. Since, then, God is intelligent, His proper good will be blessedness. But He is not related to His proper good as is something that tends to a good not yet possessed, since this belongs to a nature that is movable and existing in potency; He is related rather as that which alreadypossesses its proper good. Therefore, He not only desires blessedness, as we do, but enjoys it. Therefore, He is blessed.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Moreover, that is supremely desired or willed by an intellectual nature which is most perfect in it; and this is its blessedness. But the most perfect thing in each being is its most perfect operation. For potency and habit are perfected by operation, and so the Philosopher says that "felicity is perfect operation" [Ethics X, 7]. But the perfection of operation depends on four things. First, on its genus, namely, that it be abiding in its operating cause. By an operation that abides in its cause I mean one through which nothing takes place but the operation itself: for example, to see and to hear. For these are the perfections of the beings whose operations they are, and can be ultimate because they are not ordered to something made as to their end. On the other hand, the operation or the action from which there follows some result beyond the action itself is the perfection of the thing produced, and not of the operating cause, and is related to it as to an end. Hence, such an operation of an intellectual nature is not blessedness or felicity. Second, it depends on the principle of operation, namely, that it be the operation of the highest power. Hence, there is not felicity in us according to the operation of sense, butt according to the operation of the intellect, and one perfected by a habit. Third, it depends on the object of operation. On this account, the highest felicity in us consists in understanding the highest intelligible. Fourth, it depends on the form of the operation, namely, that it be easily, firmly, and with delight. Such, however, is the operation of God, since He is intelligent, and His the highest power, nor does He need any perfecting habit, because He is perfect in Himself, as was shown above. Furthermore, He understands Himself, being the highest intelligible, and this perfectly, without any difficulty, and with delight. God is, therefore, blessed.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Furthermore, through blessedness every desire is given rest, because, when blessedness is possessed, nothing else remains to be desired, since it is the ultimate end. He must, therefore, be blessed who is perfect in relation to all the things that He can desire. Hence, Boethius says that blessedness is "a state made perfect by the accumulation of all goods" [<I>De consolatione philosophiae</I> III, 2]. But such is the divine perfection, because it comprehends all perfection in a certain simplicity, as was shown above. Therefore, God is truly blessed.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Again, as long as someone is missing something that he needs, he is not yet blessed, for his desire is not yet at rest. Whoever, therefore, is self-sufficient, needing nothing, he is blessed. But it ha's been shown above that God does not need other things, since His perfection depends on nothing outside Himself, nor does God will other things for His own sake as though He needed them, but solely because this befits His goodness. Therefore, He is blessed.
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Furthermore, it was shown above that God cannot will something impossible. But it is
impossible that God should receive what He does not already have, since He is in no way in
potency, as has been shown. Therefore, He cannot will to have anything that He does not have.
Hence, whatever He wills, He has. Nor does He will anything evil, as was shown above. He is
therefore blessed, in the manner in which some proclaim the blessed man to be &#8220;be who has
whatever He wills and who wills nothing evil.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] Sacred Scripture, furthermore, proclaims the blessedness of God: &#8220;Which in His times He
shall show Who is the Blessed and only Mighty&#8221; (1 Tim. 6:15).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] From this it is apparent that God is His blessedness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] For His blessedness is a certain intellectual operation, as has been shown. But it was shown
above that His understanding is His substance. Therefore, He is His blessedness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Again, blessedness, since it is the ultimate end, is that which he who can have it, or has it,
principally wills. But it was shown above that God principally wills His essence. Therefore, His
essence is His blessedness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Furthermore, everyone relates to his blessedness whatever he wills. For it is what is not
desired for the sake of something else, and that in which terminates the motion of the desire of
someone desiring one thing for the sake of another&#8212;so that the motion may not be infinite.
Since, then, God wills all other things for the sake of His goodness, which is His essence, it is
necessary that, just as He is His essence and His goodness, He be His blessedness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Moreover, that there be two highest goods is impossible. For, if one lacked something that
the other had, neither would be highest and perfect. But God was shown above to be the highest
good. Blessedness will also be shown to be the highest good because it is the ultimate end.
Therefore, blessedness and God are identical. Therefore, God is His blessedness.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">THAT THE PERFECT AND UNIQUE BLESSEDNESS OF GOD EXCELS EVERY OTHER BLESSEDNESS</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[1] From what has preceded we may further examine the excellence of the divine blessedness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[2] The nearer something is to blessedness, the more blessed it is. Hence, although a man may
be called blessed because he hopes to obtain blessedness, in no way does his blessedness
compare with the blessedness of the one who already possesses it in act. But the thing nearest to
blessedness is blessedness itself. This has been shown of God. Therefore, God is in a unique way
perfectly blessed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[3] Again, since delight is caused by love, as has been shown, the possession of what is Joved.
But, other things being equal, each thing loves itself more than another, and a sign of this is that
the nearer a thing is to something else the more it is naturally loved. God, therefore, delights
more in His blessedness, which He Himself is, than do other blessed ones in the blessedness
which is not they themselves. The desire has therefore all the more repose, and the blessedness
is all the more perfect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[4] Furthermore, that which is through its essence is more excellent than what is said by
participation: for example, the nature of fire is found more perfectly in fire itself than in things
that are on fire. But God is blessed through His essence, and this befits no other being, since no
being other than He can be the highest good, as can be seen from what has been said. And thus,
whoever other than God is blessed, must be called blessed by participation. The divine
blessedness, therefore, excels every other blessedness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[5] Moreover, blessedness consists in the perfect operation of the intellect, as has been shown.
But no other intellectual operation can compare with God&#8217;s operation. 11is is evident not only
because it is a subsistent operation but also because by one operation God knows Himself as
perfectly as He is perfect, as well as all other things, those that are and those that are not, the
good and the evil. But in all other beings with an intellect, the operation of the intellect is not
itself subsistent, but the act of something subsistent. Nor, again, is God Himself, Who is the
highest intelligible, understood by anyone as perfectly as He is perfect, since the being of no
thing is as perfect as the divine being, nor can the operation of any being be more perfect than
its substance. Nor, still, is there another intellect that knows also all the things that God can
make, for then it would comprehend the divine power. And even as to the things that another
intellect knows, it does not know them all by one and the same operation. God, therefore, is
blessed above all things beyond compare.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[6] Again, the more something is united, by so much the more are its power and goodness more
perfect. But a successive operation is divided according to the diverse parts of time. Its
perfection, therefore, can in no way be compared to the perfection of an operation that is all at
once without succession, and this especially if it does not pass away in a moment but abides for
eternity. Now, in God, to understand exists eternally all at once and without succession, whereas
in us to understand implies succession because continuity and time are by accident joined to it.
Hence, the divine blessedness infinitely excels human blessedness, as the duration of eternity
excels the flowing now of time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[7] Furthermore, weariness and the various cares with which perforce our contemplation in this
life is mingled (in this contemplation human felicity especially consists, if by chance there is such
in the present life), and the errors, doubts and hazards to which the present life is exposed show
that human felicity, especially that of the present life, cannot at all compare with the divine
blessedness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[8] Moreover, the perfection of the divine blessedness can be observed from the fact that it
includes within itself every blessedness in a most perfect way. For contemplative felicity God has
the most perfect and everlasting consideration of Himself and other things. For active felicity He
has the government, not of the life of one man, or of a household, a city, or a kingdom, but of the
whole universe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[9] As for false and earthly felicity, it contains no more than a shadow of that most perfect
felicity. For it consists in five things, according to Boethius [<i>De consolatione philosophiae</i> III,
2]; namely, in pleasure, riches, power, honor, and fame. But God enjoys a most excelling delight
in Himself, as well as a universal joy in all things, without the admixture of any contrary. For
wealth, He has the all-abundant sufficiency of all good things within Himself, as was shown
above. For power, He has His infinite strength. For honor, He has the primacy and rule over all
beings. For fame, He has the admiration of every intellect that knows Him however little.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">To Him, then, Who is singularly blessed, be, honor and glory unto the ages of ages. Amen.</p>
