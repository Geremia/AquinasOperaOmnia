    “My mouth shall meditate truth, and my lips shall hate impiety” (Prov. 8:7).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    [1] The usage of the multitude, which according to the Philosopher is to be
    followed in giving names to things, has commonly held that they are to be
    called wise who order things rightly and govern them well. Hence, among
    other things that men have conceived about the wise man, the Philosopher
    includes the notion that “it belongs to the wise man to order.” Now, the
    rule of government and order for all things directed to an end must be taken
    from the end. For, since the end of each thing is its good, a thing is then
    best disposed when it is fittingly ordered to its end. And so we see among
    the arts that one functions as the governor and the ruler of another because
    it controls its end. Thus, the art of medicine rules and orders the art of
    the chemist because health, with which medicine is concerned, is the end of
    all the medications prepared by the art of the chemist. A similar situation
    obtains in the art of ship navigation in relation to shipbuilding, and in
    the military art with respect to the equestrian art and the equipment of
    war. The arts that rule other arts are called architectonic, as being the
    ruling arts. That is why the artisans devoted to these arts, who are called
    master artisans, appropriate to themselves the name of wise men. But, since
    these artisans are concerned, in each case, with the ends of certain
    particular things, they do not reach to the universal end of all things.
    They are therefore said to be wise with respect to this or that thing; in
    which sense it is said that “as a wise architect, I have laid the
    foundation” (1 Cor. 3:10). The name of the absolutely wise man, however, is
    reserved for him whose consideration is directed to the end of the universe,
    which is also the origin of the universe. That is why, according to the
    Philosopher, it belongs to the wise man to consider the highest causes.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    [2] Now, the end of each thing is that which is intended by its first author
    or mover. But the first author and mover of the universe is an intellect, as
    will be later shown. The ultimate end of the universe must, therefore, be
    the good of an intellect. This good is truth. Truth must consequently be the
    ultimate end of the whole universe, and the consideration of the wise man
    aims principally at truth. So it is that, according to His own statement,
    divine Wisdom testifies that He has assumed flesh and come into the world in
    order to make the truth known: “For this was I born, and for this came I
    into the world, that I should give testimony to the truth” (John 18:37). The
    Philosopher himself establishes that first philosophy is the science of
    truth, not of any truth, but of that truth which is the origin of all truth,
    namely, which belongs to the first principle whereby all things are. The
    truth belonging to such a principle is, clearly, the source of all truth;
    for things have the same disposition in truth as in being.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    [3] It belongs to one and the same science, however, both to pursue one of
    two contraries and to oppose the other. Medicine, for example, seeks to
    effect health and to eliminate illness. Hence, just as it belongs to the
    wise man to meditate especially on the truth belonging to the first
    principle and to teach it to others, so it belongs to him to refute the
    opposing falsehood.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    [4] Appropriately, therefore, is the twofold office of the wise man shown
    from the mouth of Wisdom in our opening words: to meditate and speak forth
    of the divine truth, which is truth in person (Wisdom touches on this in the
    words my mouth shall meditate truth), and to refute the opposing error
    (which Wisdom touches on in the words and my lips shall hate impiety). By
    impiety is here meant falsehood against the divine truth. This falsehood is
    contrary to religion, which is likewise named piety. Hence, the falsehood
    contrary to it is called impiety.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Among all human pursuits, the pursuit of wisdom is more perfect,
        more noble, more useful, and more full of joy.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is more perfect because, in so far as a man gives himself to the
        pursuit of wisdom, so far does he even now have some share in true
        beatitude. And so a wise man has said: “Blessed is the man that shall
        continue in wisdom” (Sirach 14:22).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is more noble because through this pursuit man especially approaches
        to a likeness to God Who “made all things in wisdom” (Ps. 103:24). And
        since likeness is the cause of love, the pursuit of wisdom especially
        joins man to God in friendship. That is why it is said of wisdom that
        “she is an infinite treasure to men! which they that use become the
        friends of God” (Wis. 7:14).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is more useful because through wisdom we arrive at the kingdom of
        immortality. For “the desire of wisdom leads to the everlasting kingdom”
        (Wis. 6:21).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It is more full of joy because “her conversation has no bitterness, nor
        her company any tediousness, but joy and gladness” (Wis. 7:16).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] And so, in the name of the divine Mercy, I have the confidence to
        embark upon the work of a wise man, even though this may surpass my
        powers, and I have set myself the task of making known, as far as my
        limited powers will allow, the truth that the Catholic faith professes,
        and of setting aside the errors that are opposed to it. To use the words
        of Hilary: “I am aware that I owe this to God as the chief duty of my
        life, that my every word and sense may speak of Him” [
        <i>De Trinitate</i> I, 37].
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] To proceed against individual errors, however, is a difficult
        business, and this for two reasons. In the first place, it is difficult
        because the sacrilegious remarks of individual men who have erred are
        not so well known to us so that we may use what they say as the basis of
        proceeding to a refutation of their errors. This is, indeed, the method
        that the ancient Doctors of the Church used in the refutation of the
        errors of the Gentiles. For they could know the positions taken by the
        Gentiles since they themselves had been Gentiles, or at least had lived
        among the Gentiles and had been instructed in their teaching. In the
        second place, it is difficult because some of them, such as the
        Mohammedans and the pagans, do not agree with us in accepting the
        authority of any Scripture, by which they may be convinced of their
        error. Thus, against the Jews we are able to argue by means of the Old
        Testament, while against heretics we are able to argue by means of the
        New Testament. But the Muslims and the pagans accept neither the one nor
        the other. We must, therefore, have recourse to the natural reason, to
        which all men are forced to give their assent. However, it is true, in
        divine matters the natural reason has its failings.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Now, while we are investigating some given truth, we shall also show
        what errors are set aside by it; and we shall likewise show how the
        truth that we come to know by demonstration is in accord with the
        Christian religion.

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] The way of making truth known is not always the same, and, as the
        Philosopher has very well said, “it belongs to an educated man to seek
        such certitude in each thing as the nature of that thing allows.” The
        remark is also introduced by Boethius [ <i>De Trinitate</i> II]. But,
        since such is the case, we must first show what way is open to us in
        order that we may make known the truth which is our object.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] There is a twofold mode of truth in what we profess about God. Some
        truths about God exceed all the ability of the human reason. Such is the
        truth that God is triune. But there are some truths which the natural
        reason also is able to reach. Such are that God exists, that He is one,
        and the like. In fact, such truths about God have been proved
        demonstratively by the philosophers, guided by the light of the natural
        reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] That there are certain truths about God that totally surpass man’s
        ability appears with the greatest evidence. Since, indeed, the principle
        of all knowledge that the reason perceives about some thing is the
        understanding of the very substance of that being (for according to
        Aristotle “what a thing is” is the principle of demonstration) [
        <i>Posterior Analytics</i> II, 3], it is necessary that the way in which
        we understand the substance of a thing determines the way in which we
        know what belongs to it. Hence, if the human intellect comprehends the
        substance of some thing, for example, that of a stone or of a triangle,
        no intelligible characteristic belonging to that thing surpasses the
        grasp of the human reason. But this does not happen to us in the case of
        God. For the human intellect is not able to reach a comprehension of the
        divine substance through its natural power. For, according to its manner
        of knowing in the present life, the intellect depends on the sense for
        the origin of knowledge; and so those things that do not fall under the
        senses cannot be grasped by the human intellect except in so far as the
        knowledge of them is gathered from sensible things. Now, sensible things
        cannot lead the human intellect to the point of seeing in them the
        nature of the divine substance; for sensible things are effects that
        fall short of the power of their cause. Yet, beginning with sensible
        things, our intellect is led to the point of knowing about God that He
        exists, and other such characteristics that must be attributed to the
        First Principle. There are, consequently, some intelligible truths about
        God that are open to the human reason; but there are others that
        absolutely surpass its power.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] We may easily see the same point from the gradation of intellects.
        Consider the case of two persons of whom one has a more penetrating
        grasp of a thing by his intellect than, does the other. He who has the
        superior intellect understands many things that the other cannot grasp
        at all. Such is the case with a very simple person who cannot at all
        grasp the subtle speculations of philosophy. But the intellect of an
        angel surpasses the human intellect much more than the intellect of the
        greatest philosopher surpasses the intellect of the most uncultivated
        simple person; for the distance between the best philosopher and a
        simple person is contained within the limits of the human species, which
        the angelic intellect surpasses. For the angel knows God on the basis of
        a more noble effect than does man; and this by as much as the substance
        of an angel, through which the angel in his natural knowledge is led to
        the knowledge of God, is nobler than sensible things and even than the
        soul itself, through which the human intellect mounts to the knowledge
        of God. The divine intellect surpasses the angelic intellect much more
        than the angelic surpasses the human. For the divine intellect is in its
        capacity equal to its substance, and therefore it understands fully what
        it is, including all its intelligible attributes. But by his natural
        knowledge the angel does not know what God is, since the substance
        itself of the angel, through which he is led to the knowledge of God, is
        an effect that is not equal to the power of its cause. Hence, the angel
        is not able, by means of his natural knowledge, to grasp all the things
        that God understands in Himself; nor is the human reason sufficient to
        grasp all the things that the angel understands through his own natural
        power. Just as, therefore, it would he the height of folly for a simple
        person to assert that what a philosopher proposes is false on the ground
        that he himself cannot understand it, so (and even more so) it is the
        acme of stupidity for a man to suspect as false what is divinely
        revealed through the ministry of the angels simply because it cannot be
        investigated by reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] The same thing, moreover, appears quite clearly from the defect that
        we experience every day in our knowledge of things. We do not know a
        great many of the properties of sensible things, and in most cases we
        are not able to discover fully the natures of those properties that we
        apprehend by the sense. Much more is it the case, therefore, that the
        human reason is not equal to the task of investigating all the
        intelligible characteristics of that most excellent substance.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] The remark of Aristotle likewise agrees with this conclusion. He
        says that “our intellect is related to the prime beings, which are most
        evident in their nature, as the eye of an owl is related to the sun” [
        <i>Metaphysics</i> Ia, 1]
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Sacred Scripture also gives testimony to this truth. We read in Job:
        “Do you think you can comprehend the depths of God, and find the limit
        of the Almighty?” (11:7). And again: “Behold, God is great, exceeding
        our knowledge” (Job 36:26). And St. Paul: “We know in part” (1 Cor.
        13:9).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] We should not, therefore, immediately reject as false, following the
        opinion of the Manicheans and many unbelievers, everything that is said
        about God even though it cannot be investigated by reason.

        [1] Since, therefore, there exists a twofold truth concerning the divine
        being, one to which the inquiry of the reason can reach, the other which
        surpasses the whole ability of the human reason, it is fitting that both
        of these truths be proposed to man divinely for belief. This point must
        first be shown concerning the truth that is open to the inquiry of the
        reason; otherwise, it might perhaps seem to someone that, since such a
        truth can be known by the reason, it was uselessly given to men through
        a supernatural inspiration as an object of belief.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Yet, if this truth were left solely as a matter of inquiry for the
        human reason, three awkward consequences would follow.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] The first is that few men would possess the knowledge of God. For
        there are three reasons why most men are cut off from the fruit of
        diligent inquiry which is the discovery of truth. Some do not have the
        physical disposition for such work. As a result, there are many who are
        naturally not fitted to pursue knowledge; and so, however much they
        tried, they would be unable to reach the highest level of human
        knowledge which consists in knowing God. Others are cut off from
        pursuing this truth by the necessities imposed upon them by their daily
        lives. For some men must devote themselves to taking care of temporal
        matters. Such men would not be able to give so much time to the leisure
        of contemplative inquiry as to reach the highest peak at which human
        investigation can arrive, namely, the knowledge of God. Finally, there
        are some who are cut off by indolence. In order to know the things that
        the reason can investigate concerning God, a knowledge of many things
        must already be possessed. For almost all of philosophy is directed
        towards the knowledge of God, and that is why metaphysics, which deals
        with divine things, is the last part of philosophy to be learned. This
        means that we are able to arrive at the inquiry concerning the
        aforementioned truth only on the basis of a great deal of labor spent in
        study. Now, those who wish to undergo such a labor for the mere love of
        knowledge are few, even though God has inserted into the minds of men a
        natural appetite for knowledge.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] The second awkward effect is that those who would come to discover
        the abovementioned truth would barely reach it after a great deal of
        time. The reasons are several. There is the profundity of this truth,
        which the human intellect is made capable of grasping by natural inquiry
        only after a long training. Then, there are many things that must be
        presupposed, as we have said. There is also the fact that, in youth,
        when the soul is swayed by the various movements of the passions, it is
        not in a suitable state for the knowledge of such lofty truth. On the
        contrary, “one becomes wise and knowing in repose,” as it is said in the
        <i>Physics</i> [VII, 3]. The result is this. If the only way open to us
        for the knowledge of God were solely that of the reason, the human race
        would remain in the blackest shadows of ignorance. For then the
        knowledge of God, which especially renders men perfect and good, would
        come to be possessed only by a few, and these few would require a great
        deal of time in order to reach it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] The third awkward effect is this. The investigation of the human
        reason for the most part has falsity present within it, and this is due
        partly to the weakness of our intellect in judgment, and partly to the
        admixture of images. The result is that many, remaining ignorant of the
        power of demonstration, would hold in doubt those things that have been
        most truly demonstrated. This would be particularly the case since they
        see that, among those who are reputed to be wise men, each one teaches
        his own brand of doctrine. Furthermore, with the many truths that are
        demonstrated, there sometimes is mingled something that is false, which
        is not demonstrated but rather asserted on the basis of some probable or
        sophistical argument, which yet has the credit of being a demonstration.
        That is why it was necessary that the unshakeable certitude and pure
        truth concerning divine things should be presented to men by way of
        faith.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Beneficially, therefore, did the divine Mercy provide that it should
        instruct us to hold by faith even those truths that the human reason is
        able to investigate. In this way, all men would easily be able to have a
        share in the knowledge of God, and this without uncertainty and error.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Hence it is written: “Henceforward walk not as the Gentiles walk in
        the vanity of their mind, having their understanding darkened” (Eph.
        4:17-18). And again: “All your children shall be taught of the Lord”
        (Is. 54:13).

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Now, perhaps some will think that men should not be asked to believe
        what the reason is not adequate to investigate, since the divine Wisdom
        provides in the case of each thing according to the mode of its nature.
        We must therefore prove that it is necessary for man to receive from God
        as objects of belief even those truths that are above the human reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] No one tends with desire and zeal towards something that is not
        already known to him. But, as we shall examine later on in this work,
        men are ordained by the divine Providence towards a higher good than
        human fragility can experience in the present life. That is why it was
        necessary for the human mind to be called to something higher than the
        human reason here and now can reach, so that it would thus learn to
        desire something and with zeal tend towards something that surpasses the
        whole state of the present life. This belongs especially to the
        Christian religion, which in a unique way promises spiritual and eternal
        goods. And so there are many things proposed to men in it that transcend
        human sense. The Old Law, on the other hand, whose promises were of a
        temporal character, contained very few proposals that transcended the
        inquiry of the human reason. Following this same direction, the
        philosophers themselves, in order that they might lead men from the
        pleasure of sensible things to virtue, were concerned to show that there
        were in existence other goods of a higher nature than these things of
        sense, and that those who gave themselves to the active or contemplative
        virtues would find much sweeter enjoyment in the taste of these higher
        goods.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] It is also necessary that such truth be proposed to men for belief
        so that they may have a truer knowledge of God. For then only do we know
        God truly when we believe Him to be above everything that it is possible
        for man to think about Him; for, as we have shown, the divine substance
        surpasses the natural knowledge of which man is capable. Hence, by the
        fact that some things about God are proposed to man that surpass his
        reason, there is strengthened in man the view that God is something
        above what he can think.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Another benefit that comes from the revelation to men of truths that
        exceed the reason is the curbing of presumption, which is the mother of
        error. For there are some who have such a presumptuous opinion of their
        own ability that they deem themselves able to measure the nature of
        everything; I mean to say that, in their estimation, everything is true
        that seems to them so, and everything is false that does not. So that
        the human mind, therefore, might be freed from this presumption and come
        to a humble inquiry after truth, it was necessary that some things
        should be proposed to man by God that would completely surpass his
        intellect.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] A still further benefit may also be seen in what Aristotle says in
        the <i>Ethics</i> [X, 7]. There was a certain Simonides who exhorted
        people to put aside the knowledge of divine things and to apply their
        talents to human occupations. He said that “he who is a man should know
        human things, and he who is mortal, things that are mortal.” Against
        Simonides Aristotle says that “man should draw himself towards what is
        immortal and divine as much as he can.” And so he says in the
        <i>De animalibus</i> [I, 5] that, although what we know of the higher
        substances is very little, yet that little is loved and desired more
        than all the knowledge that we have about less noble substances. He also
        says in the <i>De caelo et mundo</i> [II, 12] that when questions about
        the heavenly bodies can be given even a modest and merely plausible
        solution, he who hears this experiences intense joy. From all these
        considerations it is clear that even the most imperfect knowledge about
        the most noble realities brings the greatest perfection to the soul.
        Therefore, although the human reason cannot grasp fully the truths that
        are above it, yet, if it somehow holds these truths at least by faith,
        it acquires great perfection for itself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Therefore it is written: “For many things are shown to you above the
        understanding of men” (Sirach 3:75). Again: “So the things that are of
        God no man knows but the Spirit of God. But to us God has revealed them
        by His Spirit” (1 Cor. 2:11, 10).

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Those who place their faith in this truth, however, “for which the
        human reason offers no experimental evidence,” do not believe foolishly,
        as though “following artificial fables” (2 Peter 2:16). For these
        “secrets of divine Wisdom” (Job 11:6) the divine Wisdom itself, which
        knows all things to the full, has deigned to reveal to men. It reveals
        its own presence, as well as the truth of its teaching and inspiration,
        by fitting arguments; and in order to confirm those truths that exceed
        natural knowledge, it gives visible manifestation to works that surpass
        the ability of all nature. Thus, there are the wonderful cures of
        illnesses, there is the raising of the dead, and the wonderful
        immutation in the heavenly bodies; and what is more wonderful, there is
        the inspiration given to human minds, so that simple and untutored
        persons, filled with the gift of the Holy Spirit, come to possess
        instantaneously the highest wisdom and the readiest eloquence. When
        these arguments were examined, through the efficacy of the
        abovementioned proof, and not the violent assault of arms or the promise
        of pleasure, and (what is most wonderful of all) in the midst of the
        tyranny of the persecutors, an innumerable throng of people, both simple
        and most learned, flocked to the Christian faith. In this faith there
        are truths preached that surpass every human intellect; the pleasures of
        the flesh are curbed; it is taught that the things of the world should
        be spurned. Now, for the minds of mortal men to assent to these things
        is the greatest of miracles, just as it is a manifest work of divine
        inspiration that, spurning visible things, men should seek only what is
        invisible. Now, that this has happened neither without preparation nor
        by chance, but as a result of the disposition of God, is clear from the
        fact that through many pronouncements of the ancient prophets God had
        foretold that He would do this. The books of these prophets are held in
        veneration among us Christians, since they give witness to our faith.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] The manner of this confirmation is touched on by St. Paul: “Which,”
        that is, human salvation, “having begun to be declared by the Lord, was
        confirmed to us by them that hear Him: God also bearing them witness of
        signs, and wonders, and divers miracles, and distributions of the Holy
        Spirit” (Heb. 7:3-4).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] This wonderful conversion of the world to the Christian faith is the
        clearest witness of the signs given in the past; so that it is not
        necessary that they should be further repeated, since they appear most
        clearly in their effect. For it would be truly more wonderful than all
        signs if the world had been led by simple and humble men to believe such
        lofty truths, to accomplish such difficult actions, and to have such
        high hopes. Yet it is also a fact that, even in our own time, God does
        not cease to work miracles through His saints for the confirmation of
        the faith.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] On the other hand, those who founded sects committed to erroneous
        doctrines proceeded in a way that is opposite to this, The point is
        clear in the case of Muhammad. He seduced the people by promises of
        carnal pleasure to which the concupiscence of the flesh goads us. His
        teaching also contained precepts that were in conformity with his
        promises, and he gave free rein to carnal pleasure. In all this, as is
        not unexpected, he was obeyed by carnal men. As for proofs of the truth
        of his doctrine, he brought forward only such as could be grasped by the
        natural ability of anyone with a very modest wisdom. Indeed, the truths
        that he taught he mingled with many fables and with doctrines of the
        greatest falsity. He did not bring forth any signs produced in a
        supernatural way, which alone fittingly gives witness to divine
        inspiration; for a visible action that can be only divine reveals an
        invisibly inspired teacher of truth. On the contrary, Muhammad said that
        he was sent in the power of his arms—which are signs not lacking even to
        robbers and tyrants. What is more, no wise men, men trained in things
        divine and human, believed in him from the beginning, Those who believed
        in him were brutal men and desert wanderers, utterly ignorant of all
        divine teaching, through whose numbers Muhammad forced others to become
        his followers by the violence of his arms. Nor do divine pronouncements
        on the part of preceding prophets offer him any witness. On the
        contrary, he perverts almost all the testimonies of the Old and New
        Testaments by making them into fabrications of his own, as can be seen
        by anyone who examines his law. It was, therefore, a shrewd decision on
        his part to forbid his followers to read the Old and New Testaments,
        lest these books convict him of falsity. It is thus clear that those who
        place any faith in his words believe foolishly.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Now, although the truth of the Christian faith which we have
        discussed surpasses the capacity of the reason, nevertheless that truth
        that the human reason is naturally endowed to know cannot be opposed to
        the truth of the Christian faith. For that with which the human reason
        is naturally endowed is clearly most true; so much so, that it is
        impossible for us to think of such truths as false. Nor is it
        permissible to believe as false that which we hold by faith, since this
        is confirmed in a way that is so clearly divine. Since, therefore, only
        the false is opposed to the true, as is clearly evident from an
        examination of their definitions, it is impossible that the truth of
        faith should be opposed to those principles that the human reason knows
        naturally.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Furthermore, that which is introduced into the soul of the student
        by the teacher is contained in the knowledge of the teacher—unless his
        teaching is fictitious, which it is improper to say of God. Now, the
        knowledge of the principles that are known to us naturally has been
        implanted in us by God; for God is the Author of our nature. These
        principles, therefore, are also contained by the divine Wisdom. Hence,
        whatever is opposed to them is opposed to the divine Wisdom, and,
        therefore, cannot come from God. That which we hold by faith as divinely
        revealed, therefore, cannot be contrary to our natural knowledge.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Again. In the presence of contrary arguments our intellect is
        chained, so that it cannot proceed to the knowledge of the truth. If,
        therefore, contrary knowledges were implanted in us by God, our
        intellect would be hindered from knowing truth by this very fact. Now,
        such an effect cannot come from God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] And again. What is natural cannot change as long as nature does not.
        Now, it is impossible that contrary opinions should exist in the same
        knowing subject at the same time. No opinion or belief, therefore, is
        implanted in man by God which is contrary to man’s natural knowledge.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Therefore, the Apostle says: “The word is nigh thee, even in thy
        mouth and in thy heart. This is the word of faith, which we preach”
        (Rom. 10:8). But because it overcomes reason, there are some who think
        that it is opposed to it: which is impossible.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] The authority of St. Augustine also agrees with this. He writes as
        follows: “That which truth will reveal cannot in any way be opposed to
        the sacred books of the Old and the New Testament” [
        <i>De genesi ad litteram</i> II, 18].
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] From this we evidently gather the following conclusion: whatever
        arguments are brought forward against the doctrines of faith are
        conclusions incorrectly derived from the first and self-evident
        principles imbedded in nature. Such conclusions do not have the force of
        demonstration; they are arguments that are either probable or
        sophistical. And so, there exists the possibility to answer them.

        [1] There is also a further consideration. Sensible things, from which
        the human reason takes the origin of its knowledge, retain within
        themselves some sort of trace of a likeness to God. This is so
        imperfect, however, that it is absolutely inadequate to manifest the
        substance of God. For effects bear within themselves, in their own way,
        the likeness of their causes, since an agent produces its like; yet an
        effect does not always reach to the full likeness of its cause. Now, the
        human reason is related to the knowledge of the truth of faith (a truth
        which can be most evident only to those who see the divine substance) in
        such a way that it can gather certain likenesses of it, which are yet
        not sufficient so that the truth of faith may be comprehended as being
        understood demonstratively or through itself. Yet it is useful for the
        human reason to exercise itself in such arguments, however weak they may
        be, provided only that there be present no presumption to comprehend or
        to demonstrate. For to be able to see something of the loftiest
        realities, however thin and weak the sight may be, is, as our previous
        remarks indicate, a cause of the greatest joy.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] The testimony of Hilary agrees with this. Speaking of this same
        truth, he writes as follows in his <i>De Trinitate</i> [II, 10, ii]:
        “Enter these truths by believing, press forward, persevere. And though I
        may know that you will not arrive at an end, yet I will congratulate you
        in your progress. For, though he who pursues the infinite with reverence
        will never finally reach the end, yet he will always progress by
        pressing onward. But do not intrude yourself into the divine secret, do
        not, presuming to comprehend the sum total of intelligence, plunge
        yourself into the mystery of the unending nativity; rather, understand
        that these things are incomprehensible.”

        [1] It is clearly apparent, from what has been said, that the intention
        of the wise man ought to be directed toward the twofold truth of divine
        things, and toward the destruction of the errors that are contrary to
        this truth. One kind of divine truth the investigation of the reason is
        competent to reach, whereas the other surpasses every effort of the
        reason. I am speaking of a “twofold truth of divine things,” not on the
        part of God Himself, Who is truth one and simple, but from the point of
        view of our knowledge, which is variously related to the knowledge of
        divine things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Now, to make the first kind of divine truth known, we must proceed
        through demonstrative arguments, by which our adversary may become
        convinced. However, since such arguments are not available for the
        second kind of divine truth, our intention should not be to convince our
        adversary by arguments: it should be to answer his arguments against the
        truth; for, as we have shown, the natural reason cannot be contrary to
        the truth of faith. The sole way to overcome an adversary of divine
        truth is from the authority of Scripture—an authority divinely confirmed
        by miracles. For that which is above the human reason we believe only
        because God has revealed it. Nevertheless, there are certain likely
        arguments that should be brought forth in order to make divine truth
        known. This should be done for the training and consolation of the
        faithful, and not with any idea of refuting those who are adversaries.
        For the very inadequacy of the arguments would rather strengthen them in
        their error, since they would imagine that our acceptance of the truth
        of faith was based on such weak arguments.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] This, then, is the manner of procedure we intend to follow. We shall
        first seek to make known that truth which faith professes and reason
        investigates. This we shall do by bringing forward both demonstrative
        and probable arguments, some of which were drawn from the books of the
        philosophers and of the saints, through which truth is strengthened and
        its adversary overcome [Books I-III]. Then, in order to follow a
        development from the more manifest to the less manifest, we shall
        proceed to make known that truth which surpasses reason, answering the
        objections of its adversaries and setting forth the truth of faith by
        probable arguments and by authorities, to the best of our ability [Book
        IV].
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] We are aiming, then, to set out following the way of the reason and
        to inquire into what the human reason can investigate about God. In this
        aim the first consideration that confronts us is of that which belongs
        to God in Himself [Book I]. The second consideration concerns the coming
        forth of creatures from God [Book II]. The third concerns the ordering
        of creatures to God as to their end [Book III].
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Now, among the inquiries that we must undertake concerning God in
        Himself, we must set down in the beginning that whereby His Existence is
        demonstrated, as the necessary foundation of the whole work. For, if we
        do not demonstrate that God exists, all consideration of divine things
        is necessarily suppressed.

        [1] There are some persons to whom the inquiry seeking to demonstrate
        that God exists may perhaps appear superfluous. These are the persons
        who assert that the existence of God is self-evident, in such wise that
        its contrary cannot be entertained in the mind. It thus appears that the
        existence of God cannot be demonstrated, as may be seen from the
        following arguments.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Those propositions are said to be self-evident that are known
        immediately upon the knowledge of their terms. Thus, as soon as you know
        the nature of a whole and the nature of a part, you know immediately
        that every whole is greater than its part. The proposition God exists is
        of this sort. For by the name God we understand something than which a
        greater cannot be thought. This notion is formed in the intellect by one
        who hears and understands the name God. As a result, God must exist
        already at least in the intellect. But He cannot exist solely in the
        intellect, since that which exists both in the intellect and in reality
        is greater than that which exists in the intellect alone. Now, as the
        very definition of the name points out, nothing can be greater than God.
        Consequently, the proposition that God exists is self-evident, as being
        evident from the very meaning of the name God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Again, it is Possible to think that something exists whose
        non-existence cannot be thought. Clearly, such a being is greater than
        the being whose non-existence can be thought. Consequently, if God
        Himself could be thought not to be, then something greater than God
        could be thought. This, however, is contrary to the definition of the
        name God. Hence, the proposition that God exists is self-evident.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Furthermore, those propositions ought to be the most evident in
        which the same thing is predicated of itself, for example, man is man,
        or whose predicates are included in the definition of their subjects,
        for example, Man is an animal. Now, in God, as will be shown in a later
        chapter, it is pre-eminently the case that His being is His essence, so
        that to the question what is He? and to the question is He? the answer
        is one and the same. Thus, in the proposition God exists, the predicate
        is consequently either identical with the subject or at least included
        in the definition of the subject. Hence, that God exists is
        self-evident.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] What is naturally known is known through itself, for we do not come
        to such propositions through an effort of inquiry. But the proposition
        that God exists is naturally known since, as will be shown later on, the
        desire of man naturally tends towards God as towards the ultimate end.
        The proposition that God exists is, therefore, self-evident.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] There is also the consideration that that through which all the rest
        are known ought itself to be self-evident. Now, God is of this sort. For
        just as the light of the sun is the principle of all visible perception,
        so the divine light is the principle of all intelligible knowledge;
        since the divine light is that in which intelligible illumination is
        found first and in its highest degree. That God exists, therefore, must
        be self-evident.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] These, then, and others like them are the arguments by which some
        think that the proposition God exists is so self-evident that its
        contrary cannot be entertained by the mind.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] In part, the above opinion arises from the custom by which from
        their earliest days people are brought up to hear and to call upon the
        name of God. Custom, and especially custom in a child comes to have the
        force of nature. As a result, what the mind is steeped in from childhood
        it clings to very firmly, as something known naturally and
        self-evidently.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] In part, however, the above opinion comes about because of a failure
        to distinguish between that which is self-evident in an absolute sense
        and that which is self-evident in relation to us. For assuredly that God
        exists is, absolutely speaking, self-evident, since what God is is His
        own being. Yet, because we are not able to conceive in our minds that
        which God is, that God exists remains unknown in relation to us. So,
        too, that every whole is greater than its part is, absolutely speaking,
        self-evident; but it would perforce be unknown to one who could not
        conceive the nature of a whole. Hence it comes about, as it is said in
        <i>Metaphysics</i> II [Ia, 1], that “our intellect is related to the
        most knowable things in reality as the eye of an owl is related to the
        sun.”’
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] And, contrary to the Point made by the first argument, it does not
        follow immediately that, as soon as we know the meaning of the name God,
        the existence of God is known. It does not follow first because it is
        not known to all, even including those who admit that God exists, that
        God is that than which a greater cannot be thought. After all, many
        ancients said that this world itself was God. Furthermore, no such
        inference can be drawn from the interpretations of the name God to be
        found in Damascene [ <i>De fide orthodoxa</i> I, 9]. What is more,
        granted that everyone should understand by the name God something than
        which a greater cannot be thought, it will still not be necessary that
        there exist in reality something than which a greater cannot be thought.
        For a thing and the definition of a name are posited in the same way.
        Now, from the fact that that which is indicated by the name God is
        conceived by the mind, it does not follow that God exists save only in
        the intellect. Hence, that than which a greater cannot be thought will
        likewise not have to exist save only in the intellect. From this it does
        not follow that there exists in reality something than which a greater
        cannot be thought. No difficulty, consequently, befalls anyone who
        posits that God does not exist. For that something greater can be
        thought than anything given in reality or in the intellect is a
        difficulty only to him who admits that there is something than which a
        greater cannot be thought in reality.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Nor, again, is it necessary, as the second argument advanced, that
        something greater than God can be thought if God can be thought not to
        be. For that He can be thought not to be does not arise either from the
        imperfection or the uncertainty of His own being, since this is in
        itself most manifest. It arises, rather, from the weakness of our
        intellect, which cannot behold God Himself except through His effects
        and which is thus led to know His existence through reasoning.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] This enables us to solve the third argument as well. For just as it
        is evident to us that a whole is greater than a part of itself, so to
        those seeing the divine essence in itself it is supremely self-evident
        that God exists because His essence is His being. But, because we are
        not able to see His essence, we arrive at the knowledge of His being,
        not through God Himself, but through His effects.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] The answer to the fourth argument is likewise clear. For man
        naturally knows God in the same way as he naturally desires God. Now,
        man naturally desires God in so far as he naturally desires beatitude,
        which is a certain likeness of the divine goodness. On this basis, it is
        not necessary that God considered in Himself be naturally known to man,
        but only a likeness of God. It remains, therefore, that man is to reach
        the knowledge of God through reasoning by way of the likenesses of God
        found in His effects.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] So, too, with the fifth argument, an easy solution is available. For
        God is indeed that by which all things are known, not in the sense that
        they are not known unless He is known (as obtains among self-evident
        principles), but because all our knowledge is caused in us through His
        influence.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] There are others who hold a certain opinion, contrary to the
        position mentioned above, through which the efforts of those seeking to
        prove the existence of God would likewise be rendered futile. For they
        say that we cannot arrive at the existence of God through the reason; it
        is received by way of faith and revelation alone.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] What led some persons to hold this view was the weakness of the
        arguments which had been brought forth by others to prove that God
        exists.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Nevertheless, the present error might erroneously find support in
        its behalf in the words of some philosophers who show that in God
        essence and being are identical, that is, that that which answers to the
        question what is it? is identical with that which answers to the
        question is it? Now, following the way of the reason we cannot arrive at
        a knowledge of what God is. Hence, it seems likewise impossible to
        demonstrate by the reason that God exists.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Furthermore, according to the logic of the Philosopher, as a
        principle to demonstrate whether a thing is we must take the
        signification of the name of that thing [ <i>Posterior Analytics</i> II,
        9]; and, again according to the Philosopher [ <i>Metaphysics</i> IV, 7],
        the meaning signified by a name is its definition. If this be so, if we
        set aside a knowledge of the divine essence or quiddity, no means will
        be available whereby to demonstrate that God exists.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Again, if, as is shown in the <i>Posterior Analytics</i> [I, 18],
        the knowledge of the principles of demonstration takes its origin from
        sense, whatever transcends all sense and sensibles seems to be
        indemonstrable. That God exists appears to be a proposition of this sort
        and is therefore indemonstrable.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] The falsity of this opinion is shown to us, first, from the art of
        demonstration which teaches us to arrive at causes from their effects.
        Then, it is shown to us from the order of the sciences. For, as it is
        said in the <i>Metaphysics</i> [IV, 3], if there is no knowable
        substance higher than sensible substance, there will be no science
        higher than physics. It is shown, thirdly, from the pursuit of the
        philosophers, who have striven to demonstrate that God exists. Finally,
        it is shown to us by the truth in the words of the Apostle Paul: “For
        the invisible things of God... are clearly seen, being understood by the
        things that are made” (Rom. 1:20).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Nor, contrary to the first argument, is there any problem in the
        fact that in God essence and being are identical. For this is understood
        of the being by which God subsists in Himself. But we do not know of
        what sort this being is, just as we do not know the divine essence. The
        reference is not to the being that signifies the composition of
        intellect. For thus the existence of God does fall under demonstration;
        this happens when our mind is led from demonstrative arguments to form
        such a proposition of God whereby it expresses that He exists.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] Now, in arguments proving the existence of God, it is not necessary
        to assume the divine essence or quiddity as the middle term of the
        demonstration. This was the second view proposed above. In place of the
        quiddity, an effect is taken as the middle term, as in demonstrations
        <i>quia</i>. It is from such effects that the meaning of the name God is
        taken. For all divine names are imposed either by removing the effects
        of God from Him or by relating God in some way to His effects.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] It is thereby likewise evident that, although God transcends all
        sensible things and the sense itself, His effects, on which the
        demonstration proving His existence is based, are nevertheless sensible
        things. And thus, the origin of our knowledge in the sense applies also
        to those things that transcend the sense.

        [1] We have now shown that the effort to demonstrate the existence of
        God is not a vain one. We shall therefore proceed to set forth the
        arguments by which both philosophers and Catholic teachers have proved
        that God exists.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] We shall first set forth the arguments by which Aristotle proceeds
        to prove that God exists. The aim of Aristotle is to do this in two
        ways, beginning with motion.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Of these ways the first is as follows. Everything that is moved is
        moved by another. That some things are in motion—for example, the sun—is
        evident from sense. Therefore, it is moved by something else that moves
        it. This mover is itself either moved or not moved. If it is not, we
        have reached our conclusion—namely, that we must posit some unmoved
        mover. This we call God. If it is moved, it is moved by another mover.
        We must, consequently, either proceed to infinity, or we must arrive at
        some unmoved mover. Now, it is not possible to proceed to infinity.
        Hence, we must posit some prime unmoved mover.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] In this proof, there are two propositions that need to be proved,
        namely, that everything that is moved is moved by another, and that in
        movers and things moved one cannot proceed to infinity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] The first of these propositions Aristotle proves in three ways. The
        first way is as follows. If something moves itself, it must have within
        itself the principle of its own motion; otherwise, it is clearly moved
        by another. Furthermore, it must be primarily moved. This means that it
        must be moved by reason of itself, and not by reason of a part of
        itself, as happens when an animal is moved by the motion of its foot.
        For, in this sense, a whole would not be moved by itself, but a part,
        and one part would be moved by another. It is also necessary that a
        self-moving being be divisible and have parts, since, as it is proved in
        the <i>Physics</i> [VI, 4], whatever is moved is divisible.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] On the basis of these suppositions Aristotle argues as follows. That
        which is held to be moved by itself is primarily moved. Hence, when one
        of its parts is at rest, the whole is then at rest. For if, while one
        part was at rest, another part in it were moved, then the whole itself
        would not be primarily moved; it would be that part in it which is moved
        while another part is at rest. But nothing that is at rest because
        something else is at rest is moved by itself; for that being whose rest
        follows upon the rest of another must have its motion follow upon the
        motion of another. It is thus not moved by itself. Therefore, that which
        was posited as being moved by itself is not moved by itself.
        Consequently, everything that is moved must be moved by another.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Nor is it an objection to this argument if one might say that, when
        something is held to move itself, a part of it cannot be at rest; or,
        again, if one might say that a part is not subject to rest or motion
        except accidentally, which is the unfounded argument of Avicenna. For,
        indeed, the force of Aristotle’s argument lies in this: if something
        moves itself primarily and through itself, rather than through its
        parts, that it is moved cannot depend on another. But the moving of the
        divisible itself, like its being, depends on its parts; it cannot
        therefore move itself primarily and through itself. Hence, for the truth
        of the inferred conclusion it is not necessary to assume as an absolute
        truth that a part of a being moving itself is at rest. What must rather
        be true is this conditional proposition: if the part were at rest, the
        whole would be at rest. Now, this proposition would be true even though
        its antecedent be impossible. In the same way, the following conditional
        proposition is true: if man is an ass, he is irrational.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] In the second way, Aristotle proves the proposition by induction [
        <i>Physics</i> VIII, 4]. Whatever is moved by accident is not moved by
        itself, since it is moved upon the motion of another. So, too, as is
        evident, what is moved by violence is not moved by itself. Nor are those
        beings moved by themselves that are moved by their nature as being moved
        from within; such is the case with animals, which evidently are moved by
        the soul. Nor, again, is this true of those beings, such as heavy and
        light bodies, which are moved through nature. For such beings are moved
        by the generating cause and the cause removing impediments. Now,
        whatever is moved is moved through itself or by accident. If it is moved
        through itself, then it is moved either violently or by nature; if by
        nature, then either through itself, as the animal, or not through
        itself, as heavy and light bodies. Therefore, everything that is moved
        is moved by another.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] In the third way, Aristotle proves the proposition as follows [VIII,
        5]. The same thing cannot be at once in act and in potency with respect
        to the same thing. But everything that is moved is, as such, in potency.
        For motion is the act of something that is in potency inasmuch as it is
        in potency. That which moves, however, is as such in act, for nothing
        acts except according as it is in act. Therefore, with respect to the
        same motion, nothing is both mover and moved. Thus, nothing moves
        itself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] It is to be noted, however, that Plato, who held that every mover
        is moved [ <i>Phaedrus</i> ], understood the name motion in a wider
        sense than did Aristotle. For Aristotle understood motion strictly,
        according as it is the act of what exists in potency inasmuch as it is
        such. So understood, motion belongs only to divisible bodies, as it is
        proved in the <i>Physics</i> [VI, 4]. According to Plato, however, that
        which moves itself is not a body. Plato understood by motion any given
        operation, so that to understand and to judge are a kind of motion.
        Aristotle likewise touches upon this manner of speaking in the
        <i>De anima</i> [III, 7]. Plato accordingly said that the first mover
        moves himself because he knows himself and wills or loves himself. In a
        way, this is not opposed to the reasons of Aristotle. There is no
        difference between reaching a first being that moves himself, as
        understood by Plato, and reaching a first being that is absolutely
        unmoved, as understood by Aristotle.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] The second proposition, namely, that there is no procession to
        infinity among movers and things moved, Aristotle proves in three ways.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [12] The first is as follows [VII, 1]. If among movers and things moved
        we proceed to infinity, all these infinite beings must be bodies. For
        whatever is moved is divisible and a body, as is proved in the
        <i>Physics</i> [VI, 4]. But every body that moves some thing moved is
        itself moved while moving it. Therefore, all these infinites are moved
        together while one of them is moved. But one of them, being finite, is
        moved in a finite time. Therefore, all those infinites are moved in a
        finite time. This, however, is impossible. It is, therefore, impossible
        that among movers and things moved one can proceed to infinity.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0.125in; margin-bottom: 0.125in"></p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [13] Furthermore, that it is impossible for the abovementioned infinites
        to be moved in a finite time Aristotle proves as follows. The mover and
        the thing moved must exist simultaneously. This Aristotle proves by
        induction in the various species of motion. But bodies cannot be
        simultaneous except through continuity or contiguity. Now, since, as has
        been proved, all the aforementioned movers and. things moved are bodies,
        they must constitute by continuity or contiguity a sort of single
        mobile. In this way, one infinite is moved in a finite time. This is
        impossible, as is proved in the <i>Physics</i> [VII, 1].
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [14] The second argument proving the same conclusion is the following.
        In an ordered series of movers and things moved (this is a series in
        which one is moved by another according to an order), it is necessarily
        the fact that, when the first mover is removed or ceases to move, no
        other mover will move or be moved. For the first mover is the cause of
        motion for all the others. But, if there are movers and things moved
        following an order to infinity, there will be no first mover, but all
        would be as intermediate movers. Therefore, none of the others will be
        able to be moved, and thus nothing in the world will be moved.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [15] The third proof comes to the same conclusion, except that, by
        beginning with the superior, it has a reversed order. It is as follows.
        That which moves as an instrumental cause cannot move unless there be a
        principal moving cause. But, if we proceed to infinity among movers and
        things moved, all movers will be as instrumental causes, because they
        will be moved movers and there will be nothing as a principal mover.
        Therefore, nothing will be moved.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [16] Such, then, is the proof of both propositions assumed by Aristotle
        in the first demonstrative way by which he proved that a first unmoved
        mover exists.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [17] The second way is this. If every mover is moved, this proposition
        is true either by itself or by accident. If by accident, then it is not
        necessary, since what is true by accident is not necessary. It is
        something possible, therefore, that no mover is moved. But if a mover is
        not moved, it does not move: as the adversary says. It is therefore
        possible that nothing is moved. For, if nothing moves, nothing is moved.
        This, however, Aristotle considers to be impossible—namely, that at any
        time there be no motion. Therefore, the first proposition was not
        possible, since from a false possible, a false impossible does not
        follow. Hence, this proposition, every mover is moved by another, was
        not true by accident.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [18] Again, if two things are accidentally joined in some being, and one
        of them is found without the other, it is probable that the other can be
        found without it. For example, if white and musical are found in
        Socrates, and in Plato we find musical but not white, it is probable
        that in some other being we can find the white without the musical.
        Therefore, if mover and thing moved are accidentally joined in some
        being, and the thing moved be found without the mover in some being, it
        is probable that the mover is found without that which is moved. Nor can
        the example of two things, of which one depends on the other, be brought
        as an objection against this. For the union we are speaking of is not
        essential, but accidental.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [19] But, if the proposition that every mover is moved is true by
        itself, something impossible or awkward likewise follows. For the mover
        must be moved either by the same kind of motion as that by which he
        moves, or by another. If the same, a cause of alteration must itself be
        altered, and further, a healing cause must itself be healed, and a
        teacher must himself be taught and this with respect to the same
        knowledge. Now, this is impossible. A teacher must have science, whereas
        he who is a learner of necessity does not have it. So that, if the
        proposition were true, the same thing would be possessed and not
        possessed by the same being—which is impossible. If, however, the mover
        is moved by another species of motion, so that (namely) the altering
        cause is moved according to place, and the cause moving according to
        place is increased, and so forth, since the genera and species of motion
        are finite in number, it will follow that we cannot proceed to infinity.
        There will thus be a first mover, which is not moved by another. Will
        someone say that there will be a recurrence, so that when all the genera
        and species of motion have been completed the series will be repeated
        and return to the first motion? This would involve saying, for example,
        that a mover according to place would be altered, the altering cause
        would be increased, and the increasing cause would be moved according to
        place. Yet this whole view would arrive at the same conclusion as
        before: whatever moves according to a certain species of motion is
        itself moved according to the same species of motion, though mediately
        and not immediately.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [20] It remains, therefore, that we must posit some first mover that is
        not moved by any exterior moving cause.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [21] Granted this conclusion—namely, that there is a first mover that is
        not moved by an exterior moving cause—it yet does not follow that this
        mover is absolutely unmoved. That is why Aristotle goes on to say that
        the condition of the first mover may be twofold [VIII, 5]. The first
        mover can be absolutely unmoved. If so, we have the conclusion we are
        seeking: there is a first unmoved mover. On the other hand, the first
        mover can be self-moved. This may be argued, because that which is
        through itself is prior to what is through another. Hence, among things
        moved as well, it seems reasonable that the first moved is moved through
        itself and not by another.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [22] But, on this basis, the same conclusion again follows. For it
        cannot be said that, when a mover moves himself, the whole is moved by
        the whole. Otherwise, the same difficulties would follow as before: one
        person would both teach and be taught, and the same would be true among
        other motions. It would also follow that a being would be both in
        potency and in act; for a mover is, as such, in act, whereas the thing
        moved is in potency. Consequently, one part of the self-moved mover is
        solely moving, and the other part solely moved. We thus reach the same
        conclusion as before: there exists an unmoved mover.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [23] Nor can it be held that both parts of the self-moved mover are
        moved, so that one is moved by the other, or that one moves both itself
        and the other, or that the whole moves a part, or that a part moves the
        whole. All this would involve the return of the aforementioned
        difficulties: something would both move and be moved according to the
        same species of motion; something would be at once in potency and in
        act; and, furthermore, the whole would not be primarily moving itself,
        it would move through the motion of a part. The conclusion thus stands:
        one part of a self-moved mover must be unmoved and moving the other
        part.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [24] But there is another point to consider. Among self-moved beings
        known to us, namely, animals, although the moving part, which is to say
        the soul, is unmoved through itself, it is yet moved by accident. That
        is why Aristotle further shows that the moving part of the first
        self-moving being is not moved either through itself or by accident
        [VIII, 6]. For, since self-moving beings known to us, namely, animals,
        are corruptible, the moving part in them is moved by accident. But
        corruptible self-moving beings must be reduced to some first self-moving
        being that is everlasting. Therefore, some self-moving being must have a
        mover that is moved neither through itself nor by accident.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [25] It is further evident that, according to the position of Aristotle,
        some self-moved being must be everlasting. For if, as Aristotle
        supposes, motion is everlasting, the generation of self-moving beings
        (this means beings that are generable and corruptible) must be endless.
        But the cause of this endlessness cannot be one of the self-moving
        beings, since it does not always exist. Nor can the cause be all the
        self-moving beings together, both because they would be infinite and
        because they would not be simultaneous. There must therefore be some
        endlessly self-moving being, causing the endlessness of generation among
        these sublunary self-movers. Thus, the mover of the self-moving being is
        not moved, either through itself or by accident.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [26] Again, we see that among beings that move themselves some initiate
        a new motion as a result of some motion. This new motion is other than
        the motion by which an animal moves itself, for example, digested food
        or altered air. By such a motion the self-moving mover is moved by
        accident. From this we may infer that no self-moved being is moved
        everlastingly whose mover is moved either by itself or by accident. But
        the first self-mover is everlastingly in motion; otherwise, motion could
        not be everlasting, since every other motion is caused by the motion of
        the self-moving first mover. The first self-moving being, therefore, is
        moved by a mover who is himself moved neither through himself nor by
        accident.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [27] Nor is it against this argument that the movers of the lower
        spheres produce an everlasting motion and yet are said to be moved by
        accident. For they are said to be moved by accident, not on their own
        account, but on account of their movable subjects, which follow the
        motion of the higher sphere.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [28] Now, God is not part of any self-moving mover. In his
        <i>Metaphysics</i> [XII, 7], therefore, Aristotle goes on from the mover
        who is a part of the self-moved mover to seek another mover—God—who is
        absolutely separate. For, since everything moving itself is moved
        through appetite, the mover who is part of the self-moving being moves
        because of the appetite of some appetible object. This object is higher,
        in the order of motion, than the mover desiring it; for the one desiring
        is in a manner a moved mover, whereas an appetible object is an
        absolutely unmoved mover. There must, therefore, be an absolutely
        unmoved separate first mover. This is God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [29] Two considerations seem to invalidate these arguments. The first
        consideration is that, as arguments, they presuppose the eternity of
        motion, which Catholics consider to be false.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [30] To this consideration the reply is as follows. The most efficacious
        way to prove that God exists is on the supposition that the world is
        eternal. Granted this supposition, that God exists is less manifest.
        For, if the world and motion have a first beginning, some cause must
        clearly be posited to account for this origin of the world and of
        motion. That which comes to be anew must take its origin from some
        innovating cause; since nothing brings itself from potency to act, or
        from non-being to being.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [31] The second consideration is that the demonstrations given above
        presuppose that the first moved being, namely, a heavenly body, is
        self-moved. This means that it is animated, which many do not admit.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [32] The reply to this consideration is that, if the prime mover is not
        held to be self-moved, then it must be moved immediately by something
        absolutely unmoved. Hence, even Aristotle himself proposed this
        conclusion as a disjunction: it is necessary either to arrive
        immediately at an unmoved separate first mover, or to arrive at a
        self-moved mover from whom, in turn, an unmoved separate first mover is
        reached.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [33] In <i>Metaphysics</i> II [Ia, 2] Aristotle also uses another
        argument to show that there is no infinite regress in efficient causes
        and that we must reach one first cause—God. This way is as follows. In
        all ordered efficient causes, the first is the cause of the intermediate
        cause, whether one or many, and this is the cause of the last cause.
        But, when you suppress a cause, you suppress its effect. Therefore, if
        you suppress the first cause, the intermediate cause cannot be a cause.
        Now, if there were an infinite regress among efficient causes, no cause
        would be first. Therefore, all the other causes, which are intermediate,
        will be suppressed. But this is manifestly false. We must, therefore,
        posit that there exists a first efficient cause. This is God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [34] Another argument may also be gathered from the words of Aristotle.
        In <i>Metaphysics</i> II [Ia, 1] he shows that what is most true is also
        most a being. But in <i>Metaphysics</i> IV [4] he shows the existence of
        something supremely true from the observed fact that of two false things
        one is more false than the other, which means that one is more true than
        the other. This comparison is based on the nearness to that which is
        absolutely and supremely true. From these Aristotelian texts we may
        further infer that there is something that is supremely being. This we
        call God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [35] Damascene proposes another argument for the same conclusion taken
        from the government of the world [ <i>De fide orthodoxa</i> I, 3].
        Averroes likewise hints at it [In II <i>Physicorum</i> ]. The argument
        runs thus. Contrary and discordant things cannot, always or for the most
        part, be parts of one order except under someone’s government, which
        enables all and each to tend to a definite end. But in the world we find
        that things of diverse natures come together under one order, and this
        not rarely or by chance, but always or for the most part. There must
        therefore be some being by whose providence the world is governed. This
        we call God.

          >THAT TO KNOW GOD WE MUST USE THE WAY OF REMOTION</span
        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] We have shown that there exists a first being, whom we call God. We
        must, accordingly, now investigate the properties of this being.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Now, in considering the divine substance, we should especially make
        use of the method of remotion. For, by its immensity, the divine
        substance surpasses every form that our intellect reaches. Thus we are
        unable to apprehend it by knowing what it is. Yet we are able to have
        some knowledge of it by knowing what it is not. Furthermore, we approach
        nearer to a knowledge of God according as through our intellect we are
        able to remove more and more things from Him. For we know each thing
        more perfectly the more fully we see its differences from other things;
        for each thing has within itself its own being, distinct from all other
        things. So, too, in the case of the things whose definitions we know. We
        locate them in a genus, through which we know in a general way what they
        are. Then we add differences to each thing, by which it may be
        distinguished from other things. In this way, a complete knowledge of a
        substance is built up.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] However, in the consideration of the divine substance we cannot take
        a what as a genus; nor can we derive the distinction of God from things
        by differences affirmed of God. For this reason, we must derive the
        distinction of God from other beings by means of negative differences.
        And just as among affirmative differences one contracts the other, so
        one negative difference is contracted by another that makes it to differ
        from many beings. For example, if we say that God is not an accident, we
        thereby distinguish Him from all accidents. Then, if we add that He is
        not a body, we shall further distinguish Him from certain substances.
        And thus, proceeding in order, by such negations God will be
        distinguished from all that He is not. Finally, there will then be a
        proper consideration of God’s substance when He will be known as
        distinct from all things. Yet, this knowledge will not be perfect, since
        it will not tell us what God is in Himself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] As a principle of procedure in knowing God by way of remotion,
        therefore, let us adopt the proposition which, from what we have said,
        is now manifest, namely, that God is absolutely unmoved. The authority
        of Sacred Scripture also confirms this. For it is written: “I am the
        Lord and I change not” (Mal. 3:6);...“with whom there is no change”
        (James 2:17). Again: “God is not man... that He should be changed (Num.
        23:19).

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From what we have said it is further apparent that God is eternal.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Everything that begins to be or ceases to be does so through motion
        or change. Since, however, we have shown that God is absolutely
        immutable, He is eternal, lacking all beginning or end.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Again. Those beings alone are measured by time that are moved. For
        time, as is made clear in <i>Physics</i> IV [11], is “the number of
        motion.” But God, as has been proved, is absolutely without motion, and
        is consequently not measured by time. There is, therefore, no before and
        after in Him; He does not have being after non-being, nor non-being
        after being, nor can any succession be found in His being. For none of
        these characteristics can be understood without time. God, therefore, is
        without beginning and end, having His whole being at once. In this
        consists the nature of eternity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] What is more, if it were true that there was a time when He existed
        after not existing, then He must have been brought by someone from
        non-being to being. Not by Himself, since what does not exist cannot
        act. If by another, then this other is prior to God. But we have shown
        that God is the first cause. Hence, He did not begin to be, nor
        consequently will He cease to be, for that which has been everlastingly
        has the power to be everlastingly. God is, therefore, eternal.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] We find in the world, furthermore, certain beings, those namely that
        are subject to generation and corruption, which can be and not-be. But
        what can be has a cause because, since it is equally related to two
        contraries, namely, being and non-being, it must be owing to some cause
        that being accrues to it. Now, as we have proved by the reasoning of
        Aristotle, one cannot proceed to infinity among causes. We must
        therefore posit something that is a necessary being. Every necessary
        being, however, either has the cause of its necessity in an outside
        source or, if it does not, it is necessary through itself. But one
        cannot proceed to infinity among necessary beings the cause of whose
        necessity lies in an outside source. We must therefore posit a first
        necessary being, which is necessary through itself. This is God, since,
        as we have shown, He is the first cause. God, therefore, is eternal,
        since whatever is necessary through itself is eternal.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] From the everlastingness of time, likewise, Aristotle shows the
        everlastingness of motion [ <i>Physics</i> VIII, 1], from which he
        further shows the everlastingness of the moving substance [VIII, 6].
        Now, the first moving substance is God. God is therefore everlasting. If
        we deny the everlastingness of time and motion, we are still able to
        prove the everlastingness of the moving substance. For, if motion had a
        beginning, it must have done so through some moving cause. If this
        moving cause began, it did so through the action of some cause. Hence,
        either one will proceed to infinity, or he will arrive at a moving cause
        that had no beginning.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] To this truth divine authority offers witness. The Psalmist says:
        “But You, Lord, endure forever”; and he goes on to say: “But You art
        always the selfsame: and Your years shall not fail” (Ps. 101:13, 28).

          >THAT THERE IS NO PASSIVE POTENCY IN GOD</span
        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] If God is eternal, of necessity there is no potency in Him.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] The being whose substance has an admixture of potency is liable not
        to be by as much as it has potency; for that which can be, can not-be.
        But, God, being everlasting, in His substance cannot not-be. In God,
        therefore, there is no potency to being.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Though a being that is sometime in potency and sometime in act is in
        time in potency before being in act, absolutely speaking act is prior to
        potency. For potency does not raise itself to act; it must be raised to
        act by something that is in act. Hence, whatever is in some way in
        potency has something prior to it. But, as is evident from what was said
        above, God is the first being and the first cause. Hence, He has no
        admixture of potency in Himself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Moreover, that which is a necessary being through itself is in no
        way a possible being, since that which is through itself a necessary
        being has no cause, whereas, as we have shown above, whatever is a
        possible being has a cause. But God is through Himself a necessary
        being. He is, therefore, in no way a possible being, and so no potency
        is found in His substance.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Again, each thing acts in so far as it is in act. Therefore, what is
        not wholly act acts, not with the whole of itself, but with part of
        itself. But what does not act with the whole of itself is not the first
        agent, since it does not act through its essence but through
        participation in something. The first agent, therefore, namely, God, has
        no admixture of potency but is pure act.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Further, just as each thing naturally acts in so far as it is in
        act, so it is naturally receptive in so far as it is in potency; for
        motion is the act of that which exists in potency. But God is absolutely
        impassible and immutable, as is clear from what we have said. He has,
        therefore, no part of potency—that is, passive potency.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Then, too, we see something in the world that emerges from potency
        to act. Now, it does not educe itself from potency to act, since that
        which is in potency, being still in potency, can therefore not act. Some
        prior being is therefore needed by which it may be brought forth from
        potency to act. This cannot go on to infinity. We must, therefore,
        arrive at some being that is only in act and in no wise in potency. This
        being we call God.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From this it is likewise evident that God is not matter.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Whatever matter is, it is in potency.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Matter, furthermore, is not a principle of acting. That is why,
        according to Aristotle, the efficient cause and matter do not coincide [
        <i>Physics</i> II, 7]. But, as we have said, it belongs to God to be the
        first efficient cause of things. Therefore, He is not matter.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Moreover, for those who reduced all things to matter as to the first
        cause it follows that natural things exist by chance. Aristotle argues
        against these thinkers in <i>Physics</i> II [8]. Hence, if God, Who is
        the first cause, is the material cause of things, it follows that all
        things exist by chance.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Again, matter does not become the cause of something actual except
        by being altered and changed. But if, as we have proved, God is
        absolutely immobile, He cannot in any way be the cause of things
        according to the mode of matter.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Now, the Catholic faith professes this truth, namely, it asserts
        that God has created all things, not out of His own substance, but out
        of nothing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] On this point, however, the madness of David of Dinant stands
        confounded. He dared to assert that God is the same as prime matter on
        the ground that, if He were not, He would have to differ from it by some
        differences, and thus they would not be simple. For in the being that
        differs from another by a difference, the difference itself produces a
        composition. David’s position was the result of ignorance. He did not
        know how to distinguish between difference and diversity. The different,
        as is determined in <i>Metaphysics</i> X [3], is said relationally, for
        every different is different by something. Something is called diverse,
        however, absolutely, from the fact that it is not the same. Difference,
        therefore, must be sought among those things that agree in something,
        for we must point to something in them according to which they differ:
        for example, two species agree in genus and must therefore be
        distinguished by differences. But in things that agree in nothing we
        need not seek the whereby they differ; they are diverse by themselves.
        In the same way, opposite differences are distinguished from one
        another. For they do not share in the genus as a part of their essence,
        and therefore, since they are by themselves diverse, there is no need to
        seek that by which they differ. In this way, too, God and prime matter
        are distinguished: one is pure act, the other is pure potency, and they
        agree in nothing.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From what we have set down we can conclude that there is no
        composition in God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] In every composite there must be act and potency. For several things
        cannot become absolutely one unless among them something is act and
        something potency. Now, beings in act are not united except by being, so
        to speak, bound or joined together, which means that they are not
        absolutely one. Their parts, likewise, are brought together as being in
        potency with respect to the union, since they are united in act after
        being potentially unitable. But in God there is no potency. Therefore,
        there is no composition in Him.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Every composite, moreover, is subsequent to its components. The
        first being, therefore, which is God, has no components.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Every composite, furthermore, is potentially dissoluble. This arises
        from the nature of composition, although in some composites there is
        another element that resists dissolution. Now, what is dissoluble can
        not-be. This does not befit God, since He is through Himself the
        necessary being. There is, therefore, no composition in God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Every composition, likewise, needs some composer. For, if there is
        composition, it is made up of a plurality, and a plurality cannot be
        fitted into a unity except by some composer. If, then, God were
        composite, He would have a composer. He could not compose Himself, since
        nothing is its own cause, because it would be prior to itself, which is
        impossible. Now, the composer is the efficient cause of the composite.
        Thus, God would have an efficient cause. Thus, too, He would not be the
        first cause—which was proved above.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Again, in every genus the simpler a being, the more noble it is:
        e.g., in the genus of the hot, Ere, which has no admixture of cold.
        That, therefore, which is at the peak of nobility among all beings must
        be at the peak of simplicity. But the being that is at the peak of
        nobility among all beings we call God, since He is the first cause. For
        a cause is nobler than an effect. God can, therefore, have no
        composition.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Furthermore, in every composite the good belongs, not to this or
        that part, but to the whole—and I say good according to the goodness
        that is proper to the whole and its perfection. For parts are imperfect
        in comparison with the whole, as the parts of man are not a man, the
        parts of the number six do not have the perfection of six, and similarly
        the parts of a line do not reach the perfection of the measure found in
        the whole line. If, then, God is composite, His proper perfection and
        goodness is found in the whole, not in any part of the whole. Thus,
        there will not be in God purely that good which is proper to Him. God,
        then, is not the first and highest good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] Again, prior to all multitude we must find unity. But there is
        multitude in every composite. Therefore, that which is before all
        things, namely, God, must be free of all composition.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Everything in which there is found something violent and outside
        nature has something added to itself, for what belongs to the substance
        of a thing can be neither violent nor outside nature. Now, nothing
        simple has anything added to itself, since this would render it
        composite. Since, then, God is simple, as we have shown, nothing in Him
        can be violent or outside nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Furthermore, the necessity of coaction is a necessity from another.
        But in God there is no necessity from another; He is necessary through
        Himself and the cause of necessity for other things. Therefore, nothing
        in God is due to coaction.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Again, wherever there is something violent, there can be something
        beyond what befits a thing through itself; for the violent is opposed to
        what is according to nature. But in God there cannot be anything beyond
        what befits Him according to Himself; for God, as we have shown, is of
        Himself the necessary being. There can, therefore, be nothing violent in
        God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Then, too, everything in which there can be something violent or
        unnatural is by nature able to be moved by another. For the violent is
        “that whose source is from the outside, the receiver being completely
        passive.” Now, as we have shown, God is absolutely immobile. There can,
        therefore, be nothing violent or unnatural in Him.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From the preceding remarks it is also shown that God is not a body.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Every body, being a continuum, is composite and has parts. But, as
        we have shown, God is not composite, and is, therefore, not a body.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Again, everything possessed of quantity is in a certain manner in
        potency. For a continuum is potentially divisible to infinity, while
        numbers can be increased to infinity. But every body has quantity and is
        therefore in potency. But God is not in potency, being pure act, as has
        been shown. Therefore, God is not a body.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Furthermore, if God is a body, He must be some natural body, since,
        as the Philosopher proves, a mathematical body is not something
        self-existing, since dimensions are accidents. But God is not a natural
        body, being immobile, as we have shown, whereas every natural body is
        movable. God is, therefore, not a body.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Again, every body is finite, as is proved in <i>De caelo</i> I [I,
        5] of a circular body and a rectilinear body. Now, we can transcend any
        given finite body by means of the intellect and the imagination. If,
        then, God is a body, our intellect and imagination can think of
        something greater than God. God is thus not greater than our
        intellect—which is awkward. God is, therefore, not a body.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Intellectual knowledge, moreover, is more certain than sensitive
        knowledge. In nature we find an object for the sense and therefore for
        the intellect as well. But the order and distinction of powers is
        according to the order of objects. Therefore, above all sensible things
        there is something intelligible among things. Now, every body having
        actual existence is sensible. Therefore, we can find something nobler
        above all bodies. Hence, if God is a body, He will not be the first and
        greatest being.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] A living thing, likewise, is nobler than any non-living body, and
        the life of a living body is nobler than it, since it is this life that
        gives to the living body its nobility above other bodies. Therefore,
        that than which nothing is nobler is not a body. Ibis is God. God is,
        therefore, not a body.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] Then, too, there are the arguments of the philosophers to the same
        effect, based on the eternity of motion. They are as follows. In every
        everlasting motion, the first mover cannot be moved either through
        Himself or by accident, as is clear from the above. Now, the body of the
        heavens is moved in a circle with an everlasting motion. Therefore, its
        first mover is not moved either through Himself or by accident. Now, no
        body moves locally unless it be moved, since the mover and the moved
        must be together. The moving body must thus be moved in order to be
        together with the moved body. But no power in a body moves unless it
        itself be moved by accident, since, when a body is moved, its power is
        by accident moved. The first mover of the heavens, therefore, is neither
        a body nor a power in a body. Now, that to which the motion of the
        heavens is ultimately reduced as to its first unmoved mover is God. God
        is, therefore, not a body.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] Again, no infinite power is a power in a magnitude. But the power of
        the prime mover is an infinite power. Therefore, it is not in any
        magnitude. Therefore, God, Who is the prime mover, is neither a body nor
        a power in a body.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] The first proposition is proved thus. If the power of some
        magnitude is infinite, it will be the power either of a finite magnitude
        or an infinite one. But there is no infinite magnitude, as is proved in
        <i>Physics</i> III [5] and <i>De caelo</i> I [5]. But a finite magnitude
        cannot have an infinite power. Therefore, an infinite power cannot
        reside in any magnitude. That an infinite power cannot reside in a
        finite magnitude is proved thus. A greater power produces an equal
        effect in a shorter time than a lesser power does in a longer time. This
        is true whether that effect be according to alteration, local motion, or
        any other motion whatever. But an infinite power is greater than every
        finite power. Therefore, by moving more swiftly, it should produce its
        effect in a shorter time than any finite power. Nor can it be in
        something lesser that still is in time, Therefore, this will be in an
        indivisible point of time. And thus to move, to be moved, and motion
        will take place in an instant—of which the contrary has been proved in
        <i>Physics</i> VI [3]. That an infinite power in a finite magnitude
        cannot move in time is likewise proved as follows. Let there be an
        infinite power A. Let us assume a part of that power to be AB. This part
        will, therefore, move in a greater time. Yet there must be some
        proportion of this time to the time in which the whole power moves,
        since both times are finite. Let these two times be related to one
        another in the proportion of one to ten, since for the present argument
        this proportion will do as well as any other. Now, if we add to the
        aforementioned finite power, we must diminish its time according to the
        proportion of the addition to the power; for a greater power moves in a
        lesser time. If the decuple be added, that power will move in a time
        that will be a tenth part of the time in which the first assumed part of
        the infinite power, namely, AB, moved. And yet this power, which is its
        decuple, is a finite power, since it has a determinate proportion to the
        finite power. Therefore, the finite and the infinite power will move in
        the same time—which is impossible. Therefore, the infinite power of a
        finite magnitude cannot move in time.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] That the power of the first mover is infinite is proved thus. No
        finite power can move in an infinite time. But the power of the first
        mover moves in an infinite time because the first motion is endless.
        Therefore, the power of the prime mover is infinite. The first
        proposition is proved thus. If the finite power of some body moves in an
        infinite time, a part of that body, having a part of the power, will
        move in a shorter time; for the greater the power of a mover, the more
        it will be able to keep up its motion in a longer time. Thus, the
        aforementioned part will move in a finite time, and a greater part will
        be able to move in a longer time. Thus, as we add to the power of the
        mover, we shall always add to the time according to the same proportion.
        But after a certain addition has been made, the addition win reach the
        quantity of the whole or even exceed it. So, too, an addition of time
        will reach the quantity of time in which it moves the whole. But the
        time in which it moved the whole was said to be infinite. Therefore, a
        finite time will measure an infinite time—which is impossible.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [12] But against this reasoning there are several objections.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [13] One objection is this. It can be assumed that the body that moves
        the first moved is not divisible, as is the case with a heavenly body.
        But the preceding proof is based on the division of the first body.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [14] The reply to this objection is as follows. There can be a true
        conditional proposition whose antecedent is impossible. If there is
        something that destroys the truth of this conditional proposition, it is
        then impossible. For example, if someone destroys the truth of the
        conditional proposition, <i>If man flies, he has wings</i>, it would be
        impossible. It is in this manner that the above proof is to be
        understood. For the following conditional proposition is true:
        <i
          >If a heavenly body is divided, a part of it will have less power than
          the whole</i
        >. Now, the truth of this conditional proposition is taken away if it be
        posited that the first mover is a body; and the reason is the
        impossibilities that follow from it. Therefore, to posit this is
        impossible. A similar reply can be given if objection is made concerning
        the increase of finite powers. We cannot assume powers in nature
        according to all proportions of time to any given time. Nevertheless,
        the proposition required in the above proof is a true conditional
        proposition.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [15] The second objection is this. Although a body is divided, it is
        possible to find in a given body a power that is not divided when the
        body is divided. For example, the rational soul is not divided if the
        body is divided.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [16] The reply is as follows. The above argument does not prove that God
        is not joined to a body as the rational soul is joined to the human
        body; it proves that He is not a power in a body in the manner of a
        material power, which is divided upon the division of the body. So, too,
        it is said of the human intellect that it is not a body or a power in a
        body. However, that God is not joined to a body as the soul is, this is
        another issue.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [17] The third objection is this. If some given body has a finite power,
        as the above argument shows, and if through a finite power nothing can
        endure through an infinite time, it will follow that no body can endure
        through an infinite time. Thus, a heavenly body will of necessity be
        corrupted.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [18] To this objection some reply that, as far as its own power is
        concerned, a heavenly body can fail, but it acquires an eternal duration
        from another being of an infinite power. Plato [ <i>Timaeus</i> ] seems
        to speak for this solution when he introduces God addressing the
        heavenly bodies as follows: “By your natures you are dissoluble, but
        through my will you are indissoluble; for my will is greater than your
        bond.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [19] The Commentator attacks this position in <i>Metaphysics</i> XI.
        According to him, it is impossible that what can of itself not-be should
        acquire a perpetuity of being from another. This would mean that
        something corruptible becomes incorruptible, which according to him is
        impossible. Hence, Averroes answers the objection as follows. All the
        potency that is in a heavenly body is finite, but there is no reason why
        a heavenly body should have every potency. For, according to Aristotle
        in <i>Metaphysics</i> VIII, there is in a heavenly body potency with
        respect to place, but not with respect to being. Hence, a heavenly body
        need not have a potency to non-being.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [20] This reply of the Commentator, however, is not sufficient. Even if
        we should grant that in a heavenly body there is no sort of a passive
        potency to being, which is the potency of matter, yet there is in it a
        potency of an active kind, which is the power of being. For Aristotle
        expressly says in <i>De caelo</i> I [I, 3] that the heavens have the
        power to be forever.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [21] Hence, it is better to reply as follows. Since potency is said
        relatively to act, we must judge of potency according to the mode of the
        act. Now, according to its nature, motion has quantity and extension,
        and hence its infinite duration requires that the potency moving it be
        infinite. But being does not have any quantitative extension, especially
        in the case of a thing, such as the heavens, whose being is without
        change. Hence, the power of being need not be infinite in a finite body,
        even though it will endure to infinity. For it is one and the same
        whether through that power something will endure for an instant or for
        an infinite time, since its changeless being is not touched by time
        except by accident.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [22] The fourth objection is this. In those beings that in moving are
        not themselves altered, it does not seem necessary that what moves in an
        infinite time should have an infinite power. For such a motion consumes
        nothing of their power, so that after they have moved for a time they
        are able to move for no less a time than before. Thus, the power of the
        sun is finite, and because its active power is not lessened by acting,
        it is able, according to its nature, to act on the sublunary world
        during an infinite time.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [23] To this the reply is, as we have proved, that a body does not move
        unless it be moved. If, then, it should happen that a certain body is
        not moved, that body will consequently not move. But in everything that
        is moved there is a potency towards opposites, since the termini of
        motion are opposites. Therefore, of itself, every body that is moved can
        also not-be-moved. But what can not-be-moved is not of itself able to be
        moved through endless time, and hence neither to move through endless
        time.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [24] The above demonstration, consequently, holds of the finite power of
        a finite body, which power of itself cannot move in an infinite time.
        But a body that of itself can be moved and not-moved, move and not-move,
        can acquire perpetuity of motion from another. This must be incorporeal.
        The first mover must, therefore, be incorporeal. Thus, according to its
        nature, nothing prevents a finite body, which acquires from another a
        perpetuity in being moved, from likewise having a perpetuity in moving.
        For the first heavenly body itself, according to its nature, can revolve
        the lower heavenly bodies with a perpetual motion, according as sphere
        moves sphere. Nor, according to the Commentator, is it impossible (as it
        was impossible in the me of perpetuity of being) that what of itself can
        be moved and not-moved should acquire perpetuity of motion from another.
        For motion is a certain flow out of the mover to the thing moved, and
        hence something moved can acquire from another a perpetuity of motion
        that it does not have of itself. To be, on the other hand, is something
        fixed and at rest in being, and, therefore, that which of itself is in
        potency to non-being cannot, as Averroes himself says [
        <i>In XII Metaphysicorum</i> ], following the course of nature acquire
        from another a perpetuity of being.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [25] The fifth objection is that, following the above reasoning, there
        does not seem to be a greater reason why an infinite power is not in a
        magnitude rather than outside a magnitude. For in either case it will
        follow that it moves in null time.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [26] To this the reply is that, in magnitude, time, and motion, finite
        and infinite are found according to one and the same notion, as is
        proved in <i>Physics</i> III [4] and VI [2, 7]. Therefore, the infinite
        in one of them removes a finite proportion in the others. But in beings
        without magnitude there is no finite or infinite except equivocally.
        Hence, the aforementioned method of demonstration is not applicable
        among such potencies.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [27] There is, however, another and better answer. The heavens have two
        movers, a proximate one with a finite power, which is responsible for
        the fact that they have a finite velocity, and a remote mover with an
        infinite power, which is responsible for the fact that their motion can
        be of an infinite duration. And thus it is evident that an infinite
        power that is not in a magnitude can move a body in time, but not
        immediately. But a power that is in a magnitude must move immediately,
        since no body moves except by being moved. Hence, if it did move, it
        would follow that it would move in null time.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [28] An even better reply is this. A power that is not in a magnitude is
        an intellect, and moves by will. For we have proved that the intellect
        is not a corporeal power. Therefore, it moves according to the needs of
        the movable body and not the proportion of its power; whereas a power
        that is in a magnitude can move only through the necessity of nature.
        Thus, of necessity, it moves according to the proportion of its
        quantity. Hence, if it moves, it moves in an instant.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [29] Thus, with the removal of the preceding objections, we see that the
        argumentation of Aristotle stands.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [30] No motion, furthermore, which is from a corporeal mover can be
        continuous and regular, because in local motion a corporeal mover moves
        by pulling and pushing. Now, what is pulled or pushed is not uniformly
        disposed towards its mover from the beginning to the end of the motion,
        since at times it will be nearer and at other times farther away. Thus,
        no body can move with a continuous and regular motion. But the first
        motion is continuous and regular, as is proved in <i>Physics</i> VIII
        [7]. Therefore, the mover of the first motion is not a body.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [31] Again, no motion to an end that passes from potency to act can be
        endless, since when it reaches act the motion comes to rest. If, then,
        the first motion is endless, it must aim at an end that is always and in
        all ways in act. But such an end is not a body or a power in a body,
        since all such things are movable either through themselves or by
        accident. Therefore, the end of the first motion is neither a body nor a
        power in a body. But the end of the first motion is the first mover,
        which moves as something desired. This, however, is God. God, therefore,
        is neither a body nor a power in a body.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [32] However, although according to our faith it is false that the
        motion of the heavens is perpetual, as will be made evident later on,
        yet it is true that it will not fail either through a failure of power
        in the mover or through the corruption of the substance in the moved;
        for there is no evidence that the passing of time has slowed down the
        motion of the heavens. Hence, the above demonstrations do not lose their
        force.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [33] With this demonstrated truth divine authority stands in agreement.
        For it is said in John (4:24): “God is a spirit, and they that adore Him
        must adore Him in spirit and in truth.” It is likewise said: “To the
        King of ages. immortal, invisible, the only God” (1 Tim. 1:17). Again:
        “The invisible things of God... are clearly seen, being understood by
        the things that are made” (Rom. 1:20); for what is seen, not by sight,
        but by the intellect, is incorporeal.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [34] Thereby is destroyed the error of the early natural philosophers,
        who posited only material causes, such as fire or water or the like, and
        who thus said that the first principles of things were bodies and called
        them gods. Among them there were some who further posited friendship and
        strife as moving causes. (They, too, were refuted through the above
        arguments.) For since, according to them, strife and friendship are in
        bodies, it will follow that the first moving principles are bodily
        powers. They also held that God is composed of the four elements and
        friendship, which would give us to understand that for them God was a
        heavenly body. Among the early thinkers, Anaxagoras alone approached the
        truth by positing that an intellect moved all things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [35] By this truth, too, are refuted the Gentiles, who, taking their
        beginning in the errors of the philosophers we have listed, posited that
        the elements of the world and the powers in them are gods; for example,
        the sun, the moon, the earth, water, and the like.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [36] By the same arguments, moreover, are set aside the wild fantasies
        of the simple Jews, Tertullian, the Vodiani or Anthropomorphite
        heretics, who endowed God with a bodily figure; and also of the
        Manicheans, who thought that God was a certain infinite substance of
        light, stretched out through an infinite space.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [37] The occasion of all these errors was that, in thinking of divine
        things, men were made the victims of their imagination, through which it
        is not possible to receive anything except the likeness of a body. This
        is why, in meditating on what is incorporeal, we must stop following the
        imagination.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">THAT GOD IS HIS ESSENCE</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From what has been laid down we can infer that God is His essence,
        quiddity, or nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] There must be some composition in every being that is not its
        essence or quiddity. Since, indeed, each thing possesses its own
        essence, if there were nothing in a thing outside its essence all that
        the thing is would be its essence; which would mean that the thing is
        its essence. But, if some thing were not its essence, there should be
        something in it outside its essence. Thus, there must be composition in
        it. Hence it is that the essence in composite things is signified as a
        part, for example, humanity in man. Now, it has been shown that there is
        no composition in God. God is, therefore, His essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Moreover, only that which does not enter the definition of a thing
        seems to be outside its essence or quiddity; for the definition
        signifies what a thing is. But it is only the accidents of a thing that
        do not fall in the definition; and therefore only the accidents in any
        thing are outside its essence. But, as will be shown, in God there are
        no accidents. There is, therefore, nothing in God outside His essence;
        and hence He is His essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Furthermore, forms that are not predicated of subsisting things,
        whether these be considered universally or each is taken singly, are
        forms that do not subsist through themselves as singulars individuated
        in themselves. We do not say that Socrates, or man, or animal is
        whiteness, because whiteness does not subsist as a singular through
        itself but is individuated through its subsisting subjects. In the same
        way, also, natural forms do not subsist as singulars through themselves
        but are individuated in their proper matters. That is why we do not say
        that this fire, or fire, is its own form. The very essences or
        quiddities of genera and species are individuated through the designated
        matter of this or that individual, even though the quiddity of the genus
        or the species should include common form and matter. That is why we do
        not say that Socrates or man is humanity. But the divine essence exists
        through itself as a singular existent and individuated through itself;
        for, as we have shown, it is not in any matter. The divine essence is
        predicated of God, therefore, so that we may say: God is His essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Again, the essence of a thing is either the thing itself or is
        related to the thing in some way as its cause; for a thing derives its
        species through its essence. But nothing can in any way be the cause of
        God, since, as we have shown, He is the first being. God is, therefore,
        His essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Then, too, what is not its essence is related to its essence,
        according to some part of itself, as potency to act. That is why the
        essence is signified in the manner of a form, for example, humanity.
        But, as was shown above, there is no potentiality in God. He must,
        therefore, be His essence.

        [1] From what was proved above, however, we can further prove that His
        essence or quiddity is not something other than His being.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] For it was shown above that there is some being that must be through
        itself, and this is God. If, then, this being that must be belongs to an
        essence that is not that which it is, either it is incompatible with
        that essence or repugnant to it, as to exist through itself is repugnant
        to the quiddity of whiteness, or it is compatible with it or appropriate
        to it, as to be in another is to whiteness. If the first alternative be
        the case, the being that is through itself necessary will not befit that
        quiddity, just as it does not befit whiteness to exist through itself.
        If the second alternative be the case, either such being must depend on
        the essence, or both must depend on another cause, or the essence must
        depend on the being. The first two alternatives are contrary to the
        nature of that which is through itself a necessary being; for if it
        depends on another, it is no longer a necessary being. From the third
        alternative it follows that that quiddity is added accidentally to the
        thing that is through itself a necessary being; for what follows upon a
        thing’s being is accidental to it and hence not its quiddity. God,
        therefore, does not have an essence that is not His being.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] But against this conclusion it can be objected that that being does
        not absolutely depend on that essence, so as not to be unless the
        essence existed; it depends, rather, on the essence with reference to
        the union by which it is joined to it. Thus, that being is through
        itself necessary, but its union with the essence is not.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] However, this reply does not escape the aforementioned difficulties.
        For, if that being can be understood without that essence, it will
        follow that the essence is related to that being in an accidental way.
        But that being is that which is through itself a necessary being.
        Therefore, that essence is related in an accidental way to that which is
        through itself a necessary being. It is, therefore, not its essence. But
        that which is through itself a necessary being is God. That essence,
        then, is not the essence of God, but some essence below God. On the
        other hand, if that being cannot be understood without that essence, it
        depends absolutely on that on which its union to that essence depends.
        We then reach the same impasse as before.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        15] Another argument. Each thing is through its own being. Hence, that
        which is not its own being is not through itself a necessary being. But
        God is through Himself a necessary being. He is, therefore, His own
        being.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Again, if God’s being is not His essence, and cannot be part of that
        essence, since, as we have shown, the divine essence is simple, such a
        being must be something outside the divine essence. But whatever belongs
        to a thing and is yet not of its essence belongs to it through some
        cause; for, if things that are not through themselves one are joined,
        they must be joined through some cause. Being, therefore, belongs to
        that quiddity through some cause. This is either through something that
        is part of the essence of that thing, or the essence itself, or through
        something else. If we adopt the first alternative, and it is a fact that
        the essence is through that being, it follows that something is the
        cause of its own being. This is impossible, because, in their notions,
        the existence of the cause is prior to that of the effect. If, then,
        something were its own cause of being, it would be understood to be
        before it had being—which is impossible, unless we understand that
        something is the cause of its own being in an accidental order, which is
        being in an accidental way. This is not impossible. It is possible that
        there be an accidental being that is caused by the principles of its
        subject before the substantial being of its subject is understood as
        given. Here, however, we are speaking of substantial being, not
        accidental being. On the other hand, if the being belongs to the essence
        through some other cause, then this follows: given that what acquires
        its being from another cause is something caused, and is not the first
        cause, whereas God, as was demonstrated above, is the first cause and
        has no cause, the quiddity that acquires its being from another is not
        the quiddity of God. God's being must, therefore, be His quiddity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Being, furthermore, is the name of an act, for a thing is not said
        to be because it is in potency but because it is in act. Everything,
        however, that has an act diverse from it is related to that act as
        potency to act; for potency and act are said relatively to one another.
        If, then, the divine essence is something other than its being, the
        essence and the being are thereby related as potency and act. But we
        have shown that in God there is no potency, but that He is pure act.
        God's essence, therefore, is not something other than His being.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] Moreover, if something can exist only when several elements come
        together, it is composite. But no thing in which the essence is other
        than the being can exist unless several elements come together, namely,
        the essence and the being. Hence, every thing in which the essence is
        other than the being is composite. But, as we have shown, God is not
        composite. Therefore, God's being is His essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] Every thing, furthermore, exists because it has being. A thing whose
        essence is not its being, consequently, is not through its essence but
        by participation in something, namely, being itself. But that which is
        through participation in something cannot be the first being, because
        prior to it is the being in which it participates in order to be. But
        God is the first being, with nothing prior to Him. His essence is,
        therefore, His being.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] This sublime truth Moses was taught by our Lord. When Moses asked
        our Lord: “If the children of Israel say to me: what is His name? What
        shall I say to them?” The Lord replied: “I AM WHO AM.... You shall say
        to the children of Israel: HE WHO IS has sent me to you” (Exod. 3:13,
        14). By this our Lord showed that His own proper name is HE WHO IS. Now,
        names have been devised to signify the natures or essences of things. It
        remains, then, that the divine being is God's essence or nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] Catholic teachers have likewise professed this truth. For Hilary
        writes in his book <i>De Trinitate</i> [II]: “Being is not an accident
        in God but subsisting truth, the abiding cause and the natural property
        His nature.” Boethius also says in his own work
        <i>De Trinitate</i> [II]: “The divine substance is being itself, and
        from it comes being.”

      <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">THAT NO ACCIDENT IS FOUND IN GOD</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] It follows necessarily from this truth that nothing can come to God
        beyond His essence, nor can there be anything in Him in an accidental
        way.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] For being cannot participate in anything that is not of its essence,
        although that which is can participate in something. The reason is that
        nothing is more formal or more simple than being, which thus
        participates in nothing. But the divine substance is being itself, and
        therefore has nothing that is not of its substance. Hence, no accident
        can reside in it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Furthermore, what is present in a thing accidentally has a cause of
        its presence, since it is outside the essence of the thing in which it
        is found. If, then, something is found in God accidentally, this must be
        through some cause. Now, the cause of the accident is either the divine
        essence itself or something else. If something else, it must act on the
        divine essence, since nothing will cause the introduction of some form,
        substantial or accidental, in some receiving subject except by acting on
        it in some way. For to act is nothing other than to make something
        actual, which takes place through a form. Thus, God will suffer and
        receive the action of some cause—which is contrary to what we already
        established. On the other hand, let us suppose that the divine substance
        is the cause of the accident inhering in it. Now it is impossible that
        it be, as receiving it, the cause of the accident, for then one and the
        same thing would make itself to be actual in the same respect.
        Therefore, if there is an accident in God, it will be according to
        different respects that He receives and causes that accident, just as
        bodily things receive their accidents through the nature of their matter
        and cause them through their form. Thus, God will be composite. But, we
        have proved the contrary of this proposition above.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Every subject of an accident, moreover, is related to it as potency
        to act, since the accident is a certain form making the subject to be
        actual according to an accidental being. But, as we have shown above,
        there is no potentiality in God. There can, therefore, be no accident in
        Him.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Then, too, when a being has an accident inhering in it, it is in
        some way mutable according to its nature, since an accident can inhere
        or not-inhere. If, then, God has something belonging to Him in an
        accidental way, He will consequently be mutable. But the contrary of
        this was demonstrated above.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Again, that which has an accident inhering in it is not whatever it
        has in itself, since an accident is not part of the essence of the
        subject. But God is what He has in Himself. There is, therefore, no
        accident in God. The minor proposition is proved thus. Everything is
        found in a more noble way in the cause than in an effect. But God is the
        cause of all things. Hence, whatever is in Him is there in the most
        noble way. Now, what a thing itself is, this belongs to it in a most
        perfect way. For this is some thing more perfectly one than when
        something is joined to something else substantially as form to matter;
        just as substantial union is more perfect than when something inheres in
        something else as an accident. God, then, is whatever He has.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] It is also a fact that a substance does not depend on an accident,
        although an accident depends on a substance. But what does not depend on
        something can sometimes be found without it. Some substance, then, can
        be found without an accident. This seems especially to fit the substance
        that is most simple, such as the divine substance is. The divine
        substance, therefore, has no accidents whatever.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] In dealing with this problem, Catholics likewise give assent to this
        opinion. Whence Augustine says in his <i>De Trinitate</i> [V, 4] that
        “there is no accident in God.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] The proof of this truth serves as a refutation of the error of some
        Saracen theologians “who posit certain intentions superadded to the
        divine essence.

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] We can likewise show from what we have said that nothing can be
        added to the divine being to determine it with an essential
        determination, as a genus is determined by its differences.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Nothing can be in act unless everything that determines its
        substantial act of being exists. Thus, there cannot be an actual animal
        unless it be a rational or an irrational animal. Hence, the Platonists
        themselves, in positing the Ideas, did not posit self-existing Ideas of
        genera, which are determined to the being of their species through
        essential differences; rather, they posited self-existing Ideas solely
        of species, which for their determination need no essential differences.
        If, then, the divine being is determined essentially through something
        else superadded to it, it will be in act only if what is superadded is
        present. But the divine being, as we have shown, is the divine substance
        itself. Therefore the divine substance cannot be in act without the
        presence of something added; from which it can be concluded that it is
        not through itself a necessary being. But, we have proved the contrary
        of this proposition above.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Moreover, what needs an addition in order to be is in potency in
        relation to this addition. But, as we have shown, the divine substance
        is not in any way in potency; rather, the divine substance is its being.
        The divine being, therefore, cannot be determined in its substance
        through something superadded to it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Again, that through which a thing derives being in act and is
        intrinsic to it is either the whole essence of that thing or a part of
        the essence. But that which determines something in an essential way
        makes that thing to be in act and is intrinsic to the determined thing;
        otherwise, the thing could not be determined substantially by it. It
        must therefore be either the essence itself or a part of the essence.
        But, if something is added to the divine being, this cannot be the whole
        essence of God, since it has already been shown that God’s being is not
        other than His essence. It must, then, be a part of the essence, which
        means that God will be composed of essential parts. But, we have proved
        the contrary of this above.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Furthermore, what is added to a thing to give it a certain essential
        determination does not constitute its nature but only its being in act.
        For rational added to animal gains for animal being in act, but it does
        not constitute the nature of animal as animal, since the difference does
        not enter the definition of the genus. But, if something is added in God
        by which He is determined in His essence, that addition must constitute
        for the being to which it is added the nature of its own quiddity or
        essence, since what is thus added gains for a thing its being in act.
        But in God this “being in act” is the divine essence itself, as we have
        shown above. It remains, then, that to the divine being nothing can be
        added that determines it in an essential way, as the difference
        determines the genus.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">THAT GOD IS NOT IN SOME GENUS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From this we infer necessarily that God is not in some genus.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Every thing in a genus has something within it by which the nature
        of the genus is determined to its species; for nothing is in a genus
        that is not in some species of that genus. But, as we have shown, this
        determination cannot take place in God. God cannot, then, be in some
        genus.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] If, moreover, God is in a genus, either He is in the genus of
        accident or in that of substance. He is not in the genus of accident,
        since the first being and the first cause cannot be an accident. Neither
        can God be in the genus of substance, since the substance that is a
        genus is not being itself; otherwise, every substance would be its being
        and would thus not be caused by another—which is impossible, as is
        evident from what we have said. Therefore, God is not in some genus.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Again, whatever is in a genus differs in being from the other things
        in that genus; otherwise, the genus would not be predicated of many
        things. But all the things that are in the same genus must agree in the
        quiddity of the genus, since the genus is predicated of all things in it
        in terms of what they are. In other words, the being of each thing found
        in a genus is outside the quiddity of the genus. This is impossible in
        God. God, therefore, is not in a genus.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Then, too, each thing is placed in a genus through the nature of its
        quiddity, for the genus is a predicate expressing what a thing is. But
        the quiddity of God is His very being. Accordingly, God is not located
        in a genus, because then being, which signifies the act of being, would
        be a genus. Therefore, God is not in a genus.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Now, that being cannot be a genus is proved by the Philosopher in
        the following way [ <i>Metaphysics</i> III, 3]. If being were a genus we
        should have to find a difference through which to contract it to a
        species. But no difference shares in the genus in such a way that the
        genus is included in the notion of the difference, for thus the genus
        would be included twice in the definition of the species. Rather, the
        difference is outside what is understood in the nature of the genus. But
        there can be nothing that is outside that which is understood by being,
        if being is included in the concept of the things of which it is
        predicated. Thus, being cannot be contracted by any difference. Being
        is, therefore, not a genus. From this we conclude necessarily that God
        is not in a genus.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] From this it is likewise evident that God cannot be defined, for
        every definition is constituted from the genus and the differences.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] It is also clear that no demonstration is possible about God, except
        through an effect; for the principle of demonstration is the definition
        of that of which the demonstration is made.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] Now it can seem to someone that, although the name substance cannot
        properly apply to God because God does not substand accidents, yet the
        thing signified by the name is appropriate and thus God is in the genus
        of substance. For a substance is a being through itself. Now, this is
        appropriate to God, since we have proved that He is not an accident.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] To this contention we must reply, in accord with what we have said,
        that being through itself is not included in the definition of
        substance. For, if something is called being, it cannot be a genus,
        since we have already proved that being does not have the nature of a
        genus. Neither can what is through itself be a genus, since the
        expression seems to indicate nothing more than a negation. Something is
        said to be a being through itself because it is not in another. This is
        a pure negation, which likewise cannot constitute the nature of a genus;
        for a genus would then say, not what a thing is, but what it is not. The
        nature of substance, therefore, must be understood as follows. A
        substance is a thing to which it belongs to be not in a subject. The
        name thing takes its origin from the quiddity, just as the name being
        comes from to be. In this way, the definition of substance is understood
        as that which has a quiddity to which it belongs to be not in another.
        Now, this is not appropriate to God, for He has no quiddity save His
        being. In no way, then, is God in the genus of substance. Thus, He is in
        no genus, since we have shown that He is not in the genus of accident.

          >THAT GOD IS NOT THE FORMAL BEING OF ALL THINGS</span
        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] We are now able to refute the error of certain persons who said that
        God is nothing other than the formal being of each thing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] This being is divided into the being of substance and the being of
        accident. Now, we have proved that the divine being is neither the being
        of substance nor that of accident. God, therefore, cannot be that being
        by which each thing formally is.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Furthermore, things are not distinguished from one another in having
        being, for in this they agree. If, then, things differ from one another,
        either their being must be specified through certain added differences,
        so that diverse things have a diverse being according to their species,
        or things must differ in that the being itself is appropriate to natures
        that are diverse in species. The first of these alternatives is
        impossible, since, as we have said, no addition can be made to a being
        in the manner in which a difference is added to a genus. It remains,
        then, that things differ because they have diverse natures, to which
        being accrues in a diverse way. Now, the divine being does not accrue to
        a nature that is other than it; it is the nature itself, as we have
        said. If, therefore, the divine being were the formal being of all
        things, all things would have to be absolutely one.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Then, too, a principle is naturally prior to that whose principle it
        is. Now, in certain things being has something that is as its principle.
        For the form is said to be a principle of being, and so is the agent,
        that makes things to be in act. If, therefore, the divine being is the
        being of each thing, it will follow that God, Who is His own being, has
        some cause. Thus, He is not through Himself a necessary being. But, we
        have proved the contrary of this conclusion above.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Moreover, that which is common to many is not outside the many
        except by the reason alone. Thus, animal is not something outside
        Socrates and Plato and the other animals except in the intellect that
        apprehends the form of animal stripped of all its individuating and
        specifying characteristics. For man is that which truly is animal;
        otherwise, it would follow that in Socrates and Plato there are several
        animals, namely, common animal itself, common man, and Plato himself.
        Much less, then, is common being itself something outside all existing
        things, save only for being in the intellect. Hence, if God is common
        being, the only thing that will exist is that which exists solely in the
        intellect. But we showed above that God is something not only in the
        intellect but also in reality. Therefore, God is not the common being of
        all things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Again, strictly speaking, generation is the way to being and
        corruption the way to non-being. For form is not the terminus of
        generation, and privation is not the terminus of corruption, except
        because a form causes being and privation non-being. If a form did not
        cause being, a thing which received such a form would not be said to be
        generated. Hence, if God is the formal being of all things, He will
        consequently be the terminus of generation. This is false, since, as we
        have shown above, God is eternal.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] It will also follow that the being of each thing has existed from
        eternity. Generation or corruption is therefore impossible. If it does
        exist, pre-existing being must accrue to something anew. It will
        therefore accrue either to something pre-existing or to something in no
        way pre-existing. In the first instance, since according to the above
        position the being of all existing things is one, it will follow that a
        thing that is said to be generated acquires, not a new being, but a new
        mode of being. The result is alteration, not generation. But, if the
        generated thing in no way pre-existed, it will follow that it is
        produced from nothing—which is contrary to the nature of generation.
        This position, therefore, entirely ruins generation and corruption and,
        as a consequence, is evidently impossible.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] Sacred Teaching as well casts aside this error in confessing that
        God is “high and elevated,” according to Isaiah (6:1), and that He is
        “over all,” according to Romans (9:5). For, if He is the being of all
        things, He is part of all things, but not over them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] So, too, those who committed this error are condemned by the same
        judgment as are the idolaters who “gave the incommunicable name,” that
        is, of God, “to wood and stones,” as it is written (Wis. 14:21). If,
        indeed, God is the being of all things, there will be no more reason to
        say truly that a stone is a being than to say that a stone is God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] Four factors seem to have contributed to the rise of this error.
        The first is the warped interpretation of certain authoritative texts.
        There is in Dionysius this remark [ <i>De caelisti hierarchia</i> IV,
        1]: “The being of all things is the super-essential divinity.” From this
        remark they wished to infer that God is the formal being of all things,
        without considering that this interpretation could not square with the
        words themselves. For, if the divinity is the formal being of all
        things, it will not be over all but among all, indeed a part of all.
        Now, since Dionysius said that the divinity was above all things, he
        showed that according to its nature it was distinct from all things and
        raised above all things. And when he said that the divinity is the being
        of all things, he showed that there was in all things a certain likeness
        of the divine being, coming from God. Elsewhere Dionysius has rather
        openly set aside this warped interpretation. He has said: “God neither
        touches nor is in any way mingled with other things, as a point touches
        a line or the figure of a seal touches wax” [
        <i>De divinis nominibusi</i> II, 5].
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] The second cause leading them to this error is a failure of reason.
        For, since that which is common is specified or individuated through
        addition, they thought that the divine being, which receives no
        addition, was not some proper being but the common being of all things.
        They ignored the fact that what is common or universal cannot exist
        without addition, but is considered without addition. For animal cannot
        be without the difference rational or the difference irrational,
        although it is considered without these differences. What is more,
        although a universal may be considered without addition, it is not
        without the receptibility of addition; for, if no difference could be
        added to animal, it would not be a genus. The same is true of all other
        names. But the divine being is without addition not only in thought but
        also in reality; and not only without addition but also without the
        receptibility of addition. From the fact, then, that it neither receives
        nor can receive addition we can rather conclude that God is not common
        being but proper being; for His being is distinguished from all the rest
        by the fact that nothing can be added to it. Hence the Commentator says
        in the Book of Causes that, out of the purity of its goodness, the first
        cause is distinguished from the rest and in a manner individuated.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [12] The third factor that led them into this error concerns the divine
        simplicity. God is at the peak of simplicity. They therefore thought
        that the last point of resolution in our way of seeing things is God, as
        being absolutely simple. For it is not possible to proceed to infinity
        in composition among the things we know. Their reason also failed
        because they did not observe that what is most simple in our
        understanding of things is not so much a complete thing as a part of a
        thing. But, simplicity is predicated of God as of some perfect
        subsisting thing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [13] A fourth factor that could have led them to their error is the mode
        of expression we use when we say that God is in all things. By this we
        do not mean that God is in things as a part of a thing, but as the cause
        of a thing that is never lacking to its effect. For we do not say that a
        form is in matter as a sailor is in a ship.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Having shown that God is not the being of all things, we can
        likewise show that He is not the form of any thing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] As we have shown, the divine being cannot belong to any quiddity
        that is not being itself. Now, only God is the divine being itself. It
        is impossible, therefore, for God to be the form of some other being.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Furthermore, the form of a body is not the being itself, but a
        principle of being. But God is being itself. He is, therefore, not the
        form of a body.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Again, the union of form and matter results in a composite, which is
        a whole with respect to the matter and the form. But the parts are in
        potency in relation to the whole. In God, however, there is no
        potentiality. Therefore, God cannot be a form united to some thing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Moreover, that which has being through itself is nobler than that
        which has being in another. But every form of a body has being in
        another. Since, then, God, as the first cause of being, is the noblest
        being, He cannot be the form of any being.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] The same conclusion can also be reached in the following way from
        the eternity of motion. If God is the form of some movable body, since
        He is the first mover, the composite will be self-moving. But something
        self-moving can be moved and not-moved. Both possibilities are found in
        it. But such a being does not of itself have an indefectibility of
        motion. Above the self-moving being, therefore, we must posit another
        first mover, which gives to the self-moving being the endlessness of its
        motion. Thus, God, Who is the first mover, is not the form of a
        self-moving body.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] This argumentation is suitable for those who posit the eternity of
        motion. Those who do not posit it can reach the same conclusion from the
        regularity of the motion of the heavens. For just as a self-mover can be
        at rest and in motion, so it can be moved more swiftly and less so. The
        necessity in the uniformity of the motion of the heavens, therefore,
        depends on some higher and absolutely immobile principle, which is not a
        part of a self-moving body as the form of that body.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] The authority of Scripture is in agreement with this truth. For it
        is said in a Psalm (8:2): “Your magnificence is elevated above the
        heavens”; and in Job (11:8, 9): “He is higher than heaven, and what will
        you do?... His measure is longer than the earth and deeper than the
        sea.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] Thus, then, is removed the error of the Gentiles, who said that God
        is the soul of the heavens, or even the soul of the whole world. Thereby
        they defended the error of idolatry, by saying that the whole world was
        God not by reason of the body but by reason of the soul; just as man is
        said to be wise not by reason of the body but by reason of the soul. On
        the basis of this error the Gentiles thought it to follow that, not
        unfittingly, divine worship should be shown to the world and its parts.
        The Commentator also says that this point was the place where the Zabii
        stumbled and fell from wisdom—because, namely, they posited that God is
        the form of the heavens [ <i>In XII Metaphysicorum</i> ].

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Although the things that exist and live are more perfect than the
        things that merely exist, nevertheless, God, Who is not other than His
        being, is a universally perfect being. And I call universally perfect
        that to which the excellence of no genus is lacking.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Every excellence in any given thing belongs to it according to its
        being. For man would have no excellence as a result of his wisdom unless
        through it he were wise. So, too, with the other excellences. Hence, the
        mode of a thing’s excellence is according to the mode of its being. For
        a thing is said to be more or less excellent according as its being is
        limited to a certain greater or lesser mode of excellence. Therefore, if
        there is something to which the whole power of being belongs, it can
        lack no excellence that is proper to some thing. But for a thing that is
        its own being it is proper to be according to the whole power of being.
        For example, if there were a separately existing whiteness, it could not
        lack any of the power of whiteness. For a given white thing lacks
        something of the power of whiteness through a defect in the receiver of
        the whiteness, which receives it according to its mode and perhaps not
        according to the whole power of whiteness. God, therefore, Who is His
        being, as we have proved above, has being according to the whole power
        of being itself. Hence, He cannot lack any excellence that belongs to
        any given thing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] But just as every excellence and perfection is found in a thing
        according as that thing is, so every defect is found in it according as
        in some way it is not. Now, just as God bas being wholly, so non-being
        is wholly absent from Him. For as a thing has being, in that way is it
        removed from non-being. Hence, all defect is absent from God. He is,
        therefore, universally perfect.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Those things that merely exist are not imperfect because of an
        imperfection in absolute being. For they do not possess being according
        to its whole power; rather, they participate in it through a certain
        particular and most imperfect mode.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Furthermore, everything that is imperfect must be preceded by
        something perfect. Thus, the seed is from the animal or the plant. The
        first being must, therefore, be most perfect. But we have shown that God
        is the first being. He is, therefore, most perfect.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Again, each thing is perfect according as it is in act, and
        imperfect according as it is in potency and lacking act. Hence, that
        which is in no way in potency, but is pure act, must be most perfect.
        Such, however, is God. God is, therefore, most perfect.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Nothing, moreover, acts except as it is in act. Hence, action
        follows the mode of act in the agent. It is therefore impossible that an
        effect brought forth by an action be of a more excellent act than is the
        act of the agent. On the other hand, it is possible that the act of the
        effect be less perfect than the act of the efficient cause, since an
        action can become weakened through the effect in which it terminates.
        Now, in the genus of the efficient cause there is a reduction to one
        cause, called God, as is evident from what we have said; and from this
        cause, as we shall show later on, all things come. Hence, it is
        necessary that whatever is found in act in any thing whatever must be
        found in God in a more eminent way than in that thing itself. But the
        converse is not true. God, therefore, is most perfect.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] In every genus, furthermore, there is something that is most perfect
        for that genus, acting as a measure for all other things in the genus.
        For each thing is shown to be more or less perfect according as it
        approaches more or less to the measure of its genus. Thus, white is said
        to be the measure among all colors, and the virtuous man among all men.
        Now, the measure of all beings cannot be other than God, Who is His own
        being. No perfection, consequently, that is appropriate to this or that
        thing is lacking to Him; otherwise, He would not be the common measure
        of all things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] This is why, when Moses asked to see the divine countenance or
        glory, he received this reply from the Lord: “I will show you all good,”
        as it is written in Exodus (33:18, 19); by which the Lord gave Moses to
        understand that the fullness of all goodness was in Him. Dionysius
        likewise says: “God does not exist in a certain way; He possesses, and
        this before all others, all being within Himself absolutely and
        limitlessly” [ <i>De div. nom.</i> V, 4].
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] We must note, however, that perfection cannot be attributed to God
        appropriately if we consider the signification of the name according to
        its origin; for it does not seem that what is not made [ <i>factum</i> ]
        can be called perfect [ <i>perfectum</i> ]. But everything that comes to
        be is brought forth from potency to act and from non-being to being when
        it has been made. That is why it is rightly said to be perfect, as being
        completely made, at that moment when the potency is wholly reduced to
        act, so that it retains no non-being but has a completed being. By a
        certain extension of the name, consequently, perfect is said not only of
        that which by way of becoming reaches a completed act, but also of that
        which, without any making whatever, is in complete act. It is thus that,
        following the words of Matthew (5:48), we say that God is perfect: “Be
        perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect.”

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] In the light of what we have said, we are able to consider how a
        likeness to God is and is not possible in things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Effects that fall short of their causes do not agree with them in
        name and nature. Yet, some likeness must be found between them, since it
        belongs to the nature of action that an agent produce its like, since
        each thing acts according as it is in act. The form of an effect,
        therefore, is certainly found in some measure in a transcending cause,
        but according to another mode and another way. For this reason the cause
        is called an equivocal cause. Thus, the sun causes heat among these
        sublunary bodies by acting according as it is in act. Hence, the heat
        generated by the sun must bear some likeness to the active power of the
        sun, through which beat is caused in this sublunary world; and because
        of this beat the sun is said to be hot, even though not in one and the
        same way. And so the sun is said to be somewhat like those things in
        which it produces its effects as an efficient cause. Yet the sun is also
        unlike all these things in so far as such effects do not possess heat
        and the like in the same way as they are found in the sun. So, too, God
        gave things all their perfections and thereby is both like and unlike
        all of them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Hence it is that Sacred Scripture recalls the likeness between God
        and creatures, as when it is said in Genesis (1:26): “Let us make man to
        our image and likeness.” At times the likeness is denied, as in the text
        of Isaiah (40:18): “To whom then have you likened God, and what image
        will you make for Him?” or in the Psalm (82:1) [Vulgate]: “O God, who is
        like You?”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Dionysius is in agreement with this argument when he says: “The same
        things are both like and unlike God. They are like according as they
        imitate as much as they can Him Who is not perfectly imitable, they are
        unlike according as effects are lesser than their causes” [
        <i>De div. nom.</i> IX, 7].
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] In the light of this likeness, nevertheless, it is more fitting to
        say that a creature is like God rather than the converse. For that is
        called like something which possesses a quality or form of that thing.
        Since, then, that which is found in God perfectly is found in other
        things according to a certain diminished participation, the basis on
        which the likeness is observed belongs to God absolutely, but not to the
        creature. Thus, the creature has what belongs to God and, consequently,
        is rightly said to be like God. But we cannot in the same way say that
        God has what belongs to the creature. Neither, then, can we
        appropriately say that God is like a creature, just as we do not say
        that man is like his image, although the image is rightly said to be
        like him.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] All the less proper, moreover, is the expression that God is likened
        to a creature. For likening expresses a motion towards likeness and thus
        belongs to the being that receives from another that which makes it
        like. But a creature receives from God that which makes it like Him. The
        converse, however, does not hold. God, then, is not likened to a
        creature; rather, the converse is true.

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From what we have said we can further consider what it is possible
        to say or not to say of God, what is said of Him alone, and also what is
        said of Him and other things together.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Since it is possible to find in God every perfection of creatures,
        but in another and more eminent way, whatever names unqualifiedly
        designate a perfection without defect are predicated of God and of other
        things: for example, goodness, wisdom, being, and the like. But when any
        name expresses such perfections along with a mode that is proper to a
        creature, it can be said of God only according to likeness and metaphor.
        According to metaphor, what belongs to one thing is transferred to
        another, as when we say that a man is a stone because of the hardness of
        his intellect. Such names are used to designate the species of a created
        thing, for example, man and stone, for to each species belongs its own
        mode of perfection and being. The same is true of whatever names
        designate the properties of things, which are caused by the proper
        principles of their species. Hence, they can be said of God only
        metaphorically. But the names that express such perfections along with
        the mode of supereminence with which they belong to God are said of God
        alone. Such names are the highest good, the first being, and the like.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] I have said that some of the aforementioned names signify a
        perfection without defect. This is true with reference to that which the
        name was imposed to signify; for as to the mode of signification, every
        name is defective. For by means of a name we express things in the way
        in which the intellect conceives them. For our intellect, taking the
        origin of its knowledge from the senses, does not transcend the mode
        which is found in sensible things, in which the form and the subject of
        the form are not identical owing to the composition of form and matter.
        Now, a simple form is indeed found among such things, but one that is
        imperfect because it is not subsisting; on the other hand, though a
        subsisting subject of a form is found among sensible things, it is not
        simple but rather concreted. Whatever our intellect signifies as
        subsisting, therefore, it signifies in concretion; but what it signifies
        as simple, it signifies, not as that which is, but as that by which
        something is. As a result, with reference to the mode of signification
        there is in every name that we use an imperfection, which does not befit
        God, even though the thing signified in some eminent way does befit God.
        This is clear in the name goodness and good. For goodness has
        signification as something not subsisting, while good has signification
        as something concreted. And so with reference to the mode of
        signification no name is fittingly applied to God; this is done only
        with reference to that which the name has been imposed to signify. Such
        names, therefore, as Dionysius teaches [ <i>De divinis nominibus</i> I,
        5, <i>De caelesti hierarchia</i> II, 3], can be both affirmed and denied
        of God. They can be affirmed because of the meaning of the name; they
        can be denied because of the mode of signification.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Now, the mode of supereminence in which the abovementioned
        perfections are found in God can be signified by names used by us only
        through negation, as when we say that God is eternal or infinite, or
        also through a relation of God to other things, as when He is called the
        first cause or the highest good. For we cannot grasp what God is, but
        only what He is not and how other things are related to Him, as is clear
        from what we said above.

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From what has been said it can likewise be seen that the divine
        perfection and the plurality of names said of God are not opposed to His
        simplicity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] We have said that all the perfections found in other things are
        attributed to God in the same way as effects are found in their
        equivocal causes. These effects are in their causes virtually, as heat
        is in the sun. For, unless the power of the sun belonged to some extent
        to the genus of heat, the sun acting through this power would not
        generate anything like itself. The sun, then, is said to be hot through
        this power not only because it produces heat, but also because the power
        through which it does this has some likeness to heat. But through the
        same power through which it produces heat, the sun produces also many
        other effects among sublunary bodies-for example, dryness. And thus heat
        and dryness, which in fire are diverse qualities, belong to the sun
        through one and the same power. So, too, the perfections of all things,
        which belong to the rest of things through diverse forms, must be
        attributed to God through one and the same power in Him. This power is
        nothing other than His essence, since, as we have proved, there can be
        no accident in God. Thus, therefore, God is called wise not only in so
        far as He produces wisdom, but also because, in so far as we are wise,
        we imitate to some extent the power by which He makes us wise. On the
        other hand, God is not called a stone, even though He has made stones,
        because in the name stone there is understood a determinate mode of
        being according to which a stone is distinguished from God. But the
        stone imitates God as its cause in being and goodness, and other such
        characteristics, as do also the rest of creatures.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] A similar situation obtains among the knowing and operative powers
        of man. For by its single power the intellect knows all the things that
        the sensitive part of the soul grasps through a diversity of powers-and
        many other things as well. So, too, the higher an intellect is, the more
        it can know more things through one likeness, while a lesser intellect
        manages to know many things only through many likenesses. So, too, a
        ruling power extends to all those things to which diverse powers under
        it are ordered. In this way, therefore, through His one simple being God
        possesses every kind of perfection that all other things come to
        possess, but in a much more diminished way, through diverse principles.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] From this we see the necessity of giving to God many names. For,
        since we cannot know Him naturally except by arriving at Him from His
        effects, the names by which we signify His perfection must be diverse,
        just as the perfections belonging to things are found to be diverse.
        Were we able to understand the divine essence itself as it is and give
        to it the name that belongs to it, we would express it by only one name.
        This is promised to those who will see God through His essence: “In that
        day there shall be one Lord, and His name shall be one” (Zach. 14:9).

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] It is thereby evident that nothing can be predicated univocally of
        God and other things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] An effect that does not receive a form specifically the same as that
        through which the agent acts cannot receive according to a univocal
        predication the name arising from that form. Thus, the heat generated by
        the sun and the sun itself are not called univocally hot. Now, the forms
        of the things God has made do not measure up to a spccific likeness of
        the divine power; for the things that God has made receive in a divided
        and particular way that which in Him is found in a simple and universal
        way. It is evident, then, that nothing can be said univocally of God and
        other things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] If, furthermore, an effect should measure up to the species of its
        cause, it will not receive the univocal predication of the name unless
        it receives the same specific form according to the same mode of being.
        For the house that is in the art of the maker is not univocally the same
        house that is in matter, for the form of the house does not have the
        same being in the two locations. Now, even though the rest of things
        were to receive a form that is absolutely the same as it is in God, yet
        they do not receive it according to the same mode of being. For, as is
        clear from what we have said, there is nothing in God that is not the
        divine being itself, which is not the case with other things. Nothing,
        therefore, can be predicated of God and other things univocally.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Moreover, whatever is predicated of many things univocally is either
        a genus, a species, a difference, an accident, or a property. But, as we
        have shown, nothing is predicated of God as a genus or a difference; and
        thus neither is anything predicated as a definition, nor likewise as a
        species, which is constituted of genus and difference. Nor, as we have
        shown, can there be any accident in God, and therefore nothing is
        predicated of Him either as an accident or a property, since property
        belongs to the genus of accidents. It remains, then, that nothing is
        predicated univocally of God and other things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Again, what is predicated of many things univocally is simpler than
        both of them, at least in concept. Now, there can be nothing simpler
        than God either in reality or in concept. Nothing, therefore, is
        predicated univocally of God and other things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Everything, likewise, that is predicated univocally of many things
        belongs through participation to each of the things of which it is
        predicated; for the species is said to participate in the genus and the
        individual in the species. But nothing is said of God by participation,
        since whatever is participated is determined to the mode of that which
        is participated and is thus possessed in a partial way and not according
        to every mode of perfection. Nothing, therefore, can be predicated
        univocally of God and other things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Then, too, what is predicated of some things according to priority
        and posteriority is certainly not predicated univocally. For the prior
        is included in the definition of the posterior, as substance is included
        in the definition of accident according as an accident is a being. If,
        then, being were said univocally of substance and accident, substance
        would have to be included in the definition of being in so far as being
        is predicated of substance. But this is clearly impossible. Now nothing
        is predicated of God and creatures as though they were in the same
        order, but, rather, according to priority and posteriority. For all
        things are predicated of God essentially. For God is called being as
        being entity itself, and He is called good as being goodness itself. But
        in other beings predications are made by participation, as Socrates is
        said to be a man, not because he is humanity itself, but because he
        possesses humanity. It is impossible, therefore, that anything be
        predicated univocally of God and other things.

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From what we have said it likewise appears that not everything
        predicated of God and other things is said in a purely equivocal way, in
        the manner of equivocals by chance.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] For in equivocals by chance there is no order or reference of one to
        another, but it is entirely accidental that one name is applied to
        diverse things: the application of the name to one of them does not
        signify that it has an order to the other. But this is not the situation
        with names said of God and creatures, since we note in the community of
        such names the order of cause and effect, as is clear from what we have
        said. It is not, therefore, in the manner of pure equivocation that
        something is predicated of God and other things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Furthermore, where there is pure equivocation, there is no likeness
        in things themselves; there is only the unity of a name. But, as is
        clear from what we have said, there is a certain mode of likeness of
        things to God. It remains, then, that names are not said of God in a
        purely equivocal way.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Moreover, when one name is predicated of several things in a purely
        equivocal way, we cannot from one of them be led to the knowledge of
        another; for the knowledge of things does not depend on words, but on
        the meaning of names. Now, from what we find in other things, we do
        arrive at a knowledge of divine things, as is evident from what we have
        said. Such names, then, are not said of God and other things in a purely
        equivocal way.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Again, equivocation in a name impedes the process of reasoning. If,
        then, nothing was said of God and creatures except in a purely equivocal
        way, no reasoning proceeding from creatures to God could take place.
        But, the contrary is evident from all those who have spoken about God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] It is also a fact that a name is predicated of some being uselessly
        unless through that name we understand something of the being. But, if
        names are said of God and creatures in a purely equivocal way, we
        understand nothing of God through those names; for the meanings of those
        names are known to us solely to the extent that they are said of
        creatures. In vain, therefore, would it be said or proved of God that He
        is a being, good, or the like.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Should it be replied that through such names we know only what God
        is not, namely, that God is called living because He does not belong to
        the genus of lifeless things, and so with the other names, it will at
        least have to be the case that living said of God and creatures agrees
        in the denial of the lifeless. Thus, it will not be said in a purely
        equivocal way.

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From what we have said, therefore, it remains that the names said of
        God and creatures are predicated neither univocally nor equivocally but
        analogically, that is, according to an order or reference to something
        one.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] This can take place in two ways. In one way, according as many
        things have reference to something one. Thus, with reference to one
        health we say that an animal is healthy as the subject of health,
        medicine is healthy as its cause, food as its preserver, urine as its
        sign.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] In another way, the analogy can obtain according as the order or
        reference of two things is not to something else but to one of them.
        Thus, being is said of substance and accident according as an accident
        has reference to a substance, and not according as substance and
        accident are referred to a third thing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Now, the names said of God and things are not said analogically
        according to the first mode of analogy, since we should then have to
        posit something prior to God, but according to the second mode.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] In this second mode of analogical predication the order according to
        the name and according to reality is sometimes found to be the same and
        sometimes not. For the order of the name follows the order of knowledge,
        because it is the sign of an intelligible conception. When, therefore,
        that which is prior in reality is found likewise to be prior in
        knowledge, the same thing is found to be prior both according to the
        meaning of the name and according to the nature of the thing. Thus,
        substance is prior to accident both in nature, in so far as substance is
        the cause of accident, and in knowledge, in so far as substance is
        included in the definition of accident. Hence, being is said of
        substance by priority over accident both according to the nature of the
        thing and according to the meaning of the name. But when that which is
        prior in nature is subsequent in our knowledge, then there is not the
        same order in analogicals according to reality and according to the
        meaning of the name. Thus, the power to heal, which is found in all
        health-giving things, is by nature prior to the health that is in the
        animal, as a cause is prior to an effect; but because we know this
        healing power through an effect, we likewise name it from its effect.
        Hence it is that the health-giving is prior in reality, but animal is by
        priority called healthy according to the meaning of the name.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Thus, therefore, because we come to a knowledge of God from other
        things, the reality in the names said of God and other things belongs by
        priority in God according to His mode of being, but the meaning of the
        name belongs to God by posteriority. And so He is said to be named from
        His effects.

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] It is likewise shown from what has been said that, although names
        said of God signify the same reality, they are yet not synonyms because
        they do not signify the same notion.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] For just as diverse things are likened through their diverse forms
        to the one simple reality that God is, so our intellect through its
        diverse conceptions is to some extent likened to God in so far as it is
        led through the diverse perfections of creatures to know Him. Therefore,
        in forming many conceptions of one thing, our intellect is neither false
        nor futile, because the simple being of God, as we have shown, is such
        that things can be likened to it according to the multiplicity of their
        forms. But in accord with its diverse conceptions our intellect devises
        diverse names that it attributes to God. Hence, since these names are
        not attributed to God according to the same notion, it is evident that
        they are not synonyms, even though they signify a reality that is
        absolutely one. For the signification of the name is not the same, since
        a name signifies the conception of the intellect before it signifies the
        thing itself understood by the intellect.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From this it is further evident that, although God is absolutely
        simple, it is not futile for our intellect to form enunciations
        concerning God in His simplicity by means of composition and division.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] For although, as we have said, our intellect arrives at the
        knowledge of God through diverse conceptions, it yet understands that
        what corresponds to all of them is absolutely one. For the intellect
        does not attribute its mode of understanding to the things that it
        understands; for example, it does not attribute immateriality to a stone
        even though it knows the stone immaterially. It therefore sets forth the
        unity of a thing by a composition of words, which is a mark of identity,
        when it says, God is good or goodness. The result is that if there is
        some diversity in the composition, it is referred to the intellect,
        whereas the unity is referred to the thing understood by the intellect.
        On the same basis, our intellect sometimes forms an enunciation about
        God with a certain mark of diversity in it, through the use of a
        preposition, as when we say, there is goodness in God. Here, too, there
        is indicated a certain diversity, which belongs to the intellect, and a
        certain unity, which must be referred to the reality.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">THAT GOD IS GOOD</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From the divine perfection, which we have shown, we can conclude to
        the goodness of God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] For that by which each thing is called good is the virtue that
        belongs to it; for “the virtue of each thing is what makes its possessor
        and his work good.” Now, virtue “is a certain perfection, for each thing
        is then called perfect when it reaches the virtue belonging to it,” as
        may be seen in <i>Physics</i> VII [3]. Hence, each thing is good from
        the fact that it is perfect. That is why each thing seeks its perfection
        as the good belonging to it. But we have shown that God is perfect.
        Therefore, He is good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Again, it was shown above that there is a certain first unmoved
        mover, namely, God’s This mover moves as a completely unmoved mover,
        which is as something desired. Therefore, since God is the first unmoved
        mover, He is the first desired. But something is desired in two ways,
        namely, either because it is good or because it appears to be good. The
        first desired is what is good, since the apparent good does not move
        through itself but according as it has a certain appearance of the good,
        whereas the good moves through itself. The first desired, therefore,
        God, is truly good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Furthermore, “the good is that which all things desire.” The
        Philosopher introduces this remark as a “felicitous saying” in
        <i>Ethics</i> I [1]. But all things, each according to its mode, desire
        to be in act; this is clear from the fact that each thing according to
        its nature resists corruption. To be in act, therefore, constitutes the
        nature of the good. Hence it is that evil, which is opposed to the good,
        follows when potency is deprived of act, as is clear from the
        Philosopher in <i>Metaphysics</i> IX [9]. But, as we have shown, God is
        being in act without potency. Therefore, He is truly good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Moreover,.the communication of being and goodness arises from
        goodness. This is evident from the very nature and definition of the
        good. By nature, the good of each thing is its act and perfection. Now,
        each thing acts in so far as it is in act, and in acting it diffuses
        being and goodness to other things. Hence, it is a sign of a being’s
        perfection that it “can produce its like,” as may be seen from the
        Philosopher in <i>Meteorologica</i> IV [3]. Now, the nature of the good
        comes from its being something appetible. This is the end, which also
        moves the agent to act. That is why it is said that the good is
        diffusive of itself and of being. But this diffusion befits God because,
        as we have shown above, being through Himself the necessary being, God
        is the cause of being for other things. God is, therefore, truly good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] That is why it is written in a Psalm (72:1): “How good is God to
        Israel, to those who are of a right heart!” And again: “The Lord is good
        to those who hope in Him, to the soul that seeks Him” (Lam. 3:25).

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From this we can conclude that God is His goodness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] To be in act is for each being its good. But God is not only a being
        in act; He is His very act of being, as we have shown. God is,
        therefore, goodness itself, and not only good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Again, as we have shown, the perfection of each thing is its
        goodness. But the perfection of the divine being is not affirmed on the
        basis of something added to it, but because the divine being, as was
        shown above, is perfect in itself. The goodness of God, therefore, is
        not something added to His substance; His substance is His goodness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Moreover, each good thing that is not its goodness is called good by
        participation. But that which is named by participation has something
        prior to it from which it receives the character of goodness. This
        cannot proceed to infinity, since among final causes there is no regress
        to infinity, since the infinite is opposed to the end [ <i>finis</i> ].
        But the good has the nature of an end. We must, therefore, reach some
        first good, that is not by participation good through an order toward
        some other good, but is good through its own essence. This is God. God
        is, therefore, His own goodness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Again, that which is can participate in something, but the act of
        being can participate in nothing. For that which participates is in
        potency, and being is an act. But God is being itself, as we have
        proved. He is not, therefore, by participation good; He is good
        essentially.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Furthermore, in a simple being, being and that which is are the
        same. For, if one is not the other, the simplicity is then removed. But,
        as we have shown, God is absolutely simple. Therefore, for God to be
        good is identical with God. He is, therefore, His goodness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] It is thereby likewise evident that no other good is its goodness.
        Hence it is said in Matthew (19:17): “One is good, God.”

        <span style="font-weight: bold">THAT THERE CANNOT BE EVIL IN GOD</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From this it is quite evident that there cannot be evil in God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] For being and goodness, and all names that are predicated
        essentially, have nothing extraneous mixed with them, although that
        which is or good can have something besides being and goodness. For
        nothing prevents the subject of one perfection from being the subject of
        another, just as that which is a body can be white and sweet. Now, each
        nature is enclosed within the limits of its notion, so that it cannot
        include anything extraneous within itself. But, as we have proved, God
        is goodness, and not simply good. There cannot, therefore, be any
        non-goodness in Him. Thus, there cannot possibly be evil in God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Moreover, what is opposed to the essence of a given thing cannot
        befit that thing so long as its essence remains. Thus, irrationality or
        insensibility cannot befit man unless he ceases to be a man. But the
        divine essence is goodness itself, as we have shown. Therefore, evil,
        which is the opposite of good, could have no place in God—unless He
        ceased to be God, which is impossible, since He is eternal, as we have
        shown.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Furthermore, since God is His own being, nothing can be said of Him
        by participation, as is evident from the above argument. If, then, evil
        is said of God, it will not be said by participation, but essentially.
        But evil cannot be so said of anything as to be its essence, for it
        would lose its being, which is a good, as we have shown. In evil,
        however, there can be nothing extraneous mixed with it, as neither in
        goodness. Evil, therefore, cannot be said of God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Again, evil is the opposite of good. But the nature of the good
        consists in perfection, which means that the nature of evil consists in
        imperfection. Now, in God, Who is universally perfect, as we have shown
        above, there cannot be defect or imperfection. Therefore, evil cannot be
        in God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Then, too, a thing is perfect according as it is in act. A thing
        will therefore be imperfect according as it falls short of act. Hence,
        evil is either a privation or includes privation. But the subject of
        privation is potency, which cannot be in God. Neither, therefore, can
        evil.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] If, moreover, the good is “that which is sought by all,” it follows
        that every nature flees evil as such. Now, what is in a thing contrary
        to the motion of its natural appetite is violent and unnatural. Evil in
        each thing, consequently, is violent and unnatural, so far as it is an
        evil for that thing; although, among composite things, evil may he
        natural to a thing according to something within it. But God is not
        composite, nor, as we have shown, can there be anything violent or
        unnatural in Him. Evil, therefore, cannot be in God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] Scripture likewise confirms this. For it is said in the canonic
        Epistle of John (I, 1:5): “God is light and in Him there is no
        darkness”; and in Job (34:10) it is written: “Far from God be
        wickedness; and iniquity from the Almighty.”

        [1] From the foregoing it is also shown that God is “the good of every
        good.”’
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] For the goodness of each thing is its perfection, as we have said.
        But, since God is absolutely perfect, in His perfection He comprehends
        the perfections of all things, as has been shown. His goodness,
        therefore, comprehends every goodness. Thus, He is the good of every
        good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Moreover, that which is said to be of a certain sort by
        participation is said to be such only so far as it has a certain
        likeness to that which is said to be such by essence. Thus iron is said
        to be on fire in so far as it participates in a certain likeness of
        fire. But God is good through His essence, whereas all other things are
        good by participation, as has been shown. Nothing, then, will be called
        good except in so far as it has a certain likeness of the divine
        goodness. Hence, God is the good of every good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Since, furthermore, each thing is appetible because of the end, and
        since the nature of the good consists in its being appetible, each thing
        must be called good either because it is the end or because it is
        ordered to the end. It is the last end, then, from which all things
        receive the nature of good. As will be proved later on, this is God. God
        is, therefore, the good of every good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Hence it is that God, promising to Moses a vision of Himself, says:
        “I will show you all good” (Exod. 33:19). And in Wisdom (7:11), it is
        said of the divine wisdom: “All good things come to me together with
        her.”

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From this conclusion we prove that God is the highest good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] For the universal good stands higher tlpn any particular good, just
        as “the good of the people is better than the good of an individual,”
        since the goodness and perfection of the whole stand higher than the
        goodness and perfection of the part. But the divine goodness is compared
        to all others as the universal good to a particular good, being, as we
        have shown, the good of every good. God is, therefore, the highest good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Furthermore, what is said essentially is said more truly than what
        is said by participation. But God is good essentially, while other
        things are good by participation, as we have shown. God is, therefore,
        the highest good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Again, “what is greatest in any genus is the cause of the rest in
        that genus,” for a cause ranks higher than an effect. But, as we have
        shown, it is from God that all things have the nature of good. God is,
        therefore, the highest good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Moreover, just as what is not mixed with black is more white, so
        what is not mixed with evil is more good. But Cod is most unmixed with
        evil, because evil can be in God neither in act nor in potency; and this
        belongs to God according to His nature, as we have shown. God is,
        therefore, the highest good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From what has been shown it is evident that God is one.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] For it is not possible that there be two highest goods, since that
        which is said by superabundance is found in only one being. But God, as
        we have shown, is the highest good. God is, therefore, one.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Again, it has been shown that God is absolutely perfect, lacking no
        perfection. If, then, there are many gods, there must be many such
        perfect beings. But this is impossible. For, if none of these perfect
        beings lacks some perfection, and does not have any admixture of
        imperfection, which is demanded for an absolutely perfect being, nothing
        will be given in which to distinguish the perfect beings from one
        another. It is impossible, therefore, that there be many gods.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Again, that which is accomplished adequately through one supposition
        is better done through one than through many. But the order of things is
        the best it can be, since the power of the first cause does not fail the
        potency in things for perfection. Now, all things are sufficiently
        fulfilled by a reduction to one first principle. There is, therefore, no
        need to posit many principles.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Moreover, it is impossible that there be one continuous and regular
        motion from many movers. For, if they move together, none of them is a
        perfect mover, but all together rather take the place of one perfect
        mover. This is not befitting in the first mover, for the perfect is
        prior to the imperfect. If, however, they do not move together, each of
        them at times moves and at times does not. It follows from this that
        motion is neither continuous nor regular. For a motion that is
        continuous and one is from one mover. Furthermore, a mover that is not
        always moving is found to move irregularly, as is evident among lesser
        movers among whom a violent motion is stronger in the beginning and
        weaker at the end, whereas a natural motion proceeds conversely. But, as
        the philosophers have proved, the first motion is one and continuous.
        Therefore, its first mover must be one.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Furthermore, a corporeal substance is ordered to a spiritual
        substance as to its good. For there is in the spiritual substance a
        fuller goodness to which the corporeal substance seeks to liken itself,
        since whatever exists desires the best so far as this is possible. But
        all the motions of the corporeal creature are seen to be reduced to one
        first motion, beyond which there is no other first motion that is not in
        some way reduced to it. Therefore, outside the spiritual substance that
        is the end of the first motion, there is none that is not reduced to it.
        But this is what we understand by the name of God. Hence, there is only
        one God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Among all the things that are ordered to one another, furthermore,
        their order to one another is for the sake of their order to something
        one; just as the order of the parts of an army among themselves is for
        the sake of the order of the whole army to its general. For that some
        diverse things should be united by some relationship cannot come about
        from their own natures as diverse things, since on this basis they would
        rather be distinguished from one another. Nor can this unity come from
        diverse ordering causes, because they could not possibly intend one
        order in so far as among themselves they are diverse. Thus, either the
        order of many to one another is accidental, or we must reduce it to some
        one first ordering cause that orders all other things to the end it
        intends. Now, we find that all the parts of this world are ordered to
        one another according as some things help some other things. Thus, lower
        bodies are moved by higher bodies, and these by incorporeal substances,
        as appears from what was said above. Nor is this something accidental,
        since it takes place always or for the most part. Therefore, this whole
        world has only one ordering cause and governor. But there is no other
        world beyond this one. Hence, there is only one governor for all things,
        whom we call God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] Then, too, if there are two beings of which both are necessary
        beings, they must agree in the notion of the necessity of being. Hence,
        they must be distinguished by something added either to one of them
        only, or to both. This means that one or both of them must be composite.
        Now, as we have shown, no composite being is through itself a necessary
        being. It is impossible therefore that there be many beings of which
        each is a necessary being. Hence, neither can there be many gods.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] Furthermore, given two gods that are posited as agreeing in the
        necessity of being, either that in which they differ is in some way
        required for the completion of their necessity of being, or it is not.
        If it is not, then it is something accidental, because that which
        accrues to a thing without contributing to its being is an accident.
        Hence, this accident has a cause, which is, consequently, either the
        essence of the necessary being or something else. If its essence, then,
        since the necessity itself of being is its essence, as is evident from
        what was said above, the necessity of being will be the cause of that
        accident. But the necessity of being is found in both gods. Therefore,
        both will have that accident, and thus will not be distinguished with
        reference to it. If, however, the cause of the accident is something
        else, it follows that, unless that something else existed, this accident
        would not exist; and unless this accident existed, the aforesaid
        distinction would not exist. Therefore, unless that something else
        existed, these two supposed necessary beings would not be two but one.
        Therefore, the proper being of each depends on the other, and thus
        neither of them is through itself a necessary being.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] If, however, that in which they are distinguished is required to
        complete the necessity of their being, either this will be because it is
        included in the nature of this necessity of being, as animate is
        included in the definition of animal, or this will be because their
        necessity of being is specified by it, as animal is completed by
        rational. If the first is the case, wherever the necessity of being is
        found there must be present that which is included in its nature, just
        as animate belongs to whatever being to which animal belongs. And thus,
        since the necessity of being is attributed to both the aforementioned
        beings, they will not thereby be distinguished. If the second is the
        case, this too is impossible. A difference specifying a genus does not
        complete the nature of the genus, but rather through it the genus comes
        to be in act. For the nature of animal is complete before the addition
        of rational. Rather, the fact is that there cannot be an animal in act
        that is not rational or irrational. Thus, therefore, something completes
        the necessity of being as to being in act, and not as to the notion of
        the necessity of being. This is impossible on two counts. First, because
        the quiddity of a necessary being is its being, as was proved above.
        Second, because, were it true, the necessary being would acquire being
        through something else, which is impossible.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] It is, therefore, not possible to posit many beings of which each
        is through itself a necessary being.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [12] What is more, if there are two gods, either the name God is
        predicated of both univocally, or equivocally. If equivocally, this is
        outside our present purpose. Nothing prevents any given thing from being
        equivocally named by any given name, provided we admit the usage of
        those who express the name. But if it be used univocally, it must be
        predicated of both according to one notion, which means that, in notion,
        there must be in both one nature. Either, therefore, this nature is in
        both according to one being, or according to a being that is other in
        each case. If according to one, there will not be two gods, but only
        one, since there cannot be one being for two things that are
        substantially distinguished. If each has its own being, therefore in
        neither being will the quiddity be its being. Yet this must be posited
        in God, as we have proved. Therefore, neither of these two beings is
        what we understand by the name God. It is, therefore, impossible to
        posit two gods.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [13] Again, nothing that belongs to this designated thing as such can
        belong to another, for the singularity of some thing belongs to none
        other than to that singular thing. But its necessity of being belongs to
        the necessary being so far as it is this designated being. Therefore, it
        cannot belong to another, and therefore there cannot be several beings
        of which each is a necessary being. It is, consequently, impossible that
        there be several gods.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [14] The proof of the minor. If the necessary being is not this
        designated being as a necessary being, the designation of its being is
        not necessary through itself but depends on another. But so far as each
        thing is in act it is distinct from all other things; this is to be this
        designated thing. Therefore, the necessary being depends on another to
        be in act; which is against the nature of the necessary being.
        Therefore, the necessary being must be necessary according as it is this
        designated being.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [15] Furthermore, either the nature signified by the name God is
        individuated through itself in this God, or it is individuated through
        something else. If through something else, composition must result. If
        through itself, then it cannot possibly belong to another, since the
        principle of individuation cannot be common to several, It is
        impossible, therefore, that there be several gods.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [16] If, again, there are several gods, the nature of the godhead cannot
        be numerically one in two of them. There must, therefore, be something
        distinguishing the divine nature in this and in that god. But this is
        impossible, because, as we have shown above, the divine nature receives
        the addition neither of essential differences nor of accidents. Nor yet
        is the divine nature the form of any matter, to be capable of being
        divided according to the division of matter. It is impossible,
        therefore, that there be two gods.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [17] Then, too, the proper being of each thing is only one. But God is
        His being, as we have shown. There can, therefore, be only one God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [18] Moreover, a thing has being in the manner it possesses unity.
        Hence, each thing struggles as much as it can against any division of
        itself, lest thereby it tend to nonbeing. But the divine nature has
        being most powerfully. There is therefore, in it the greatest unity, and
        hence no plurality is in any way distinguished within it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [19] Furthermore, we notice in each genus that multitude proceeds from
        some unity. This is why in every genus there is found a prime member
        that is the measure of all the things found in that genus. In whatever
        things, therefore, we find that there is an agreement in one respect, it
        is necessary that this depend upon one source. But all things agree in
        being. There must, therefore, be only one being that is the source of
        all things. This is God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [20] Again, in every rulership he who rules desires unity. That is why
        among the forms of rulership the main one is monarchy or kingship. So,
        too, for many members there is one head, whereby we see by an evident
        sign that he to whom rulership belongs should have unity. Hence, we must
        admit that God, Who is the cause of all things, is absolutely one.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [21] This confession of the divine unity we can likewise gather from
        holy Scripture. For it is said in Deuteronomy (6:4): “Hear, O Israel:
        the Lord our God is one God”; and in Exodus (20:3): “You shall not have
        strange gods before Me”; and in Ephesians (4:5): “One Lord, one faith,
        one baptism.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [22] Now by this truth are refuted those Gentiles who accepted a
        multitude of gods. However, many of them said that there was one highest
        God, by whom all the others whom they named gods were according to them
        caused. For they attributed the name of divinity to all everlasting
        substances, and this especially because of their wisdom and felicity and
        the rulership of things. This manner of speaking is found also in Sacred
        Scripture, in which the holy angels, or even men, or judges, are called
        gods. Thus, this verse of the Psalms (85:8): “There is none among the
        gods like You, O Lord”; and elsewhere: “I have said: You are gods” (Ps.
        81:6). Many such expressions are found in different places in Scripture.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [23] Hence, it is mainly the Manicheans who seem opposed to this truth,
        in that they posit two first principles of which one is not the cause of
        the other.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [24] The Arians likewise attacked this truth by their errors, in
        confessing that the Father and the Son are not one but several gods;
        although the authority of Scripture forces e to believe that the Son is
        true God.

        [1] Since, as the philosophers teach, “the infinite accompanies
        quantity,” infinity cannot be attributed to God on the ground of
        multitude. For we have shown that there is only one God and that no
        composition of parts or accidents is found in Him. Nor, again, according
        to continuous quantity can God be called infinite, since we have shown
        that He is incorporeal. It remains, then, to investigate whether
        according to spiritual magnitude it befits God to be infinite.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] We speak of spiritual magnitude with reference to two points:
        namely, power and the goodness or completeness of one’s own nature. For
        something is said to be more or less white according to the mode in
        which its whiteness is completed. The magnitude of its power likewise is
        measured from the magnitude of its action or its works. Of these
        magnitudes one follows the other. For, from the fact that something is
        in act it is active, and hence the mode of the magnitude of its power is
        according to the mode in which it is completed in its act. Thus, it
        remains that spiritual beings are called great according to the mode of
        their completion. Augustine himself says that “in beings that are great
        but not in bulk, to be greater is the same as to be better.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] We must therefore show that God is infinite according to the mode of
        this sort of magnitude. The infinite here will not be taken in the sense
        of privation, as in the case of dimensive or numerical quantity. For
        this quantity is of a nature to have a limit, so that such things are
        called infinites according as there is removed from them the limits they
        have by nature; which means that in their case the infinite designates
        an imperfection. But in God the infinite is understood only in a
        negative way, because there is no terminus or limit to His perfection:
        He is supremely perfect. It is thus that the infinite ought to be
        attributed to God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] For everything that according to its nature is finite is determined
        to the nature of some genus. God, however, is not in any genus; His
        perfection, as was shown above, rather contains the perfections of all
        the genera. God is, therefore, infinite.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5) Again, every act inhering in another is terminated by that in which
        it inheres, since what is in another is in it according to the mode of
        the receiver. Hence, an act that exists in nothing is terminated by
        nothing. Thus, if whiteness were self-existing, the perfection of
        whiteness in it would not be terminated so as not to have whatever can
        be had of the perfection of whiteness. But God is act in no way existing
        in another, for neither is He a form in matter, as we have proved, nor
        does His being inhere in some form or nature, since He is His own being,
        as was proved above. It remains, then, that God is infinite.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Furthermore, in reality we find something that is potency alone,
        namely, prime matter, something that is act alone, namely, God, as was
        shown above, and something that is act and potency, namely, the rest of
        things. But, since potency is said relatively to act, it cannot exceed
        act either in a particular case or absolutely. Hence, since prime matter
        is infinite in its potentiality, it remains that God, Who is pure act,
        is infinite in His actuality.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Moreover, an act is all the more perfect by as much as it has less
        of potency mixed with it. Hence, every act with which potency is mixed
        is terminated in its perfection. But, as was shown above, God is pure
        act without any potency. He is, therefore, infinite.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] Again, considered absolutely, being is infinite, since there are
        infinite and infinite modes in which it can be participated. If, then,
        the being of some thing is finite, that being must be limited by
        something other that is somehow its cause. But there can be no cause of
        the divine being, for God is a necessary being through Himself.
        Therefore, His being is infinite, and so is He.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] Then, too, what has a certain perfection is the more perfect as it
        participates in that perfection more fully. But there cannot be a mode
        of perfection, nor is one thinkable, by which a given perfection is
        possessed more fully than it is possessed by the being that is perfect
        through its essence and whose being is its goodness. In no way,
        therefore, is it possible to think of anything better or more perfect
        than God. Hence, God is infinite in goodness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] Our intellect, furthermore, extends to the infinite in
        understanding; and a sign of this is that, given any finite quantity,
        our intellect can think of a greater one. But this ordination of the
        intellect would be in vain unless an infinite intelligible reality
        existed. There must, therefore, be some infinite intelligible reality,
        which must be the greatest of beings. This we call God. God is,
        therefore, infinite.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] Again, an effect cannot transcend its cause. But our intellect can
        be only from God, Who is the first cause of all things. Our intellect,
        therefore, cannot think of anything greater than God. If, then, it can
        think of something greater than every finite thing, it remains that God
        is not finite.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [12] There is also the argument that an infinite power cannot reside in
        a finite essence. For each thing acts through its form, which is either
        its essence or a part of the essence, whereas power is the name of a
        principle of action. But God does not have a finite active power. For He
        moves in an infinite time, which can be done only by an infinite power,
        as we have proved above. It remains, then, that God’s essence is
        infinite.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [13] This argument, however, is according to those who posit the
        eternity of the world. If we do not posit it, there is all the greater
        confirmation for the view that the power of God is infinite. For each
        agent is the more powerful in acting according as it reduces to act a
        potency more removed from act; just as a greater power is needed to heat
        water than air. But that which in no way exists is infinitely distant
        from act, nor is it in any way in potency. If, then, the world was made
        after previously not being at all, the power of its maker must be
        infinite.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [14] This argument holds in proving the infinity of the divine power
        even according to those who posit the eternity of the world. For they
        acknowledge that God is the cause of the substance of the world, though
        they consider this substance to be everlasting. They say that God is the
        cause of an everlasting world in the same way as a foot would have been
        the cause of an imprint if it had been pressed on sand from all
        eternity. If we adopt this position, according to our previous
        argumentation it still follows that the power of God is infinite. For,
        whether God produced things in time, as we hold, or from all eternity,
        according to them, nothing can be in reality that God did not produce;
        for God is the universal source of being. Thus, God produced the world
        without the supposition of any pre-existent matter or potency. Now, we
        must gather the proportion of an active power according to the
        proportion of a passive potency, for the greater the potency that
        preexists or is presupposed, by so much the greater active power will it
        be brought to actual fulfillment. It remains, therefore, that, since a
        finite power produces a given effect by presupposing the potency of
        matter, the power of God, which presupposes no potency, is infinite, not
        finite. Thus, so is His essence infinite.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [15] Each thing, moreover, is more enduring according as its cause is
        more efficacious. Hence, that being whose duration is infinite must have
        been from a cause of infinite efficaciousness. But the duration of God
        is infinite, for we have shown above that He is eternal. Since, then, He
        has no other cause of His being than Himself, He must be infinite.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [16] The authority of Sacred Scripture is witness to this truth. For the
        psalmist says: “Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised: and of His
        greatness there is no end” (Ps. 144:3).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [17] The sayings of the most ancient philosophers are likewise a witness
        to this truth. They all posited an infinite first principle of things,
        as though compelled by truth itself.” Yet they did not recognize their
        own voice. They judged the infinity of the first principle in terms of
        discrete quantity, following Democritus, who posited infinite atoms as
        the principles of things, and also Anaxagoras, who posited infinite
        similar parts as the principles of things. Or they judged infinity in
        terms of continuous quantity, following those who posited that the first
        principle of all things was some element or a confused infinite body.
        But, since it was shown by the effort of later philosophers that there
        is no infinite body, given that there must be a first principle that is
        in some way infinite, we conclude that the infinite which is the first
        principle is neither a body nor a power in a body.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">THAT GOD IS INTELLIGENT</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From what has been said we can show that God is intelligent.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] We have shown above that among movers and things moved we cannot
        proceed to infinity, but must reduce all movable things, as is
        demonstrable, to one first self-moving being. The self-moving being
        moves itself only by appetite and knowledge, for only such beings are
        found to move themselves, because to be moved and not moved lies in
        their power. The moving part in the first self-moving being must he
        appetitive and apprehending. Now, in a motion that takes place through
        appetite and apprehension, he who has the appetite and the apprehension
        is a moved mover, while the appetible and apprehended is the unmoved
        mover. Since, therefore, the first mover of all things, whom we call
        God, is an absolutely unmoved mover, He must be related to the mover
        that is a part of the self-moving being as the appetible is to the one
        who has the appetite. Not, however, as something appetible by sensible
        appetite, since sensible appetite is not of that which is good
        absolutely but of this particular good, since the apprehension of the
        sense is likewise particular; whereas that which is good and appetible
        absolutely is prior to that which is good and appetible here and now.
        The first mover, then, must be appetible as an object of intellect, and
        thus the mover that desires it must be intelligent. All the more,
        therefore, will the first appetible be intelligent, since the one
        desiring it is intelligent in act by being joined to it as an
        intelligible. Therefore, making the supposition that the first mover
        moves himself, as the philosophers intended, we must say that God is
        intelligent.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Moreover, the same conclusion must follow if the reduction of
        movable beings is, not to a first self-moving being, but to an
        absolutely unmoved mover. For the first mover is the universal source of
        motion. Therefore, since every mover moves through a form at which it
        aims in moving, the form through which the first mover moves must be a
        universal form and a universal good. But a form does not have a
        universal mode except in the intellect. Consequently, the first mover,
        God, must be intelligent.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] In no order of movers, furthermore, is it the case that an
        intellectual mover is the instrument of a mover without an intellect.
        Rather, the converse is true. But all movers in the world are to the
        first mover, God, as instruments are related to a principal agent.
        Since, then, there are in the world many movers endowed with
        intelligence, it is impossible that the first mover move without an
        intellect. Therefore, God must be intelligent.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Again, a thing is intelligent because it is without matter. A sign
        of this is the fact that forms are made understood in act by abstraction
        from matter. And hence the intellect deals with universals and not
        singulars, for matter is the principle of individuation. But forms that
        are understood in act become one with the intellect that understands
        them in act. Therefore, if forms are understood in act because they are
        without matter, a thing must be intelligent because it is without
        matter. But we have shown that God is absolutely immaterial. God is,
        therefore, intelligent.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Then, too, as was shown above, no perfection found in any genus of
        things is lacking to God. Nor on this account does any composition
        follow in Him. But among the perfections; of things the greatest is that
        something be intelligent, for thereby it is in a manner all things,
        having within itself the perfections of all things. God is, therefore,
        intelligent.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Again, that which tends determinately to some end either has set
        itself that end or the end has been set for it by another. Otherwise, it
        would tend no more to this end than to that. Now, natural things tend to
        determinate ends. They do not fulfill their natural needs by chance,
        since they would not do so always or for the most part, but rarely,
        which is the domain of chance. Since, then, things do not set for
        themselves an end, because they have no notion of what an end is, the
        end must be set for them by another, who is the author of nature. He it
        is who gives being to all things and is through Himself the necessary
        being. We call Him God, as is clear from what we have said. But God
        could not set an end for nature unless He had understanding. God is,
        therefore, intelligent.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] Furthermore, everything imperfect derives from something perfect;
        for the perfect is naturally prior to the imperfect, as is act to
        potency. But the forms found in particular things are imperfect because
        they are there in a particular way and not according to the community of
        their natures. They must therefore be derived from some forms that are
        perfect and not particular. But such forms cannot exist unless by being
        understood, since no form is found in its universality except in the
        intellect. Consequently, these forms must be intelligent, if they be
        subsistent; for only thus do they have operation. God, then, Who is the
        first subsistent act, from whom all other things are derived, must be
        intelligent.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] This truth the Catholic faith likewise confesses. For it is said of
        God in Job (9:4): “He is wise of heart, and mighty in strength”; and
        later on (12:16): “With Him is strength and wisdom.” So, too, in the
        Psalms (138:6): “Your knowledge has become wonderful to me”; and Romans
        (21:33): “O the depth of the riches of the wisdom and of the knowledge
        of God.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] The truth of this faith was so strong among men that they named God
        from the act of understanding. For theos [θεος], which among the Greeks
        signifies God, comes from <i>theaste</i> [θεασθαι], which means to
        consider or to see.

          >THAT GOD’S ACT OF U11MERSTAMING IS HIS ESSENCE</span
        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From the fact that God is intelligent it follows that His act of
        understanding is His essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] To understand is the act of one understanding, residing in him, not
        proceeding to something outside as heating proceeds to the heated thing.
        For, by being understood, the intelligible suffers nothing; rather, the
        one understanding is perfected. Now, whatever is in God is the divine
        essence. God’s act of understanding, therefore, is His essence, it is
        the divine being, God Himself. For God is His essence and His being.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Furthermore, the act of understanding is to the intellect as being [
        <i>esse</i> ] is to essence [ <i>essentia</i> ]. But, as we have proved,
        God’s being is His essence. Therefore, God’s understanding is His
        intellect. But the divine intellect is God’s essence; otherwise, it
        would be an accident in God. Therefore, the divine understanding is His
        essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Again, second act is more perfect than first act, as consideration
        is more perfect than knowledge. But the knowledge or intellect of God is
        His essence, if, as we have proved, He is intelligent; for, as is clear
        from the above, no perfection belongs to Him by participation but rather
        by essence. If, therefore, His consideration is not His essence,
        something will be nobler and more perfect than His essence. Thus, God
        will not be at the summit of perfection and goodness and hence will not
        be first.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Moreover, to understand is the act of the one understanding. If,
        therefore, God in understanding is not His understanding, God must be
        related to it as potency to act. Thus, there will be potency and act in
        God, which is impossible, as we proved above.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Then, too, every substance exists for the sake of its operation. If,
        then, the operation of God is other than the divine substance, the end
        of God will be something other than God. Thus, God will not be His
        goodness, since the good of each thing is its end.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] If, however, God’s understanding is His being, His understanding
        must be simple, eternal and unchangeable, existing only in act, and
        including all the perfections that have been proved of the divine being.
        Hence, God is not potentially understanding, nor does He begin to
        understand something anew, nor still does He have any change or
        composition in understanding.

        [1] From what has been shown above it appears with evidence that the

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] The intelligible species is the formal principle of intellectual
        operation, just as the form of any agent is the principle of its own
        operation. Now, as we have shown, the divine intellectual operation is
        God’s essence. If, then, the divine intellect understood by an
        intelligible species other than the divine essence, something other

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Furthermore, the intellect becomes understanding in act through an
        intelligible species, just as the sense becomes sensing in act through a
        sensible species. The intelligible species is to the intellect,
        therefore, as act to potency. If, then, the divine intellect understood
        through some intelligible species other than itself, it would be in
        potency with respect to something. This is impossible, as we proved
        above.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Moreover, an intelligible species in the intellect that is other
        than the intellect’s essence has an accidental being, which is why our
        knowledge is numbered among the accidents. But in God, as we have shown,
        there can be no accident. Therefore, there is not in the divine
        intellect any species other than the divine essence itself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Again, the intelligible species is the likeness of something
        understood. If, then, there is in the divine intellect an intelligible
        species other than the divine essence, it will be the likeness of
        something understood. It will thus be the likeness either of the divine
        essence or of some other thing. It cannot be the likeness of the divine
        essence, because then the divine essence would not be intelligible
        through itself, but that species would make it intelligible. Nor can
        there be in the divine intellect a species other than the divine
        intellect that is the likeness of some other being. For that likeness
        would then be impressed on the divine intellect by some being. Not by
        itself, since then the same being would be agent and receiver, and also
        because there would be an agent that impressed, not its own likeness,
        but that of another on the receiver, and thus it would not be true that
        every agent produced its like. Nor by another, for there would then be
        an agent prior to God. It is, therefore, impossible that there be in God
        an intelligible species other than His essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Furthermore, God’s understanding, as we have shown, is His essence.
        If, therefore, God understood through a species that was not His
        essence, it would be through something other than His essence. This is
        impossible. Therefore, God does not understand through a species that is
        not His essence.

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From this it further appears that God understands Himself perfectly.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Since through the intelligible species the intellect is directed to
        the thing understood, the perfection of intellectual operation depends
        on two things. One is that the intelligible species be perfectly
        conformed to the thing understood. The second is that it be perfectly
        joined to the intellect, which is realized more fully according as the
        intellect has greater power in understanding. Now, the divine essence,
        which is the intelligible species by which the divine intellect
        understands, is absolutely identical with God and it is also absolutely
        identical with His intellect. Therefore, God understands Himself most
        perfectly.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Furthermore, a material thing is made intelligible by being
        separated from matter and the conditions of matter. Therefore, that
        which is through its nature separate from all matter and material
        conditions is intelligible in its nature. Now every intelligible is
        understood by being one in act with the one understanding. But, as we
        have proved, God is intelligent. Therefore, since He is absolutely
        immaterial, and most one with Himself, He understands Himself perfectly.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Again, a thing is Understood in act because the intellect in act and
        the understood in act are one. But the divine intellect is always an
        intellect in act, since there is no potency or imperfection in God. On
        the other hand, the divine essence is through itself perfectly
        intelligible, as is clear from what we have said. Since, therefore, the
        divine intellect and the divine essence are one, it is evident from what
        we have said that God understands Himself perfectly. For God is His
        intellect and His essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Moreover, what is in something in an intelligible way is understood
        by it. The divine essence is in God in an intelligible way, for the
        natural being of God and His intelligible being are one and the same,
        since His being is His understanding. God, therefore, understands His
        essence, and hence Himself, since He is His essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] The acts of the intellect, furthermore, like those of the other
        powers of the soul, are distinguished according to their objects. The
        operation of the intellect will be more perfect as the intelligible
        object is more perfect. But the most perfect intelligible object is the
        divine essence, since it is the most perfect and the first truth. The
        operation of the divine intellect is likewise the most noble, since, as
        we have shown, it is the divine being. Therefore, God understands
        Himself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Again, the perfections of all things are found supremely in God.
        Now, among other perfections found in created things the greatest is to
        understand God. For the intellectual nature, whose perfection is
        understanding, excels all the others; and the most noble intelligible
        object is God. God, therefore, knows Himself supremely.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] This is confirmed by divine authority. For the Apostle says: “The
        spirit searches all things, yea, the deep things of God” (1 Cor. 2:10).

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Now, it appears from what we have said that primarily. and
        essentially God knows only Himself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] That thing alone is primarily and essentially known by the intellect
        by whose species the intellect understands; for an operation is
        proportioned to the form that is the principle of the operation. But, as
        we have proved, that by which God understands is nothing other than His
        essence. Therefore, the primary and essential object of His intellect is
        nothing other than Himself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] It is, furthermore, impossible to understand a multitude primarily
        and essentially, since one operation cannot be terminated by many. But,
        as we have proved, God at some time understands Himself. If, therefore,
        He understands something other than Himself as the primary and essential
        object of His understanding, His intellect must change from a
        consideration of Himself to the consideration of this something else.
        This something else is less noble than God. The divine intellect is thus
        changed for the worse, which is impossible.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Moreover, the operations of the intellect are distinguished
        according to their objects. If, then, God understands Himself and
        something other than Himself as the principal object, He will have
        several intellectual operations. Therefore, either His essence will be
        divided into several parts, or He will have an intellectual operation
        that is not His substance. Both of these positions have been proved to
        be impossible. It remains, then, that nothing other than the divine
        essence is known by God as the primary and essential object of His
        intellect.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Again, in so far as the intellect is different from its object, it
        is in potency to it. If, then, something other than Himself is God's
        primary and essential object, it will follow that He is in potency to
        something else. This is impossible, as is clear from what we have said.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0.125in; margin-bottom: 0.125in"></p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] The thing understood, likewise, is the perfection of the one
        understanding. For the intellect is perfect according as it understands
        in act, and this obtains through the fact that the intellect is one with
        what is understood. If, then, something other than Himself is primarily
        understood by God, something else will be His perfection, and more noble
        than He. This is impossible.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Furthermore, the knowledge of the one understanding is comprised of
        many things understood. If, then, God knows many things as the principal
        and essential objects of His knowledge, it will follow that the
        knowledge of God is composed of many things. Thus, either the divine
        essence will be composite, or knowledge will be an accident in God. From
        what we have said, it is clear that both of these suppositions are
        impossible. It remains, therefore, that what is primarily and
        essentially understood by God is nothing other than His substance.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] Again, intellectual operation derives its specification and nobility
        from that which is essentially and primarily understood by it. If, then,
        God understood something other than Himself as His essential and primary
        object, His intellectual operation would have its specification and
        nobility according to something other than God. This, however, is
        impossible, since, as we have shown, God’s operation is His essence.
        Thus, it is impossible that what is understood primarily and essentially
        by God be other than He.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From the fact that God understands Himself primarily and essentially
        we must posit that He knows in Himself things other than Himself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] An effect is adequately known when its cause is known. So “we are
        said to know each thing when we know the cause.” But God Himself is
        through His essence the cause of being for other things. Since He has a
        most full knowledge of His essence, we must posit that God also knows
        other things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Moreover, the likeness of every effect somehow preexists in its
        cause; for every agent produces its like. But whatever is in something
        is in it according to the mode of that in which it is. If, then, God is
        the cause of certain things, since according to His nature He is
        intellectual, the likeness of what He causes will exist in Him in an
        intelligible way. But what is in something in an intelligible way is
        understood by it. God, therefore, understands within Himself things
        other than Himself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Again, whoever knows perfectly a given thing knows whatever can be
        truly said of it and whatever befits it according to its nature. But it
        befits God according to His nature to be the cause of other things.
        Since, then, God knows Himself perfectly, He knows Himself to be a
        cause. This cannot be unless He somehow knows what He causes. This is
        other than He, since nothing is the cause of itself. Therefore, God
        knows things other than Himself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] If we put together these two conclusions, it appears that God knows
        Himself as primarily and essentially known, whereas He knows other
        things as seen in His essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] This truth is expressly taught by Dionysius. He says: “In seeing
        them, God does not insert Himself in singulars, but He knows them as
        contained within a single cause” [ <i>De dev. nom.</i> VII, 2]. And
        later on: “the divine wisdom, knowing itself, knows other things.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] To this judgment, too, the authority of Sacred Scripture bears
        witness. For it is said of God in the Psalms (101:20): “He looked forth
        from His high sanctuary”; as though to say that God sees other things
        from His own height.

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Some have said that God has only a universal knowledge of other
        things. He knows them, that is, in so far as they are beings because He
        knows the nature of being through a knowledge of Himself. For this
        reason, it remains for us to show that God knows all other things as
        they are distinct from one another and from Himself. This is to know
        things according to their proper natures.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] In order to show this point, let us suppose that God is the cause of
        every being, as is somewhat evident from what we said above and will be
        more fully shown later on. Thus, there is consequently nothing in any
        thing that is not caused by God, mediately or immediately. Now, when the
        cause is known, the effect is known. Whatever is in each and every thing
        can be known if we know God and all the causes that are between God and
        things. But God knows Himself and all the intervening causes between
        Himself and any given thing. Now, we have already shown that God knows
        Himself perfectly. By knowing Himself, God knows whatever proceeds from
        Him immediately. When this is known, God once more knows what proceeds
        from it immediately; and so on for all intermediate causes down to the
        last effect. Therefore, God knows whatever is found in reality. But this
        is to have a proper and complete knowledge of a thing, namely, to know
        all that there is in that thing, both what is common and what is proper.
        Therefore, God has a proper knowledge of things, in so far as they are
        distinct from one another.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Furthermore, whatever acts through an intellect knows what it does
        according to the proper nature of its work; for the knowledge of the
        maker determines the form for the thing made. Now, God causes things
        through His intellect, since His being is His understanding and each
        thing acts in so far as it is in act. God, therefore, has a proper
        knowledge of what He causes, so far as it is distinct from the others.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Moreover, the distinction of things cannot be from chance, because
        it has a fixed order. The distinction in things must therefore be from
        the intention of some cause. It cannot be from the intention of a cause
        acting through a necessity of nature, for nature is determined to one
        course of action, and thus the intention of no thing acting through the
        necessity of nature can terminate in many effects in so far as these are
        distinct. It remains, then, that distinction in things comes from the
        intention of a knowing cause. But it seems to be proper to the intellect
        to consider the distinction of things; and so Anaxagoras called the
        intellect the source of distinction. Now, the universal distinction of
        things cannot be from the intention of some secondary cause, because all
        such causes belong to the world of distinct effects. It belongs to the
        first cause, that is through itself distinguished from all other things,
        to aim at the distinction of all things. God, therefore, knows things as
        distinct.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Again, whatever God knows He knows most perfectly. For, as was shown
        above, there is all perfection in God as in the absolutely perfect
        being. Now, what is known only in a general way is not perfectly known,
        since one does not yet know what is most important in that thing,
        namely, the ultimate perfections, by which its proper being is
        completed; so that by such a knowledge a thing is known potentially
        rather than actually. Since, then, by knowing His own essence God knows
        things in a universal way, He must also have a proper knowledge of
        things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Then, too, whoever knows a certain nature knows the essential
        accidents of that nature. The essential accidents of being as being are
        one and many, as is proved in <i>Metaphysics</i> IV [3]. If, then, by
        knowing His essence, God knows the nature of being in a universal way,
        it follows that He knows multitude. But multitude cannot be understood
        without distinction. Therefore, God knows things as they are distinct
        from one another.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Whoever, furthermore, perfectly knows a universal nature knows the
        mode in which that nature can be possessed. In the same way, he who
        knows whiteness knows that which receives it more and less. But the
        grades of beings are established from the diverse mode of being. If,
        then, by knowing Himself, God knows the universal nature of being, and
        this not imperfectly, since, as we have shown, every imperfection is
        remote from Him, God must know all grades of beings. Thus, God will have
        a proper knowledge of things other than Himself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] Furthermore, he who knows something perfectly knows all that is in
        it. But God knows Himself perfectly. Therefore, He knows all that is in
        Him according to His active power. But all things, in their proper
        forms, are in Him according to His active power, since God is the
        principle of every being. Therefore, God has a proper knowledge of all
        things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] Again, he who knows a certain nature knows whether that nature is
        communicable. He who did not know that the nature of animal is
        communicable to many would not know it perfectly. Now, the divine nature
        is communicable by likeness. God, therefore, knows in how many modes
        there can be something like His essence. But the diversities of forms
        arise from the fact that things imitate the divine essence diversely;
        and so the Philosopher has called a natural form “something divine.”
        Therefore, God has a knowledge of things in terms of their proper forms.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] Moreover, men and other knowing beings know things as distinct from
        one another in their multitude. If, then, God does not know things in
        their distinction, it follows that He is the most foolish being of all,
        as He must have been for those who held that God did not know strife, a
        thing known to all-an opinion that the Philosopher considers to be
        untenable in <i>De anima</i> I [5]and <i>Metaphysics</i> III [4].
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] We likewise receive this teaching from the canonic Scriptures. For
        it is said in Genesis (1:31): “And God saw all things that He had made,
        and they were very good.” And in Hebrews (4:13): “Neither is there any
        creature invisible in His sight: but all things are naked and open to
        His eyes.”

          >ARGUMENTS INQUIRING HOW A MULTITUDE OF INTELLECTUAL OBJECTS IS IN THE
          DIVINE INTELLECT</span
        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Lest the multitude of intellectual objects, however, introduce a
        composition into the divine intellect, we must investigate the mode in
        which these intellectual objects are many.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2.] Now, this multitude cannot be taken to mean that many intellectual
        objects have a distinct being in God. For either these objects would be
        the same as the divine essence, and thus a certain multitude would be
        posited in the essence of God, which we set aside above in many ways; or
        they would be added to the divine essence, and thus there would be some
        accident in God, which we have shown above to be impossible.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Nor, again, can such intelligible forms be posited as existing in
        themselves. This is what Plato, avoiding the above difficulties, seems
        to have posited by introducing the Ideas. For the forms of natural
        things cannot exist without matter, since neither are they understood
        without matter.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] And, even if this position were held, it would not enable us to
        posit that God has understanding of a multitude. For, since the
        aforementioned forms are outside God’s essence, if God could not
        understand the multitude of things without them, as the perfection of
        His intellect requires, it would follow that His perfection in
        understanding depended on something else, and consequently so would His
        perfection in being, since His being is His understanding. The contrary
        of this was shown above.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Furthermore, since whatever is outside His essence must be caused by
        Him, as will be shown later on it is necessary that, if the
        aforementioned forms are to be found outside God, they must be caused by
        Him. But God is the cause of things through His intellect, as will be
        shown later on. Therefore, so that these intelligibles may have
        existence, it is required according to the order of nature that God
        first understand them. Hence, God does not have knowledge of multitude
        by the fact that many intelligibles are found outside Him.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Furthermore, the intelligible in act is the intellect in act, just
        as the sensible in act is the sense in act. According as the
        intelligible is distinguished from the intellect, both are in potency,
        as likewise appears in the case of the sense. For neither the sight is
        seeing in act, nor is the visible object seen in act, except when the
        sight is informed by the species of the visible object, so that thereby
        from the sight and the object something one results. If, then, the
        intelligible objects of God are outside His intellect, it will follow
        that His intellect is in potency, as are also its intelligible objects.
        Thus, some cause reducing them to act would be needed, which is
        impossible, since there is nothing prior to God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Then, too, the understood must be in him who understands. Therefore,
        to posit the forms of things as existing in themselves outside the
        divine intellect does not suffice for God to understand a multitude of
        things; these intelligibles must be in the divine intellect itself.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] [Chapter 52] From the same arguments it likewise appears that the
        multitude of the aforementioned intelligibles cannot reside in any
        intellect other than the divine intellect—for example, that of a soul or
        an angel or intelligence. If this were true, the divine intellect would
        depend on a lower intellect for some operation. But this is impossible.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] Then, too, just as self-subsisting things are from God, so is
        whatever inheres in them. Hence, the divine understanding, by which God
        is a cause, is a prerequisite for the being of the aforementioned
        intelligibles in some lower intellect.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] It likewise follows that the divine intellect is in potency, since
        its intelligible objects are not joined to it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] Furthermore, just as each thing has its own being, so it has its
        own operation. It cannot happen, then, that because some intellect is
        disposed for operation another intellect will perform an intellectual
        operation; rather, the very same intellect in which the disposition is
        present will do this, just as each thing is through its own essence, not
        through the essence of another. Therefore, by the fact that there are
        many intelligible objects in some secondary intellect it could not come
        about that the first intellect knows a multitude.

          >THE SOLUTION OF THE ABOVE DIFFICULTY</span
        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] We can solve the above difficulty with ease if we examine diligently
        how the things that are understood by the intellect exist within the
        intellect.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] So far as it is possible, let us proceed from our intellect to the
        knowledge that the divine intellect has. Let us consider the fact that
        an external thing understood by us does not exist in our intellect
        according to its own nature; rather, it is necessary that its species be
        in our intellect, and through this species the intellect comes to be in
        act. Once in act through this species as through its own form, the
        intellect knows the thing itself. This is not to be understood in the
        sense that the act itself of understanding is an action proceeding to
        the thing understood, as heating proceeds to the heated thing.
        Understanding remains in the one understanding, but it is related to the
        thing understood because the abovementioned species, which is a
        principle of intellectual operation as a form, is the likeness of the
        thing understood.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] We must further consider that the intellect, having been informed by
        the species of the thing, by an act of understanding forms within itself
        a certain intention of the thing understood, that is to say, its notion,
        which the definition signifies. This is a necessary point, because the
        intellect understands a present and an absent thing indifferently. In
        this the imagination agrees with the intellect. But the intellect has
        this characteristic in addition, namely, that it understands a thing as
        separated from material conditions, without which a thing does not exist
        in reality. But this could not take place unless the intellect formed
        the abovementioned intention for itself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Now, since this understood intention is, as it were, a terminus of
        intelligible operation, it is distinct from the intelligible species
        that actualizes the intellect, and that we must consider the principle
        of intellectual operation, though both are a likeness of the thing
        understood. For, by the fact that the intelligible species, which is the
        form of the intellect and the principle of understanding, is the
        likeness of the external thing, it follows that the intellect forms an
        intention like that thing, since such as a thing is, such are its works.
        And because the understood intention is like some thing, it follows that
        the intellect, by forming such an intention) knows that thing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Now, the divine intellect understands by no species other than the
        divine essence, as was shown above. Nevertheless, the divine essence is
        the likeness of all things. Thereby it follows that the conception of
        the divine intellect as understanding itself, which is its Word, is the
        likeness not only of God Himself understood, but also of all those
        things of which the divine essence is the likeness. In this way,
        therefore, through one intelligible species, which is the divine
        essence, and through one understood intention, which is the divine Word,
        God can understand many things.

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] But, again, it can seem to someone difficult or impossible that one
        and the same simple being, the divine essence for example, is the proper
        model or likeness of diverse things. For, since among diverse things
        there is a distinction by reason of their proper forms, whatever is like
        something according to its proper form must turn out to be unlike
        something else. To be sure, according as diverse things have something
        in common, nothing prevents them from having one likeness, as do man and
        a donkey so far as they are animals. But from this it will follow that
        God does not have a proper knowledge of things, but a common one; for
        the operation that knowledge is follows the mode in which the likeness
        of the known is in the knower. So, too, heating is according to the mode
        of the heat. For the likeness of the known in the knower is as the form
        by which the operation takes place. Therefore, if God has a proper
        knowledge of many things, He must be the proper model of singulars. How
        this may be we must investigate.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] As the Philosopher says in <i>Metaphysics</i> VIII [3], the forms of
        things and the definitions that signify them are like numbers. Among
        numbers, the addition or subtraction of unity changes the species of a
        number, as appears in the numbers two and three. It is the same among
        definitions: the addition or subtraction of one difference changes the
        species. For sensible substance, with the difference rational taken away
        and added, differs in species.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Now, with reference to things that contain a multitude, the
        intellect and nature are differently disposed. For what is required for
        the being of something the nature of that thing does not permit to be
        removed. For the nature of an animal will not survive if the soul is
        taken away from the body. But what is joined in reality the intellect
        can at times receive separately, when one of the elements is not
        included in the notion of the other. Thus, in the number three the
        intellect can consider the number two only, and in the rational animal
        it can consider that which is sensible only. Hence, that which contains
        several elements the intellect can take as the proper notion of the
        several elements by apprehending one of them without the others. It can,
        for example, take the number ten as the proper notion of nine by
        subtracting unity, and similarly as the proper notion of each of the
        numbers included under it. So, too, it can take in man the proper
        exemplar of irrational animal as such, and of each of its species,
        except that they would add some positive differences. On this account a
        certain philosopher, Clement by name, said that the nobler beings in
        reality are the exemplars of the less noble [cf. Pseudo-Dionysius,
        <i>De div. nom.</i> V, 9].
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] But the divine essence comprehends within itself the nobilities of
        all beings, not indeed compositely, but, as we have shown above,
        according to the mode of perfection. Now, every form, both proper and
        common, considered as positing something, is a certain perfection; it
        includes imperfection only to the extent that it falls short of true
        being. The intellect of God, therefore, can comprehend in His essence
        that which is proper to each thing by understanding wherein the divine
        essence is being imitated and wherein each thing falls short of its
        perfection. Thus, by understanding His essence as imitable in the mode
        of life and not of knowledge, God has the proper form of a plant; and if
        He knows His essence as imitable in the mode of knowledge and not of
        intellect, God has the proper form of animal, and so forth. Thus, it is
        clear that, being absolutely perfect, the divine essence can be taken as
        the proper exemplar of singulars. Through it, therefore, God can have a
        proper knowledge of all things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Since, however, the proper exemplar of one thing is distinguished
        from the proper exemplar of another thing, and distinction is the source
        of plurality, we must observe in the divine intellect a certain
        distinction and plurality of understood exemplars, according as that
        which is in the divine intellect is the proper exemplar of diverse
        things. Hence, since this obtains according as God understands the
        proper relation of resemblance that each creature has to Him, it remains
        that the exemplars of things in the divine intellect are many or
        distinct only according as God knows that things can be made to resemble
        Him by many and diverse modes. In accord with this, Augustine says that
        God made man and a horse by distinct exemplars. He also says that the
        exemplars of things are a plurality in the divine mind. This conclusion
        likewise saves to some extent the opinion of Plato and his doctrine of
        Ideas, according to which would be formed everything that is found among
        material things.

          >THAT GOD UNDERSTANDS ALL THINGS TOGETHER</span
        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From this it is further apparent that God understands all things
        together.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Our intellect cannot understand in act many things together. The
        reason is that, since “the intellect in act is its object in act,” if
        the intellect did understand many things together, it would follow that
        the intellect would be at one and the same time many things according to
        one genus—which is impossible. I say “according to one genus” because
        nothing prevents the same subject from being informed by diverse forms
        of diverse genera, just as the same body is figured and colored. Now,
        the intelligible species, by which the intellect is formed so as to be
        the objects that are understood in act, all belong to one genus; for
        they have one manner of being in the order of intelligible being, even
        though the things whose species they are do not have one manner of
        being. Hence, the species are not contrary through the contrariety of
        the things that are outside the soul. It is in this way that, when
        certain things that are many are considered as in any way united, they
        are understood together. For the intellect understands a continuous
        whole all at once, not part after part. So, too, it understands a
        proposition all at once, not first the subject and then the predicate,
        since it knows all the parts according to one species of the whole.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] From these remarks we can infer that, whenever several things are
        known through one species, they can be known together. But all that God
        knows He knows through one species, which is His essence. Therefore, God
        can understand all things together.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Again, a knowing power does not know anything in act unless the
        intention be present. Thus, the phantasms preserved in the organ are not
        always actually imagined because the intention is not directed to them.
        For among voluntary agents the appetite moves the other powers to act.
        We do not understand together, therefore, many things to which the
        intention is not directed at the same time. But things that must fall
        under one intention must be understood together; for he who is
        considering a comparison between two things directs his intention to
        both and sees both together.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Now, all the things that are in the divine knowledge must fall under
        one intention. For God intends to see His essence perfectly, which is to
        see it according to its whole power, under which are contained all
        things. Therefore God, by seeing His essence, sees all things together.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Furthermore, the intellect of one considering successively many
        things cannot have only one operation. For since operations differ
        according to their objects, the operation by which the first is
        considered must be different from the operation by which the second is
        considered. But the divine intellect has only one operation, namely, the
        divine essence, as we have proved. Therefore, God considers all that He
        knows, not successively, but together.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Moreover, succession cannot be understood without time nor time
        without motion, since time is “the number of motion according to before
        and after.” But there can be no motion in God, as may be inferred from
        what we have said. There is, therefore, no succession in the divine
        consideration. Thus, all that He knows God considers together.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] Then, too, God’s understanding is His being, as is clear from what
        we have said. But there is no before and after in the divine being;
        everything is together, as was shown above. Neither, therefore, does the
        consideration of God contain a before and after, but, rather,
        understands all things together.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] Every intellect, furthermore, that understands one thing after the
        other is at one time potentially understanding and at another time
        actually understanding. For while it understands the first thing
        actually it understands the second thing potentially. But the divine
        intellect is never potentially, but always actually, understanding.
        Therefore, it does not understand things successively but rather
        understands them together.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] Sacred Scripture bears witness to this truth. For it is written:
        “With God there is no change nor shadow of alteration” (James 1:17).

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From this it appears that there is no habitual knowledge in God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Where there is habitual knowledge, not all things are known
        together; some are known actually, and some habitually. But, as we have
        proved, God has actual understanding of all things together. There is,
        therefore, no habitual knowledge in Him.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Furthermore, he who has a habit and is not using it is in a manner
        in potency, though otherwise than prior to understanding. But we have
        shown that the divine intellect is in no way in potency. In no way,
        therefore, is there habitual knowledge in it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Moreover, if an intellect knows something habitually, its essence is
        other than its intellectual operation, which is the consideration
        itself. For an intellect that knows habitually is lacking its operation,
        but its essence cannot be lacking to it. In God, however, as we have
        proved, His essence is His operation. There is, therefore, no habitual
        knowledge in His intellect.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Again, an intellect that knows only habitually is not at its highest
        perfection. That is why happiness, which is something best, is posited
        in terms of act, not in terms of habit. If, therefore, God is habitually
        knowing through His substance, considered in His substance He will not
        be universally perfect. We have shown the contrary of this conclusion.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] It has also been shown that God understands through His essence, but
        not through any intelligible species added to His essence. Now, every
        habitual intellect understands through some species. For either a habit
        confers on the intellect a certain ability to receive the intelligible
        species by which it becomes understanding in act, or else it is the
        ordered aggregate of the species themselves existing in the intellect,
        not according to a complete act, but in a way intermediate between
        potency and act. There is therefore no habitual knowledge in God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Then, again, a habit is a certain quality. But no quality or
        accident can be added to God, as we have proved. Habitual knowledge,
        therefore, does not befit God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] But because the disposition by which one is only habitually
        considering or willing or doing is likened to the disposition of one
        sleeping, hence it is that, in order to remove any habitual disposition
        from God, David says: “Behold He neither slumbers nor sleeps, who keeps
        Israel” (Ps. 120:4). Hence, also, what is said in Sirach (23:28): “The
        eyes of the Lord are far brighter than the sun”; for the sun is always
        shining.

          >THAT GOD’S KNOWLEDGE IS NOT DISCURSIVE</span
        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] We thereby further know that the divine consideration is not
        ratiocinative or discursive.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Our consideration is ratiocinative when we proceed from the
        consideration of one thing to another, as when in syllogistic reasoning
        we proceed from principles to conclusions. For, when someone examines
        how a conclusion follows from premises and considers both together, he
        is not on this account reasoning or discoursing, since this takes place,
        not by arguing, but by judging the arguments. So, too, knowledge is not
        material because it judges material things. Now, it has been shown that
        God does not consider one thing after the other as it were in
        succession, but all together. His knowledge, therefore, is not
        ratiocinative or discursive, although He knows all discourse and
        ratiocination.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Everyone reasoning sees the principle by one consideration and the
        conclusions by another. There would be no need to proceed to conclusions
        after the consideration of the principles if by considering the
        principles we also considered the conclusions. But God knows all things
        by one operation, His essence, as we proved above. His knowledge is,
        therefore, not ratiocinative.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Again, all ratiocinative knowledge contains some potency and some
        act, for conclusions are in principles potentially. But in the divine
        intellect potency has no place, as was proved above. God’s intellect,
        therefore, is not discursive.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Moreover, in all discursive knowledge there must be something
        caused, since principles are in a manner the efficient cause of the
        conclusion. Hence, demonstration is said to be “a syllogism making one
        to know.” But in the divine knowledge there can be nothing caused, since
        it is God Himself, as is clear from what has preceded. God’s knowledge,
        therefore, cannot be discursive.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] What is naturally known, furthermore, is known to us without
        ratiocination. But in God there can be only natural knowledge, indeed,
        only essential knowledge; for, as was proved above, His knowledge is His
        essence. God’s knowledge, therefore, is not ratiocinative.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Again, every motion must be reduced to a first mover that is only
        mover and not moved. That from which the first motion originates,
        therefore, must be an absolutely unmoved mover. This, as was proved
        above, is the divine intellect. The divine intellect must, therefore, be
        an absolutely unmoved mover. But ratiocination is a certain motion of
        the intellect proceeding from one thing to another. Hence, the divine
        intellect is not ratiocinative.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] Then, too, what is highest in us is lower than what is in God, for
        the lower reaches the higher only in its own highest part. But what is
        highest in our knowledge is, not reason, but intellect, which is the
        origin of reason. God’s knowledge, then, is not ratiocinative but solely
        intellectual.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] Moreover, since God is absolutely perfect, as we proved above, every
        defect must be removed from Him. But ratiocinative knowledge arises from
        an imperfection in intellectual nature. For that which is known through
        another is less known than what is known through itself; nor is the
        nature of the knower sufficient for knowing that which is known through
        another without that through which it is made known. But in
        ratiocinative knowledge something is made known through another, whereas
        that which is known intellectually is known through itself, and the
        nature of the knower is able to know it without an external means.
        Hence, it is manifest that reason is a certain defective intellect.
        Therefore, the divine knowledge is not ratiocinative.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] Furthermore, those things whose species are in the knower are
        comprehended without discursive reasoning. For the sight does not
        proceed discursively to know the stone whose likeness it possesses. But
        the divine essence, as was shown above, is the likeness of all things.
        Hence, it does not proceed to know something through discursive
        reasoning.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] The solution of those difficulties that seem to introduce
        discursiveness into the divine knowledge is likewise at hand. First,
        because God knows other things through His essence. For it was shown
        that this does not take place discursively, since God’s essence is
        related to other things, not as a principle to conclusions, but as a
        species to things known. Secondly, because some might think it
        unbefitting if God were not able to syllogize. For God possesses the
        knowledge of syllogizing as one judging, and not as one proceeding by
        syllogizing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [12] To this truth, which has been rationally proved, Sacred Scripture
        likewise gives witness. For it is written: “And things are naked and
        open to His sight” (Heb. 4:13). For what we know by reasoning is not
        through itself naked and revealed to us, but is opened and laid bare by
        reason.

          >THAT GOD DOES NOT UNDERSTAND BY COMPOSING AND DIVIDING</span
        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Through the same means we can also show that the divine intellect
        does not understand in the manner of a composing and dividing intellect.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] For the divine intellect knows all things by knowing its own
        essence. Now it does not know its own essence by composing and dividing,
        since it knows itself as it is and there is no composition in it. It
        does not, therefore, know in the manner of a composing and dividing
        intellect.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Moreover, what is composed and divided by the intellect is of a
        nature to be considered separately by it. For there would be no need of
        composition and division if by apprehending the essence of a thing we
        grasped what belonged in it and what did not. If, then, God understood
        in the manner of a composing and dividing intellect, it would follow
        that He did not consider all things by one intuition but each thing
        separately. We have shown the contrary of this above.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Furthermore, there can be no before and after in God. But
        composition and division come after the consideration of the essence,
        which is their principle. Hence, composition and division cannot be
        found in the operation of the divine intellect.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Again, the proper object of the intellect is what a thing is. Hence,
        in relation to what a thing is the intellect suffers no deception except
        by accident, whereas as concerns composition and division it is
        deceived. So, too, a sense dealing with its proper sensibles is always
        true, but in other cases it is deceived. But in the divine intellect
        there is nothing accidental, but only that which is substantial. In the
        divine intellect, therefore, there is no composition and division, but
        only the simple apprehension of a thing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Furthermore, in the case of a proposition formed by a composing and
        dividing intellect, the composition itself exists in the intellect, not
        in the thing that is outside the soul. If the divine intellect should
        judge of things in the manner of a composing and dividing intellect, the
        intellect itself will be composite. This is impossible, as is clear from
        what has been said.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Again, the composing and dividing intellect judges diverse things by
        diverse compositions, for the composition of the intellect does not
        exceed the terms of the composition. Hence, the intellect does not judge
        the triangle to be a figure by the same composition by which it judges
        man to be an animal. Now, composition or division is a certain operation
        of the intellect. If, then, God considers things by means of composing
        and dividing, it will follow that His understanding is not solely one
        but many. And thus His essence, as well, will not be solely one, since
        His intellectual operation is His essence, as was proved above.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] But it is not on this account necessary for us to say that God does
        not know enunciables. For His essence, being one and simple, is the
        exemplar of all manifold and composite things. And thus God knows
        through His essence all multitude and composition both of nature and of
        reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] With these conclusions the authority of Sacred Scripture is in
        harmony. For it is said in Isaiah (55:8): “For My thoughts are not your
        thoughts.” Yet it is said in a Psalm (93:11): “The Lord knows the
        thoughts of men,” which thoughts evidently proceed through composition
        and division in the intellect.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] Dionysius likewise says: “Therefore, in knowing itself, the divine
        wisdom knows all things-the material immaterially, the divisible
        indivisibly, and the many unitedly” [ <i>De div. nom.</i> VII, 2].

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From this it may be seen that, although the knowledge of the divine
        intellect is not of the sort belonging to an intellect that composes and
        divides, truth, which according to the Philosopher is found only in the
        composition and division of the intellect [ <i>Metaph.</i> V, 4;
        <i>De anima</i> III, 6], is yet not excluded from it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] For, since the truth of the intellect is “the adequation of
        intellect and thing,” inasmuch as the intellect says that what is is and
        what is not is not, truth belongs to that in the intellect which the
        intellect says, not to the operation by which it says it. For the
        intellect to be true it is not required that its act of understanding be
        adequated to the thing known, since the thing is sometimes material
        whereas the act of understanding is immaterial. Rather, what the
        intellect in understanding says and knows must be adequated to the
        thing, so that, namely, the thing be such as the intellect says it to
        be. Now, by His simple understanding, in which there is no composition
        and division, God knows not only the quiddities of things but also
        enunciations, as has been shown. Hence, that which the divine intellect
        says in understanding is composition and division. Therefore, truth is
        not excluded from the divine intellect by reason of its simplicity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] When the incomplex is said or understood, the incomplex, of itself,
        is neither equated to a thing nor unequal to it. For equality and
        inequality are by relation, whereas the incomplex, of itself, does not
        imply any relation or application to a thing. Hence, of itself, it can
        be said to be neither true nor false; but the complex can, in which the
        relation of the incomplex to a thing is designated by a sign of
        composition or division. Nevertheless, the incomplex intellect in
        understanding what a thing is apprehends the quiddity of a thing in a
        certain relation to the thing, because it apprehends it as the quiddity
        of that thing. Hence although the incomplex itself, or even a
        definition, is not in itself true or false, nevertheless the intellect
        that apprehends what a thing is is always said to be through itself
        true, as appears in <i>De anima</i> III [6], although it can be by
        accident false, in so far as a definition includes some composition
        either of the parts of a definition with one another or of the whole
        definition with the thing defined. Hence, according as the definition is
        understood to be the definition of this or that thing, as it is received
        by the intellect, it will be called absolutely false if the parts of the
        definition do not belong together, as if we should say
        <i>insensible animal</i>; or it will be called false with reference to a
        given thing, as when the definition of a circle is taken as that of a
        triangle. Given, therefore, by an impossible supposition, that the
        divine intellect knew only incomplexes, it would still be true in
        knowing its own quiddity as its own.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Again, the divine simplicity does not exclude perfection, because it
        possesses in its simple being whatever of perfection is found in other
        things through a certain aggregation of perfections or forms, as was
        shown above. But in apprehending incomplexes, our intellect does not yet
        reach its ultimate perfection, because it is still in potency to
        composition or division. So, too, among natural things, the simple are
        in potency with reference to the mixed, and the parts with reference to
        the whole. According to His simple understanding, therefore, God has
        that perfection of knowledge that our intellect has through both
        knowledges, that of complexes and that of incomplexes. But our intellect
        reaches truth in its perfect knowledge, that is to say, when it already
        has arrived at composition. Therefore, in the simple understanding of
        God as well there is truth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Again, since God is the good of every good, as having every goodness
        in Himself, as has been shown above, the goodness of the intellect
        cannot be lacking to Him. But the true is the good of the intellect, as
        appears from the Philosopher [ <i>Ethics</i> VI, 2]. Therefore, truth is
        in God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From the foregoing it is evident that God Himself is truth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Truth is a certain perfection of understanding or of intellectual
        operation, as has been said. But the understanding of God is His
        substance. Furthermore, since this understanding is, as we have shown,
        the divine being, it is not perfected through any superadded perfection;
        it is perfect through itself, in the same manner as we have shown of the
        divine being. It remains, therefore, that the divine substance is truth
        itself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Again, according to the Philosopher, truth is a certain goodness of
        the intellect. But God is His own goodness, as we have shown above.
        Therefore, He is likewise His own truth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Furthermore, nothing can be said of God by participation, since He
        is His own being, which participates in nothing. But, as was shown
        above, there is truth in God. If, then, it is not said by participation,
        it must be said essentially. Therefore, God is His truth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Moreover, although, according to the Philosopher, the true is
        properly not in things but in the mind, a thing is at times said to be
        true when it reaches in a proper way the act of its own nature. Hence,
        Avicenna says in his <i>Metaphysics</i> that “the truth of a thing is
        the property of the being established in each thing” [VIII, 6]. This is
        so in so far as each thing is of a nature to give a true account of
        itself and in so far as it imitates the model of itself which is in the
        divine mind. But God is His essence. Therefore, whether we speak of the
        truth of the intellect or of the truth of a thing, God is His truth.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">

        with which no falsity or deception can be mingled.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] For truth is not compatible with falsity, as neither is whiteness
        with blackness. But God is not only true, He is truth itself. Therefore,
        there can be no falsity in Him.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Moreover, the intellect is not deceived in knowing what a thing is,
        just as the sense is not deceived in its proper sensible. But, as we
        have shown, all the knowledge of the divine intellect is in the manner
        of an intellect knowing what a thing is. It is impossible, therefore,
        that there be error or deception or falsity in the divine knowledge.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Furthermore, the intellect does not err in the case of first
        principles; it errs at times in the case of conclusions at which it
        arrives by reasoning from first principles. But the divine intellect, as
        we have shown above, is not ratiocinative or discursive. Therefore,
        there cannot be falsity or deception in it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Again, the higher a knowing power, so much the more universal is its
        proper object, containing several objects under it. Thus, that which
        sight knows by accident the common sense or the imagination apprehends
        as contained under its proper object. But the power of the divine
        intellect is at the very peak of elevation in knowing. Hence, all
        knowable objects are related to it as knowable properly,and essentially
        and not by accident. In such cases, however, the knowing power does not
        err. Therefore, the divine intellect cannot err in the case of any
        knowable object.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Moreover, intellectual virtue is a certain perfection of the
        intellect in knowing. But according to intellectual virtue no intellect
        expresses what is false, but always what is true; for to speak the true
        is the good of the act of the intellect, and it belongs to virtue “to
        make an act good.” But the divine intellect, being at the peak of
        perfection, is more perfect through its nature than the human intellect
        is through the habit of virtue. It remains, therefore, that there cannot
        be falsity in the divine intellect.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Furthermore, the knowledge of the human intellect is in a manner
        caused by things. Hence it is that knowable things are the measure of
        human knowledge; for something that is judged to be so by the intellect
        is true because it is so in reality, and not conversely. But the divine
        intellect through its knowledge is the cause of things. Hence, its
        knowledge is the measure of things, in the same way as an art is the
        measure of artifacts, each one of which is perfect in so far as it
        agrees with the art. The divine intellect, therefore, is related to
        things as things are related to the human intellect. But the falsity
        that is caused by the lack of equality between the human intellect and a
        thing is not in reality but in the intellect. If, therefore, there were
        no adequation whatever of the divine intellect to things, the falsity
        would be found in things and not in the divine intellect. Nevertheless,
        there is no falsity in things, because, so far as each thing has being,
        to that extent does it have truth. There is, therefore, no inequality
        between the divine intellect and things, nor can there be any falsity in
        the divine intellect.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] Again, as the true is the good of the intellect, so the false is its
        evil. For we naturally seek to know the truth and flee from being
        deceived by the false. But, as we have proved, there can be no evil in
        God. Hence, there can be no falsity in Him.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] Hence it is written: “But God is true” (Rom. 3:4); and in Numbers
        (23:19): “God is not a man, that He should lie”; and in John (I, 1:5):
        “God is light, and in Him there is no darkness.”

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From what we have shown it clearly results that the divine truth is
        the first and highest truth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] As is clear from the Philosopher, things are disposed in truth as
        they are disposed in being. The reason for this is that the true and
        being follow one another; for the true then exists when that which is is
        said to be and that which is not is said not to be. But the divine being
        is first and most perfect. Therefore, its truth is the first and highest
        truth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Again, what belongs to a thing essentially belongs to it most
        perfectly. But, as we have shown, truth is said of God essentially.
        Therefore, His truth is the highest and first truth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Furthermore, there is truth in our intellect because it is adequated
        to the thing that the intellect understands. But, as can be seen in
        <i>Metaphysics</i> V [15], unity is the cause of equality. Since, then,
        in the divine intellect the intellect and that which it understands are
        absolutely one, its truth is the first and highest truth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Moreover, that which is the measure in any given genus is most
        perfect in that genus. That is why all colors are measured by white. But
        the divine truth is the measure of all truth. For the truth of our
        intellect is measured by the thing outside the soul, since our intellect
        is said to be true because it is in agreement with the thing that it
        knows. On the other hand, the truth of a thing is measured by the divine
        intellect, which is the cause of things, as will later on be proved. In
        the same way, the truth of artifacts comes from the art of the artisan,
        for a chest is then true when it agrees with its art. And since God is
        the first intellect and the first intelligible, the truth of any given
        intellect must be measured by the truth of His intellect—if, as the
        Philosopher teaches, each thing is measured by that which is first in
        its genus. The divine truth, therefore, is the first, highest, and most
        perfect truth.

          >THE ARGUMENTS OF THOSE WHO WISH TO TAKE AWAY THE KNOWLEDGE OF
          SINGULARS FROM GOD</span
        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Now, there are certain persons who are trying to take away the
        knowledge of singulars from the perfection of the divine knowledge. They
        use seven ways to confirm their position.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] The first way is based on the very condition of singularity. For the
        principle of singularity is designated matter, and hence it seems that
        singulars cannot be known by any immaterial power, given that all
        knowledge takes place through a certain assimilation. So, too, in our
        own case only those powers apprehend singulars that make use of material
        organs, for example, the imagination, the senses, and the like. But
        because it is immaterial, our intellect does not know singulars. Much
        less, therefore, does the divine intellect know singulars, being the
        most removed from matter. Thus, in no way does it seem that God can know
        singulars.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] The second way is based on the fact that singulars do not always
        exist. Therefore, either they will be known by God always, or they will
        be known at some time and not at another. The first alternative is
        impossible, since of that which does not exist there can be no
        knowledge; knowledge deals only with what is true, and what does not
        exist cannot be true. Nor is the second alternative possible, since, as
        we have shown, the knowledge of the divine intellect is absolutely
        unchangeable.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] The third way is based on the fact that not all singulars come to be
        of necessity but some happen contingently. Hence, there can be a certain
        knowledge of them only when they exist. Now, that knowledge is certain
        which cannot be deceived. But all knowledge of the contingent can be
        deceived when the contingent is future, since the opposite of what is
        held by knowledge can happen; for, if it could not happen, it would then
        be necessary. Hence it is that we cannot have any knowledge of future
        contingents, but only a certain conjectural estimation. Now, we must
        suppose that all God’s knowledge is, as we have shown, most certain and
        infallible. And because of His immutability, as we have said, it is
        impossible for God to begin to know something anew. From all this it
        seems to follow that God does not know contingent singulars.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] The fourth way is based on the fact that the will is the cause of
        some singulars. Before it exists, an effect can be known only in its
        cause, since, before it begins to be, this is the only way for an effect
        to exist. But the motions of the will can be known with certitude only
        by the one willing, in whose power they lie. It seems impossible,
        therefore, that God should have an eternal knowledge of such singulars
        as are caused by the will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] The fifth way is based on the infinity of singulars. The infinite as
        such is unknown. Everything that is known is in a manner measured by the
        comprehension of the knower, since this “measure” is nothing other than
        a certain certification of the measured thing. That is why every art
        repudiates the infinite. But singulars are infinite, at least
        potentially. It seems impossible, then, that God knows singulars.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] The sixth way is based on the very lowliness of singulars. Since the
        dignity of a science is in a way determined from the dignity of its
        object, the lowliness of the knowable object likewise seems to redound
        to the lowliness of the science. But the divine intellect is most noble.
        Its nobility, therefore, forbids that it should know certain of the
        lowliest among singulars.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] The seventh way is based on the evil found in some singulars. For,
        since that which is known is found in the knower in a certain way, and
        there can be no evil in God, as was shown abovc, it seems to follow that
        God has absolutely no knowledge of evil and privation. This is known
        only by an intellect that is in potency, for privation can exist only in
        potency. From this it follows that God has no knowledge of the singulars
        in which there is evil and privation.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] To remove this error, and likewise to show the perfection of the
        divine knowledge, we must diligently look into the truth of each of the
        above ways, so that what is opposed to the truth may be refuted. We
        shall first show, then, that the divine intellect knows singulars.
        Second, we shall show that it knows what does not exist in act. Third,
        that it knows future contingents with an infallible knowledge. Fourth,
        that it knows the motions of the will. Fifth, that it knows infinite
        things. Sixth, that it knows every lowly and least thing among beings.
        Seventh, that it knows evils and all privations and defects.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">THAT GOD KNOWS SINGULARS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] We shall therefore first show that the knowledge of singulars cannot
        be lacking to God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] It was shown above that God knows other things in so far as He is
        their cause. Now, singular things are God's effects. God causes things
        in so far as He makes them to be in act. Universals, on the other hand,
        are not subsisting things, but rather have being only in singulars, as
        is proved in <i>Metaphysics</i> VII [13]. God, therefore, knows things
        other than Himself, not only universally, but also in the singular.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Again, by knowing the principles of which the essence of a thing is
        composed, we necessarily know that thing itself. Thus, by knowing a
        rational soul and a certain sort of body, we know man. Now, the singular
        essence is composed of designated matter and individuated form. Thus,
        the essence of Socrates is composed of this body and this soul, just as
        the universal essence of man is composed of soul and body, as may be
        seen in <i>Metaphysics</i> VII [10]. Hence, just as the latter
        principles fall within the definition of universal man, so the former
        principles would fall in the definition of Socrates if he could be
        defined. Hence, whoever has a knowledge of matter and of what designates
        matter, and also of form individuated in matter, must have a knowledge
        of the singular. But the knowledge of Cod extends to matter and to
        individuating accidents and forms. For, since His understanding is His
        essence, He must understand all things that in any way are in His
        essence. Now, within His essence, as within the first source, there are
        virtually present all things that in any way have being, since He is the
        first and universal principle of being. Matter and accidents are not
        absent from among these things, since matter is a being in potency and
        an accident is a being in another. Therefore, the knowledge of singulars
        is not lacking to God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Moreover, the nature of a genus cannot be known perfectly unless its
        first differences and proper attributes are known. The nature of number
        would not be known perfectly if the even and the odd were not known. But
        universal and singular are differences or essential attributes of being.
        If, then, in knowing His essence God knows perfectly the common nature
        of being, He must know the universal and the singular perfectly. But,
        just as He would not know the universal perfectly if He knew the
        intention of universality and did not know the universal reality, for
        example, man or animal, so He would not know the singular perfectly if
        He knew the nature of singularity and did not know this or that
        singular. Therefore, God must know singular things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Furthermore, just as God is His being, so, as we have shown, He is
        His knowing. Now, since He is His being, all the perfections of being
        must be found in Him as in the first origin of being, as was shown
        above. Therefore, there must be found in His knowledge, as in the first
        source of knowledge, the perfection of all knowledge. But this would not
        be so if the knowledge of singulars were lacking to Him; for the
        perfection of some knowers consists in this knowledge. Therefore, it is
        impossible for God not to have a knowledge of singulars.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Furthermore, among all ordered powers it is commonly found that the
        higher power, though one, extends to several things, whereas a lower
        power extends to fewer things and is nevertheless multiplied by its
        relation to them. This happens in the case of the imagination and the
        sense. The one power of the imagination extends to all the things that
        the five powers of the senses know, and to more besides. But the knowing
        power in God is higher than it is in man. Therefore, whatever man knows
        by means of diverse powers, namely, the intellect, the imagination, and
        the sense, this God considers by His one simple intellect. God,
        therefore, knows the singulars that we apprehend by the sense and the
        imagination.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Moreover, the divine intellect does not gather its knowledge from
        things, as ours does; rather, as will be shown later on, it is through
        its knowledge the cause of things. The knowledge that the divine
        intellect has of other things is after the manner of practical
        knowledge. Now, practical knowledge is not perfect unless it reaches to
        singulars. For the end of practical knowledge is operation, which
        belongs to the domain of singulars. Therefore, the knowledge that God
        has of other things extends to singulars.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] Furthermore, as was shown above, the first movable is moved by a
        mover moving through intellect and appetite. Now, a mover could not
        cause motion through his intellect unless he moved the movable in so far
        as it is of a nature to be moved in place. But this is true of the
        movable in so far as it is here and now, and consequently in so far as
        it is singular. Therefore, the intellect that is the mover of the first
        movable knows the first movable in so far as it is singular. Now, this
        mover is either held to be God, in which case we have made our point, or
        it is held to be some being below God. But, if the intellect of such a
        being can by its power know the singular, which our intellect cannot,
        all the more will the intellect of God be able to do this.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] Again, the agent is more noble than the patient or thing acted upon,
        as act is more noble than potency. Hence, a form of a lower grade cannot
        by acting extend its likeness to a higher grade; rather, the higher form
        by acting can extend its likeness to a lower grade. Thus, from the
        incorruptible powers of the stars there are produced corruptible forms
        among sublunary things; but a corruptible power cannot produce an
        incorruptible form. Now, all knowledge takes place through the
        assimilation of the knower and the known. There is this difference,
        however, that the assimilation in human knowledge takes place through
        the action of sensible things on man’s knowing powers, whereas in the
        case of God’s knowledge the assimilation takes place contrariwise
        through the action of the forms of the divine intellect on the things
        known. Hence, since the form of the sensible thing is individuated
        through its materiality, it cannot extend the likeness of its
        singularity so that it be absolutely immaterial. It can extend its
        likeness to the level of the powers that use material organs; it reaches
        the intellect only through the power of the agent intellect in so far as
        it is completely divested of the conditions of matter. Thus, the
        likeness of the singularity of a sensible form cannot reach up to the
        human intellect. But the likeness of a form in the divine intellect, by
        reaching to the least of things to which its causality reaches, extends
        to the singularity of the sensible and material form. The divine
        intellect, therefore, can know singulars, but not the human intellect.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] Then, too, if God does not know singulars which even men know,
        there would follow the difficulty that the Philosopher raises against
        Empedocles, namely, that God is the most foolish of beings [

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] This truth that we have proved is likewise strengthened by the
        authority of Sacred Scripture. For it is said in Hebrews (4:13):
        “Neither is there any creature invisible in His sight.” The contrary
        error likewise is removed by Sirach (16:16): “Do not say: I shall be
        hidden from God, and who shall remember me from on high?”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [12] It is also clear from what has been said how the objection to the
        contrary does not conclude properly. For, although that by which the
        divine intellect understands is immaterial, it is nevertheless the
        likeness of both form and matter, being the first productive principle
        of both.

        [1] We must next show that the knowledge even of the things that are not
        is not lacking to God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] As is clear from what we have said above, the relation of the divine
        knowledge to the things known is the same as the relation of the things
        that we know to our knowledge. Now, the relation of a thing known to our
        knowledge is this, namely, that the known thing can exist without our
        having a knowledge of it, as Aristotle illustrates of the squaring of a
        circle; but the converse is not true. The relation of the divine
        knowledge to other things, therefore, win be such that it can be even of
        non-existing things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Again, the knowledge of the divine intellect is to other things as
        the knowledge of an artisan to artifacts, since through His knowledge
        God is the cause of things. Now, the artisan knows through his art even
        those things that have not yet been fashioned, since the forms of his
        art flow from his knowledge to external matter for the constitution of
        the artifacts. Hence, nothing forbids that there be in the knowledge of
        an artisan forms that have not yet come out of it. Thus, nothing forbids
        God to have knowledge of the things that are not.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Furthermore, through His essence God knows things other than Himself
        in so far as His essence is the likeness of the things that proceed from
        Him. This is clear from what we have said. But since, as was shown
        above, the essence of God is of an infinite perfection, whereas every
        other thing has a limited being and perfection, it is impossible that
        the universe of things other than God equal the perfection of the divine
        essence. Hence, its power of representation extends to many more things
        than to those that are. Therefore, if God knows completely the power and
        perfection of His essence, His knowledge extends not only to the things
        that are but also to the things that are not.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Moreover, by that operation through which it knows what a thing is
        our intellect can know even those things that do not actually exist. It
        can comprehend the essence of a lion or a horse even though all such
        animals were to be destroyed. But the divine intellect knows, in the
        manner of one knowing what a thing is, not only definitions but also
        enunciables, as is clear from what we have said. Therefore, it can know
        even the things that are not.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Furthermore, an effect can be pre-known in its cause even before it
        exists. Thus, an astronomer pre-knows a future eclipse from a
        consideration of the order of the heavenly motions. But God knows all
        things through a cause; for, by knowing Himself, Who is the cause of
        other things, He knows other things as His effects, as was shown above.
        Nothing, therefore, prevents God from knowing even the things that are
        not.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Moreover, God’s understanding has no succession, as neither does His
        being. He is therefore an ever-abiding simultaneous whole-which belongs
        to the nature of eternity. On the other hand, the duration of time is
        stretched out through the succession of the before and after. Hence, the
        proportion of eternity to the total duration of time is as the
        proportion of the indivisible to something continuous; not, indeed, of
        that indivisible that is the terminus of a continuum, which is not
        present to every part of a continuum (the instant of time bears a
        likeness to such an indivisible), but of that indivisible which is
        outside a continuum and which nevertheless co-exists with any given part
        of a continuum or with a determinate point in the continuum. For, since
        time lies within motion, eternity, which is completely outside motion,
        in no way belongs to time. Furthermore, since the being of what is
        eternal does not pass away, eternity is present in its presentiality to
        any time or instant of time. We may see an example of sorts in the case
        of a circle. Let us consider a determined point on the circumference of
        a circle. Although it is indivisible, it does not co-exist
        simultaneously with any other point as to position, since it is the
        order of position that produces the continuity of the circumference. On
        the other hand, the center of the circle, which is no part of the
        circumference, is directly opposed to any given determinate point on the
        circumference. Hence, whatever is found in any part of time coexists
        with what is eternal as being present to it, although with respect to
        some other time it be past or future. Something can be present to what
        is eternal only by being present to the whole of it, since the eternal
        does not have the duration of succession. The divine intellect,
        therefore, sees in the whole of its eternity, as being present to it,
        whatever takes place through the whole course of time. And yet what
        takes place in a certain part of time was not always existent. It
        remains, therefore, that God has a knowledge of those things that
        according to the march of time do not yet exist.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] Through these arguments it appears that God has a knowledge of
        non-being. But not all non-beings have the same relation to His
        knowledge. For those things that are not, nor will be, nor ever were,
        are known by God as possible to His power. Hence, God does not know them
        as in some way existing in themselves, but as existing only in the
        divine power. These are said by some to be known by God according to a
        knowledge of simple understanding. The things that are present, past, or
        future to us God knows in His power, in their proper causes, and in
        themselves. The knowledge of such things is said to be a knowledge of
        vision. For of the things that for us are not yet God sees not only the
        being that they have in their causes but also the being that they have
        in themselves, in so far as His eternity is present in its
        indivisibility to all time.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] Nevertheless, whatever being a thing has God knows through His
        essence. For His essence can be represented by many things that are not,
        nor will be, nor ever were. His essence is likewise the likeness of the
        power of every cause, through which effects pre-exist in their causes.
        And the being that each thing has in itself comes from the divine
        essence as from its exemplary source.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] Thus, therefore, God knows non-beings in so far as in some way they
        have being, namely, in His power, or in their causes, or in themselves.
        This is not incompatible with the nature of knowledge.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] The authority of Sacred Scripture likewise offers witness to what
        has preceded. For it is said in Sirach (23:29): “For all things were
        known to the Lord God before they were created: so also after they were
        perfected He beholds all things.” And in Jeremias (1:5): “Before I
        formed you in the bowels of your mother I knew you.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [12] It is also clear from what has preceded that we are not forced to
        say, as some said, that God knows singulars universally because He knows
        them only in universal causes, just as one would know a particular
        eclipse not in itself but as it arises from the position of the stars.
        For we have shown that the divine knowledge extends to singulars in so
        far as they are in themselves.

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From this we can begin to understand somewhat that God had from
        eternity an infallible knowledge of contingent singulars, and yet they
        do not cease to be contingent.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] The contingent is opposed to the certitude of knowledge only so far
        as it is future, not so far as it is present. For when the contingent is
        future, it can not-be. Thus, the knowledge of one conjecturing that it
        will be can be mistaken: it will be mistaken if what he conjectures as
        future will not take place. But in so far as the contingent is present,
        in that time it cannot not-be. It can not-be in the future, but this
        affects the contingent not so far as it is present but so far as it is
        future. Thus, nothing is lost to the certitude of sense when someone
        sees a man running, even though this judgment is contingent. All
        knowledge, therefore, that bears on something contingent as present can
        be certain. But the vision of the divine intellect from all eternity is
        directed to each of the things that take place in the course of time, in
        so far as it is present, as shown above. It remains, therefore, that
        nothing prevents God from having from all eternity an infallible
        knowledge of contingents.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Again, the contingent differs from the necessary according to the
        way each of them is found in its cause. The contingent is in its cause
        in such a way that it can both not-be and be from it; but the necessary
        can only be from its cause. But according to the way both of them are in
        themselves, they do not differ as to being, upon which the true is
        founded. For, according as it is in itself, the contingent cannot be and
        not-be, it can only be, even though in the future it can not-be. Now,
        the divine intellect from all eternity knows things not only according
        to the being that they have in their causes, but also according to the
        being that they have in themselves. Therefore, nothing prevents the
        divine intellect from having an eternal and infallible knowledge of
        contingents.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Moreover, just as from a necessary cause an effect follows with
        certitude, so it follows from a complete contingent cause if it be not
        impeded. But since, as appears from what was said above, God knows all
        things, He knows not only the causes of contingent things but also those
        things by which these causes may be impeded. Therefore, He knows with
        certitude whether contingent things are or are not.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Furthermore, an effect cannot exceed the perfection of its cause,
        though sometime it falls short of it. Hence, since our knowledge comes
        to us from things, it happens at times that we know what is necessary
        not according to the mode of necessity but according to that of
        probability. Now, just as in us things are the cause of knowledge, so
        the divine knowledge is the cause of the things known. Therefore,
        nothing prevents those things from being contingent in themselves of
        which God has a necessary knowledge.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Again, an effect whose cause is contingent cannot be a necessary
        one; otherwise, the effect could be even though the cause were removed.
        Now, of the most remote effect there is both a proximate and a remote
        cause. If, then, the proximate cause were contingent, its effect would
        have to be contingent even though the remote cause is necessary. Thus,
        plants do not bear fruit of necessity, even though the motion of the sun
        is necessary, because the intermediate causes are contingent. But the
        knowledge of God, though it is the cause of the things known through it,
        is yet a remote cause. Therefore, the contingency of the things known is
        not in conflict with this necessity, since it may be that the
        intermediate causes are contingent.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] The knowledge of God, furthermore, would not be true and perfect if
        things did not happen in the way in which God knows them to happen. Now,
        since God knows all being, and is its source, He knows every effect not
        only in itself but also in its order to each of its causes. But the
        order of contingent things to their proximate causes is that they come
        forth from these causes in a contingent way. Hence, God knows that some
        things are taking place, and this contingently. Thus, therefore, the
        certitude and truth of the divine knowledge does not remove the
        contingency of things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] From what has been said, it is therefore clear bow the objection
        impugning a knowledge of contingents in God is to be repulsed. For
        change in that which comes later does not induce change in that which
        has preceded; for it is possible that from prime necessary causes there
        proceed ultimate contingent effects. Now, the things that are known by
        God are not prior to His knowledge, as is the case with us, but, rather,
        subsequent to it. It does not therefore follow that, if something known
        by God can change, His knowledge of it can be deceived or in any way
        changed. We shall be deceived in the consequent therefore, if, because
        our knowledge of changeable things is itself changeable, we suppose on
        this account that such is necessarily the case in all knowledge.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] Again, when it is said that God knows or knew this future thing, a
        certain intermediate point between the divine knowledge and the thing
        known is assumed. This is the time when the above words are spoken, in
        relation to which time that which is known by God is said to be future.
        But this is not future with reference to the divine knowledge, which,
        abiding in the moment of eternity, is related to all things as present
        to them. If with respect to the divine knowledge we remove from its
        intermediate position the time when the words are spoken, we cannot say
        that this is known by God as non-existent, so as to leave room for the
        question whether it can not-be; rather, it will be said to be known by
        God in such a way that it is seen by Him already in its own existence.
        On this basis there is no room for the preceding question. For that
        which already is cannot, with respect to that moment of time, not be. We
        are therefore deceived by the fact that the time in which we are
        speaking is present to eternity, as is likewise past time (designated by
        the words God knew). Hence, the relation of past or present time to the
        future is attributed to eternity, to which such a relation does not
        belong. It is thus that we commit the fallacy of accident.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        There is more. If each thing is known by God as seen by Him in the
        present, what is known by God will then have to be. Thus, it is
        necessary that Socrates be seated from the fact that he is seen seated.
        But this is not absolutely necessary or, as some say, with the necessity
        of the consequent; it is necessary conditionally, or with the necessity
        of the consequence. For this is a necessary conditional proposition: if
        he is seen sitting, he is sitting. Hence, although the conditional
        proposition may be changed to a categorical one, to read what is seen
        sitting must necessarily be sitting, it is clear that the proposition is
        true if understood of what is said, and compositely; but it is false if
        understood of what is meant, and dividedly. Thus, in these and all
        similar arguments used by those who oppose God’s knowledge of
        contingents, the fallacy of composition and division takes place.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] That God knows future contingents is also shown by the authority of
        Sacred Scripture. For it is said of the divine wisdom: “She knows signs
        and wonders before they be done, and the events of times and ages” (Wis.
        8:8). And in Sirach (39:24-25) it is said: “There is nothing hidden from
        His eyes. He sees from eternity to eternity.” And in Isaiah (48:5): “I
        foretold you of old, before they came to pass I told you.”

        [1] We must now show that God knows the thoughts of the mind and the
        motions of the will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] As was shown above, whatever in any way exists is known by God in so
        far as He knows His own essence. There is a certain being in the soul
        and a certain being in things outside the soul. God, therefore, knows
        all these differences of being and what is contained under them. But the
        being that is in the soul is that which is in the will or in thought. It
        remains, therefore, that God knows that which is in thought and in the
        will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Moreover, in knowing His essence, God knows other things in the same
        way as an effect is known through a knowledge of the cause. By knowing
        His essence, therefore, God knows all things to which His causality
        extends. But it extends to the operations of the intellect and the will.
        For, since each thing acts through its form, from which the thing has a
        certain being, so the fount and source of all being, from which is also
        every form, must be the source of all operation; for the effects of
        second causes are grounded more principally in first causes. Therefore,
        God knows the thoughts and affections of the mind.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Again, just as God’s being is prime and for this reason the cause of
        all being, so His understanding is prime and on this account the cause
        of all intellectual operation. Hence, just as God, by knowing His being
        knows the being of each thing, so by knowing His understanding and
        willing He knows every thought and will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Moreover, as is clear from what was said above, God knows things not
        only so far as they are in themselves, but also so far as they are in
        their causes; for He knows the order of a cause to its effect. But
        artifacts are in artisans through their intellect and will, just as
        natural things are in their causes through the powers of these causes.
        For just as natural things through their active powers assimilate their
        effects to themselves, so an artisan through his intellect induces into
        the artifact the form through which it is assimilated to his art. The
        situation is the same for all things that proceed intentionally from an
        agent. Therefore, od knows the thoughts and affections of the mind.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Again, God knows intelligible substances no less than He knows or we
        know sensible substances; for intellectual substances are more knowable,
        since they are in act. Now, both God and we know how sensible substances
        are informed and inclined. Since, then, the soul’s thinking is a certain
        information of the soul itself and its affection is a certain
        inclination of the soul towards something (so, too, we likewise caH the
        inclination of a natural thing a natural appetite), it remains that God
        knows the thoughts and affections of the mind.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] This is confirmed by the testimony of Sacred Scripture. For it is
        said in a Psalm (7:10): “The searcher of hearts and reins is God.” And
        in the Proverbs (15:11): “Hell and destruction are before the Lord: how
        much more the hearts of the children of men?” And John (2:25): “He knew
        what was in man.”

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] As for the dominion that the will has over its acts, through which
        it lies in the power of the will to will or not to will, this excludes
        the determination of the power to one effect and any violence from a
        cause acting from the outside; but it does not exclude the influence of
        a higher cause from which come its being and operation. Thus, the
        causality in the first cause, which is God, is not removed with respect
        to the motions of the will. Hence, God, by knowing Himself, can know
        such motions.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">THAT GOD KNOWS INFINITE THINGS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] After this we must show that God knows infinite things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] By knowing Himself to be the cause of things God knows things other
        than Himself, as is clear from the above. But God is the cause of
        infinite things, if there are infinite things, since He is the cause of
        all things that are. Therefore, God knows infinite things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Again, as is clear from what we have said, God knows His own power
        perfectly. But a power cannot be known perfectly unless all that it can
        do is known, since this is how the magnitude of a power is in a manner
        gauged. But since, as was shown above, His power is infinite, it extends
        to infinite things. Therefore, God knows infinite things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Moreover, if the knowledge of God extends to all things that in any
        way are, as was shown, He must know not only that which is actual but
        also that which is potential. But among natural things there is the
        infinite in potency, though not in act, as the Philosopher proves in
        <i>Physics</i> III [6]. God, therefore, knows infinite things. So, too,
        unity, which is the source of number, would know the infinite species of
        number if it knew whatever was in it potentially; for unity is
        potentially every number.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Furthermore, God knows other things by His essence as through a
        certain exemplary means. But, since His essence is of an infinite
        perfection, as was shown above, an infinite number of things having
        finite perfections can be derived from it. For no one thing or any
        number of things copied from the divine essence can equal the perfection
        of their cause. There thus always remains a new way in which some copy
        is able, to imitate the divine essence. Hence, nothing prevents God from
        knowing infinite things through His essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Besides, God’s being is His understanding. Hence, just as His being
        is infinite, as we have shown, so His understanding is infinite. But as
        the finite is to the finite, so the infinite is to the infinite. If,
        then, we are able to grasp finite things according to our understanding,
        which is finite, so God according to His understanding can grasp
        infinite things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Moreover, the intellect that knows the greatest intelligible, all
        the more, rather than less, knows lesser intelligibles, as is clear from
        the Philosopher in <i>De anima</i> III [4]. This arises because the
        intellect is not corrupted by an excelling intelligible, as is the
        sense, but is rather perfected by it. Now, let us take infinite things,
        whether of the same species (for example, an infinite number of men) or
        of infinite species, and let us even assume that some or all of them
        were infinite in quantity, were this possible the universe of these
        things would be of a lesser infinity than is God. For each of them, and
        all of them together, would have a being that is received and limited to
        a given species or genus and would thus be finite in some respect.
        Hence, it would fall short of the infinity of God, Who is absolutely
        infinite, as was shown above. Therefore, since God knows Himself
        perfectly, nothing prevents Him from also knowing that sum of infinite
        things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] Again, the more an intellect is more efficacious and penetrating in
        knowing, the more it can know many things through one means. So, too,
        every power is more united the more strong it is. But the divine
        intellect, as is clear from the above, is infinite in power or in
        perfection. Therefore, it can know infinite things through one means,
        namely, the divine essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] Moreover, the divine intellect, like the divine essence, is
        absolutely perfect. Hence, no intelligible perfection is lacking to it.
        But that to which our own intellect is in potency is its intelligible
        perfection. Now, our intellect is in potency to all intelligible
        species. But such species are infinite, since the species of both
        numbers and figures are infinite. It remains, then, that God knows all
        such infinites.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] Again, since our intellect can know infinite things in potency,
        being able to multiply the species of numbers infinitely, if the divine
        intellect did not know infinite things also in act, it would follow
        either that the human intellect knew more than did the divine intellect,
        or that the divine intellect did not know in act all the things that it
        knew in potency. Both alternatives are impossible, as appears from what
        was said above.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] Again, the infinite cannot be known in so far as it cannot be
        numbered, for it is in itself impossible to number the parts of the
        infinite, as implying a contradiction. But to know something by the
        numbering of its parts belongs to an intellect that knows one part after
        the other; it does not belong to an intellect that comprehends the
        diverse parts together. Therefore, since the divine intellect knows all
        things together without succession, it is no more prevented from knowing
        infinite things than from knowing finite things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [12] Moreover, all quantity consists in a certain multiplication of
        parts, and this is why number is the first of quantities. Where,
        therefore, plurality does not bring about any difference, there neither
        does anything that follows quantity bring about any difference. Now, in
        the case of God’s knowledge, many things are known as one, since they
        are known not through diverse species but through one species, namely,
        the divine essence. Hence, many things are also known together by God,
        so that in this way plurality introduces no difference in the divine
        knowledge. Neither, therefore, does the infinite that accompanies
        quantity. Hence, to know infinite and finite objects makes no difference
        to the divine intellect. Thus, since God knows finite things, nothing
        prevents Him from also knowing infinite things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [13] What is said in a Psalm (146:5) agrees with this: “And of His
        wisdom there is no number.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [14] Now, from what has been said it is evident why our intellect does
        not know the infinite, as does the divine intellect. For our intellect
        is distinguished from the divine intellect on four points which bring
        about this difference. The first point is that our intellect is
        absolutely finite whereas the divine intellect is infinite. The second
        point is that our intellect knows diverse things through diverse
        species. This means that it does not extend to infinite things through
        one act of knowledge as does the divine intellect. The third point
        follows from the second. Since our intellect knows diverse things
        through diverse species it cannot know many things at one and the same
        time. Hence, it can know infinite things only successively by numbering
        them. This is not the case with the divine intellect which sees many
        things together as grasped through one species. The fourth point is that
        the divine intellect knows both the things that are and the things that
        are not, as has been shown.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [15] It is likewise evident how the statement of Aristotle, who says
        that the infinite as infinite is unknown, is not opposed to the present
        conclusion. For, since the nature of the infinite belongs to quantity,
        as he himself says, the infinite as infinite would be known if it were
        known through the measurement of its parts, for this is the proper
        knowledge of quantity. But God does not know in this way. God,
        therefore, so to speak, does not know the infinite in so far as it is
        infinite, but, as we have shown, in so far as it is related to His
        knowledge as though it were something finite.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [16] It must be observed, however, that God does not know infinite
        things with the knowledge of vision, to make use of an expression
        employed by others. For there neither are nor have been nor will be
        infinite things in act, since, according to the Catholic faith,
        generation is not infinite at either end. But God knows the infinite
        with the knowledge of simple understanding. For He knows the infinite
        things which neither are nor will be nor have been, which yet lie in the
        potency of the creation. God likewise knows the infinite things that are
        in His power, which neither are nor will be nor have been.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [17] Hence, as concerns the question of the knowledge of singulars, we
        may reply by denying the major. There are not infinite singulars.
        However, if there were, God would still know them.

      <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">THAT GOD KNOWS LOWLY THINGS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Having achieved this conclusion, we must show that God knows lowly
        things, and that this is not opposed to the nobility of His knowledge.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] The stronger a given active power is, the more does its action
        extend to more remote effects. This is also evident in the actions of
        sensible things. Now, the power of the divine intellect in knowing
        things is like an active power. For God knows things not by receiving
        anything from them, but, rather, by exercising His causality on them.
        Hence, since God is of an infinite power in understanding, as is clear
        from what has preceded, His knowledge must extend even to the most
        remote things. But the gradation of nobility and lowliness among all
        things is measured according to their nearness to and distance from God,
        Who is at the peak of nobility. Therefore, because of the perfect power
        of His intellect, God knows the lowliest possible among beings.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Furthermore, everything that is, in that it is or in what it is, is
        in act and the likeness of the first act, and on this account has
        nobility. Whatever is in potency likewise participates in nobility from
        its order to act; for it is thus that it is said to be. It remains,
        then, that, considered in itself, each thing is noble, but is called
        lowly with respect to something more noble. Now, the most noble of
        creatures are no less distant from God than the lowest of creatures are
        distant from the highest. Hence, if this distance prevented God from
        knowing them, all the more would the previous distance. It would thus
        follow that God did not know anything other than Himself. This was
        disproved above. If, then, God knows something other than Himself,
        however supreme in nobility it may be, by the same reason He knows
        anything whatever, however exceedingly lowly it may be called.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Moreover, the good of the order of the universe is more noble than
        any part of the universe, since the individual parts are ordered, as to
        an end, to the good of the order that is in the whole. Ibis is evident
        from the Philosopher in <i>Metaphysics</i> XI [10]. Hence, if God knows
        some other noble nature, He especially knows the order of the universe.
        But this order cannot be known without a knowledge both of the things
        that are more noble and of the things that are more lowly, in whose
        distances and relations the order of the universe consists. It remains,
        therefore, that God knows not only noble things but also the things that
        are deemed lowly.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Again, the lowliness of the things known does not of itself redound
        to the knower. For it belongs to the nature of knowledge that the knower
        should contain the species of the thing known according to his own
        manner. Accidentally, however, the lowliness of the things known can
        redound to the knower. This may be either because, while he is
        considering lowly things, his mind is turned away from thinking of more
        noble things; or it may be because, as a result of considering lowly
        things, he is inclined towards certain unbefitting affections. This,
        however, is not possible in God, as is clear from what has been said.
        The knowledge of lowly things, therefore, does not detract from the
        divine nobility, but rather belongs to the divine perfection according
        as it pre-contains all things in itself, as was shown above.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Furthermore, a power is not judged to be small because it can do
        small things but because it is limited to small things; for a power that
        can do great things can likewise do small ones. Hence, a knowledge that
        extends at the same time to both noble and lowly things is not to be
        judged as being lowly; rather, that knowledge is to be judged lowly
        which extends only to lowly things, as happens in our own case. For we
        examine divine and human things by different considerations, and the
        knowledge of the one is not the knowledge of the other, so that by
        comparison with the more noble knowledge the lower knowledge is deemed
        to be lowlier. But it is not thus in God. By one and the same knowledge
        and consideration He considers both Himself and all other things. No
        lowliness, therefore, is ascribed to His knowledge from the fact that He
        knows any lowly things whatever.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] What is said of the divine wisdom is in harmony with this
        conclusion. Wisdom “reaches everywhere by reason of her purity... and
        therefore no defiled thing cometh into her” (Wis. 7:24-25).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] Now, from what has been said it is evident that the argument
        advanced on the opposite side is not opposed to the truth we have shown.
        For the nobility of knowledge is measured in terms of those things to
        which knowledge is principally directed, and not in terms of all the
        things that fall within knowledge. For in the most noble among the
        knowledges that we have there are included not only the highest beings
        but also the lowest. For first philosophy extends its consideration from
        the first being to being in potency, which is the lowest being. Thus,
        under divine science are included the lowest of beings as being known
        along with its principal object. For the divine essence is the principal
        object known by God and in this object, as was shown above, all others
        are known.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] It is also evident that this truth is not opposed to what the
        Philosopher says in <i>Metaphysics</i> XI [9]. Aristotle there intends
        to show that the divine intellect does not know anything other than
        itself that is its perfection in the sense of being its principal known
        object. In this sense he says that it is better not to know lowly things
        than to know them. This is the case, namely, when the knowledge of the
        lowly is different from the knowledge of the noble and the consideration
        of lowly things impedes the consideration of noble things.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">THAT GOD KNOWS EVILS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] It now remains to show that God likewise knows evils.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] When a good is known, the opposite evil is known. But God knows all
        particular goods, to which evils are opposed. Therefore, God knows
        evils.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Furthermore, the notions of contraries are themselves not contraries
        in the soul; otherwise, they would not be in the soul together nor would
        they be known together. The notion, therefore, by which evil is known is
        not opposed to the good but belongs, rather, to the notion of the good.
        Hence, if all the notions of goodness are found in God because of His
        absolute perfection, as was proved above, it follows that there is in
        Him the notion by which evil is known. And thus God also knows evils.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Again, the true is the good of the intellect. For an intellect is
        said to be good because it knows the true. But it is true not only that
        the good is good but also that evil is evil; for just as it is true that
        that which is is, so it is true that that which is not is not. The good
        of the intellect, therefore, also consists in the knowledge of evil.
        But, since the divine intellect is perfect in goodness, no intellectual
        perfection can be lacking to it. Therefore, it has a knowledge of evils.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Moreover, as was shown above, God knows the distinction of things.
        But negation is found within the notion of distinction; for those things
        are distinct of which one is not the other. Hence, the first notions,
        which are distinguished by themselves, mutually include a negation of
        one another. That is why the negative propositions among them are
        immediate: for example, no quantity is a substance. God, therefore,
        knows negation. But privation is a certain negation in a determinate
        subject, as is shown in <i>Metaphysics</i> IV [2]. God, therefore, knows
        privation. Consequently, He knows evil, which is nothing other than the
        privation of a due perfection.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Furthermore, if God knows all the species of things, as was proved
        above, and is likewise conceded and proved by certain philosophers, He
        must know contraries. This is so because the species of certain genera
        are contraries and also because the differences of genera are
        contraries, as is proved in <i>Metaphysics</i> X [8]. But between
        contraries there is included the opposition of form and privation, as is
        said in the same reference. Therefore, God must know privation and
        consequently evil.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Again, as was shown above, God knows not only form but also matter.
        But, since matter is a being in potency, it cannot be known perfectly
        unless those things to which its potency extends are known. This is the
        case with all other potencies. Now, the potency of matter extends both
        to form and to privation, since that which can be can also not-be.
        Therefore, God knows privation, and consequently He knows evil.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] Again, if God knows something other than Himself, He especially
        knows that which is the best. Ibis is the order of the universe to
        which, as to the end, all particular goods are ordered. But in the order
        of the universe certain things exist to ward off dangers that may come
        about from certain other things. This is clear from what is given to
        animals for their own protection. Therefore, God knows such dangers.
        Hence, He knows evils.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] Furthermore, in our own case the knowledge of evil is not considered
        blameworthy according to that which essentially belongs to knowledge,
        namely, the judgment that we have of evil things. But it is considered
        blameworthy by accident, in so far as through the consideration of evil
        one is sometimes inclined to evil things. This is not the case in God,
        because, as was shown above, He is immutable. Nothing, therefore,
        prevents God from knowing evils.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] What is said in Wisdom (7:30) harmonizes with this conclusion: “No
        evil can overcome” the “wisdom” of God. And in Proverbs (15:11) it is
        said: “Hell and destruction are before the Lord.” And in the Psalm
        (68:6): “My offenses are not hidden from you.” And in Job (11:11) it is
        said: “For He knows the vanity of men, and when He sees iniquity, does
        He not consider it?”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] We must observe, however, that on the knowledge of evil and
        privation the divine intellect and our own are differently disposed.
        For, since our intellect knows singular things through singular species
        that are proper and diverse, that which it is in act it knows through an
        intelligible species through which it is made an intellect in act.
        Hence, it can also know potency in so far as it is sometimes in potency
        to such a species; so that just as it knows act through act, so likewise
        it knows potency through potency. And because potency belongs to the
        nature of privation, since privation is a negation whose subject is a
        being in potency, it follows that it is suitable to our intellect in a
        certain manner to know privation in so far as it is of a nature to be in
        potency. Nevertheless, it can also be said that the knowledge of potency
        and privation follows from the knowledge of act.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [12] The divine intellect, on the other hand, which is in no way in
        potency, does not know privation or anything else in the above given
        way. For, if it knew something through a species that is not itself, it
        would necessarily follow that its proportion to that species would be as
        the proportion of potency to act. God must therefore understand solely
        through the species that is His own essence. It follows, consequently,
        that He understands only Himself as the first object of His intellect.
        But in understanding Himself He understands other things, as was proved
        above. And He knows not only acts, but also potencies and, privations.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [13] This is the meaning of the words that the Philosopher sets down in
        <i>De anima</i> III [6], when he says: “How does it apprehend evil or
        something black? For in a manner it knows contraries. But the knower
        must be potentially what it knows and this must be in it. But, if no
        contrary is present to a certain knower”—that is, in potency—“this
        knower knows itself and is in act and separable.”“ Nor must we adopt the
        interpretation of Averroes, who takes the position that it follows from
        this text that the intellect that is solely in act in no way knows
        privation. Rather, the sense is that it does not know privation by the
        fact of being in potency to something else; it knows privation because
        it knows itself and is always in act.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [14] Moreover, we must observe that, if God knew Himself in such a way
        that, by knowing Himself, He did not know other beings, which are
        particular goods, then in no way would He know privation and evil. For
        to the good that He is there is no contrary privation, since privation
        and its opposite bear on the same thing, and thus to that which is pure
        act no privation is opposed. And, consequently, neither is evil. Hence,
        granted that God knows only Himself, by knowing the good that He is He
        will not know evil. But because, in knowing Himself, He knows the beings
        that are by nature subject to privations, He must know the privations
        and the evils that are opposed to particular goods.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [15] We must likewise observe, as was shown above, that just as God in
        knowing Himself knows other things without any discursiveness of the
        intellect, so likewise it is not necessary that His knowledge be
        discursive if He knows the evil through the good. For the good is as the
        principle of the knowledge of what is evil. Hence, evils are known
        through goods as things are known through their definitions, not as
        conclusions are known through their principles.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [16] Nor, again, does it mean that there is imperfection in the divine
        knowledge if God knows evils through the privation of goods. For the
        position says that evil exists only in so far as it is the privation of
        good. Hence, in this way alone is it knowable, for each thing is
        knowable to the extent that it has being.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Having dealt with what concerns the knowledge of the divine
        intellect, it remains for us to deal with God’s will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] From the fact that God is endowed with intellect it follows that He
        is endowed with will. For, since the understood good is the proper
        object of the will, the understood good is, as such, willed. Now that
        which is understood is by reference to one who understands. Hence, he
        who grasps the good by his intellect is, as such, endowed with will. But
        God grasps the good by His intellect, For, since the activity of His
        intellect is perfect, as appears from what has been said, He understands
        being together with the qualification of the good. He is, therefore,
        endowed with will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Again, whoever possesses some form is related through that form to
        things in reality. For example, white wood is through its whiteness like
        some things and unlike other things. But in one understanding and
        sensing there is the form of the understood and sensed thing, since all
        knowledge is through some likeness. There must, therefore, be a relation
        of the one understanding and sensing to understood and sensed things
        according as these are in reality. But this is not because of the fact
        that these beings understand and sense, since thereby we rather find a
        relation of things to the one understanding and sensing; for to
        understand and to sense exist according as things are in the intellect
        and the sense, following the mode of each. He who senses and understands
        has a relation to the thing outside the soul through his will and
        appetite. Hence, all sensing and understanding beings have appetite and
        will. Properly speaking, however, the will is in the intellect. Since,
        then, God is intelligent, He must be endowed with will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Moreover, that which accompanies every being belongs to being
        inasmuch as it is in being. This accompaniment must be found in a
        supreme way in that which is the first being. Now, it belongs to every
        being to seek its perfection and the conservation of its being, and this
        in the case of each being according to its mode: for intellectual beings
        through will, for animals through sensible appetite, and to those
        lacking sense through natural appetite. To seek perfection belongs
        differently to those that have it and those that have it not. For those
        that have it not tend by desire, through the appetitive power proper to
        them, to acquire what is lacking to their desire, whereas those that
        have it rest in it. Hence, this cannot be lacking to the first being,
        which is God. Since, then, God is intelligent, there is in Him a will by
        which His being and His goodness are pleasing to Him.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Again, the more perfect understanding is, the more delightful it is
        to the one understanding, But God understands and His understanding is
        most perfect, as was shown above. Therefore, His understanding is most
        full of delight. But intelligible delight is through the will, as
        sensible delight is through the appetite of concupiscence. There is,
        therefore, will in God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Furthermore, a form considered by the intellect does not move or
        cause anything except through the will, whose object is the end and the
        good, by which someone is moved to act. Hence, the speculative intellect
        does not move, nor does the imagination alone without an act of the
        estimative power. But the form of the divine intellect is the cause of
        motion and being in other things, since God produces things by His
        intellect, as will be shown later on. Therefore, God must be endowed
        with will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Again, among moving powers in beings possessing an intellect, the
        first is found to be the will. For the will sets every power to its act:
        we understand because we will, we imagine because we will, and so with
        the rest. The will has this role because its object is the end; although
        it is also a fact that the intellect, though not in the manner of an
        efficient and moving cause, but in that of a final cause, moves the will
        by proposing to it its object, namely, the end. It therefore belongs
        supremely to the first mover to have a will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] Furthermore, “that is free which is for its own sake,” and thus the
        free has the nature of that which is through itself. Now, first and
        primarily, will has liberty in acting, for according as someone acts
        voluntarily he is said to perform any given action freely. To act
        through will, therefore, supremely befits the first agent, whom it
        supremely befits to act through himself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] Moreover, the end and the agent to the end are always found to be of
        one order in reality; and hence the proximate end that is proportioned
        to an agent falls into the same species as the agent both among natural
        things and artificial things. For the form of the art through which the
        artisan works is the species of the form that is in matter, which is the
        end of the artisan; and the form by which the generating fire acts is of
        the same species as the form of the generated fire, which is the end of
        generation. But nothing is co-ordered with God, as within the same
        order, except Himself; otherwise, there would be several first
        beings—whose contrary was proved above. He is therefore the first agent
        because of the end that He is Himself. He is therefore not only the
        appetible end, but also the seeker of Himself as the end, so to speak.
        And this He is with an intellectual appetite, since He is intelligent.
        This is will. There is, therefore, will in God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] The testimony of Sacred Scripture is witness to the divine will.
        For it is said in a Psalm (134:6): “Whatever the Lord pleased He has
        done.” And Romans (9:19): “Who resists His will?”

        [1] From this it appears that God’s will is not other than His essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] It belongs to God to be endowed with will in so far as He is
        intelligent, as has been shown. But God has understanding by His
        essence, as was proved above. So, therefore, does He have will. God’s
        will, therefore, is His very essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Again, as to understand is the perfection of the one understanding,
        so to will is the perfection of the one willing; for both are actions
        remaining in the agent and not going out (as does heat) to some
        receiving subject. But the understanding of God is His being, as was
        proved above. For, since the divine being is in itself most perfect, it
        admits of no superadded perfection, as was proved above. The divine
        willing also is, therefore, His being; and hence the will of God is His
        essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Moreover, since every agent acts in so far as it is in act, God, Who
        is pure act, must act through His essence. Willing, however, is a
        certain operation of God. Therefore, God must be endowed with will
        through His essence. Therefore, His will is His essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Furthermore, if will were something added to the divine substance,
        since the divine substance is something complete in being it would
        follow that will would be added to it as an accident to a subject, that
        the divine substance would be related to it as potency to act, and that
        there would be composition in God. All this was refuted above. Hence, it
        is not possible that the divine will be something added to the divine
        substance.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From this it further appears that the principal object of the divine
        will is the divine essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] The understood good is the object of the will, as has been said. But
        that which is principally understood by God is the divine essence, as
        was proved above. The divine essence, therefore, is principally the
        object of the divine will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Again, the appetible is to appetite as the mover to the moved, as
        was said above. Similar, too, is the relation of the object of the will
        to the will, since the will belongs to the class of appetitive powers.
        If, then, the principal object of the divine will be other than the
        divine essence, it will follow that there is something higher than the
        divine will moving it. The contrary of this is apparent from what has
        been said.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Moreover, the principal object willed is for each one willing the
        cause of his willing. For when we say, I will to walk in order to become
        healed, we are of the impression that we are assigning a cause. If,
        then, it be asked, why do you want to become healed? causes will be
        assigned one after the other until we arrive at the ultimate end. This
        is the principal object of the will, which is through itself the cause
        of willing. If, then, God should principally will something other than
        Himself, it will follow that something other is the cause of His
        willing. But His willing is His being, as has been shown.” Hence,
        something other will be the cause of His being—which is contrary to the
        nature of the first being.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Furthermore, for each being endowed with a will the principal object
        willed is the ultimate end. For the end is willed through itself, and
        through it other things become objects of will. But the ultimate end is
        God Himself, since He is the highest good, as has been shown. Therefore,
        God is the principal object of His will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Moreover, every power is proportioned with equality to its principal
        object, for the power of a thing is measured according to its objects,
        as may be seen through the Philosopher in <i>De caelo et mundo</i> [11],
        But the will is proportioned with equality to its principal object, and
        similarly the intellect and likewise the sense. Now, nothing is
        proportioned with equality to the divine will save only God’s essence.
        Therefore, the principal object of the divine will is the divine
        essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] But since the divine essence is God’s understanding and all else
        that is said to be in Him, it is further manifest that in the same way
        He principally wills Himself to understand, to will, to be one, and
        other such attributes.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Thereby it can be shown, however, that in willing Himself God also
        wills other things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] For to whom it belongs to win the end principally, to him it belongs
        to will the things that are ordered to the end for the sake of the end.
        Now, God Himself is the ultimate end of things, as appears somewhat from
        what has been said. Hence, because He wills Himself to be, He likewise
        wills other things, which are ordered to Him as to the end.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Again, everyone desires the perfection of that which is willed and
        loved by him for its own sake. For the things that we love for their own
        sake we want to be most perfect, and always to become better and be
        multiplied as much as possible. But God wills and loves His essence for
        its own sake. Now, the divine essence cannot be increased or multiplied
        in itself, as is manifest from what has been said; it can be multiplied
        solely according to its likeness, which is participated by many. God,
        therefore, wills the multitude of things in willing and loving His own
        essence and perfection.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Moreover, whoever loves something in itself and for its own sake
        consequently loves all the things in which it is found: for example, he
        who loves sweetness for itself must love all sweet things. But God wills
        and loves His own being in itself and for its own sake, as shown above.
        Every other being, however, is by way of likeness a certain
        participation of His being, as appears somewhat from what has been said.
        It remains, then, that God, in that He wills and loves Himself, wills
        and loves other things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Furthermore, in willing Himself God wills all that is in Him. But
        all things in a certain manner pre-exist in Him through their proper
        models, as was shown above. God, therefore, in willing Himself likewise
        wills other things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Then, again, the more perfect the power of a being, by so much does
        its causality extend to more, and more remote, things, as was said
        above. But the causality of the end consists in this, that other things
        are desired for its sake. The more perfect an end, therefore, and the
        more willed, by so much does the will of one willing the end extend to
        more things for the sake of that end. But the divine essence is most
        perfect as goodness and as end. It will, therefore, supremely diffuse
        its causality to many, so that many things may be willed for its sake;
        and especially so by God, Who wills the divine essence perfectly
        according to its power.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Moreover, will accompanies intellect. But by His intellect God
        principally understands Himself, and He understands other things in
        Himself. In the same way, therefore, He principally wills Himself, and
        wills all other things in willing Himself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] This is confirmed by the authority of Sacred Scripture. For it is
        said in Wisdom (11:25): “For You love all things that are, and hate none
        of the things which You have made.”

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From this result it follows that God wills Himself and other things
        by one act of will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2.] Every power is directed to its object and to the formal notion of
        the object by one operation or one act. For example, by the same sight
        we see light and color, which becomes visible in act through light. Now,
        when we will something solely for the sake of the end, that which is
        desired for the sake of the end derives the nature of something willed
        from the end; and thus the end is to it as the formal notion of the
        object is to the object, for example, as light is to color. Since, then,
        God wills other things for His own sake as for the sake of the end, as
        has been shown, He wills Himself and other things by one act of will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Moreover, what is perfectly known and desired is known and desired
        according to its whole power. But the power of the end is measured not
        only according as it is desired in itself, but also according as other
        things become desirable for its sake. Hence, whoever desires an end
        perfectly desires it in both ways. But there is no act of will in God by
        which He wills Himself and does not do so perfectly, since there is
        nothing imperfect in Him. Therefore, by whatever act God wills Himself,
        He wills Himself absolutely and other things for His sake. But He does
        not will things other than Himself except in so far as He wills Himself,
        as has been proved. It remains, then, that God does not will Himself and
        other things by different acts of will, but by one and the same act.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Furthermore, as appears from what has been said, discursiveness is
        found in the act of a cognitive power according as we know principles by
        themselves and from them we arrive at conclusions. For, if we saw
        conclusions in principles by knowing the principles themselves, there
        would be no discursiveness, as likewise there is not when we see
        something in a mirror. But as principles are to conclusions in
        speculative matters, so ends are to the things ordered to them in
        operative and appetitive matters; for, just as conclusions are known
        through principles, so the appetite and doing of the things ordered to
        the end proceed from the end. If, then, someone wills separately the end
        and the things ordered to the end, there will be a certain
        discursiveness in His will. But this cannot be in God, since He is
        outside all motion. It remains, then, that God wills Himself and other
        things together and in the same act of will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Again, since God wills Himself always, if He wills Himself and other
        things by different acts it will follow that there are at once two acts
        of will in Him. This is impossible, since one simple power does not have
        at once two operations.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Furthermore, in every act of the will the object willed is to the
        one willing as a mover to the moved. If, then, there be some action of
        the divine will, by which God wills things other than Himself, which is
        diverse from the action by which He wills Himself, there will be in Him
        some other mover of the divine will. This is impossible.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Moreover, God’s willing is His being, as has been proved. But in God
        there is only one being. Therefore, there is in Him only one willing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] Again, willing belongs to God according as He is intelligent.
        Therefore, just as by one act He understands Himself and other things,
        in so far as His essence is the exemplar of all things, so by one act He
        wills Himself and other things, in so far as His goodness is the
        likeness of all goodness.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From this it follows that the multitude of the objects of the will
        is not opposed to the unity and simplicity of the divine substance.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] For acts are distinguished according to their objects. If, then, the
        many objects that God wills caused a multitude in Him, it would follow
        that there was not in Him solely one operation of the will. This is
        against what has been proved above.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Again, it has been shown that God wills other things in so far as He
        wills His own goodness. Hence, other things are to His will in the
        manner in which they are comprehended by His goodness. But all things in
        His goodness are one, since other things are in Him according to His
        way, namely, “the material immaterially and the many unitedly,” as
        appears from what has been said. It remains, then, that the multitude of
        the objects of the will does not multiply the divine substance.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Moreover, the divine intellect and will are of an equal simplicity,
        for both are the divine substance, as has been proved. But the multitude
        of intellectual objects does not cause a multitude in the divine
        essence, nor a composition in the divine intellect. Neither, therefore,
        does a multitude of the objects of the will cause either a diversity in
        the divine essence or a composition in the divine will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Furthermore, there is this difference between knowledge and
        appetite, that knowledge takes place according as the known is in some
        way in the knower, whereas appetite does not take place in this way, but
        rather conversely, according as the appetite is related to the appetible
        thing, which the one pursuing seeks or in which be rests. And on this
        account good and evil, which have reference to appetite, are in things,
        whereas the true and the false, which have reference to knowledge, are
        in the mind, as the Philosopher says in <i>Metaphysics</i> VI [4]. Now,
        that something be related to many is not opposed to its simplicity,
        since unity itself is the principle of numerical multitude. Hence, the
        multitude of the objects willed by God is not opposed to His simplicity.

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From this it is likewise apparent that, for the purpose of
        conserving the divine simplicity, we should not say that God wills other
        goods in a certain general way, in so far as He wills Himself to be the
        principle of the goods that can come forth from Him, but that He does
        not will them in the particular.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] For to will implies a relationship of the one willing to the thing
        willed. But the divine simplicity does not forbid -its being related
        even to many particulars; for God is said to be something best and first
        in relation to singulars. Therefore, His simplicity does not forbid Him
        from willing things other than Himself in the concrete or the
        particular.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Again, the will of God is related to other things in so far as they
        participate in goodness in virtue of their order to the divine goodness,
        which is for God the reason of His willing. But not only the totality of
        goods, but even each one of them derives its goodness from the divine
        goodness, as well as its being. Therefore, the will of God extends to
        singular goods.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Moreover, according to the Philosopher, in <i>Metaphysics</i> XI
        [10], a twofold good of order is found in the universe: one according to
        which the whole universe is ordered to what is outside the universe, as
        the army is ordered to its general; the other according as the parts of
        the universe are ordered to one another, as are the parts of the army.
        Now, the second order is for the sake of the first. But God, from the
        fact of willing Himself as the end, wills other things that are ordered
        to Him as to the end, as has been proved. He therefore wills the good of
        the order that the whole universe has to Him, as well as the good of the
        order that the universe has in the mutual relations of its parts. But
        the good of an order arises from singular goods. Therefore, God also
        wills singular goods.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Furthermore, if God does not will the singular goods of which the
        universe is composed, it follows that in the universe the good that
        order is is by chance. For it is not possible that some part of the
        universe should bring together all the particular goods into the order
        of the universe; only the universal cause of the whole universe, God,
        Who acts through His will, as will later be shown, can do this. Now,
        that the order of the universe be by chance is impossible, since it
        would follow that the consequences of the order would all the more be by
        chance. It remains, then, that God wills even singulars among goods.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Again, the understood good, as such, is what is willed. But God
        understands even particular goods, as was proved above. He therefore
        wills even particular goods.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] This is confirmed by the authority of Scripture, which, in the first
        chapter of Genesis (1:4, 31), shows the pleasure of the divine will with
        each single work, in the words: “God saw the light that it was good,”
        and similarly of His other works, and then of all the works together:
        “And God saw all the things that He had made, and they were very good.”

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] If willing implies a relationship of the one willing to the thing
        willed, it can possibly seem to someone that God cannot will save only
        the things that are. For relatives ought to be together, and when one is
        destroyed so is the other, as the Philosopher teaches. If, then, willing
        implies the relationship of the one willing to the thing willed, no one
        can will save the things that are.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Furthermore, will is said in relation to the things that are willed,
        and similarly with cause and creator. But not even God can be called
        Creator, or Lord, or Father, save of the things that are. Therefore,
        neither can He be said to will save the things that are.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] From this it could be further concluded that, if the divine willing
        is unchangeable as is the divine being, and God does not will save the
        things that are in act, He wills nothing that does not always exist.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] To these difficulties some answer that the things that are not in
        themselves are in God and in His intellect. Hence, nothing prevents God
        from willing the things that do not exist in themselves in so far as
        they are in Him.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] But this does not seem to be a sufficient reply. For someone with a
        will is said to will something in so far as his will is related to the
        thing willed. If, then, the divine will is not related to the thing
        willed save only in so far as it exists in Him or in His intellect, it
        will follow that God does not will that thing except because He wills it
        to be in His being or in His intellect. But this is not the intention of
        those who bold the position; they intend that God wills such
        not-yet-existents to be even in themselves.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Again, if the will is related to the thing willed through its
        object, the understood good, and the intellect understands not only that
        the good exists in it but that it exists in its own nature, the will
        likewise is related to the thing willed not only as it is in the knower,
        but likewise as it is in itself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Let us therefore reply that, since the apprehended good moves the
        will, the act of will itself must follow the condition of apprehension;
        just as the motions of the other movers follow the conditions of the
        mover that is the cause of motion. But the relation of the apprehension
        to the thing apprehended follows upon the apprehension itself, because
        one who apprehends is related to the apprehended thing in that he
        apprehends it. Now, he who apprehends does not apprehend a thing solely
        as it is in him, but as it is in its own nature; for not only do we know
        that a thing is understood by us because it is in the intellect, but we
        know also that it exists or has existed or will exist in its own nature.
        Therefore, although at that moment the thing does not exist save only in
        the intellect, the relation following upon the apprehension is to the
        thing, not as it exists in the knower, but as it is in its own nature,
        which the one apprehending apprehends.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] The relation of the divine will, therefore, is to the non-existing
        thing according as it exists in its proper nature at a certain time, and
        not only according as it is in God knowing it. The thing that does not
        now exist God wills to be at a certain time; He does not will solely the
        fact that He understands it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] The relations of the one willing to the thing willed, of creator to
        created, and of maker to thing made, or of Lord to His subject creature,
        are not similar. For willing is an action remaining in the one willing,
        and hence does not require that something existing outside the will be
        understood. But to make, to create, and to govern signify an action
        terminating in an exterior effect, without whose existence such an
        action cannot be understood.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From what was shown above it follows that God wills His own being
        and His own goodness in a necessary way, and cannot will the contrary.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] For it was shown above that God wills His own being and His own
        goodness as His principal object, which is for Him the reason for
        willing other things. In everything willed, therefore, God wills His own
        being and His own goodness, just as the sight in every color sees light.
        But it is impossible for God not to will something in act, for He would
        be willing only in potency, which is impossible, since His willing is
        His being. It is therefore necessary that God will His own being and His
        own goodness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Again, every being endowed with will necessarily wills his own
        ultimate end: for example, man necessarily wills his own beatitude and
        cannot will misery. But God wills Himself to be as the ultimate end, as
        appears from what has been said. Therefore, He necessarily wills Himself
        to be, nor can He will Himself not to be.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Moreover, in appetitive and operative matters the end functions as
        an indemonstrable principle does in speculative matters. For just as in
        speculative matters the conclusions are reached from principles, so in
        active and appetitive matters the principle of all the things to be done
        and sought is taken from the end. But in speculative matters the
        intellect necessarily assents to the first and indemonstrable
        principles, and can in no way assent to their contraries. Therefore, the
        will necessarily inheres to the ultimate end, so as to be unable to will
        the contrary. Thus, if the divine will has no end other than itself, it
        necessarily wills itself to be.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Again, all things in so far as they are, are likened to God Who is
        primarily and supremely being. But all things, in so far as they are, in
        their own way naturally love their own being. All the more, then, does
        God naturally love His own being. But His nature is a being necessary
        through itself, as was shown above. Therefore, God of necessity wills
        Himself to be.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Furthermore, every perfection and goodness found in creatures is
        proper to God in an essential way, as was proved above. But to love God
        is the highest perfection of the rational creature, since thereby it is
        somehow united to God. Therefore, this love is found in God in an
        essential way. Therefore, of necessity God loves Himself. And thus He
        wills Himself to be.

        [1] But, if the divine will of necessity wills the divine goodness and
        the divine being, it might seem to someone that it wills of necessity
        other things as well, since God wills all other things in willing His
        own goodness, as was proved above. Nevertheless, if we consider the
        matter correctly, it appears that He does not will other things
        necessarily.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] For God wills other things as ordered to the end of His goodness.
        But the will is not directed to what is for the sake of the end if the
        end can be without it. For, on the basis of his intention to heal, a
        doctor does not necessarily have to give to a sick person the medicine
        without which the sick person can nevertheless be healed. Since, then,
        the divine goodness can be without other things, and, indeed, is in no
        way increased by other things, it is under no necessity to will other
        things from the fact of willing its own goodness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Furthermore, since the understood good is the object of the will,
        the will can will anything conceived by the intellect in which the
        nature of the good is present. Hence, although the being of any given
        thing is as such a good and its non-being an evil, the non-being of
        something can fall under the will (though not by necessity) because of
        some adjoined good that is preserved; since it is a good that something
        be, even though something else does not exist. Therefore, according to
        its own nature, the will cannot not will that good whose non-existence
        causes the nature of the good entirely to be lost. But there is no such
        good apart from God. According to its nature, therefore, the will can
        will the non-existence of anything whatever apart from God. But in God
        will is present according to its whole range, since all things in Him
        are universally perfect. God, therefore, can will the non-existence of
        anything whatever apart from Himself. Hence, it is not of necessity that
        things other than Himself exist.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Moreover, God, in willing His own goodness, wills things other than
        Himself to be in so far as they participate in His goodness. But, since
        the divine goodness is infinite, it can be participated in infinite
        ways, and in ways other than it is participated in by the creatures that
        now exist. if, then, as a result of willing His own goodness, God
        necessarily willed the things that participate in it, it would follow
        that He would will the existence of an infinity of creatures
        participating in His goodness in an infinity of ways. This is patently
        false, because, if He willed them, they would be, since His will is the
        principle of being for things, as will be shown later on. Therefore, God
        does not necessarily will even the things that now exist.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Again, the will of a wise man, by the fact of dealing with a cause,
        deals also with the effect that necessarily follows from the cause. For
        it would be foolish to wish the sun to be overhead and yet that it
        should not be daylight. But, as to an effect that does not follow of
        necessity from a cause, it is not necessary that someone will it because
        he wills the cause. Now, other things proceed from God Without
        necessity, as will be shown later on. It is not necessary, therefore,
        that God will other things from the fact of willing Himself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Moreover, things proceed from God as artifacts from an artisan, as
        will be shown later on. But, although the artisan wishes to have the
        art, he does not necessarily wish to produce the artifacts. Neither,
        therefore, does God necessarily will that there be things other than
        Himself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] We must therefore consider why it is that God necessarily knows
        things other than Himself, but does not necessarily will them, even
        though from the fact that He understands and wills Himself He
        understands and wills other things. The reason is as follows. That he
        who understands should understand something arises from the fact that he
        is disposed in a certain way, since something is understood in act in so
        far as its likeness is in the one understanding. But that he who wills
        should will something arises from the fact that what is willed is
        disposed in a certain way. For we will something either because it is
        the end or because it is ordered to the end. Now, that all things be in
        God, so that they can be understood in Him, is necessarily required by
        the divine perfection; but the divine goodness does not necessarily
        require that other things exist, which are ordered to it as to the end.
        That is why it is necessary that God know other things, but not
        necessary that He will them. Hence, neither does God will all the things
        that can have an order to His goodness; but He knows all things that
        have any order whatever to His essence, by which He understands.

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Awkward consequences seem to follow if God does not will necessarily
        the things that He wills.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] For, if with respect to certain objects the will of God is not
        determined to them, it would seem to be disposed to opposites. But every
        power that is disposed to opposites is in a manner in potency, since “to
        opposites” is a species of the contingent possible. Therefore, there is
        potency in the will of God, which will consequently not be the substance
        of God, in which there is no potency, as was shown above.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] If being in potency, as such, is of a nature to be moved, because
        what can be can not-be, it follows that the divine will is changeable.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Furthermore, if it is natural to God to will something about His
        effects, it is necessary. Now there can be nothing unnatural in God,
        since there cannot be anything accidental or violent in Him, as was
        proved above.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Again, if what is open to opposites, being indifferently disposed,
        tends no more to one thing than to another unless it be determined by
        another, it is necessary either that God will none of the things towards
        which He is disposed to opposites, of which the contrary was proved
        above, or that God be determined to one effect by another. Thus, there
        will be something prior to Him, determining Him to one effect.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] But of these conclusions none necessarily follows. For to be open to
        opposites belongs to a certain power in a twofold way: in one way, from
        the side of itself; in another way, from the side of its object. From
        the side of itself, when it has not yet achieved its perfection, through
        which it is determined to one effect. This openness redounds to the
        imperfection of a power, and potentiality is shown to be in it; as
        appears in the case of an intellect in doubt, which has yet not acquired
        the principles from which to be determined to one alternative. From the
        side of its object, a certain power is found open to opposites when the
        perfect operation of the power depends on neither alternative, though
        both can be. An example is an art which can use diverse instruments to
        perform the same work equally well. This openness does not pertain to
        the imperfection of a power, but rather to its eminence, in so far as it
        dominates both alternatives, and thereby is determined to neither, being
        open to both. This is bow the divine will is disposed in relation to
        things other than itself. For its end depends on none of the other
        things, though it itself is most perfectly united to its end. Hence, it
        is not required that any potentiality be posited in the divine will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Mutability, similarly, is not required- For, if there is no
        potentiality in the divine will, God does not thus prefer one of the
        opposites among His effects as if He should be thought as being in
        potency to both, so that He first wills both in potency and afterward He
        wills in act; rather, He wills in act whatever He wills, not only in
        relation to Himself but also in relation to His effects. The reason
        rather is because the object willed does not have a necessary order to
        the divine goodness, which is the proper object of the divine will; just
        as we call enunciables, not necessary, but possible when there is not a
        necessary order of the predicate to the subject. Hence, when it is said,
        God wills this effect, it is manifest that it is not a necessary
        enunciable but a possible one, not in the sense in which something is
        said to be possible according to some power, but in the sense in which
        the possible is that whose existence is neither necessary nor
        impossible, as the Philosopher teaches in <i>Metaphysics</i> V [12]. For
        example, for a triangle to have two equal sides is a possible
        enunciable, but not according to some power, since in mathematics there
        is neither power nor motion. The exclusion of the aforesaid necessity,
        therefore, does not take away the immutability of the divine will. This
        Sacred Scripture professes: “But the triumpher in Israel will not spare,
        and will not be moved to repentance” (1 Samuel 15:29).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] However, although the divine will is not determined to its effects,
        we yet cannot say that it wills none of them, or that in order to will
        one of them it is determined by an exterior agent. For, since the
        apprehended good determines the will as its proper object, and the
        divine intellect is not outside God’s will, because both are His
        essence, if God’s will is determined to will something through the
        knowledge of His intellect, this determination of the divine will will
        not be due to something extraneous. For the divine intellect apprehends
        not only the divine being, which is God’s goodness, but also other
        goods, as was shown above. These goods it apprehends as certain
        likenesses of the divine goodness and essence, not as its principles.
        And thus, the divine will tends to them as befitting its goodness, not
        as necessary to it. The same thing happens in the case of our own will.
        When it is inclined to something as absolutely necessary to the end, it
        is moved to it with a certain necessity; but when it tends to something
        only because of a certain befittingness, it tends to it without
        necessity. Hence, neither does the divine will tend to its effects in a
        necessary way.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] Nor, furthermore, is it necessary because of the foregoing to posit
        something unnatural in God. For His will wills itself and other things
        by one and the same act. But its relation to itself is necessary and
        natural, whereas its relation to other things is according to a certain
        befittingness, not indeed necessary and natural, nor violent and
        unnatural, but voluntary; for the voluntary need be neither natural nor
        violent.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From this we may infer that, although among His effects God wills
        nothing with absolute necessity, yet He does will something with the
        necessity of supposition.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] For it has been shown that the divine will is immutable. Now, if
        something is found in any immutable being, it cannot afterwards not be;
        for we say that a thing has moved if it is otherwise disposed now than
        it was previously. If, then, the divine will is immutable, assuming that
        it wills something, God must by supposition will this thing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Again, everything eternal is necessary. Now, that God should will
        some effect to be is eternal, for, like His being, so, too, His willing
        is measured by eternity, and is therefore necessary. But it is not
        necessary considered absolutely, because the will of God does not have a
        necessary relation to this willed object. Therefore, it is necessary by
        supposition.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Furthermore, whatever God could He can, for His power is not
        decreased, as neither is His essence. But He cannot now not will what He
        is posited as having willed, because His will cannot be changed.
        Therefore, at no time could He not will what He has willed. It is
        therefore necessary by supposition that He willed whatever He willed,
        and also that He wills it; neither, however, is absolutely necessary,
        but, rather, possible in the aforementioned way.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Moreover, whoever wills something, necessarily wills whatever it
        necessarily required for it, unless there be a defect in him either
        because of ignorance or because he is led astray through passion from
        the right choice of that which leads to the intended end. This cannot be
        said of God. If God, then, in willing Himself wills something other than
        Himself, it is necessary that He will for this object whatever is
        necessarily required by it. Thus, it is necessary that God will the
        rational soul to exist supposing that He wills man to exist.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From this it appears that the will of God cannot be of the things
        that are impossible in themselves.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        For these have a contradiction in themselves, for example, that man is
        an ass, in which the rational and the irrational are included. For what
        is incompatible with something excludes some of the things that are
        necessary to it, as to be an ass excludes man’s reason. If, then, God
        necessarily wills the things that are required for what He wills by
        supposition, it is impossible for Him to will what is incompatible with
        these things. Thus, it is impossible for God to will the absolutely
        impossible.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Again, as was shown above, in willing His own being, which is His
        own goodness, God wills all other things in so far as they bear His
        likeness. But in so far as a thing is opposed to the nature of being as
        such, there cannot be preserved in it the likeness of the first being,
        namely, the divine being, which is the source of being. Hence, God
        cannot will something that is opposed to the nature of being as such.
        But just as it is opposed to the nature of man as man to be irrational,
        so it is opposed to the nature of being as such that something be at
        once being and nonbeing. God, therefore, cannot will that affirmation
        and negation be true together. But this is included in everything that
        is of itself impossible, which has an opposition with itself as implying
        a contradiction. The will of God, therefore, cannot be of that which is
        of itself impossible.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Moreover, the will is only of the understood good. Hence, whatever
        cannot be the object of the intellect is not an object of the will. But
        that which is of itself impossible is not an object of the intellect,
        since it is self-contradictory, except, of course, through the fault of
        one who does not understand what belongs to things—which cannot be said
        of God. Therefore, that which is of itself impossible cannot be the
        object of the will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Furthermore, as a thing is disposed toward being, so it is disposed
        toward goodness. But the impossible is that which cannot be. Therefore,
        it cannot be good, and hence cannot be willed by God, Who does not will
        save only the things that are or can be good.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From what has been said it results that the divine will does not
        remove contingency from things, nor does it impose absolute necessity on
        things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] God wills whatever is required for a thing that He wills, as has
        been said. But it befits certain things, according to the mode of their
        nature, that they be contingent and not necessary. Therefore, God wills
        that some things be contingent. Now, the efficacy of the divine will
        requires not only that something be that God wills to be, but also that
        it be as He wills it to be. For, among natural agents as well, when the
        acting power is strong it assimilates its effect to itself not only as
        to species but also as to the accidents, which are certain modes of that
        thing. Therefore, the efficacy of the divine will does not remove
        contingency.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Moreover, God wills the good of the universe of His effects more
        principally than He does any particular good, according as a fuller
        likeness of His goodness is found in it. But the completeness of the
        universe requires that there be some contingent things; otherwise, not
        all grades of beings would be contained in the universe. Therefore, God
        wills that there be some contingent things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Furthermore, the good of the universe is seen in a certain order, as
        appears in <i>Metaphysics</i> XI [10]. But the order of the universe
        requires that there be some changeable causes, since bodies are part of
        the perfection of the universe, and they do not move unless they be
        moved. Now, contingent effects follow from a changeable cause, for an
        effect cannot have a more stable being than its cause. Hence we see
        that, even though the remote cause is necessary, provided the proximate
        cause is contingent, the effect is contingent, as may be seen in the
        things that happen among sublunary bodies, which are contingent because
        of the contingency of the proximate causes even though the remote
        causes, which are the heavenly motions, are necessary. God, therefore,
        wills something to come to pass contingently.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] The necessity of supposition in the cause, moreover, does not
        require an absolute necessity in the effect. But God wills something in
        the creature, not by absolute necessity, but only by a necessity of
        supposition, as was shown above. From the divine will, therefore, an
        absolute necessity in created things cannot be inferred. But only this
        excludes contingency, for even the contingents open to opposites are
        made necessary by supposition: for example, that Socrates be moved, if
        he runs, is necessary. Therefore, the divine will does not exclude
        contingency from the things it wills.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Hence, it does not follow, if God wills something, that it will of
        necessity take place. But this conditional is true and necessary: If God
        wills something, it will be. But the consequent does not have to be

          >THAT A REASON CAN BE ASSIGNED TO THE DIVINE WILL</span
        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From what has been said we can infer that a reason can be assigned
        to the divine will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] The end is the reason for willing the things that are for the sake
        of the end. But God wills His own goodness as the end, and other things
        He wills as things that are for the sake of the end. His goodness,
        therefore, is the reason why He wills the other things which are
        different from Himself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Again, a particular good is ordered to the good of the whole as to
        its end, as the imperfect to the perfect. Now, some things fall under
        the divine will according to their disposition in the order of the good.
        It remains, then, that the good of the universe is the reason why God
        wills each particular good in the universe.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Again, as was shown above, on the supposition that God wills
        something, it follows necessarily that He wills the things required for
        it. But that which imposes necessity on another is the reason why that
        other exists. Therefore, the reason why God wills the things that are
        required for each thing is that that thing be for which they are
        required.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Thus, therefore, can we proceed in assigning the reason of the
        divine will. God wills man to have a reason in order that man be; He
        wills man to be so that the universe may be complete; and He wills that
        the good of the universe be because it befits His goodness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] However, this threefold reason does not proceed according to the
        same relationship. For the divine goodness neither depends on the
        perfection of the universe nor is anything added to it from this
        perfection. For, although the perfection of the universe necessarily
        depends on certain particular goods that are its essential parts, yet on
        some of them it does not depend of necessity, but nevertheless a certain
        goodness or adornment accrues to the universe from them, as from those
        things that exist only for the support or adornment of the other parts
        of the universe. A particular good depends necessarily on the things
        that are absolutely required for it, even though this too has certain
        things that are for its embellishment. Hence, at times the reason of the
        divine will contains only a befittingness; at other times, usefulness;
        at still other times, a necessity of supposition; but a necessity that
        is absolute only when it wills itself.

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Now, although a certain reason of the divine will can be assigned,
        it does not follow that anything is the cause of the divine will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] For to the will the cause of its willing is the end. But the end of
        the divine will is its goodness. Hence, it is the cause of God’s
        willing, just as it is also His act of will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] As to the other objects willed by God, none is the cause of willing
        for God. But one of them is the cause for the other to have an order to
        the divine goodness. And thus God is understood to will one of them for
        the sake of another.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] It is nevertheless manifest that no discursiveness is to be posited
        in the divine will. For where there is one act that is no
        discursiveness, as was shown above in connection with the intellect. But
        by means of one act God wills His goodness and all other things, since
        His action is His essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Through the foregoing is set aside the error of certain persons who
        said that all things proceed from God according to His simple will,
        which means that we are not to give an explanation of anything except
        that God wills it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] This view is likewise opposed to Sacred Scripture, which proclaims
        that God made all things according to the order of His wisdom, as is
        said in the Psalm (103:24): “You made all things in wisdom.” And in
        Sirach (1:10) it is said that God “poured” His wisdom “out upon all His
        works.”

        <span style="font-weight: bold">THAT IN GOD THERE IS FREE CHOICE</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From what has been said it can be shown that free choice is found in
        God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Free choice is said in relation to the things that one wills, not of
        necessity, but of his own accord. Thus, there is in us free choice in
        relation to our willing to run or to walk. But God wills things other
        than Himself without necessity, as was shown above. Therefore, to have
        free choice befits God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Again, towards the things to which it is not determined by nature
        the divine will is in a manner inclined through its intellect, as was
        shown above. But on this account is man said to have free choice as
        opposed to the other animals because he is inclined to willing by the
        judgment of the reason and not by the impulse of nature, as are the
        brutes. Therefore, in God there is free choice.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Furthermore, according to the Philosopher in <i>Ethics</i> III [5],
        “will is of the end, but election is of that which is for the sake of
        the end.” Since, then, God wills Himself as the end, and other things as
        what is for the sake of the end, it follows that with reference to
        Himself God has only will, but with reference to other things He has
        election. But election is made by choice. Therefore, free choice befits
        God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Moreover, because he has free choice, man is said to be master of
        his acts. But this supremely befits the first agent, whose act does not
        depend on another. Therefore, God has free choice.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] This can likewise be gathered from the very meaning of the name. For
        “that is free which is for its own sake,” according to the Philosopher
        in the beginning of the <i>Metaphysics</i> [I, 2]. But this befits no
        being more than the first cause, God.

          >THAT IN GOD THERE ARE NOT THE PASSIONS OF THE APPETITES</span
        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From what has preceded we can know that the passions of the
        appetites are not in God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Now, according to intellective appetite there is no passion, but
        only according to sensitive appetite, as is proved in <i>Physics</i> VII
        [3]. But no such appetite can be in God, since He does not have
        sensitive knowledge, as is manifest from what has been said above.
        Therefore, there is no passion of the appetite in God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Moreover, every passion of the appetite takes place through some
        bodily change, for example, the contraction or distension of the heart,
        or something of the sort. Now, none of this can take place in God, since
        He is not a body or a power in a body, as was shown above. There is,
        therefore, no passion of the appetite in Him.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Again, in every passion of the appetite the patient is somehow drawn
        out of his usual, calm, or connatural disposition. A sign of this is
        that such passions, if intensified, bring death to animals. But it is
        not possible for God to be somehow drawn outside His natural condition,
        since He is absolutely immutable, as has been shown. It appears, then,
        that such passions cannot be found in God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Moreover, every affection arising from a passion is directed
        determinately to one thing according to the manner and measure of the
        passion. For passion has an impulse to something one, as does nature,
        and on this account it must be curbed and regulated by reason. But the
        divine will is not determined in itself to something one among
        creatures, except out of the order of its wisdom, as was shown above.
        Therefore, there is no passion of the appetite in God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Furthermore, every passion belongs to something existing in potency.
        But God is completely free from potency, since He is pure act. God,
        therefore, is solely agent, and in no way does any passion have a place
        in Him.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Thus, therefore, by reason of its genus, passion is excluded in God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] Some passions, however, are excluded from God not only by reason of
        their genus, but also by reason of their species. For every passion is
        specified by its object. That passion, therefore, whose subject is
        absolutely unbefitting to God is removed from God even according to the
        nature of its proper species.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] Such a passion, however, is sorrow or pain, for its subject is the
        already present evil, just as the object of joy is the good present and
        possessed. Sorrow and pain, therefore, of their very nature cannot be
        found in God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] Furthermore, the notion of the object of a given passion is derived
        not only from good and evil, but also from the fact that one is disposed
        in a certain way towards one of them. For it is thus that hope and joy
        differ. If, then, the mode itself in which one is disposed toward the
        object that is included in the notion of passion is not befitting to
        God, neither can the passion itself befit Him, even through the nature
        of its proper species. Now, although hope has as its object something
        good, yet it is not a good already possessed, but one to be possessed.
        This cannot befit God, because of His perfection, which is so great that
        nothing can be added to it. Hope, therefore, cannot be found in God,
        even by reason of its species. And likewise, neither can the. desire of
        something not possessed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] Moreover, just as the divine perfection excludes from God the
        potency of the addition of some good to be obtained, so likewise, and
        all the more, does it exclude the potency to evil. Fear has reference to
        the evil that can threaten, as hope has reference to a good to be
        obtained. By a twofold reason of its species, therefore, is fear
        excluded from God: both because it belongs only to one existing in
        potency and because it has for its object a threatening evil.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [12] Again, repentance implies a change of affection. Therefore, the
        nature of repentance likewise is repugnant to God, not only because it
        is a species of sadness, but also because it implies a change of will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [13] Furthermore, without an error of the cognitive power it is
        impossible that what is good be apprehended as evil. Nor is it possible
        that the evil of one be the good of another, except among particular
        goods in which “the corruption of one is the generation of another.” But
        the universal good does not lose anything because of the existence of
        some particular good, but is rather mirrored by each one. God, however,
        is the universal good, and by participating in His likeness all things
        are called good. The evil of no thing, therefore, can be His good. Nor
        is it possible that what is absolutely good, and is not evil to itself,
        He should apprehend as something evil; for His knowledge is without
        error, as has been shown. Envy, therefore, cannot be found in God, even
        according to the nature of its species, not only because it is a species
        of sadness, but also because it is saddened by the good of another and
        thus takes his good as its own evil.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [14] Moreover, to be saddened over a good and to seek evil are of the
        same nature, for the first arises because the good is judged to be evil,
        while the second arises because evil is judged to be good. Anger is the
        appetite of another’s evil for the sake of revenge. Anger, therefore, is
        far from God according to the nature of its species, not only because it
        is an effect of sadness, but likewise because it is an appetite for
        revenge arising from sadness due to an injury received.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [15] Again, whatever other passions are species of these or are caused
        by them, are for the same reason removed from God.

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] There are certain passions which, though they do not befit God as
        passions, do not signify anything by the nature of their species that is
        repugnant to the divine perfection.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Among these passions are joy and delight. Delight is of a present
        good. Neither, therefore, by reason of its object, which is a good, nor
        by reason of its disposition towards its object, which is possessed in
        act, is joy, according to the nature of its species, repugnant to the
        divine perfection.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] From this it is manifest that joy or delight is properly in God. For
        just as the apprehended good and evil are the object of sensible
        appetite, so, too, are they of intellective appetite. It belongs to both
        to seek good and avoid evil, whether truly or by estimation. There is
        the difference that the object of intellective appetite is more common
        than that of the sensitive appetite, because intellective appetite has
        reference to good and evil absolutely, whereas sensitive appetite has
        reference to good or evil according to the sense. So, too, the object of
        the intellect is more common than that of the sense. But the operations
        of appetite derive their species from their objects. Hence, there are
        found in intellective appetite, which is the will, operations that in
        the nature of their species are similar to the operations of the
        sensitive appetite, differing in that in the sensitive appetite there
        are passions because of its union to a bodily organ, whereas in the
        intellective appetite there are simple operations; for just as through
        the passion of fear, which resides in the sensitive appetite, someone
        flees a future evil, so without passion the intellective appetite does
        the same thing. Since, then, joy and delight are not repugnant to God
        according to their species, but only in so far as they are passions, and
        since they are found in the will according to their species but not as
        passions, it remains that they are not lacking even to the divine will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Again, joy and delight are a certain resting of the will in its
        object. But God, Who is His own principal object willed, is supremely at
        rest in Himself, as containing all abundance in Himself. God, therefore,
        through His will supremely rejoices in Himself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Furthermore, delight is a certain perfection of operation, as
        appears from the Philosopher in Ethics X [4]; “for it perfects
        operation, as does beauty youth.” But God has the most perfect operation
        in understanding, as appears from what has been said. If, then, our
        understanding is delightful because of its perfection, the divine
        understanding will be most full of delight.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Moreover, each thing takes joy in its like as in something
        agreeable, except by accident in so far as it may interfere with one’s
        own advantage: for example, “potters quarrel among themselves” because
        one interferes with the profit of the other. Now, every good is a
        likeness of the divine good, as was said above, nor does God lose any
        good because of some good. It remains, then, that God takes joy in every
        good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] joy and delight, then, are properly in God. Now, joy and delight
        differ in notion. For delight arises from a really conjoined good,
        whereas joy does not require this, but the resting of the will in the
        object willed suffices for the nature of joy. Hence, delight is only of
        the conjoined good if it be taken properly, whereas joy is of a
        non-conjoined good. From this it is apparent that God properly delights
        in Himself, but He takes joy both in Himself and in other things.

        [1] In the same way, there must be love in God according to the act of
        His will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] For this belongs properly to the nature of love, that the lover will
        the good of the one he loves. Now, God wills His own good and that of
        others, as appears from what has been said. This means, therefore, that
        God loves Himself and other things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Again, for true love it is required that we will someone’s good as
        his good. For if we will someone’s good only in so far as it leads to
        the good of another, we love this someone by accident, just as he who
        wishes to store wine in order to drink it or loves a man so that this
        man may be useful or enjoyable to him, loves the wine or the man by
        accident, but essentially he loves himself. But God wills the good of
        each thing according as it is the good of each thing; for He wills each
        thing to be according as it is in itself good (although He likewise
        orders one thing to another’s use). God, then, truly loves Himself and
        other things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Moreover, since each thing in its own way wills and seeks its proper
        good, if it is the nature of love that the lover will and seek the good
        of the one he loves, it follows that the lover is to the loved as to
        that which in some way is one with him. From this the proper nature of
        love is seen to consist in this, that the affection of the one tends to
        the other as to someone who is somehow one with him. On this account it
        is said by Dionysius that love is a “unitive power” [
        <i>De div. nom.</i> IV, 13]. Therefore, the more that through which the
        lover is one with the one he loves is greater, the more is the love
        intense. For we love those whom the origin of birth joins to us, or the
        way of life, or something of the sort, more than those whom the
        community of human nature alone joins to us. Again, the more the source
        of the union is intimate to the lover, by so much the stronger becomes
        the love. Hence, at times, the love arising from some passion becomes
        more intense than the love that is of natural origin or from some habit;
        but it passes more easily. But the source whence all things are joined
        to God, namely, His goodness, which all things imitate, is what is
        supreme and most intimate in God, since it is His goodness. There is,
        therefore, in God not only a true love, but also a most perfect and a
        most enduring love.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Again, from the side of its object love does not signify anything
        repugnant to God, since its object is the good; neither does it from the
        mode of its disposition towards its object. For we love some thing, not
        less, but more when we have it, because a good is closer to us when we
        have it. So, too, a motion to an end among natural things becomes
        intensified from the nearness of the end. (The contrary sometimes
        happens by accident, namely, when in the one we love we experience
        something repugnant to love; then the object loved is loved less when it
        is gained.) Hence, love is not repugnant to the divine perfection
        according to the nature of its species. Therefore, it is found in God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Moreover, it belongs to love to move towards union, as Dionysius
        says. For since, because of a likeness or congeniality between the lover
        and the one he loves, the affection of the lover is in a manner united
        to the one loved, his appetite tends to the perfection of the union, so
        that, namely, the union that has already begun in affection may be
        completed in act. Hence, it is also the privilege of friends to take joy
        in one another’s presence, in living together, and in conversation. But
        God moves all things to union, for in so far as He gives them being and
        other perfections, He joins them to Himself in the manner in which this
        is possible. God, therefore, loves Himself and other things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Again, the principle of every affection is love. For joy and desire
        are only of a good that is loved, and fear and sadness are only of an
        evil that is opposed to the good that is loved; and from these all the
        other affections take their origin. But in God there is joy and delight,
        as was shown above. Therefore, in God there is love.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] Now, it might seem to someone that God does not love this thing more
        than that. For, if increase or decrease in intensity properly belongs to
        a changeable nature, it cannot befit God, from whom all mutability is
        absent.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] Again, none of the other things that are said of God in terms of
        operation are said of Him according to more and less; for neither does
        He know one thing more than another, nor does He take more joy over this
        thing than over that.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] We must therefore observe that, although the other operations of
        the soul deal with only one object, love alone seems to be directed to
        two objects. For by the fact that we understand and rejoice, we must be
        somehow related to some object. Love, however, wills something for
        someone, for we are said to love the thing to which we wish some good,
        as explained above. Hence, the things that we want, absolutely and
        properly we are said to desire, but not to love; rather, we love
        ourselves for whom we want those things: whence it is by accident and
        improperly that such things are said to be loved. Now, then, the other
        operations are susceptible of more and less only according to the vigor
        of the action. This cannot take place in God. For the vigor of an action
        is measured according to the power by which it is done, and every divine
        action belongs to one and the same power. On the other hand, love is
        said according to more and less in a twofold way. In one way, from the
        good that we will to someone, and according to this we are said to love
        him more to whom we will the greater good. In a second way, from the
        vigor of the action, and in this way we are said to love him more to
        whom we will with greater fervor and efficacity, though not a greater
        good, yet an equal good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] In the first way, nothing prevents us from saying that God loves
        one thing more than another, according as He wills it a greater good. In
        the second way, this cannot be said, for the same reason that was given
        in the case of the other operations.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [12] It is therefore apparent from what has been said that, from among
        our affections, there is none that can properly exist in God save only
        joy and love; although even these are not in God as passions, as they
        are in us.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [13] That there are joy and delight in God is confirmed by the authority
        of Sacred Scripture. For it is said in a Psalm (15:11): “At Your right
        hand there are delights even to the ends.” In the Proverbs (8:30),
        divine Wisdom, which is God, as we have shown, says: “I... was delighted
        every day playing before Him at all times.” And Luke (15:10): “There is
        joy in heaven before the angels of God upon one sinner doing penance.”
        The Philosopher likewise says in <i>Ethics</i> VII [14] that “God ever
        rejoices with one simple delight.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [14] Sacred Scripture likewise records the love of God: “He hath loved
        the people” (Deut. 33:3); “I have loved you with an everlasting love”
        (Jer. 31:3); “For the Father Himself loves you” (John 16:27). Certain
        philosophers likewise made God’s love to be the principle of things.
        With this view the words of Dionysius agree when he says that “the
        divine love did not allow Him to be without offspring” [
        <i>De div. nom.</i> IV, 11].
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [15] It must be noted, however, that the other affections, which in
        their species are repugnant to the divine perfection, are also said of
        God in Sacred Scripture, not indeed properly, as has been proved, but
        metaphorically, because of a likeness either in effects or in some
        preceding affection.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [16] I say of effects because the will at times, following the order of
        wisdom, tends to that effect to which someone is inclined because of a
        defective passion; for a judge punishes from justice, as the angry man
        punishes from anger. Hence, God is at times called angry in so far as,
        following the order of His wisdom, He wills to punish someone, according
        to a Psalm (2:13): “When His wrath shall be kindled in a short time.” On
        the other hand, God is called merciful in so far as out of His
        loving-kindness He takes away the miseries of men, just as we do the
        same thing through the passion of mercy. Hence the Psalm (102:8): “The
        Lord is compassionate and merciful: longsuffering and plenteous in
        mercy.” Sometimes, too, God is said to repent in so far as according to
        the eternal and immutable order of His providence He makes what He
        previously had destroyed, or destroys what He had previously had made—as
        those who are moved by repentance are found doing. Hence Genesis (6:7):
        “I repent that I have made man.” That this cannot be taken at the letter
        appears from what is said in 1 Samuel (15:29): “But the triumpher in
        Israel will not spare, and will not be moved to repentance.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [17] And I say in some preceding affection since love and joy, which are
        properly in God, are the principles of the other affections, love in the
        manner of a moving principle and joy in the manner of an end. Hence,
        those likewise who punish in anger rejoice as having gained their end.
        God, then, is said to be saddened in so far as certain things take place
        that are contrary to what He loves and approves; just as we experience
        sadness over things that have taken place against our will. This is
        apparent in Isaiah (59:15-16): God “saw, and it appeared evil in His
        eyes, because there is no judgment. And He saw that there is not a man,
        and He stood astonished, because there is none to oppose Himself.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [18] Now, what we have said sets aside the error of certain Jews who
        attributed anger, sadness, repentance, and all such passions in their
        proper sense to God, failing to distinguish what in Sacred Scripture is
        said properly and what metaphorically.

          >HOW VIRTUES MAY BE HELD TO BE IN GOD</span
        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Following what has been said, it remains to show how virtues may be
        posited in God. For just as God’s being is universally perfect,
        containing in itself the perfections of all beings, so His goodness must
        in a manner contain the goodness in each and every thing. Now, virtue is
        a certain goodness in the virtuous, for “according to it is one called
        good, and his work good.” Therefore, the divine goodness must contain in
        its way all the virtues.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] As a consequence, none of them is posited as a habit in God, as
        happens in our case. For it does not befit God to be good through
        something else superadded to Him, but through His essence, since He is
        absolutely simple. Nor, likewise, does He act through something added to
        His essence, since His action is His being, as has been shown. Hence,
        His virtue is not some habit, but His essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Again, a habit is an imperfect act, as being intermediate between
        potency and act; hence, those possessing a habit are compared to those
        who are asleep. But in God there is most perfect act. Act, therefore, is
        not in Him as a habit, for example, science, but as the act of
        considering, which is an ultimate and perfect act.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Further, habit is perfective of a power. But in God there is nothing
        in potency, but only in act. A habit, therefore, cannot be found in Him.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Moreover, a habit is in the genus of accident, which in no way is
        found in God, as was shown above. Neither, therefore, is any virtue said
        of God as a habit, but only according to His essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Now, since human virtues are those by which human life is directed,
        and human life is twofold, contemplative and active, the virtues
        belonging to the active life, so far as they perfect this life, cannot
        befit God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] For man’s active life consists in the use of bodily goods, and hence
        the active life is directed by the virtues by which we make a right use
        of these goods. Such goods, however, cannot befit God, nor, therefore,
        can such virtues so far as they direct this life.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] Furthermore, such virtues perfect the ways of men in the domain of
        political life. Hence, for those who do not take part in such a life the
        active virtues do not seem very suitable. Much less, therefore, can they
        suit God, whose conduct and life is far removed from the manner of human
        life.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] Of the virtues that deal with the active life some, likewise, direct
        the passions. These we cannot posit in God. For the virtues that deal
        with the passions take their species from the passions as from their
        proper objects; and so temperance differs from fortitude so far as it
        deals with desires, whereas the latter with fear and daring. But in God
        there are no passions, as has been shown, and therefore neither can such
        virtues be found in Him.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] Again, such virtues are not found in the intellective part of the
        soul but in the sensitive part, in which alone passions can be found, as
        is proved in <i>Physics</i> VII [3]. In God, however, there is no
        sensitive part, but only intellect. It remains, then, that such virtues
        cannot be in God even according to their proper natures.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] Of the passions, with which the virtues deal, some exist according
        to the inclination of the appetite to some corporeal good that is
        delightful to the sense, for example, food, drink, and sex. For the
        desires of these passions there are <i>sobriety</i> and <i>chastity</i>,
        and, in general, <i>temperance</i> and <i>continence</i>. Hence, because
        bodily delights are absolutely foreign to God, the aforesaid virtues
        neither befit God properly, since they deal with passions, nor are they
        said of God even metaphorically in Scripture, because there is no
        available likeness of them in God in terms of a likeness of some effect.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [12] Some passions, however, follow the inclination of the appetite to
        some spiritual good, such as honor, power, victory, revenge, and the
        like; and concerned with their hopes, their darings, and in general
        their desires there are <i>fortitude, magnanimity, gentleness</i>, and
        other like virtues. These, properly speaking, cannot be found in God,
        since they deal with passions, but in Scripture they are said
        metaphorically of God, because of a likeness in effects. For example,
        what is said in 1 Samuel (2:2): “There is no one as strong as our God”;
        and Micah [rather, Zephaniah 2:31: “Seek the just, seek the meek.”

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Now, there are some virtues directing the active life of man that do
        not deal with passions, but with actions: for example, truth, justice,
        liberality, magnificence, prudence, and art.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Since, however, virtue derives its species from its object or its
        matter, and since the actions that are the matter or the objects of such
        virtues are not repugnant to the divine perfection, neither do these
        virtues, according to their proper species, have anything on whose
        account they are excluded from the divine perfection.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Again, these virtues are certain perfections of the intellect and
        the will, which are principles of operation without passion. But in God
        there are intellect and will, lacking no perfection. Therefore, these
        virtues cannot be absent from God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Moreover, of the things that come into being from God the proper
        model is in the divine intellect, as was shown above. Now, the model in
        the mind of the maker of the thing to be made is art. Hence, the
        Philosopher says in <i>Ethics</i> VI [4] that “art is the true model of
        things to be made.” Art, then, is properly in God. And therefore it is
        said in Wisdom (7:21): “the artisan of all things has taught me wisdom.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Again, the divine will, with reference to things other than God, is
        determined to one effect by His knowledge, as was shown above. But the
        knowledge directing the will to act is prudence; for, according to the
        Philosopher in <i>Ethics</i> VI [5], “prudence is the true notion of the
        things to be done.” There is, therefore, prudence in God. And this is
        what is said in Job (12:13): “With Him is prudence and strength.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Furthermore, it was shown above that because God wills something He
        also wills those things that are necessary to it. But that which is
        necessary to the perfection of each thing is due to it. Therefore, there
        is justice in God, to which it belongs to give to each one what belongs
        to him. Hence it is said in a Psalm (3.o:8): “The Lord is just and loves
        justice.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Moreover, as was shown above, the ultimate end for which God wills
        all things in no way depends on the things that exist for the sake of
        the end, and this either as to being or as to some perfection. Hence, He
        does not will to give to someone His goodness so that thereby something
        may accrue to Himself, but because for Him to make such a gift befits
        Him as the fount of goodness. But to give something not for the sake of
        some benefit expected from the giving, but because of the goodness and
        befittingness of the giving, is an act of liberality, as appears from
        the Philosopher in <i>Ethics</i> IV [1]. God, therefore, is supremely
        liberal; and, as Avicenna says, He alone can truly be called liberal,
        for every agent other than God acquires some good from his action, which
        is the intended end.” Scripture sets forth this liberality of God,
        saying in a Psalm (103:28): “When You open Your hand, they shall all be
        filled with good”; and in James (1:5): “Who gives to all men abundantly
        without reproaching.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] Again, all things that receive being from God must bear His likeness
        in so far as they are, are good, and have their proper models in the
        divine intellect, as was shown above. But it belongs to the virtue of
        truth, as appears from the Philosopher in <i>Ethics</i> IV [7], for
        someone in his deeds and words to show himself such as he is. Therefore,
        there is in God the virtue of truth. Hence, Romans (3:4): “But God is
        true”; and the Psalm (118:151): “All Your ways are truth.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] But, if there are any virtues that deal with notions belonging to
        subordinates in relation to their superiors, such cannot befit God: for
        example, obedience, worship, or something of the sort that is due a
        superior.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] If, furthermore, some of the aforementioned virtues have certain
        imperfect acts, the virtues in question cannot be attributed to God
        according to those acts. Thus, prudence, according to the act of taking
        good counsel, does not befit God. For, since counsel is “a certain
        inquiry,” as is said in <i>Ethics</i> VI [9], and the divine knowledge
        is not inquiring, as was shown above, to take counsel cannot befit God.
        Hence Job (26:3): “How you have counseled him who has no wisdom!”; and
        Isaiah (40:14): “Whom has He consulted: and who has instructed Him?” But
        as to the act that consists in judging the matter of counsel and
        choosing what has been approved, nothing prevents prudence from being
        said of God. Nevertheless, counsel is at times said of God. This is
        either because of the likeness in privacy, since counsels take place in
        private, so that what is hidden in the divine wisdom is called by
        likeness counsel, as appears in Isaiah in the other version: “May Your
        ancient counsel be verified” (25:1 Septuagint); or in so far as He gives
        satisfaction to those who seek His counsel, since one who has
        understanding can, even without any discursiveness, instruct the
        inquiring.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] In the same way, justice, as concerns the act of commutative
        justice, cannot befit God, since He does not receive anything from
        anyone. Hence Romans (11:35): “Who hath first given to Him and
        recompense shall be made him?” And Job (41:2): “Who hath given me before
        that I should repay him?” Through a likeness, however, we are said to
        give some things to God in so far as God looks with favor upon our
        gifts. Commutative justice, therefore, does not befit God, but only
        distributive. Hence, Dionysius says that “God is praised for His justice
        as giving to all according to their worth” [ <i>De div. nom.</i> VIII,
        3]. And in the words of Matthew (25:15): “He gave... to every one
        according to his proper ability.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [12] We must observe, however, that the actions with which the above
        virtues deal, do not according to their natures depend on man; for to
        judge of the things that are to be done, or to give or distribute
        something, does not belong to man alone but to any being possessing an
        intellect. Yet, in so far as these are narrowed to the human sphere, in
        a manner they receive their species from them, as the curvature in a
        nose produces the species of the snub. The aforementioned virtues,
        therefore, according as they order man’s active life, are ordered to
        these actions in so far as they are narrowed to human affairs and take
        their species from them. In this manner they cannot befit God. But in so
        far as the aforementioned actions are taken in their generality, they
        can be attributed even to divine things. For just as man is a
        distributor of human goods, such as money and honor, so too God is the
        distributor of all the goods of the universe. The aforementioned
        virtues, therefore, are of a more universal extension in God than in
        man; for as the justice of man is to the community or the household, so
        the justice of God is to the whole universe. Hence, the divine virtues
        are said to be the exemplar virtues of ours; for the things that are
        contracted and particularized are the likenesses of certain absolute
        beings, just as the light of a candle is to the light of the sun. As for
        the other virtues, which do not properly befit God, they do not have an
        exemplar in the divine nature, but only in the divine wisdom, which
        contains the proper likenesses of all beings: this is the case with
        other corporeal beings.

        [1] Concerning the contemplative virtues there can be no doubt that they
        supremely befit God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] For if wisdom consists in the knowledge of the highest causes,
        according to the Philosopher in the beginning of the
        <i>Metaphysics</i> [I, 2], and if God especially knows Himself, and does
        not know anything, as has been proved, except by knowing Himself Who is
        the first cause of all things, it is manifest that wisdom must most
        especially be attributed to Him. Hence Job (9:4): “He is wise in heart”;
        and Sirach (1:1): “All wisdom is from the Lord God, and hath been always
        with Him.” The Philosopher also says in the beginning of the
        <i>Metaphysics</i> [I, 2] that wisdom is a divine possession, not a
        human one.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Again, if science is the knowledge of a thing through its cause, and
        if God knows the order of all causes and effects, and thereby knows the
        proper causes of singulars, as was shown above, it is manifest that in a
        proper sense there is science in Him. Nevertheless, this is not the
        science caused by ratiocination, as our science is caused by
        demonstration. Hence 1 Samuel (2:3): “For the Lord is the God of all
        knowledge.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Furthermore, if the immaterial knowledge of some things without
        discursiveness is intellect, and God has such knowledge of all things,
        as was shown above, there is therefore intellect in God. Hence Job
        (12:13): “He hath counsel and understanding.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] These virtues, likewise, are in God the exemplars of ours, as the
        perfect of the imperfect.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">THAT GOD CANNOT WILL EVIL</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From what has been said it can be shown that God cannot will evil.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] For the virtue of a being is that by which he operates well. Now
        every operation of God is an operation of virtue, since His virtue is
        His essence, as was shown above. Therefore, God cannot will evil.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Again, the will never aims at evil without some error existing in
        the reason, at least with respect to a particular object of choice. For,
        since the object of the will is the apprehended good, the will cannot
        aim at evil unless in some way it is proposed to it as a good; and this
        cannot take place without error. But in the divine knowledge there
        cannot be error, as was shown above. God’s will cannot, therefore, tend
        towards evil.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Moreover, God is the highest good, as has been shown. But the
        highest good cannot bear any mingling with evil, as neither can the
        highest hot thing bear any mingling with the cold. The divine will,
        therefore, cannot be turned to evil.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Furthermore, since the good has the nature of an end, evil cannot
        enter the will except by turning away from the end. But the divine will
        cannot be turned from the end, since it can will nothing except by
        willing itself. Therefore, it cannot will evil.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] And thus it appears that free choice in God naturally stands abiding
        in the -good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] This is what is said in Deuteronomy (32:4): “God is faithful and
        without any iniquity”; and Habakkuk (1:13): “Your eyes are too pure to
        behold evil, and You cannot look on iniquity.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] By this is refuted the error of the Jews, who say in the Talmud that
        at times God sins and is cleansed from sin; and of the Luciferians, who
        say that God sinned in ejecting Lucifer.

          >THAT GOD HATES NOTHING, AND THE HATRED OF NO THING BEFITS HIM</span
        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From this it appears that the hatred of something does not befit
        God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] For as love is to the good, so hatred is to evil; for to those we
        love we will good, and to those we hate, evil. If, then, the will of God
        cannot be inclined to evil, as has been shown, it is impossible that He
        should hate anything.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Again, the will of God is directed to things other than Himself, as
        has been shown, in so far as, by willing and loving His own being and
        His own goodness, God wills it to be diffused as much as possible
        through the communication of likeness. This, then, is what God wills in
        other things, that there be in them the likeness of His goodness. But
        this is the good of each thing, namely, to participate in the likeness
        of God; for every other goodness is nothing other than a certain
        likeness of the first goodness. Therefore, God wills good to each thing.
        Hence, He hates nothing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Furthermore, from the first being all the others take the origin of
        their being. If, then, God hates anything among the things that are, He
        wills it not to be, since to be is each thing’s good. He wills,
        therefore, the non-existence of His own action by which that thing is
        brought into being either mediately or immediately. For it was shown
        above that, if God wills something, He must will the things that are
        necessary for it. Now, this is impossible. This is apparent if things
        come into being through His will, for then the action by which things
        are produced must be voluntary. The same is the case if God is by nature
        the cause of things, for, just as His nature is pleasing to Him, so
        whatever His nature requires is pleasing to Him. God, therefore, does
        not hate anything.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Moreover, that which is found in all naturally active causes must be
        especially found in the first cause. But all agents in their own way
        love their effects as such: thus, parents love their children, poets
        their poetry, and artists their works. All the more, then, does God not
        hate anything, since He is the cause of all things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] This is what is said in Wisdom (11:25): “For You lovest all the
        things that are, and batest none of the things which You hast made.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] However, God is said by similitude to hate some things, and this in
        a twofold way. In the first way, because God, in loving things and by
        willing the existence of their good, wills the non-existence of the
        contrary evil. Hence, He is said to have a hatred of evils, for we are
        said to hate what we will not to exist. In the words of Zechariah
        (8:17): “And let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his
        friend and love not a false oath. For all these are the things that I
        hate, saith the Lord.” These, however, are not effects in the manner of
        subsisting things, to which properly love and hate refer.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] The second way arises from the fact that God wills some greater good
        that cannot be without the loss of some lesser good. And thus He is said
        to hate, although this is rather to love. For thus, inasmuch as He wills
        the good of justice or of the order of the universe, which cannot exist
        without the punishment or corruption of some things, God is said to hate
        the things whose punishment or corruption He wills. In the words of
        Malachi (1:3): “I have hated Esau”; and the Psalms (5:7): “You hate all
        workers of iniquity: You destroy all who speak a lie. The bloody and the
        deceitful man the Lord will abhor.”

        [1] From what has already been proved it necessarily follows that God is
        living.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] For it has been shown that God is understanding and willing, and the
        acts of understanding and willing belong only to a living being.
        Therefore, God is living.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Again, to live is attributed to some beings because they are seen to
        move themselves, but not to be moved by another. And on this account the
        things that seem to be moved by themselves, whose movers people in
        general do not perceive, we call by similitude living: for example, the
        living water of a flowing spring, but not the water of a cistern or a
        stagnant pool; or quicksilver, which appears to have a certain movement.
        For, in a proper sense, those things move through themselves that move
        themselves, being composed of a mover and something moved, for example,
        animate things. These alone we properly say are living, while all other
        things are moved by some exterior agent, be it a generating cause, or
        one removing an obstacle, or an impelling cause. And because all
        sensible operations involve motion, everything that moves itself to its
        own operations is further said to live, though this be not with motion;
        and so understanding, appetition, and sensing are actions of life. But
        it is supremely true of God that He does not act from another, but
        through Himself, since He is the first agent. Therefore, to live belongs
        to Him in a supreme way.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Again, the divine being comprehends every perfection of being, as
        has been shown. But to live is a certain perfection, which is why living
        things in the order of being are higher than non-living things. Hence,
        the divine being is living. Therefore, God is living.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] This is likewise confirmed by the authority of the divine Scripture.
        For it is said in Deuteronomy (32:40) in the person of the Lord: “I will
        say: I live forever”; and in a Psalm (83:3): “My heart and my flesh have
        rejoiced in the living God.”

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] For the life of the living being is the very act of living signified
        in an abstract manner, as running is in reality nothing other than to
        run. Now, “to live is for the living their very being,” as appears from
        the Philosopher in <i>De anima</i> II [4]. For, since an animal is said
        to be living because it has a soul, through which it has being as
        through its proper form, it follows that to live is nothing other than
        such a being arising from such a form. But God is His own being, as was
        proved above. Therefore, He is His own act of living and His own life.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Again, understanding is a certain way of living, as appears from the
        Philosopher in <i>De anima</i> II [2]; for to live is the act of a
        living being. But God is His own understanding, as was shown above, and
        therefore He is His own act of living and His own life.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Moreover, if God were not His life, since He is living, as has been
        shown, it would follow that He would be living through the participation
        of life. But everything that is through participation is reduced to that
        which is through itself. Therefore, God would be reduced to something
        prior, through which He would be living. This is impossible, as is
        apparent from what has been said.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Furthermore, if God is living, as has been shown, there must be life
        in Him. If, then, He is not His own life, there will be something in Him
        that is not He.. Thus, He will be composite, which has been disproved.”
        Therefore, God is His life.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Nothing ceases to live except through separation from life. But
        nothing can be separated from God, since every separation takes place
        through the division of something from something. It is therefore
        impossible that God cease to live, since He is His life, as has been

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">

        some cause, for nothing leads itself from nonbeing to being, since that
        which does not yet exist does not act. But the divine life has no cause,
        as neither does the divine being. Hence, God is not at times living and

        [4] Furthermore, in every operation the agent abides, even though at
        times the operation passes through succession. Hence, in motion
        likewise, the movable remains the same in subject during the whole
        motion, although not in situation. Where, therefore, the action is the
        agent itself, of necessity nothing there passes through succession, but
        the whole remains all together. But the understanding and living of God
        are God Himself, as has been shown. Therefore, His life has no
        succession, but is life all together. Therefore, it is everlasting.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Moreover, God is absolutely immobile, as was shown above. But what
        begins to live and ceases to live, or in living suffers succession, is
        mutable. For one’s life begins through generation, it ceases through
        corruption, and as to succession, it exists because of some motion. But
        God neither began to live, nor will He cease to live, not in living does
        He suffer any succession. Therefore, His life is everlasting.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Hence what is said in Deuteronomy (32:40) in the person of the Lord:
        “I live forever”; and in 1 John (5:20): “This is true God and life
        eternal.”

        THAT GOD IS BLESSED
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] It remains from the foregoing to show that God is blessed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] The proper good of every intellectual nature is blessedness. Since,
        then, God is intelligent, His proper good will be blessedness. But He is
        not related to His proper good as is something that tends to a good not
        yet possessed, since this belongs to a nature that is movable and
        existing in potency; He is related rather as that which alreadypossesses
        its proper good. Therefore, He not only desires blessedness, as we do,
        but enjoys it. Therefore, He is blessed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Moreover, that is supremely desired or willed by an intellectual
        nature which is most perfect in it; and this is its blessedness. But the
        most perfect thing in each being is its most perfect operation. For
        potency and habit are perfected by operation, and so the Philosopher
        says that "felicity is perfect operation" [Ethics X, 7]. But the
        perfection of operation depends on four things. First, on its genus,
        namely, that it be abiding in its operating cause. By an operation that
        abides in its cause I mean one through which nothing takes place but the
        operation itself: for example, to see and to hear. For these are the
        perfections of the beings whose operations they are, and can be ultimate
        because they are not ordered to something made as to their end. On the
        other hand, the operation or the action from which there follows some
        result beyond the action itself is the perfection of the thing produced,
        and not of the operating cause, and is related to it as to an end.
        Hence, such an operation of an intellectual nature is not blessedness or
        felicity. Second, it depends on the principle of operation, namely, that
        it be the operation of the highest power. Hence, there is not felicity
        in us according to the operation of sense, butt according to the
        operation of the intellect, and one perfected by a habit. Third, it
        depends on the object of operation. On this account, the highest
        felicity in us consists in understanding the highest intelligible.
        Fourth, it depends on the form of the operation, namely, that it be
        easily, firmly, and with delight. Such, however, is the operation of
        God, since He is intelligent, and His the highest power, nor does He
        need any perfecting habit, because He is perfect in Himself, as was
        shown above. Furthermore, He understands Himself, being the highest
        intelligible, and this perfectly, without any difficulty, and with
        delight. God is, therefore, blessed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Furthermore, through blessedness every desire is given rest,
        because, when blessedness is possessed, nothing else remains to be
        desired, since it is the ultimate end. He must, therefore, be blessed
        who is perfect in relation to all the things that He can desire. Hence,
        Boethius says that blessedness is "a state made perfect by the
        accumulation of all goods" [ <i>De consolatione philosophiae</i> III,
        2]. But such is the divine perfection, because it comprehends all
        perfection in a certain simplicity, as was shown above. Therefore, God
        is truly blessed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Again, as long as someone is missing something that he needs, he is
        not yet blessed, for his desire is not yet at rest. Whoever, therefore,
        is self-sufficient, needing nothing, he is blessed. But it ha's been
        shown above that God does not need other things, since His perfection
        depends on nothing outside Himself, nor does God will other things for
        His own sake as though He needed them, but solely because this befits
        His goodness. Therefore, He is blessed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Furthermore, it was shown above that God cannot will something
        impossible. But it is impossible that God should receive what He does
        not already have, since He is in no way in potency, as has been shown.
        Therefore, He cannot will to have anything that He does not have. Hence,
        whatever He wills, He has. Nor does He will anything evil, as was shown
        above. He is therefore blessed, in the manner in which some proclaim the
        blessed man to be “be who has whatever He wills and who wills nothing
        evil.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Sacred Scripture, furthermore, proclaims the blessedness of God:
        “Which in His times He shall show Who is the Blessed and only Mighty” (1
        Tim. 6:15).

        <span style="font-weight: bold">THAT GOD IS HIS BLESSEDNESS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From this it is apparent that God is His blessedness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] For His blessedness is a certain intellectual operation, as has been
        shown. But it was shown above that His understanding is His substance.
        Therefore, He is His blessedness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Again, blessedness, since it is the ultimate end, is that which he
        who can have it, or has it, principally wills. But it was shown above
        that God principally wills His essence. Therefore, His essence is His
        blessedness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Furthermore, everyone relates to his blessedness whatever he wills.
        For it is what is not desired for the sake of something else, and that
        in which terminates the motion of the desire of someone desiring one
        thing for the sake of another—so that the motion may not be infinite.
        Since, then, God wills all other things for the sake of His goodness,
        which is His essence, it is necessary that, just as He is His essence
        and His goodness, He be His blessedness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Moreover, that there be two highest goods is impossible. For, if one
        lacked something that the other had, neither would be highest and
        perfect. But God was shown above to be the highest good. Blessedness
        will also be shown to be the highest good because it is the ultimate
        end. Therefore, blessedness and God are identical. Therefore, God is His
        blessedness.

          >THAT THE PERFECT AND UNIQUE BLESSEDNESS OF GOD EXCELS EVERY OTHER
          BLESSEDNESS</span
        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From what has preceded we may further examine the excellence of the
        divine blessedness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] The nearer something is to blessedness, the more blessed it is.
        Hence, although a man may be called blessed because he hopes to obtain
        blessedness, in no way does his blessedness compare with the blessedness
        of the one who already possesses it in act. But the thing nearest to
        blessedness is blessedness itself. This has been shown of God.
        Therefore, God is in a unique way perfectly blessed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Again, since delight is caused by love, as has been shown, the
        possession of what is Joved. But, other things being equal, each thing
        loves itself more than another, and a sign of this is that the nearer a
        thing is to something else the more it is naturally loved. God,
        therefore, delights more in His blessedness, which He Himself is, than
        do other blessed ones in the blessedness which is not they themselves.
        The desire has therefore all the more repose, and the blessedness is all
        the more perfect.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Furthermore, that which is through its essence is more excellent
        than what is said by participation: for example, the nature of fire is
        found more perfectly in fire itself than in things that are on fire. But
        God is blessed through His essence, and this befits no other being,
        since no being other than He can be the highest good, as can be seen
        from what has been said. And thus, whoever other than God is blessed,
        must be called blessed by participation. The divine blessedness,
        therefore, excels every other blessedness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Moreover, blessedness consists in the perfect operation of the
        intellect, as has been shown. But no other intellectual operation can
        compare with God’s operation. 11is is evident not only because it is a
        subsistent operation but also because by one operation God knows Himself
        as perfectly as He is perfect, as well as all other things, those that
        are and those that are not, the good and the evil. But in all other
        beings with an intellect, the operation of the intellect is not itself
        subsistent, but the act of something subsistent. Nor, again, is God
        Himself, Who is the highest intelligible, understood by anyone as
        perfectly as He is perfect, since the being of no thing is as perfect as
        the divine being, nor can the operation of any being be more perfect
        than its substance. Nor, still, is there another intellect that knows
        also all the things that God can make, for then it would comprehend the
        divine power. And even as to the things that another intellect knows, it
        does not know them all by one and the same operation. God, therefore, is
        blessed above all things beyond compare.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Again, the more something is united, by so much the more are its
        power and goodness more perfect. But a successive operation is divided
        according to the diverse parts of time. Its perfection, therefore, can
        in no way be compared to the perfection of an operation that is all at
        once without succession, and this especially if it does not pass away in
        a moment but abides for eternity. Now, in God, to understand exists
        eternally all at once and without succession, whereas in us to
        understand implies succession because continuity and time are by
        accident joined to it. Hence, the divine blessedness infinitely excels
        human blessedness, as the duration of eternity excels the flowing now of
        time.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Furthermore, weariness and the various cares with which perforce our
        contemplation in this life is mingled (in this contemplation human
        felicity especially consists, if by chance there is such in the present
        life), and the errors, doubts and hazards to which the present life is
        exposed show that human felicity, especially that of the present life,
        cannot at all compare with the divine blessedness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] Moreover, the perfection of the divine blessedness can be observed
        from the fact that it includes within itself every blessedness in a most
        perfect way. For contemplative felicity God has the most perfect and
        everlasting consideration of Himself and other things. For active
        felicity He has the government, not of the life of one man, or of a
        household, a city, or a kingdom, but of the whole universe.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] As for false and earthly felicity, it contains no more than a shadow
        of that most perfect felicity. For it consists in five things, according
        to Boethius [ <i>De consolatione philosophiae</i> III, 2]; namely, in
        pleasure, riches, power, honor, and fame. But God enjoys a most
        excelling delight in Himself, as well as a universal joy in all things,
        without the admixture of any contrary. For wealth, He has the
        all-abundant sufficiency of all good things within Himself, as was shown
        above. For power, He has His infinite strength. For honor, He has the
        primacy and rule over all beings. For fame, He has the admiration of
        every intellect that knows Him however little.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        To Him, then, Who is singularly blessed, be, honor and glory unto the
        ages of ages. Amen.
