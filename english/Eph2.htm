meanings in Scripture. Positively, it may refer to the world as created and ruled by God; or, as it is loved by God\
and brought to perfection through Christ&#8217;s redemption. Negatively, it refers to the world as perverted by sin and\
hostile to God, which is the meaning St. Paul gives it here. For the way in which these three are interrelated, and how\
the positive triumphs over the negative, cf. &#8220;Christian Humanism and St. John&#8217;s Theology of Life,&#8221; <i>Review for\

never went into a detailed speculation about which ranks of angels governed which parts of the universe. In a general\
way, it could be said that the Middle Hierarchy would govern the celestial bodies&#8212;the nine celestial spheres (cf.\
Appendix)&#8212;and the Lower Hierarchy the terrestrial sphere made up of the four elements of fire, water, earth and\
air; cf. <i>S.T.<\/i> I, 63, 7c. Yet St. Thomas only mentions this as an opinion of others and does not seem attracted to it;\
he reminds us that the lowest possible angel transcends the whole of material creation by reason of its pure\

  var WPFootnote8 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>In these few sentences St. Thomas hints at his thought on concupiscence and original sin. It is not that these desires\
are sinful, for if the delight resulting from obtaining what we desire is not evil (<i>S.T.<\/i> I, 1-4), neither is the desire evil\
(<i>ibid., <\/i>30, 2c). If man had not sinned his enjoyment of sensible goods would be even more intense than now; to be\
ruled by reason is not to become &#8220;angelized,&#8221; cf. I, 98, 2 ad 3. Yet, due to the lack of original justice (I-II, 82, 3),\
these desires can become causes of sin (I-II, 77). This is taking &#8220;concupiscentia&#8221; in the strictly theological sense,\
cf. K. Ralmer, &#8220;The Theological Concept of Concupiscentia,&#8221; <i>Theological Investigations <\/i>(Baltimore: Helicon,\
1960), pp. 360-69. By &#8220;natural concupiscences&#8221; St. Thomas means that men share them with all animals, whereas\
the &#8220;concupiscence of knowledge,&#8221; or of reason, is proper to man only, cf. <i>S.T.<\/i> I-II, 30, 3c.<\/p>\

servum. redimeres, filium tradidisti.&#8221; Liturgists seem to agree that the <i>Exultet, <\/i>or &#8220;Benedictio Cerei Gallicana,&#8221; owes\
its main inspiration to the fourth or fifth century; and it has been attributed both to St. Ambrose and Augustine. The\
earliest records we have of it are in the Gelasian Sacramentaries of the eighth century, cf. Schmidt, S.J., <i>Hebdomada\
Sancta<\/i>, Vol. 2 (Rome: Herder, 1957) pp. 639-45. Possibly St. Thomas was under the impression that St. Gregory\
had composed the <i>Exultet. <\/i>St. Thomas&#8217; attribution of the quotation to St. Gregory more than likely springs from the\
common medieval custom of accepting Gregory as the author of the texts in the missal.<\/p>\

  var WPFootnote10 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>Cf. note 11 above. For St. Thomas &#8220;salus&#8221; is a divine action directed at the whole of man&#8217;s being. V. White, O.P.,\
has pointed out how &#8220;holiness (<i>sanctitas<\/i>), health (<i>sanitas<\/i>),<i> <\/i>completeness (<i>perfectio<\/i>), and wholeness (<i>integritas<\/i>)<i> <\/i>are,\
in principle, virtually synonymous&#8221; for Aquinas; cf. his Soul <i>and Psyche <\/i>(London: Collins &amp; Harvill, 1960), pp. 184-86. Notice how St. Thomas regularly speaks of &#8220;human salvation&#8221; or the &#8220;salvation of man&#8221; rather than the\
&#8220;salvation of souls.&#8221;<\/p>\

  var WPFootnote11 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>The act of faith is essentially an assent to God revealing himself to man (<i>S.T.<\/i> II-II, 1, 1c). The individual articles\
of faith are only the material determinations of this essential acceptance of Divinity revealing himself. St. Thomas\
brings out this interpersonal character of faith: &#8220;Everyone who believes assents to someone&#8217;s words; and thus, in any\
form of belief, it seems that it is the person to whose words the assent is given, who is of principal importance and,\
as it were, the end; while the individual truths through which one assents to that person are secondary&#8221; (<i>ibid.<\/i>, 11,\
1c). Cf. J. Mouroux, <i>I Believe, The Personal Structure <\/i>of <i>Faith <\/i>(New York: Sheed &amp; Ward, 1959).<\/p>\

  var WPFootnote12 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>Cf. note 7 above. The &#8220;habitus&#8221; are creative powers by which men can perform different types of actions. For\
instance, the ability to solve complex mathematical problems is only acquired through training and practice; we\
cannot perform the requisite mental acts until we are conditioned by a learning process. The creative power which\
results from this conditioning is obviously distinct from the individual acts of solving mathematical problems, yet\
it is nonetheless real since if it did not exist we should have to go through the whole learning process before each\
act. Unlike such acquired powers, the supernatural virtues are infused by God, cf. <i>S.T.<\/i> I-II, 51, 4; 63, 4.<\/p>\
<\/span>';

  var WPFootnote13 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>St. Thomas is using &#8220;sacramenta&#8221; here in the Patristic sense which does not limit it to the seven sacraments. All\
sanctifying mysteries are &#8220;Sacraments.&#8221; Christ, as the incarnation of God, is thus <i>the <\/i>sacrament of the Divine\
redemptive presence in the world of man; the Church&#8212;or as St. Thomas refers to it in discussing the second\
sacrament of which the pagans were deprived, the &#8220;society of the saints&#8221;&#8212;is the continuation of this sacramental\
presence. Aquinas probably owed this terminology to Hugh of St. Victor&#8217;s <i>De Sacramentis, <\/i>P.L. 176, 181 ff. Like\
Hugh, he discussed the &#8220;sacraments of nature&#8221; (<i>In IV Sent., <\/i>d. 1, q. 2, a. 6, sol. 3) which were even capable of\
symbolizing Christ (<i>S.T.<\/i> I-II, 103, 1; cf. note 154 below). The Old Law also had its sacraments <i>(S.C.G. <\/i>IV, 57; <i>S.T.\
<\/i>I-II, 101, 4; 102, 5; 103; 111, 61, 3 ad 2). On &#8220;sacramentum&#8221; as aholy secret or sanctifying mystery, cf. <i>S.T.<\/i> III, 60,\
1 ad 2; and A. M. Roguet, <i>O.P., les Sacrements <\/i>(Paris: Descl&eacute;e et Cie, 1945) pp. 257-M. A broader usage of the term\
&#8220;sacrament&#8221; is being restored to contemporary theology, cf. E. Schillebeeckx, O.P., <i>Christ: The Sacrament of the\
Encounter with God <\/i>(New York: Sheed &amp; Ward, 1963).<\/p>\

designating the region of becoming between pure being and absolute non-being. St. Augustine used it in his\
<i>Confessions <\/i>VII, 10 and it enjoyed wide vogue in the Middle Ages where it was associated with the &#8220;terra longinqua&#8221;\
of the prodigal son in Lk 15:13. In similar fashion St. Thomas here links it with the &#8220;de longe venerunt&#8221; of Mk. 8:3.\
The Christian concept of sin distorting man&#8217;s likeness to God is what it mainly implies. Cf. E. Gilson, <i>The Mystical\

Manich. Discip. <\/i>17, (P.L. 42, Col 157-62). In St. Thomas&#8217; view of salvation-history the Old Law had an embryonic\
relationship to the New: &#8220;As the effect is in its cause, or the perfect is in its less perfect beginnings-just as the whole\
tree is contained in the seed-so is the New Law contained in the Old Law.&#8221; <i>S.T. <\/i>I-II, 107, 3. This is a corollary of\
the general pattern of God&#8217;s salvific revelation to man, it is gradual in order for man to better assimilate. it (<i>ibid.<\/i>,\
99, 6). Thus the New Covenant fulfills the Old by realizing its deepest potentialities (<i>ibid.<\/i>, 107, 2); they both have\
the same goal while they differ as less perfect and more perfect in their methods of attaining that goal (<i>ibid.<\/i>, 107,\
1). This is why Aquinas characterized the Old Law as one of Fear and the New as one of Love. For a genuine\
supernatural love could only be offered to God by God himself become man and communicating his love, the Holy\
Spirit, to other men (<i>S.T.<\/i> II-II, 24, 2c; III, 8, 6c). Hence Christ is the head of all mankind (<i>ibid.<\/i>, III, 8, 3) and those\
who observed God&#8217;s commands out of supernatural love in the Old Testament really belonged to the New, while\
those in the New Covenant who still practice virtue out of fear of punishment are acting as though they were under\
the Old Law (<i>ibid.<\/i>, I-II, 107, 1 ad 2). For a comparison of the Old and New Covenants in an eschatological\
perspective, cf. <i>ibid.<\/i>, 103, 3.<\/p>\

    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>The ceremonial precepts, in Aquinas&#8217; view, served two purposes. One was to provide Israel with a suitable religious\
cult of Yahweh, the other was to symbolize the mystery of Christ. Thomas (in <i>S.T.<\/i> I-II, 102, 2) refers to St. Jerome&#8217;s\
comment on Old Testament prophecy to show how this symbolic character must be present in the actual rites\
themselves and not fanciful speculations arbitrarily tacked on to them later. Jerome&#8217;s observation was: &#8220;During the\
course of the Old Testament period the prophets promised much about the coming of Christ and the salvation of the\
Gentiles; yet they did this precisely by not neglecting the age in which they lived. As though they would not instruct\
the assembled people about the matters then confronting them, but would rather seem to wildly speculate about\
uncertain and future happenings.&#8221; (Comm. <i>super Osee<\/i>, 1, P.L. <i>25, 824). <\/i>In the remaining articles of question 102\
St. Thomas applies the principles discussed here, and in note 56 above, with too much attention to minor\
details&#8212;closer to Latin patristic methods than those of modem scholars. Nevertheless, the latter base their theories\
on principles similar to those St. Thomas adopted, cf. C. Charlier, <i>The Christian Approach to the Bible, <\/i>(Maryland:\

the latter wanting to observe the law and the former least (wanting it).&#8221; If Thomas was asserting that the Gentiles\
were eager to observe the law, then either the Jews were not at all eager to observe it themselves or they were not\
eager to let the Gentiles do so. Old Testament history, however, offers so few instances of these phenomena&#8212;not\
to mention St. Paul&#8217;s struggles with the judaizing Christians in the New&#8212;that I have taken &#8220;isti&#8221; to refer to the Jews\

This is the analysis St. Bernard made of the growth in man&#8217;s love for God. He begins by loving God for man&#8217;s sake\

      Above, the Apostle enumerated the blessings bestowed on the human race in
      general through Christ (1:3). Here the Apostle sets them in relief by
      comparing them to [mankind’s] own former condition. Their past state can
      be considered in two ways: first as a state of sin, and secondly as a
      state of paganism. Therefore, the Apostle does two things:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
      First, he recounts the blessings shown them in regard to their first

    Secondly, he adds its necessity (2: 1)
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    God, he says, is wondrously active in the faithful, “in accord with the
    exercise of his mighty power, which he worked in Christ,” (Eph 1:19) in
    raising him from the dead. Hence, according to this activity, and after the
    example of this operation, he has restored us to the life of grace from the
    death of sin. “He will revive us after two days: on the third day he will
    raise us up and we shall live in his sight” (Hos 6:3). “If you have ben
    raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is sitting
    at the right hand of God” (Col 3:1).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    He demonstrates the need for such a blessing when he states
    <span style="font-weight: bold"
      >when you were dead in your offenses and sins</span
    >
    where he describes so well their sin. First of all, [he depicts] the
    multitude [of their sins] at
    <span style="font-weight: bold">And you, when you were dead</span> with the
    worst type of death, spiritual death. “Evil will slay the wicked [Vul: The
    death of the wicked is very evil]” (Ps 34:22). Sin is termed a death because
    by it man is separated from God who is life: I am the way, and the truth,
    and the life” (Jn 14:6). <span style="font-weight: bold">Dead</span> I say,
    <span style="font-weight: bold">in your offenses and sins</span> —behold the
    great number! For offenses are the omissions [of what they should have
    done]—“Who can discover errors?” (Ps 19:13)—while sins are [the evil they]
    committed.
    <span style="font-weight: bold">Wherein in time past you walked</span> is
    added to exaggerate the great number of sins. For if some are dead in
    offenses and sins at one time, they nonetheless cease at another time and
    leave off sinning; but these keep up their pace in going from bad to worse.
    Philippians 3 (18) contains a similar idea: “For many, as I have often told
    you and now tell you with tears, conduct themselves as enemies of the cross
    of Christ.” They “have gone after worthlessness and become worthless” (Jer
    2:5).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Secondly, he describes the twofold cause of their sin. One arises from this
    world insofar as they are attracted by the things of the world.

    Concerning this he states
    <span style="font-weight: bold">according to the course of this world</span
    >; you were allured by mundane matters into a worldly life. “If any man love
    the world, the charity of the Father is not in him.” Hence the command:
    “Love not the world, nor the things which are in the world” (1 Jn 2:15).
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    The other cause was the devils whom they served, of which Wisdom 14 (27)
    warns: “The worship of infamous is the beginning and cause and end of all
    evil.”

    In reference to this he says
    <span style="font-weight: bold"
      >according to the prince of the power of this air</span
    >, and he portrays three aspects of this cause.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    First, as regards their strength he says
    <span style="font-weight: bold">the prince of the power</span>. He exerts a
    power, not by the fact that he has it naturally, since he is neither the
    Lord nor creator by nature, but to the degree that he dominates over men who
    subject themselves to him by sinning. “Now shall the prince of this world be
    cast out” (Jn 12:31); “for the prince of this world is coming; he has no
    power over me” (Jn 14:30).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Secondly, concerning their dwelling place he says
    <span style="font-weight: bold">of this air</span>, that is, he has power in
    this darksome atmosphere. Here it should be noted that two opinions exist
    among the doctors. For some held that the demons who had fallen [from grace]
    were not from the higher ranks, but from the lower ones in charge of the
    lower bodies.

    was of the opinion that the first of those who had fallen had been in charge

    preferred, and with better reason, that those [angels who sinned] were from
    the highest ranks. <span style="font-weight: bold">Of this air</span> then
    designates that this atmosphere is the place of their punishment. Jude
    refers to this in his canonical [letter]: “And the angels who did not keep
    their own position but left their proper dwelling he has kept in everlasting
    chains under darkness until the judgment of the great day” (Jude 6). The
    reason why they were not immediately thrust into hell after their fall, but
    released in the atmosphere, was because God did not want the creation of
    those who had sinned to be totally frustrated. Hence, he sent them to try
    men, by which the good would be prepared for glory and the wicked for
    eternal death. The time of our warfare and of merit will last until the day
    of judgment, till then they will remain in the atmosphere; after the day of
    judgment, however, they will be thrust back into hell.

    Observe also how one reading has “of the spirit” which, as a genitive
    singular, stands for the plural “of the spirits.” Another reading gives
    “spirit” in the accusative case; as if to say: “according to the prince
    spirit,” that is, the prince who is a spirit.

    Thirdly, [he describes] their activity when be states
    <span style="font-weight: bold"
      >that now works on the children of despair</span
    >. They are the children of despair who reject the fruit of Christ’s
    passion. Or, those who have no faith in eternal realities nor hope in
    salvation through Christ. In these the prince of the power of this air
    freely <span style="font-weight: bold">works</span>, leading them wherever
    he wishes. Later it is said of them: “They have become callous [Vul:
    despairing] and have given themselves up to licentiousness, greedy to
    practice every kind of uncleanness” (Eph 4:19). Perhaps,
    <span style="font-weight: bold">of despair</span> means those of whom we
    should despair because they sin out of malice; the prince of this world
    doing whatever he pleases in them. For no one should despair of those who
    sin from ignorance or weakness, nor does that prince do whatever he wants
    with them.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    On the contrary, however, one should never despair of anyone else as long as
    he lives. I reply. Our hope in someone can be twofold. On the one hand, it
    can be in the man, and on the other, in divine grace. Thus someone may be
    despaired of as far as he himself is concerned, but never must confidence in
    God be lost. For instance, people rightly despaired of Lazarus’ power to
    bring himself back to life once he bad been placed in the tomb, but no trust
    should have been lost in the God who raised him up. Therefore, those who out
    of malice are sunk in their many sins can be despaired of from the point of
    view of their own strength: “I have sunk into the abysmal Mire, where there
    is no footing” (Ps 69:3). But no one should despair if it is a question of
    the divine power. Concerning these children of despair it mentions further
    on: “Let no man deceive you with empty words. For because of these things
    the anger of God comes upon the children of disobedience [Vul: despair]”
    (Eph 5:6).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Next (v. 3), the Apostle recalls the sinful state of the Jews, thereby
    demonstrating how everyone had sinned, according to that saying of Romans 3
    (9): “For we have charged both Jews and Greeks, that they are all under
    sin.” Nevertheless, a difference should be noted. The Apostle had designated
    two causes when dealing with the sin of the Gentiles, one on the side of the
    world and the other on that of the demons whom they worshiped. The Jews were
    like the Gentiles in their sinful condition in regard to the first cause,
    but not the second; hence, the Apostle only mentions their sin as arising
    from worldly causes. In reference to this he makes three points:
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
    First, he recounts their guilt regarding sins of the heart.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
    Secondly, the sins of action.
  </p>
  <p
    style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in"
  >
    Thirdly, original sin.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    A sin of, the heart is implied in carnal desires. About this he asserts:
    <span style="font-weight: bold">in which</span> sins and offenses
    <span style="font-weight: bold">also we all</span> who are Jews
    <span style="font-weight: bold">conversed in time past</span>, leading our
    life <span style="font-weight: bold">in the</span> carnal
    <span style="font-weight: bold">desires of our flesh</span>. “For we
    ourselves also were once foolish, disobedient, led astray, slaves to various
    passions and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one
    another” (Tit 3:3). “Put on the Lord Jesus Christ; and make no provision for
    the desires of the flesh” (Rom 13:14).

    A certain concupiscence of the flesh exists, it consists of the natural
    concupiscences; for example, for food through which the individual maintains
    his own life, and for sexual relations by which the species is preserved.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Regarding these he says
    <span style="font-weight: bold">fulfilling the will of the flesh</span>,
    doing what the flesh delights in. “And they who are in the flesh cannot
    please God” (Rom 8:8). Another concupiscence exists, that of thought. These
    desires do not spring from the flesh but from the appetitive faculty of the
    soul, such as the ambition for honors, for one’s own excellence and the
    like. Of these he states
    <span style="font-weight: bold">and of our thoughts</span>, that is,
    inordinate desires are followed once they are caused by the prompting of our
    reflections.

    Original sin is hinted at in
    <span style="font-weight: bold"
      >and we were by nature children of wrath</span

    to the Jews also: “Wherefore as by one man sin entered into this world, and
    by sin death; and so death passed upon all men, in whom all have sinned”
    (Rom 5:12). Baptism cleanses only the individual person who receives it from
    original sin; his children must also be baptized. Likewise, circumcision
    cleansed only the individual from original sin; the children they begot
    still had to be circumcised. Thus he says
    <span style="font-weight: bold">we were by nature</span>, that is, from the

        After exaggerating their state of festering sin (2:1), the Apostle
        recounts here the blessing of the grace of justification. Concerning
        which he does two things:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
        First, he sets down the blessing itself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Secondly, he explains it (2:8).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        The blessing is described with reference to its three causes:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
        First, the efficient cause.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
        Secondly, the formal or exemplary cause (2:5).
      </p>
      <p
        style="
          text-align: justify;
          margin-left: 0.259167in;
          margin-bottom: 0.125in;
        "
      >
        Thirdly, the final cause (2:7).
      </p></a
    >
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <a name="2" id="2"
      >The efficient cause of the divine blessing of justification is God’s
      charity:
      <span style="font-weight: bold"
        >But God, who is rich in mercy, for his exceeding charity wherewith he
        loved us</span
      >. He states
      <span style="font-weight: bold">for his exceeding charity</span> since we
      can think of a fourfold goodness and efficacy of the divine love. First,
      it brought us into existence: “For you love all things that are, and hate
      none of the things which you have made” (Wis 11:25). Second, he made us
      according to his own image, capable of enjoying his own beatitude: “He
      [God] came from Miribath-Kadesh [Vul & lit: thousands of saints]. At his
      right hand a fire blazed forth. He has loved the people; all the saints
      are in his hand” (Deut 33:2-3). Third, he renewed men corrupted by sin:
      “Yea, I have loved them with an everlasting love; therefore have I drawn
      thee, taking pity on thee” (Jer 31:3). Fourth, for our salvation he gave
      over his own Son: “For God so loved the world, as to give his only
      begotten Son” (Jn 3:16). Hence Gregory exclaims: “O the incalculable love
      of your charity! To redeem slaves you delivered up your Son.”</a

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    He then asserts <span style="font-weight: bold">who is rich in mercy</span>.
    When a man’s love is caused from the goodness of the one he loves, then that
    man who loves does so out of justice, inasmuch as it is just that he love
    such a person. When, however, love causes the goodness in the beloved, then
    it is a love springing from mercy. The love with which God loves us produces
    goodness in us; hence mercy is presented here as the root of the divine
    love: “The favors of Yahweh I will recall, the praises of Yahweh for all
    that Yahweh has done for us... which he has given according to his kindness
    and the multitude of his mercies” (Is 63:7). And “where is your zealous care
    and might, your surge of pity and mercy toward me?” (Is 63:15).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    God is said to be
    <span style="font-weight: bold">rich in mercy</span> because he possesses an
    infinite and unfailing mercy, which man does not. For man has a mercy that
    is bounded or limited in three ways. Firstly, in bestowing temporal
    benefits, man’s mercy is restricted by the amount of his own possessions.
    “If you have little, do not be afraid to give from that little” (Tob 4:8);
    whereas God is “enriches all who call upon him” (Rom 10:12). Secondly, the
    mercy of man is limited since he can only pardon offenses against himself.
    Even with these there ought to be a certain qualification; he should not
    forgive so indiscriminately that whoever is pardoned becomes more bold,
    prone and ready to offend again. “For, because sentence is not speedily
    pronounced against the evil, the hearts of the sons of men are fully set to
    do evil” (Eccl 8:11). But nothing can harm God and hence he can forgive
    every offense: “If you sin, what harm do you do to him?” And a little
    further on, “And if you act rightly, what do you give him?” (Job 35:6 & 7).
    Thirdly, a man shows mercy in remitting punishment; yet here too a
    qualification must be observed: he must not contravene the justice of a
    higher law. God, on the other hand, can remit all punishment since he is not
    bound by any higher law: “Who gave him charge over the earth? Or who else
    set the land in its place?” (Job 34:13). Thus the mercy of God is infinite
    because it is not limited by a scarcity of wealth, nor is it restricted
    through a fear of injury, nor by any higher law.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    The exemplary cause of the blessing is that it is granted in Christ. In
    reference to this he states
    <span style="font-weight: bold"
      >even when we were dead in sins, he has quickened us together in
      Christ</span
    >. He touches upon a triple blessing: justification, resurrection from the
    dead, and ascension into heaven—through these three we are assimilated to
    Christ.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    He states, that the whole text might be read, concerning the first:
    <span style="font-weight: bold"
      >God, who is rich in mercy, for his exceeding charity wherewith he loved
      us, even when we were dead in sins, has quickened us together in
      Christ</span
    >, he has made us live together with Christ. “He will revive us after two
    days: on the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight”
    (Hos 6:3). He has quickened us, I say, through a life of justice: “Who
    placed us among the living” (Ps 66:9). This occurs in Christ, that is,
    through the grace of Christ by whose grace you are saved. “For we are saved
    by hope” (Rom 8:24). Regarding the second, he says
    <span style="font-weight: bold">and has raised us up together</span> with
    Christ—for the soul [this has happened] in reality, in hope the body [awaits
    it]. “He who raised Jesus Christ from the dead will give life to your mortal
    bodies also through his Spirit which dwells in you” (Rom 8:11). In respect
    to the third he asserts
    <span style="font-weight: bold"
      >and has made us sit together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus</span
    >, now through hope, and in the future in reality. For, as John 12 (26) puts
    it: “Where I am, there also will my servant be. If anyone serves me, my
    Father will honor him.” Also the Apocalypse 3 (21): “He who conquers I will
    grant him to sit with me in my throne; as I myself have conquered and sat
    down with my Father on his throne.”
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    In these the Apostle uses the past tense in place of the future, proclaiming
    as already accomplished what has yet to be done on account of the certitude
    of hope. Thus God has <span style="font-weight: bold">quickened us</span> in
    soul, he <span style="font-weight: bold">has raised us up</span> in body,
    and <span style="font-weight: bold">has made us sit</span> with Christ in
    both [body and soul].

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Consequently, when he says
    <span style="font-weight: bold">that he might shew in the ages to come</span
    >, he discloses the final cause of the blessing which has been given. It can
    be read in two ways, depending on whether
    <span style="font-weight: bold">ages to come</span> pertains to the present
    or future life. If it applies to this life, then age is a certain measure of
    time and a period of one generation. As though he affirmed: I am saying that
    we who are the first-fruits of those who sleep (cf. 1 Thes 4:12 ff.),
    <span style="font-weight: bold"
      >he has quickened in Christ that he might show in the ages to come</span
    >, to those who will exist after us, the abundant riches of his grace. And
    this is not on account of our merits, but in his own
    <span style="font-weight: bold">goodness towards us in Christ Jesus</span>,
    that is, through Christ Jesus. “Christ Jesus came into the world to save
    sinners; of these I am the foremost. But I have received mercy for this
    reason, that in me first Christ Jesus might display his perfect patience, as
    an example for those who would believe in him for eternal life” (1 Tim.
    1:15-16). Therefore, God has communicated copious gifts of grace to the
    early saints that later generations would more easily be converted to
    Christ.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Or, <span style="font-weight: bold">age</span> can be taken in reference to
    the next life, of which Sirach 24 (14) states: “For eternity I shall not
    cease to exist.” Although there will then be only one age, since it will be
    eternity, he nevertheless says
    <span style="font-weight: bold">in the ages to come</span> on account of the
    numerous saints who will participate in eternity; there are said to be as
    many ages as there are shared-in eternities. Psalm 145 (13) speaks of these
    ages: “Your kingdom is an eternal kingdom.” In this sense he affirms: I say
    that he has vivified us in hope, namely, through Christ or in grace
    <span style="font-weight: bold">that he might shew in the ages to come</span
    >, that is, that he might bring to perfection in the next life,
    <span style="font-weight: bold">the abundant riches of his grace</span>.
    Such an abundant grace with which, even in this world, he forgives many sins
    and confers the greatest of gifts, will superabound even more in the next
    life, since there it will be enjoyed unfailingly. “I have come that they
    might have a life,” namely, of grace in this world, “and have it more
    abundantly” in the fatherland of glory (Jn 10:10).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    This occurs <span style="font-weight: bold">in his own goodness</span>.
    “Israel, how good God is to those who are pure of heart!” (Ps 73:1). “Yahweh
    is good to those who wait for him, to the soul that seeks him” (Lam 3:25).
    This is <span style="font-weight: bold">towards us</span>; it is beyond our
    desire, our understanding, and beyond our capacity: “No eye has seen any God
    but you acting like this for those who wait for him” (Is 64:4). And this is
    <span style="font-weight: bold">in Christ Jesus</span>, that is, through
    Christ Jesus; for as grace is bestowed on us through Christ, so also is
    glory communicated, which is grace brought to perfection. “Yahweh God
    bestows favors and honors” (Ps 84:12). Through the same person we are
    beatified, through whom we are justified.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    He says <span style="font-weight: bold">that he might shew</span> because
    the treasure of grace is hidden within us; we have it “in earthen vessels”
    as 2 Corinthians 4 (7) expresses it. “Behold what manner of charity the
    Father has bestowed upon us, that we should be called and should be the sons
    of God,” after which comes: “We know that when he shall appear we shall be
    like to him” (1 Jn 3:1-2). But that hidden treasure, although it has not yet
    been revealed, is shown in the ages to come, since in the fatherland
    everything relating to the transparent glory of the saints will be unveiled
    before us. “The sufferings of this time are not worthy to be compared with
    the glory to come that shall be revealed in us” (Rom 8: 18).

        have been freed from sin, he inserted [the thought] that we had been
        saved by Christ’s grace (2:5). Now he intends to prove that; he makes
        two points concerning it:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
        First, he sets down his intention.

        "
      >
        Secondly, he clarifies the point in question (2:8b).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        I rightly declared, he says of the first, by whose grace you were saved;
        and indeed, I still confidently say
        <span style="font-weight: bold">For</span>, in place of “because,”
        <span style="font-weight: bold">by grace you are saved</span>. “By the
        grace of God, I am what I am” (1 Cor 15: 10), “being justified freely by
        his grace” (Rom 3:24). For to be saved is the same as to be justified.
        Salvation implies a freedom from dangers; hence, man’s perfect salvation
        will be in eternal life when he will be immune from all dangers, as a
        ship is said to be safe when it has arrived at port. “You shall call
        your walls ‘salvation’ and your gates ‘praise’” (Is 60: 18).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Men receive the hope of this salvation when they are justified from sin
        in the present, and are thus referred to as saved according to the
        expression of Romans 8 (24): “For we are saved by hope.” But this
        salvation of grace is <span style="font-weight: bold">by faith</span> in
        Christ. In the justification of an adult who has sinned, the movement of
        faith towards God coincides with the infusion of grace. “Your faith has
        saved you. Go in peace” (Lk 8:48). “Being justified, therefore, by
        faith, we are at peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ” (Rom
        5:1).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        When he next says
        <span style="font-weight: bold">and that not of yourselves</span>, he
        clarifies what he had spoken of:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
        First, regarding faith, which is the foundation of the whole spiritual
        edifice.

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <a name="3" id="3"
      >He eliminates two errors concerning the first point. The first of these
      is that, since he had said we are saved by faith, any one can hold the
      opinion that faith itself originates within ourselves and that to believe
      is determined by our own wishes. Therefore to abolish this he states
      <span style="font-weight: bold">and that not of yourselves</span>. Free
      will is inadequate for the act of faith since the contents of faith are
      above human reason. “Matters too great for human understanding have been
      shown to you” (Sir 3:25). “No one knows what pertains to God except the
      Spirit of God” (1 Cor 2:11). That a man should believe, therefore, cannot
      occur from himself unless God gives it, according to that text of Wisdom 9
      (17): “Who could ever have known your will, had you not given Wisdom and
      sent your Holy Spirit from above.”</a

    For this reason he adds for it is the gift of God, namely, faith itself.
    “For you have been granted, for the sake of Christ, not only to believe in
    him, but also to suffer for him” (Phil 1:29). “To another, faith is given in
    the same Spirit” (1 Cor 12:9).
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    The second error he rejects is that anyone can believe that faith is given
    by God to us on the merit of our preceding actions. To exclude this he adds
    <span style="font-weight: bold">Not of</span> preceding
    <span style="font-weight: bold">works</span> that we merited at one time to
    be saved; for this is the grace, as was mentioned above, and according to
    Romans 11 (6): “If by grace, it is not now by works; otherwise grace is no
    more grace.” He follows with the reason why God saves man by faith without
    any preceding merits,
    <span style="font-weight: bold">that no man may glory</span> in himself but
    refer all the glory to God. “Not for our sake, Yahweh, not for our sake, but
    for the sake of your name display your glory, because of your kindness,
    because of your faithfulness” (Ps 115:1-2). “That no flesh should glory in
    his sight. It is due to him that you are in Christ Jesus, who became for us
    wisdom from God, justice, sanctification and redemption” (1 Cor 1:29-30).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Next (2: 10), he clarifies what he had said regarding grace. Concerning this
    he does two things:
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
    First, he clarifies the infusion of grace.
  </p>
  <p
    style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in"
  >
    Secondly, he declares the predestination of grace (2: l0b).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    There are two essential characteristics of grace, they have already been
    spoken of. The first of these is that what exists through grace is not
    present in man through himself or by himself, but from the gift of God. In
    reference to this he states
    <span style="font-weight: bold">For we are his workmanship</span>, whatever
    good we possess is not from ourselves but from the action of God. “Know that
    Yahweh is God: he made us, the Almighty” (Ps 99:3). “Is he not your Father,
    who created you, made you and fashioned you?” (Deut. 32:6). This is
    immediately linked with what went before:
    <span style="font-weight: bold"
      >that no man may glory for we are his workmanship</span
    >. Or, it can be joined with what was said above:
    <span style="font-weight: bold">For by grace you are saved</span>.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    The second essential characteristic of grace is that it is not from previous
    works; this is expressed when he adds
    <span style="font-weight: bold">created</span>. To create anything is to
    produce it from nothing; hence, when anyone is justified without preceding
    merits, he can be said to have been created as though made from nothing.
    This creative action of justification occurs through the power of Christ
    communicating the Holy Spirit. On this account he adds
    <span style="font-weight: bold">in Christ Jesus</span>, that is, through
    Christ Jesus. “For [in Christ Jesus] neither circumcision nor uncircumcision
    means anything, but a new creation” (Gal. 6:15). “Send forth your Spirit,
    they are created anew” (Ps 104:30). Moreover, not only are the habits of
    virtue
    <a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote12',%20WPFootnote12%20)"
      ><img
        src="footnoteicon.gif"

        );
        document.write("<\/span>");
      }
    </script>
    and grace given to us, but we are inwardly renewed through the Spirit in
    order to act uprightly. Whence he goes on
    <span style="font-weight: bold">in good works</span> since the good works
    themselves are [made possible] to us by God. “For you have accomplished all
    we have done” (Is 26:12).
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Since “those he predestined he also called” through grace, as Romans 8 (30)
    expresses it, therefore he adds something concerning predestination, saying,
    <span style="font-weight: bold">which</span> good works
    <span style="font-weight: bold">God has prepared</span>. For predestination
    is nothing else than the pre-arrangement of God’s blessings, among which
    blessings our good works themselves are numbered. God is said to prepare
    something for us insofar as be disposes himself to give it to us. “Provide
    the land with grain, for you prepared it for this” (Ps 64:10).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Lest anyone imagine that good works are prepared for us by God in such a way
    that we do not cooperate in their realization through our free will, he
    annexes <span style="font-weight: bold">that we should walk in them</span>.
    As though he said: Thus has he prepared them for us, that we might perform
    them for ourselves through our free will. “For we are God’s co-workers” (1
    Cor 3:9). For this reason the Apostle said of himself: “By the grace of God,
    I am what I am. And his grace in me has not been in vain; rather I have
    worked harder than all of them—yet not I, but the grace of God that is with
    me” (1 Cor 15:10). He expressly said we should walk to designate a progress
    in good works, in line with that saying: “Walk while you have the light, so
    that darkness may not overtake you” (Jn 12:35); “Walk then as children of
    the light” (Eph 5:8).

        Once he has outlined God’s blessing to the Gentiles in freeing them from
        sin (2:1), the Apostle recalls the favor shown them in their liberation
        from the state of paganism. Concerning this he does two things:
      </p>

        Secondly, he describes the blessings granted them in their present state
        (2:13).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        He does two things about the first:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">

        Thus he says <span style="font-weight: bold">For which cause</span>,
        that you might advert to the fact that everything comes to us by God’s
        grace, be mindful: “Remember and do not forget how you provoked Yahweh
        your God in the dessert” (Deut 9:7). “That you may remember the day of
        your coming out of Egypt, all the days of your life” (Deut 16:3).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        When he states
        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >that you, being heretofore Gentiles</span

        Secondly, as regards the goods of which they were deprived (2:12).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        In reference to the first he exposes three evils. First was the crime of
        paganism, by which they were accustomed to worship idols; this he
        implies in
        <span style="font-weight: bold">that you being heretofore Gentiles</span
        >. “You know that when you were heathens, you went to dumb idols
        according as you were led” (1 Cor 12:2). Some books have “You who were
        Gentiles” and omit everything until “But now in Christ Jesus...” (v.
        13). Secondly, he discusses their carnal way of life, saying
        <span style="font-weight: bold">in the flesh</span>, that is, living
        lustfully. “And they who are in the flesh cannot please God” (Rom 8:8).
        Thirdly, he speaks of the repugnance and contempt with which the Jews
        despised them. Hence he mentions
        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >who are called uncircumcision by that</span
        >
        type of circumcision
        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >which is called circumcision in the flesh</span
        >
        as the circumcised Jews performed this circumcision. He says
        <span style="font-weight: bold">made by hands</span> to distinguish it
        from the spiritual circumcision spoken of in Colossians 2 (11-13): “In
        whom [Christ] you also were circumcised with a circumcision not
        hand-made, by putting off the body of the flesh, but in the circumcision
        of Christ, buried with him in baptism... And when you were dead in your
        sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, he has brought you to life
        together with him, forgiving you all offenses.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">

    12).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Regarding the first he sets down three sacraments they were deprived of
    sharing in. They were, first of all, without the fundamental truth of
    Christ; whence he affirms
    <span style="font-weight: bold"
      >that you were at that time without Christ,</span
    >
    without the promise of a Christ as was made to the Jews. “I will raise up
    for David a just branch; and a king shall reign and shall be wise” (Jer
    23:5). “Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Sion, shout for joy, O daughter of
    Jerusalem: See, your King is coming to you, triumphant and victorious” (Zech
    9:9).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    They were deprived, in the second place, from the society of the saints as
    long as they remained in paganism. He says they were
    <span style="font-weight: bold">aliens from Israel’s way of life</span>,
    since the Jews were not permitted to mix with the Gentiles. “You shall not
    make any league with them, nor show them mercy. Neither shall you make
    marriages with them” (Deut 7:2-3). “Jews do not communicate with Samaritans”
    (Jn 4:9). With respect to those who—not without contempt—were accepted into
    Judaism when they became proselytes he adds and
    <span style="font-weight: bold">strangers to the testaments</span>. As
    though he asserted: These converts, when they went over to Judaism and
    became proselytes, were accepted to partake of God’s covenants as strangers
    rather than as citizens. He says testaments in the plural
    <a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote14',%20WPFootnote14%20)"

    since the Old Testament was offered the Jews and the New was promised. “The
    Lord made his covenant rest upon the head of Jacob” (Sir 44:25) can be
    understood of the Old Testament. God promised to give them another covenant:
    “And I will make an everlasting covenant with them” (Bar 2:35). This latter
    was granted to those “to whom belong the adoption as children, the glory and
    the giving of the Law” (Rom 9:4).
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    He also sets down another blessing of which they were deprived: the hope of
    future goods, when he says
    <span style="font-weight: bold">having no hope of the promise</span> since
    “To Abraham were the promises made and to his seed” (Gal 3:16).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Finally, he writes of the greatest injury from which they suffered,
    ignorance of God.
    <span style="font-weight: bold">And without God in this world</span> means
    without the knowledge of God. “God has shown himself in Judah” (Ps 76:2),
    but not among the Gentiles: “Not in the passion of lust, like the Gentiles
    that do not know God” (1 Thes 4:5). This must be understood of the knowledge
    obtainable through faith, for Romans 1 (21) speaks of their natural
    knowledge: “Although they knew God, they did not glorified him as God or
    give him thanks.”
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    After this he recalls the blessings offered them through Christ in their

    The first part again has two sections:

  <p

    in him” (1 Jn 4:16). “For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor
    uncircumcision means anything, but a new creature” (Gal 6:15).

    that is, through his blood by which Christ draws you: “And I, if I be lifted

        Thirdly, its purpose (2:15b).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Christ is the cause of this drawing together, for which reason he
        affirms
        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >For he is our peace, who has made both one</span
        >. This is an emphatic way of speaking to better express the reality, as
        though he said: Rightly do I say that you are drawn near each other, but
        this occurs through Christ since he is the cause of
        <span style="font-weight: bold">our peace</span>. “My peace I give you”
        (Jn 14:27). It is usual to adopt this way of speaking when the totality
        of the effect depends on its cause; for instance, we say that God
        himself is our salvation because whatever salvation is present in us is
        caused by God. In the same way, whatever peace we possess is caused by
        Christ and, as a result, whatever convergence [men have with one
        another]. For when a man is at peace with another he can securely walk
        towards or approach him. Hence,
        <span style="font-weight: bold">he is our peace</span>. Angels announced
        peace at his birth: “Glory to God in the highest; and on earth peace to
        those he is pleased with” (Lk 2:14). Indeed, while Christ lived in the
        body the world enjoyed the greatest peace, the like of which it had
        never before possessed. “May the just man flourish in his days, and
        peace pour down till the moon be no more” (Ps 72:7). He himself
        proclaimed peace when he arose from the dead: “He said to them: ‘Peace
        be with you’” (Lk 24:36).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        It follows that he
        <span style="font-weight: bold">has made both one</span>, joining into
        unity both the Jews who worshiped the true God and the Gentiles who were
        alienated from God’s cult. “And other sheep I have, that are not of this
        fold; them also I must bring. And they shall bear my voice; and there
        shall be one fold and one shepherd” (Jn 10:16). “One king shall be king
        over them all. And they shall no more be two nations, neither shall they
        be divided any more into two kingdoms” (Ez 37:22).

    <span style="font-weight: bold">of partition.</span> The method, then,
    consists in removing what is divisive. To understand the text we should
    imagine a large field with many men gathered on it. But a high barrier was
    thrown across the middle of it, segregating the people so that they did not
    appear as one people but two. Whoever would remove the barrier would unite
    the crowds of men into one multitude, one people would be formed.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    What is said here should be understood in this way. For the world is likened
    to a field: “The field is the world” (Mt 13:38); this field of the world is
    crowded with men, “Increase and multiply, and fill the earth” (Gen 1:28). A
    barrier, however, runs down the field, some are on one side and the rest on
    the other. The Old Law can be termed such a barrier, its carnal observances
    kept the Jews confined: “Before the faith came, we were under the
    guardianship of the law, confined in anticipation of the faith which was to
    be revealed” (Gal 3:23). Christ was symbolized through the Old Law: “See, he
    stands behind our wall” (Cant. 2:9). Christ, however, has put an end to this
    barrier and, since no division remained, the Jews and the Gentiles became
    one people. This is what he says: I affirm that
    <span style="font-weight: bold">he has made both one</span> by the method of
    <span style="font-weight: bold">breaking down the middle barrier</span>.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    I say a barrier <span style="font-weight: bold">of partition</span> and not
    a wall. A barrier of partition is one in which the stones are not mortared
    together with cement; it is not built to last permanently but only for a
    specified time. The Old Law was a barrier of partition for two reasons.
    First, because it was not mortared together with charity which is, as it
    were, the cement uniting individuals among themselves and everyone together
    with Christ. “Be careful to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of
    peace” (Eph 4:3). The Old Law is a law of fear, persuading men to observe
    its commands by punishments and threats. While that law was in force, those
    who kept it out of love belonged by anticipation, as Augustine holds, to the
    New Testament which is the law of love.

    “For you have not received the spirit of bondage again in fear but you have
    received the spirit of adoption of sons” (Rom 8:15). Secondly, the Old Law
    is a barrier of partition because it was not meant to last permanently but
    only for a definite time. “As long as the heir is a child, he is no
    different from a servant, though he is master of all; but he is under tutors
    and governors until the time appointed by his father. So we also, when we
    were children, were slaves to the elemental powers of the world” (Gal
    4:1-3).
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    A problem arises here since he says
    <span style="font-weight: bold"
      >breaking down the barrier of partition</span
    >
    and, on the contrary, Matthew 5 (17) states: “Do not think that I have come
    to destroy the law or the prophets. I have not come to destroy, but to
    fulfill.” I reply. The Old Law contained both moral and ceremonial precepts.
    The moral commandments were not destroyed by Christ but fulfilled in the
    counsels he added and in his explanations of what the Scribes and Pharisees
    had wrongly interpreted. So he says in Matthew 5 (20): “Unless your justice
    abounds more than that of the Scribes and Pharisees, you shall not enter
    into the kingdom of heaven.” And further on: “You have heard that it has
    been said: ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ But I say to
    you: Love your enemies; do good to those who hate you; and pray for those
    who persecute and calumniate you” (Mt 5:43-44). He abolished the ceremonial
    precepts with regard to what they were in themselves, but he fulfilled them
    with regard to what they prefigured, adding what was symbolized to the
    symbol.

    It should be understood, therefore, that in saying breaking he refers to the
    observance of the carnal law. To break down this barrier of partition is to
    destroy the hostility between the Jews and Gentiles. The former wanted to

    from which anger and jealousy sprung up between them. But certainly, Christ
    has abolished this animosity in his assumed flesh. For at his birth peace
    was immediately proclaimed to men (cf. Lk 2:14). Or, in his immolated flesh
    since “He has given himself for us as an offering and sacrifice to God” (Eph
    5:2). In this sacrifice all the former sacrifices were fulfilled and came to
    an end. “For by a single offering he has perfected for ever those who are
    sanctified” (Heb. 10:14).

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    What that barrier was he implies when he says
    <span style="font-weight: bold">the law of commandments,</span> as though he
    said: <span style="font-weight: bold">Breaking down the barrier</span> which
    is <span style="font-weight: bold">the law of the commandments.</span> The
    Old Law is termed the law of commandments, not because other laws lacked
    injunctions since the New Law has commandments: “A new commandment I give
    you” (Jn 13:34). There are two reasons why [this title is applied to the Old
    Law]. One is the great number of legal injunctions it contained, so many
    that men could not possibly keep them all, according to that text of Acts 15
    (10): “Now, therefore, why tempt God to put a yoke upon the necks of the
    disciples which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear?” And Job
    11 (6): “That he would tell you the secrets of wisdom, which have multiple
    applications.” Or, it is called
    <span style="font-weight: bold">of commandments</span> meaning “of works.”
    “Where then is your boasting? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? No, but
    by the law of faith” (Rom 3:27). Thus the baptism of John was called a
    baptism of water since it would cleanse only externally and not sanctify
    interiorly. Likewise, the Old Law was termed of works be cause it ordained
    only what must be done, but did not confer the grace through which men would
    have been assisted in fulfilling the law. The New Law, on the other hand,
    regulates what must be done by giving commands, and it aids in fulfilling
    them by bestowing grace.

    asserts: “The law has a shadow of the good things to come, not the very

    divided they could not be united in that law. But Christ took the place of
    the law, and faith in him, as the truth of those symbols, made them one in
    himself. “That they may be one as we also are one” (Jn 17:22); “For, where

    the grace he bestows: “For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor
    uncircumcision has any meaning, but a new creature” (Gal 6:15); “and be

    new commands he sets forth: “A new commandment I give you: that you love one
    another as I have loved you” (Jn 13:34).

    This appears to correspond to the Apostle’s intention, yet in a Gloss the
    barrier is duplicated. On the side of the Jews the law is set up as the
    obstacle, while on the Gentile’s side it is idolatry.

    It should be realized that love of neighbor is the way to peace with God;
    for, as is mentioned in 1 John 4 (20): “He who does not love his brother

    Hence, he first mentions the peace among themselves Christ brought to men
    and then the peace of men with God. For this reason he says
    <span style="font-weight: bold">that he might reconcile both</span> the
    united peoples <span style="font-weight: bold">in one body</span> of the
    Church, namely, in Christ. “We, being many, are one body in Christ” (Rom
    12:5). Then he reconciles us
    <span style="font-weight: bold">to God</span> through faith and charity:
    “For God indeed was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself” (2 Cor 5:
    19).
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    He achieved this by the cross,
    <span style="font-weight: bold">killing the enmities in himself</span>. In
    fulfilling the Old Testament symbols, he killed the hostility that had
    arisen through the law between the Jews and the Gentiles. But the hostility
    that existed between God and men through sin, he killed in himself when he
    blotted out sin through the death of the Cross. He “who gave himself for our
    sins” (Gal 1-4); “Christ was offered once to carry away the sins of many”
    (Heb. 9:28). Therefore, he says
    <span style="font-weight: bold">killing the enmities</span>, that is, sins,
    <span style="font-weight: bold">in himself</span>, meaning in the immolation
    of his own body. “Making peace through the blood of his cross, both as to
    the things that are on earth and the things that are in heaven” (Col 1:20).
    “When we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son”
    (Rom 5:10). “God wanted all fullness to dwell in him, and through him, to
    reconcile all things unto himself’ (Col 1:19-20). Since Christ satisfied
    sufficiently for our sins, reconciliation occurred as a consequence of his
    having paid the price (cf. 1 Cor 6:20).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    The manifestation of the reconciliation is set down in
    <span style="font-weight: bold">And coming, he preached</span> where he

  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    The reconciliation of God to man through Christ has been made known because
    Christ himself not only reconciled us to God and destroyed the hostilities,
    but also <span style="font-weight: bold">coming</span> in the flesh
    <span style="font-weight: bold">he preached</span> and proclaimed
    <span style="font-weight: bold">peace</span>. Or,
    <span style="font-weight: bold">coming</span> after the resurrection when he
    stood in the midst of the disciples and said. “Peace be to you” (Lk 24:36).
    “He has sent me to bring good news to the afflicted, to heal the
    brokenhearted” (Is 61:1). “How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of
    the messenger who preaches peace, brings good news and announces salvation”
    (Is 52:7).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    <span style="font-weight: bold">He preached</span>, I say, not to one people
    only but <span style="font-weight: bold">to you</span> Gentiles
    <span style="font-weight: bold">that were afar off</span>; although not in
    his own person, nonetheless he proclaimed peace to you through his Apostles.
    “Go, therefore, and teach all nations” (Mt 28:19). “Hear, you that are far
    off, what I have done: and you that are near, know my strength” (Is 33:13).
    Christ in his own person announced the
    <span style="font-weight: bold">peace to them that were near</span>. “For I
    say that Christ became a servant of the circumcised to show God’s
    truthfulness, to confirm the promises made to the patriarchs” (Rom 15:8).
    [Is 54:15 Vulgate misses point].
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    He indicates the cause and form of peace by saying
    <span style="font-weight: bold">For by him we have access both,</span> that
    is, the two peoples, <span style="font-weight: bold">in one Spirit</span>,
    meaning we are joined by the union of the Holy Spirit. “Careful to keep the
    unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace” (Eph 4:3). “One and the same
    Spirit produces all these” (1 Cor 12:11). The way we enjoy access to the
    Father is through Christ since Christ works through the Holy Spirit. “Now if
    anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to him” (Rom
    8:9). Hence, whatever happens through the Holy Spirit also occurs through
    Christ.

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    When he says <span style="font-weight: bold">to the Father,</span> [our

    in the Father, and the Father and the Son are in the Holy Spirit. In saying
    <span style="font-weight: bold">to the Father</span> he especially shows
    that whatever the Son possesses he has from the Father, and that he

        Once he has made it clear that the Gentiles have been admitted to
        spiritual blessings together with the Jews (2:13), he goes on to teach
        that in these blessings the Gentiles are not of less eminence than the
        Jews themselves; they enjoy a completely equal access to Christ’s
        blessings. In reference to this be does two things:

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">

        Secondly, he clarifies this presentation by an example (2:20).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Regarding the first he makes two points:
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
        First, he excludes what was [true of] their past state from their

          >Now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners,</span
        >
        and it should be recognized that a similar conclusion follows from the
        premises. First, indeed, from this, that both [Jews and Gentiles] are
        united and are reconciled to God. In the second place, they both have
        access in one Spirit to the Father. Together they are conformed to the
        whole Trinity; to the Father whom they approach, to the Son through
        whom, and to the Holy Spirit in whom they have access in unity. Hence,
        they in no way lack a share in spiritual goods.

      >To understand the text it must be realized that the community of the
      faithful are sometimes referred to as a house in the Scriptures: “that you
      may know how to behave thyself in the household of God, which is the
      church of the living God” (1 Tim. 3:15). At other times it is called a
      city: “Jerusalem, which is built as a city” (Ps 121:3). A city possesses a

    these differ in two respects. For those who belong to the domestic community
    share with one another private activities; but those belonging to the civil
    community have in common with one another public activities. Secondly, the
    head of the family governs the domestic community; while those in the civil
    community are ruled by a king. Hence [the analogy]: what the king is in the
    realm, this the father is in the home.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    The community of the faithful contains within it something of the city and
    something of the home. If the ruler of the community is thought of, he is a
    father: “Our Father, who art in heaven” (Mt 6:9); “I though you would me
    Father and would not turn from following me” (Jer 3:19). In this
    perspective, the community is a home. But if you consider the subjects
    themselves, it is a city since they have in common with one another the
    particular acts of faith, hope and charity. In this way, if the faithful are
    considered in themselves, the community is a civil one; if, however, the
    ruler is thought of, it is a domestic community.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    This is why the Apostle writes the two words here:
    <span style="font-weight: bold">strangers and foreigners</span>. For what
    the stranger is to the home, that the foreigner is to the city. A stranger
    is an outsider, as it were, of a family: “It is a miserable life to go from
    house to house, and where you are a guest you may not open your mouth” (Sir
    29:24). A foreigner is as an alien to the city into which he comes. As
    though the Apostle said: Formerly you were estranged from the community of
    believers, as strangers to a home and foreigners to a state—and as the
    proselytes were to the Old Law—but this is true no longer, for you are no
    more strangers and foreigners. [Is 54:15 Vulgate misses the point.]
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Next (v, 19b), he draws the conclusion of what their present state is,
    stating but you are
    <span style="font-weight: bold"
      >fellow citizens with the saints and the domestics of God.</span
    >
    As if he had said: Since the community of the faithful is termed a city in
    relation to its subjects, and a home relative to its ruler, the assembly to
    which you are called is the city of the saints and the house of God. “He who
    made perfect the glorious dwellings of Jacob speaks in you, city of God:”
    (Ps 87:3). Hence Augustine remarks: “Two loves have formed two cities. For
    the love of God, even to the “contempt of self,” namely, of the man loving,
    “builds the heavenly city of Jerusalem. But the love of self, even to the
    contempt of God, builds the city of Babylon.

    Consequently, when he says
    <span style="font-weight: bold"

    he clarifies what has been said. It is customary in the Scriptures that the
    figure, called metonymy, is used where the container is substituted for what
    it contains, as a house sometimes refers to those who are in the house. The
    Apostle employs this figure of speech concerning those who are in the house
    of God, the faithful; as though they were one house, he compares them to a
    building. Regarding this he does two things:
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">
    First, he sets down what he intended.
  </p>
  <p
    style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in"
  >
    Secondly, he shows that the Ephesians themselves have become parts of this
    building (2:22).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Concerning the first he does two things:

  <p

  >
    Secondly, its construction or completeness (2:21).

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">

    The Apostles and Prophets are the secondary foundation. In this regard he
    states that they [the Ephesians] are not strangers but fellow citizens who
    belong already to the spiritual edifice which is
    <span style="font-weight: bold"
      >built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets,</span
    >
    that is, upon the teaching of the Apostles and Prophets. Or,
    <span style="font-weight: bold"
      >upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets</span
    >
    means upon Christ who is the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets. As
    though he said: You are built upon the same foundation on which the Apostles
    and Prophets, who were Jewish, were built.
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    These two interpretations only differ in words. Yet the first is more suited
    [to the context]; if the second was the better one there would be no point
    in adding
    <span style="font-weight: bold"
      >Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone</span
    >
    since he would be the principal foundation. Hence this is more in harmony
    with the first; although Christ would be both the chief stone and the
    principal foundation. In meaning, however, they are in no way different
    since it is the same to say that Christ is the foundation, and the teaching
    of the Apostles and Prophets is; after all, they proclaimed Christ alone,
    and not themselves. To accept their doctrine is to accept Christ crucified:
    “We preach Christ crucified” (1 Cor 1:23); and “We have the mind of Christ”
    (1 Cor 2:16). 1 Peter 1 (12) affirms [of the Prophets]: “It was revealed to
    them that they were not serving themselves but you, in the things which are
    have been announced to you by those who preached the good news to you.”
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Notice that the Apostles are designated as foundations: “O city founded by
    him on the holy mountains” (Ps 87:1). I will lay your foundations with
    sapphires” (Is 54:11), that is, with saintly men. In the Apocalypse 21 (14)
    they are expressly called foundations: “And the wall of the city had twelve
    foundations, and on them were the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the
    Lamb.” They are referred to as foundations to the degree that their doctrine
    proclaims Christ. “Upon this rock I will build my Church” (Mt 16:18).

    Both <span style="font-weight: bold">Apostles and Prophets</span> are
    alluded to so that he might indicate that the doctrine of both is necessary
    for salvation. “Therefore, every scribe instructed in the kingdom of heaven
    is like a householder who brings forth out of his treasure new things and
    old” (Mt 13:52). Also, that he might show the harmony between the two, of
    the one with the other, since there is an identical foundation to both. What
    the Prophets foretold was to come, the Apostles proclaimed as accomplished.
    “Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, set apart for the
    gospel of God, which he had promised before by his prophets in the holy
    scriptures, concerning his Son” (Rom 1: 1-3).

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Christ Jesus alone is the principal foundation, in reference to this he says
    <span style="font-weight: bold">himself being the chief cornerstone.</span>
    Here he states three things about him; he is a stone, is placed at the
    corner, and is the chief one.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    He is a stone on account of the strength of the foundation. Whence Matthew 7
    (25) speaks of the house founded on a rock and built solidly; neither rains,
    nor floods, nor winds could destroy it. Such was not the case with the house
    built on sand. “You saw a stone cut out of the mountain without a hand being
    put to it” (Dan. 2:45). He is called a comer-stone on account of the
    convergence of both [Jews and Gentiles]. As two walls are joined at the
    comer, so in Christ the Jewish and Pagan peoples are united. “The stone
    which the builders rejected became the cornerstone” (Ps 118:22): “This is
    the stone rejected by you, the builders, which became the cornerstone. And
    there salvation in no one else” (Acts 4:11-12). And Christ applies this text
    to himself in Matthew 21 (42): “Have you never read in the Scriptures: The
    stone which the builders rejected has become the cornerstone?” He is
    referred to as the chief one by reason of his heavenly dignity: “See, I am
    laying a stone in Zion, a tested stone, a cornerstone, a precious stone, a
    foundation stone” (Is 28:16).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    The foundation of a spiritual edifice contrasts with that of a material
    building. For a material building rests on a foundation in the earth, the
    more important the foundation is, the deeper must it be. A spiritual
    structure, on the other hand, has its foundation in heaven; as a result, the
    more principal the foundation, the higher it necessarily Is Thus we could
    imagine a city, as it were, coming down from heaven with its foundation in
    heaven and the building itself appearing to come downward towards us below,
    according to that passage of the Apocalypse 21 (2): 1 John, saw the holy
    city, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God.”

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Next (v. 21), he treats of the building’s construction. In erecting any
    building four stages are requisite. First is the foundation of the edifice,
    second is the construction, third its increase, and fourth is the
    completion.

    He briefly touches on these.

  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    In saying <span style="font-weight: bold">in whom</span> he designates the
    foundation which principally is Christ and secondarily the doctrine of the
    Apostles and Prophets: “For other foundation no man can lay, but that which
    is laid; which is Christ Jesus” (1 Cor 3:11). He discusses the second
    briefly in
    <span style="font-weight: bold"
      >all the building being framed together.</span

    Understood allegorically, this signifies the Church herself which is built

    it signifies a sanctified soul, and then this building is erected when good
    works are built upon Christ. “Lady wisdom builds her house” (Prov. 14: 1);
    ‘Let each man take care how he builds on it” (1 Cor 3:10). With Christ as
    foundation, every spiritual edifice—whether of the Jews or of the
    Gentiles—is constructed by God’s power. “If Yahweh does not build the
    palace, in vain do its builders work on it.” (Ps 127:1). “Every house is
    built by someone; but the builder of all things is God” (Heb. 3:4). Yet the
    building is constructed instrumentally either by the man who builds up
    himself, or by prelates.

    He touches on the third when he states
    <span style="font-weight: bold">grows up into an holy temple</span>; this
    happens when the number of those saved increases. “The word of the Lord
    continued to spread, and the number of the disciples multiplied greatly in
    Jerusalem” (Acts 6:7). It also grows when a man makes progress in good
    works, and he grows in grace to the degree that he becomes a holy temple. A
    temple is the dwelling plate of God and must be holy: “The Most High
    sanctifies his dwelling.” (Ps 46:5). Since we should be inhabited by God,
    that he might live in us, we ought to prepare ourselves in order to be holy.
    “Do you not know that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God
    dwells in you?” (1 Cor 3:16). “See God’s dwelling is with men, and he will
    dwell with them” (Rev 21:3).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    But are we not temples of God from the instant we possess charity? I reply
    that it is so. And the more we progress, so much the more will God dwell
    within us. Hence, the fourth requisite to this building is its perfection
    and completion, which he states to be
    <span style="font-weight: bold">in the Lord.</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Finally (v. 22), he indicates how the Gentiles have become participants of
    the building. <span style="font-weight: bold">In which</span>

    building not only are the Jews incorporated, but also you Ephesians
    <span style="font-weight: bold">are built together,</span> that is, you are
    incorporated like the others. “Come to him, the living stone, rejected
    indeed by men, but chosen and honored by God. Be yourselves like living
    stones built into a spiritual house” (1 Pet 2:4-5). Therefore he adds
    <span style="font-weight: bold">into an habitation of God</span> that God
    may dwell in you through faith. “That Christ may dwell by faith in your
    hearts” (Eph 3:17). Yet this cannot happen without charity since “he who
    remains in love remains in God and God in him” (1 Jn 4:16). And charity is
    bestowed on us through the Holy Spirit: “The love of God is poured forth in
    our hearts by the Holy Spirit who is given to us” (Rom 5:5). Thus he adds
    <span style="font-weight: bold">in the Spirit</span>.
