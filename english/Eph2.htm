restored you to life when you were dead...&#8221; This reading corresponds to a few Vulgate codices and was adopted in\
the edition of Pope Sixtus V, although it is now recognized as an interploation.</p>\

var WPFootnote2 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>St. Thomas notes in his <i>Commentary on St. John&#8217;s Gospel. </i>Ch. 1, Lect. 5, that &#8220;world&#8221; has at least three different\
meanings in Scripture. Positively, it may refer to the world as created and ruled by God; or, as it is loved by God\
and brought to perfection through Christ&#8217;s redemption. Negatively, it refers to the world as perverted by sin and\
hostile to God, which is the meaning St. Paul gives it here. For the way in which these three are interrelated, and how\
the positive triumphs over the negative, cf. &#8220;Christian Humanism and St. John&#8217;s Theology of Life,&#8221; <i>Review for\
Religious, </i>March, 1964.</p>\

var WPFootnote3 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>Following a common Biblical approach, Aquinas equates idol worship with slavery to the devil, cf. Ps 95:5;\

</span>'

var WPFootnote4 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>The &#8220;lower bodies&#8221; are identical with the &#8220;corruptible and mutable causes&#8221; mentioned in note 35 above. Aquinas\
never went into a detailed speculation about which ranks of angels governed which parts of the universe. In a general\
way, it could be said that the Middle Hierarchy would govern the celestial bodies&#8212;the nine celestial spheres (cf.\
Appendix)&#8212;and the Lower Hierarchy the terrestrial sphere made up of the four elements of fire, water, earth and\
air; cf. <i>S.T.</i> I, 63, 7c. Yet St. Thomas only mentions this as an opinion of others and does not seem attracted to it;\
he reminds us that the lowest possible angel transcends the whole of material creation by reason of its pure\
spirituality, <i>ibid.</i>, 110, 1 ad 3.</p>\
</span>'

var WPFootnote5 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>St. John Damascene (c. 677-750), a priest and Doctor of the Church. The work referred to here is his celebrated\
<i>De Fide Orthodoxa</i>, 11, 4 (P.G. 94, 873-76).</p>\
</span>'

var WPFootnote6 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>This is the opinion of St. Gregory the Great in his <i>Homilia 34 in Evangelia, </i>P.L. 76, 1250. For a further discussion\
of this cf. <i>S.T.</i> I, 63, 7.</p>\
</span>'

var WPFootnote7 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>St. Thomas is borrowing this observation from Peter Lombard&#8217;s <i>Collectanea, </i>P.L. 192, Col 179. The Greek has\
the genitive <i>tou pneumatos, </i>&#8220;of the spirit.&#8221;</p>\
</span>'

var WPFootnote8 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>In these few sentences St. Thomas hints at his thought on concupiscence and original sin. It is not that these desires\
are sinful, for if the delight resulting from obtaining what we desire is not evil (<i>S.T.</i> I, 1-4), neither is the desire evil\
(<i>ibid., </i>30, 2c). If man had not sinned his enjoyment of sensible goods would be even more intense than now; to be\
ruled by reason is not to become &#8220;angelized,&#8221; cf. I, 98, 2 ad 3. Yet, due to the lack of original justice (I-II, 82, 3),\
these desires can become causes of sin (I-II, 77). This is taking &#8220;concupiscentia&#8221; in the strictly theological sense,\
cf. K. Ralmer, &#8220;The Theological Concept of Concupiscentia,&#8221; <i>Theological Investigations </i>(Baltimore: Helicon,\
1960), pp. 360-69. By &#8220;natural concupiscences&#8221; St. Thomas means that men share them with all animals, whereas\
the &#8220;concupiscence of knowledge,&#8221; or of reason, is proper to man only, cf. <i>S.T.</i> I-II, 30, 3c.</p>\

var WPFootnote9 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>This same quotation is ascribed to St. Gregory in Lecture 5 of Ch. 3. 1 have not been able to locate it in his\
writings. It occurs word for word in the <i>Exultet </i>of the Easter Vigil Liturgy&#8212;&#8220;O inaestimabilis dilectio caritatis: ut\
servum. redimeres, filium tradidisti.&#8221; Liturgists seem to agree that the <i>Exultet, </i>or &#8220;Benedictio Cerei Gallicana,&#8221; owes\
its main inspiration to the fourth or fifth century; and it has been attributed both to St. Ambrose and Augustine. The\
earliest records we have of it are in the Gelasian Sacramentaries of the eighth century, cf. Schmidt, S.J., <i>Hebdomada\
Sancta</i>, Vol. 2 (Rome: Herder, 1957) pp. 639-45. Possibly St. Thomas was under the impression that St. Gregory\
had composed the <i>Exultet. </i>St. Thomas&#8217; attribution of the quotation to St. Gregory more than likely springs from the\
common medieval custom of accepting Gregory as the author of the texts in the missal.</p>\
</span>'

var WPFootnote10 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>Cf. note 11 above. For St. Thomas &#8220;salus&#8221; is a divine action directed at the whole of man&#8217;s being. V. White, O.P.,\
has pointed out how &#8220;holiness (<i>sanctitas</i>), health (<i>sanitas</i>),<i> </i>completeness (<i>perfectio</i>), and wholeness (<i>integritas</i>)<i> </i>are,\
in principle, virtually synonymous&#8221; for Aquinas; cf. his Soul <i>and Psyche </i>(London: Collins &amp; Harvill, 1960), pp. 184-86. Notice how St. Thomas regularly speaks of &#8220;human salvation&#8221; or the &#8220;salvation of man&#8221; rather than the\
&#8220;salvation of souls.&#8221;</p>\
</span>'

var WPFootnote11 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>The act of faith is essentially an assent to God revealing himself to man (<i>S.T.</i> II-II, 1, 1c). The individual articles\
of faith are only the material determinations of this essential acceptance of Divinity revealing himself. St. Thomas\
brings out this interpersonal character of faith: &#8220;Everyone who believes assents to someone&#8217;s words; and thus, in any\
form of belief, it seems that it is the person to whose words the assent is given, who is of principal importance and,\
as it were, the end; while the individual truths through which one assents to that person are secondary&#8221; (<i>ibid.</i>, 11,\
1c). Cf. J. Mouroux, <i>I Believe, The Personal Structure </i>of <i>Faith </i>(New York: Sheed &amp; Ward, 1959).</p>\
</span>'

var WPFootnote12 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>Cf. note 7 above. The &#8220;habitus&#8221; are creative powers by which men can perform different types of actions. For\
instance, the ability to solve complex mathematical problems is only acquired through training and practice; we\
cannot perform the requisite mental acts until we are conditioned by a learning process. The creative power which\
results from this conditioning is obviously distinct from the individual acts of solving mathematical problems, yet\
it is nonetheless real since if it did not exist we should have to go through the whole learning process before each\
act. Unlike such acquired powers, the supernatural virtues are infused by God, cf. <i>S.T.</i> I-II, 51, 4; 63, 4.</p>\
</span>'

var WPFootnote13 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>St. Thomas is using &#8220;sacramenta&#8221; here in the Patristic sense which does not limit it to the seven sacraments. All\
sanctifying mysteries are &#8220;Sacraments.&#8221; Christ, as the incarnation of God, is thus <i>the </i>sacrament of the Divine\
redemptive presence in the world of man; the Church&#8212;or as St. Thomas refers to it in discussing the second\
sacrament of which the pagans were deprived, the &#8220;society of the saints&#8221;&#8212;is the continuation of this sacramental\
presence. Aquinas probably owed this terminology to Hugh of St. Victor&#8217;s <i>De Sacramentis, </i>P.L. 176, 181 ff. Like\
Hugh, he discussed the &#8220;sacraments of nature&#8221; (<i>In IV Sent., </i>d. 1, q. 2, a. 6, sol. 3) which were even capable of\
symbolizing Christ (<i>S.T.</i> I-II, 103, 1; cf. note 154 below). The Old Law also had its sacraments <i>(S.C.G. </i>IV, 57; <i>S.T.\
</i>I-II, 101, 4; 102, 5; 103; 111, 61, 3 ad 2). On &#8220;sacramentum&#8221; as aholy secret or sanctifying mystery, cf. <i>S.T.</i> III, 60,\
1 ad 2; and A. M. Roguet, <i>O.P., les Sacrements </i>(Paris: Descl&eacute;e et Cie, 1945) pp. 257-M. A broader usage of the term\
&#8220;sacrament&#8221; is being restored to contemporary theology, cf. E. Schillebeeckx, O.P., <i>Christ: The Sacrament of the\
Encounter with God </i>(New York: Sheed &amp; Ward, 1963).</p>\

var WPFootnote14 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>The Douay-Rheims translation of the singular &#8220;testament&#8221; corresponds to neither the Vulgate nor the original\

</span>'

var WPFootnote15 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>&#8220;Land of distortion&#8221; translates &#8220;regio dissimilitudinIs&#8221; This expression originated in Plato (cf. <i>Politicus, </i>273 d),\
designating the region of becoming between pure being and absolute non-being. St. Augustine used it in his\
<i>Confessions </i>VII, 10 and it enjoyed wide vogue in the Middle Ages where it was associated with the &#8220;terra longinqua&#8221;\
of the prodigal son in Lk 15:13. In similar fashion St. Thomas here links it with the &#8220;de longe venerunt&#8221; of Mk. 8:3.\
The Christian concept of sin distorting man&#8217;s likeness to God is what it mainly implies. Cf. E. Gilson, <i>The Mystical\
Theology of St. Bernard </i>(New York: Sheed &amp; Ward, 1940) pp. 33-59; and note 43 on pp. 224-25. Also P. Courcelle,\

var WPFootnote16 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>The Douay-Rheims translates &#8220;paries&#8221; as &#8220;wall,&#8221; but St. Thomas distinguishes between &#8220;paries&#8221; and &#8220;murus.&#8221; The\
former is a temporary partition&#8212;I have translated it as &#8220;barrier&#8221;&#8212;whereas the latter is permanent and used often\
in reference to city walls.</p>\
</span>'

var WPFootnote17 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>St. Augustine&#8217;s <i>De Gratia Christi et Peccato Originali</i>, 2, 24&#8211;25 (P.L. 44, Col 398-400); also <i>Contra Adamantum\
Manich. Discip. </i>17, (P.L. 42, Col 157-62). In St. Thomas&#8217; view of salvation-history the Old Law had an embryonic\
relationship to the New: &#8220;As the effect is in its cause, or the perfect is in its less perfect beginnings-just as the whole\
tree is contained in the seed-so is the New Law contained in the Old Law.&#8221; <i>S.T. </i>I-II, 107, 3. This is a corollary of\
the general pattern of God&#8217;s salvific revelation to man, it is gradual in order for man to better assimilate. it (<i>ibid.</i>,\
99, 6). Thus the New Covenant fulfills the Old by realizing its deepest potentialities (<i>ibid.</i>, 107, 2); they both have\
the same goal while they differ as less perfect and more perfect in their methods of attaining that goal (<i>ibid.</i>, 107,\
1). This is why Aquinas characterized the Old Law as one of Fear and the New as one of Love. For a genuine\
supernatural love could only be offered to God by God himself become man and communicating his love, the Holy\
Spirit, to other men (<i>S.T.</i> II-II, 24, 2c; III, 8, 6c). Hence Christ is the head of all mankind (<i>ibid.</i>, III, 8, 3) and those\
who observed God&#8217;s commands out of supernatural love in the Old Testament really belonged to the New, while\
those in the New Covenant who still practice virtue out of fear of punishment are acting as though they were under\
the Old Law (<i>ibid.</i>, I-II, 107, 1 ad 2). For a comparison of the Old and New Covenants in an eschatological\
perspective, cf. <i>ibid.</i>, 103, 3.</p>\
</span>'

var WPFootnote18 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>The ceremonial precepts, in Aquinas&#8217; view, served two purposes. One was to provide Israel with a suitable religious\
cult of Yahweh, the other was to symbolize the mystery of Christ. Thomas (in <i>S.T.</i> I-II, 102, 2) refers to St. Jerome&#8217;s\
comment on Old Testament prophecy to show how this symbolic character must be present in the actual rites\
themselves and not fanciful speculations arbitrarily tacked on to them later. Jerome&#8217;s observation was: &#8220;During the\
course of the Old Testament period the prophets promised much about the coming of Christ and the salvation of the\
Gentiles; yet they did this precisely by not neglecting the age in which they lived. As though they would not instruct\
the assembled people about the matters then confronting them, but would rather seem to wildly speculate about\
uncertain and future happenings.&#8221; (Comm. <i>super Osee</i>, 1, P.L. <i>25, 824). </i>In the remaining articles of question 102\
St. Thomas applies the principles discussed here, and in note 56 above, with too much attention to minor\
details&#8212;closer to Latin patristic methods than those of modem scholars. Nevertheless, the latter base their theories\
on principles similar to those St. Thomas adopted, cf. C. Charlier, <i>The Christian Approach to the Bible, </i>(Maryland:\
Newman, 1959) pp. 15984,255-73.</p>\
</span>'

var WPFootnote19 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>The text is somewhat ambiguous here: inter Judaeos et Gentiles: quia isti volebant legem servare, illi vero\
minime...&#8221; According to literal usage, &#8220;isti&#8221; and &#8220;illi&#8221; would make the passage read: &#8220;between the Jews and Gentiles,\
the latter wanting to observe the law and the former least (wanting it).&#8221; If Thomas was asserting that the Gentiles\
were eager to observe the law, then either the Jews were not at all eager to observe it themselves or they were not\
eager to let the Gentiles do so. Old Testament history, however, offers so few instances of these phenomena&#8212;not\
to mention St. Paul&#8217;s struggles with the judaizing Christians in the New&#8212;that I have taken &#8220;isti&#8221; to refer to the Jews\
and &#8220;illi&#8221; to the Gentiles.</p>\
</span>'

var WPFootnote20 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>The Douay-Rheims, closer to the meaning of the Greek, translates the &#8220;decretis&#8221; of the Vulgate as &#8220;in the decrees,&#8221;\
referring to the Old Testament. St. Thomas saw it instead as an ablative of means, &#8220;by the decrees,&#8221; referring to the\
commands of the New Law abrogating the Old. The following text from Leviticus is used to designate the three\
divinely originating laws operative in human history and society, cf. <i>S.T.</i> I-II, 91; 93; 98; 106. The temporal\

<p>The basic principles of the natural law were changed by neither the Old nor the New Laws (<i>ibid.</i>, I-II, 94, 5). Since\
the moral precepts, e.g., the ten commandments, are closely related to the natural law they too are still in force (<i>ibid.,\
</i>100, 1). The New Law of the Gospel is primarily a spiritual law, existing by the grace of the Holy Spirit in the hearts\
of the faithful; the written expression of this law is only a secondary characteristic (<i>ibid.</i>, 106, 1-2).</p>\
</span>'

var WPFootnote21 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>The Gloss is the Lombard&#8217;s <i>Collectanea, </i>P.L. 192, Col 184. St. Thomas took his interpretation of &#8220;decretis&#8221; as\

var WPFootnote22 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>Cf. Augustine&#8217;s commentary on Ps 124, n. 10 (P.L. 37, Col 1655--56). In discussing the peace which results from\
true Christian love, St. Thomas is careful to point out that it consists in a harmony of wills in matters pertaining to\
salvation, and not necessarily in a harmony of intellectual opinions, cf. <i>S.T. </i>II-II, 29, 1; 3 ad 2; 37, 1; 38, 1. St.\
Augustine&#8217;s sharp difference of opinion with St. Jerome indicates that he understood the distinction clearly, cf. <i>St.\
Augustine&#8217;s Letters </i>(translated by W. Parsons, S.N.D., F.C., 1951) Vol. 1, pp. 93 ff., 172 ff., 390 ff. A short history\

certainly carries different connotations than the community of the faithful. Throughout these paragraphs community\
translates <i>collegium. </i>The political community and the domestic community are two distinct domains in human\

var WPFootnote24 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>In both the Piana-Cai and the Parma editions this is given as a direct quotation. It seems to come from <i>The City of\
God</i>, XIV, 28 (P.L. 41, 436). But there it reads: &#8220;Two cities have been formed by two loves: the earthly by the love\
of self, even to the contempt of God; the heavenly by the love of God, even to the contempt of self.&#8221; (translated by\
M. Dodds, New York: Modern Library, 1950), p. 477. It is most likely that St. Thomas picked up his &#8220;Jerusalem-Babylon&#8221; designations from a sentence in Peter Lombard&#8217;s commentary on this same verse in Ephesians (P.L. 192,\
Col 186): &#8220;Two loves have made the whole world into two cities, the love of God has formed Jerusalem, and earthly\

are clothed with double garments.&#8221; The Piana-Cai includes it in the text without comment. If St. Thomas actually\
mentioned the quote in his lecture it may have been within a context which pointed out how love of Cod to contempt\
of self paradoxically leads to the highest realization of self; the city of God&#8217;s love takes good care of its domestics.\
This is the analysis St. Bernard made of the growth in man&#8217;s love for God. He begins by loving God for man&#8217;s sake\
and, in the fourth and highest stage, ends by loving himself for God&#8217;s sake, cf. <i>Saint Bernard on the Love of God,\
</i>a translation of <i>De Diligendo Deo </i>(P.L. 182, 973 ff.), by T. Connolly, S.J. (Maryland: Newman, 1951) pp. 43-46.\

in no way dispenses from the necessity and real causal influence of the secondary causes, <i>ibid., </i>22, 3; 103, 6; 116,\

var WPFootnote27 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p><i>&#160;</i>Aquinas interprets Mt 16:18 as primarily referring to Peter&#8217;s confession of Christ&#8217;s divinity: &#8220;&#8216;Upon this rock,&#8217;\
namely, your confession, &#8216;I will build my Church.&#8217;&#8221; (<i>S.T.</i> II-II, 174, 6c). And this is the meaning he gives the text\
here. For the New Testament affirmation of the Petrine teaching office he more realistically turns to Lk 22:32, &#8220;But\
I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not; and thou, being once converted, confirm thy brethren.&#8221; (<i>ibid., </i>II-II, 1,\

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">You [Gentiles], especially, dead as you were in your lapses and sins&#8212;in the past your steps were
bound by them. [You were] following [the inspiration of] this world-age, the ruler of the
atmosphere, that spirit which is now at work among the rebellious men.  In the past all of us,
[Jews] too, followed these ways.  In our own fleshly passions, we did whatever our flesh and our
thoughts decided.  As much as the rest of mankind we were by nature under the wrath [of God].</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">[Read Marcus Barth, note on &#8220;this world-age&#8221; (p. 214), and &#8220;The realm of the Evil One&#8221; (p.

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt">2 Wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of this

thoughts, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Above, the Apostle enumerated the blessings bestowed on the human race in general through
Christ (1:3). Here the Apostle sets them in relief by comparing them to [mankind&#8217;s] own former
condition. Their past state can be considered in two ways: first as a state of sin, and secondly as
a state of paganism. Therefore, the Apostle does two things:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">First, he recounts the blessings shown them in regard to their first state.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Secondly, he recalls those related to their second state. (2:11).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">The first part has two sections:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">First, the Apostle describes their state of sin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Secondly, the blessing of the grace of justification (2:4).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Again, the first part has two divisions:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">First, he calls to mind the state of sin with reference to the pagans.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Secondly, then with reference to the Jews (2:3).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Once more the first has two parts:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">First, he sets down the generality of the blessing.

</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Secondly, he adds its necessity (2: 1)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">God, he says, is wondrously active in the faithful, &#8220;in accord with the exercise of his mighty
power, which he worked in Christ,&#8221; (Eph 1:19) in raising him from the dead. Hence, according
to this activity, and after the example of this operation, he has restored us to the life of grace from
the death of sin. &#8220;He will revive us after two days: on the third day he will raise us up and we
shall live in his sight&#8221; (Hos 6:3). &#8220;If you have ben raised with Christ, seek the things that are
above, where Christ is sitting at the right hand of God&#8221; (Col 3:1).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">He demonstrates the need for such a blessing when he states <span style="font-weight: bold">when you were dead in your
offenses and sins</span> where he describes so well their sin. First of all, [he depicts] the multitude [of
their sins] at <span style="font-weight: bold">And you, when you were dead</span> with the worst type of death, spiritual death. &#8220;Evil
will slay the wicked [Vul: The death of the wicked is very evil]&#8221; (Ps 34:22). Sin is termed a death
because by it man is separated from God who is life: I am the way, and the truth, and the life&#8221; (Jn
14:6). <span style="font-weight: bold">Dead</span> I say, <span style="font-weight: bold">in your offenses and sins</span>&#8212;behold the great number!  For offenses are the
omissions [of what they should have done]&#8212;&#8220;Who can discover errors?&#8221; (Ps 19:13)&#8212;while sins
are [the evil they] committed. <span style="font-weight: bold">Wherein in time past you walked</span> is added to exaggerate the great
number of sins. For if some are dead in offenses and sins at one time, they nonetheless cease at
another time and leave off sinning; but these keep up their pace in going from bad to worse.
Philippians 3 (18) contains a similar idea: &#8220;For many, as I have often told you and now tell you
with tears, conduct themselves as enemies of the cross of Christ.&#8221; They &#8220;have gone after
worthlessness and become worthless&#8221; (Jer 2:5).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Secondly, he describes the twofold cause of their sin. One arises from this world insofar as they
are attracted by the things of the world.

 Concerning this he states <span style="font-weight: bold">according to the course of
this world</span>; you were allured by mundane matters into a worldly life. &#8220;If any man love the world,
the charity of the Father is not in him.&#8221; Hence the command: &#8220;Love not the world, nor the things
which are in the world&#8221; (1 Jn 2:15).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">The other cause was the devils whom they served, of which Wisdom 14 (27) warns: &#8220;The

 In reference to this he says
<span style="font-weight: bold">according to the prince of the power of this air</span>, and he portrays three aspects of this cause.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">First, as regards their strength he says <span style="font-weight: bold">the prince of the power</span>. He exerts a power, not by the
fact that he has it naturally, since he is neither the Lord nor creator by nature, but to the degree
that he dominates over men who subject themselves to him by sinning. &#8220;Now shall the prince of
this world be cast out&#8221; (Jn 12:31); &#8220;for the prince of this world is coming; he has no power over
me&#8221; (Jn 14:30).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Secondly, concerning their dwelling place he says <span style="font-weight: bold">of this air</span>, that is, he has power in this
darksome atmosphere. Here it should be noted that two opinions exist among the doctors. For
some held that the demons who had fallen [from grace] were not from the higher ranks, but from
the lower ones in charge of the lower bodies.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote4', WPFootnote4 )"><img src="footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

 It is evident that the whole of material creation
is governed by God through the ministry of angels. Thus John Damascene
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote5', WPFootnote5 )"><img src="footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">

    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote5" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote5 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote5\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 was of the opinion
that the first of those who had fallen had been in charge of the terrestrial order. He may have
derived this from Plato&#8217;s talk about certain celestial or world substances. In this perspective of
this air is interpreted that they were created to preside over this atmosphere.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Others
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote6', WPFootnote6 )"><img src="footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

 preferred, and with better reason, that those [angels who sinned] were from the highest
ranks. <span style="font-weight: bold">Of this air</span> then designates that this atmosphere is the place of their punishment. Jude
refers to this in his canonical [letter]: &#8220;And the angels who did not keep their own position but
left their proper dwelling he has kept in everlasting chains under darkness until the judgment of
the great day&#8221; (Jude 6). The reason why they were not immediately thrust into hell after their fall,
but released in the atmosphere, was because God did not want the creation of those who had
sinned to be totally frustrated. Hence, he sent them to try men, by which the good would be
prepared for glory and the wicked for eternal death. The time of our warfare and of merit will last
until the day of judgment, till then they will remain in the atmosphere; after the day of judgment,
however, they will be thrust back into hell.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Observe also how one reading has &#8220;of the spirit&#8221; which, as a genitive singular, stands for the
plural &#8220;of the spirits.&#8221; Another reading gives &#8220;spirit&#8221; in the accusative case; as if to say:
&#8220;according to the prince spirit,&#8221; that is, the prince who is a spirit.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote7', WPFootnote7 )"><img src="footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote7" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote7 );

</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Thirdly, [he describes] their activity when be states <span style="font-weight: bold">that now works on the children of despair</span>.
They are the children of despair who reject the fruit of Christ&#8217;s passion. Or, those who have no
faith in eternal realities nor hope in salvation through Christ. In these the prince of the power of
this air freely <span style="font-weight: bold">works</span>, leading them wherever he wishes. Later it is said of them: &#8220;They have
become callous [Vul: despairing] and have given themselves up to licentiousness, greedy to
practice every kind of uncleanness&#8221; (Eph 4:19). Perhaps, <span style="font-weight: bold">of despair</span> means those of whom we
should despair because they sin out of malice; the prince of this world doing whatever he pleases
in them. For no one should despair of those who sin from ignorance or weakness, nor does that
prince do whatever he wants with them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">On the contrary, however, one should never despair of anyone else as long as he lives. I reply.
Our hope in someone can be twofold. On the one hand, it can be in the man, and on the other,
in divine grace. Thus someone may be despaired of as far as he himself is concerned, but never
must confidence in God be lost. For instance, people rightly despaired of Lazarus&#8217; power to bring
himself back to life once he bad been placed in the tomb, but no trust should have been lost in
the God who raised him up. Therefore, those who out of malice are sunk in their many sins can
be despaired of from the point of view of their own strength: &#8220;I have sunk into the abysmal Mire,
where there is no footing&#8221; (Ps 69:3). But no one should despair if it is a question of the divine
power. Concerning these children of despair it mentions further on: &#8220;Let no man deceive you
with empty words. For because of these things the anger of God comes upon the children of
disobedience [Vul: despair]&#8221; (Eph 5:6).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Next (v. 3), the Apostle recalls the sinful state of the Jews, thereby demonstrating how everyone
had sinned, according to that saying of Romans 3 (9): &#8220;For we have charged both Jews and
Greeks, that they are all under sin.&#8221; Nevertheless, a difference should be noted. The Apostle had
designated two causes when dealing with the sin of the Gentiles, one on the side of the world and
the other on that of the demons whom they worshiped. The Jews were like the Gentiles in their
sinful condition in regard to the first cause, but not the second; hence, the Apostle only mentions
their sin as arising from worldly causes. In reference to this he makes three points:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">First, he recounts their guilt regarding sins of the heart.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">Secondly, the sins of action.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Thirdly, original sin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">A sin of, the heart is implied in carnal desires. About this he asserts: <span style="font-weight: bold">in which</span> sins and offenses
<span style="font-weight: bold">also we all</span> who are Jews <span style="font-weight: bold">conversed in time past</span>, leading our life <span style="font-weight: bold">in the</span> carnal <span style="font-weight: bold">desires of our
flesh</span>. &#8220;For we ourselves also were once foolish, disobedient, led astray, slaves to various
passions and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another&#8221; (Tit 3:3). &#8220;Put
on the Lord Jesus Christ; and make no provision for the desires of the flesh&#8221; (Rom 13:14).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Sin in action is nothing else than a manifestation of inner concupiscence.

 A certain
concupiscence of the flesh exists, it consists of the natural concupiscences; for example, for food
through which the individual maintains his own life, and for sexual relations by which the species
is preserved.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Regarding these he says <span style="font-weight: bold">fulfilling the will of the flesh</span>, doing what the flesh delights in. &#8220;And
they who are in the flesh cannot please God&#8221; (Rom 8:8). Another concupiscence exists, that of
thought. These desires do not spring from the flesh but from the appetitive faculty of the soul,
such as the ambition for honors, for one&#8217;s own excellence and the like. Of these he states <span style="font-weight: bold">and
of our thoughts</span>, that is, inordinate desires are followed once they are caused by the prompting
of our reflections.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Original sin is hinted at in <span style="font-weight: bold">and we were by nature children of wrath</span>. This sin of the first parent
was not only passed on to the Gentiles but to the Jews also: &#8220;Wherefore as by one man sin
entered into this world, and by sin death; and so death passed upon all men, in whom all have
sinned&#8221; (Rom 5:12). Baptism cleanses only the individual person who receives it from original
sin; his children must also be baptized. Likewise, circumcision cleansed only the individual from
original sin; the children they begot still had to be circumcised. Thus he says <span style="font-weight: bold">we were by nature</span>,
that is, from the earliest beginning of nature&#8212;not of nature as nature since this is good and from
God, but of nature as vitiated&#8212;<span style="font-weight: bold">children of</span> an avenging <span style="font-weight: bold">wrath</span>, aimed at punishment and hell,

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">After exaggerating their state of festering sin (2:1), the Apostle recounts here the blessing of the
grace of justification. Concerning which he does two things:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">First, he sets down the blessing itself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Secondly, he explains it (2:8).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">The blessing is described with reference to its three causes:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">First, the efficient cause.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">Secondly, the formal or exemplary cause (2:5).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Thirdly, the final cause (2:7).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">The efficient cause of the divine blessing of justification is God&#8217;s charity: <span style="font-weight: bold">But God, who is rich
in mercy, for his exceeding charity wherewith he loved us</span>. He states <span style="font-weight: bold">for his exceeding
charity</span> since we can think of a fourfold goodness and efficacy of the divine love. First, it brought
us into existence: &#8220;For you love all things that are, and hate none of the things which you have
made&#8221; (Wis 11:25). Second, he made us according to his own image, capable of enjoying his
own beatitude: &#8220;He [God] came from Miribath-Kadesh [Vul &amp; lit: thousands of saints]. At his
right hand a fire blazed forth. He has loved the people; all the saints are in his hand&#8221; (Deut 33:2-3). Third, he renewed men corrupted by sin: &#8220;Yea, I have loved them with an everlasting love;
therefore have I drawn thee, taking pity on thee&#8221; (Jer 31:3). Fourth, for our salvation he gave over
his own Son: &#8220;For God so loved the world, as to give his only begotten Son&#8221; (Jn 3:16). Hence
Gregory exclaims: &#8220;O the incalculable love of your charity! To redeem slaves you delivered up
your Son.&#8221;

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">He then asserts <span style="font-weight: bold">who is rich in mercy</span>. When a man&#8217;s love is caused from the goodness of the one
he loves, then that man who loves does so out of justice, inasmuch as it is just that he love such
a person. When, however, love causes the goodness in the beloved, then it is a love springing
from mercy. The love with which God loves us produces goodness in us; hence mercy is
presented here as the root of the divine love: &#8220;The favors of Yahweh I will recall, the praises of
Yahweh for all that Yahweh has done for us... which he has given according to his kindness and
the multitude of his mercies&#8221; (Is 63:7). And &#8220;where is your zealous care and might, your surge
of pity and mercy toward me?&#8221; (Is 63:15).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">God is said to be <span style="font-weight: bold">rich in mercy</span> because he possesses an infinite and unfailing mercy, which man
does not. For man has a mercy that is bounded or limited in three ways. Firstly, in bestowing
temporal benefits, man&#8217;s mercy is restricted by the amount of his own possessions. &#8220;If you have
little, do not be afraid to give from that little&#8221; (Tob 4:8); whereas God is &#8220;enriches all who call
upon him&#8221; (Rom 10:12). Secondly, the mercy of man is limited since he can only pardon offenses
against himself. Even with these there ought to be a certain qualification; he should not forgive
so indiscriminately that whoever is pardoned becomes more bold, prone and ready to offend
again. &#8220;For, because sentence is not speedily pronounced against the evil, the hearts of the sons
of men are fully set to do evil&#8221; (Eccl 8:11). But nothing can harm God and hence he can forgive
every offense: &#8220;If you sin, what harm do you do to him?&#8221; And a little further on, &#8220;And if you act
rightly, what do you give him?&#8221; (Job 35:6 &amp; 7). Thirdly, a man shows mercy in remitting
punishment; yet here too a qualification must be observed: he must not contravene the justice of
a higher law. God, on the other hand, can remit all punishment since he is not bound by any
higher law: &#8220;Who gave him charge over the earth? Or who else set the land in its place?&#8221; (Job
34:13). Thus the mercy of God is infinite because it is not limited by a scarcity of wealth, nor is
it restricted through a fear of injury, nor by any higher law.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">The exemplary cause of the blessing is that it is granted in Christ. In reference to this he states
<span style="font-weight: bold">even when we were dead in sins, he has quickened us together in Christ</span>. He touches upon
a triple blessing: justification, resurrection from the dead, and ascension into heaven&#8212;through
these three we are assimilated to Christ.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">He states, that the whole text might be read, concerning the first: <span style="font-weight: bold">God, who is rich in mercy, for
his exceeding charity wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, has
quickened us together in Christ</span>, he has made us live together with Christ. &#8220;He will revive us
after two days: on the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight&#8221; (Hos 6:3). He
has quickened us, I say, through a life of justice: &#8220;Who placed us among the living&#8221; (Ps 66:9).
This occurs in Christ, that is, through the grace of Christ by whose grace you are saved. &#8220;For we
are saved by hope&#8221; (Rom 8:24). Regarding the second, he says <span style="font-weight: bold">and has raised us up together
</span>with Christ&#8212;for the soul [this has happened] in reality, in hope the body [awaits it]. &#8220;He who
raised Jesus Christ from the dead will give life to your mortal bodies also through his Spirit
which dwells in you&#8221; (Rom 8:11). In respect to the third he asserts <span style="font-weight: bold">and has made us sit together
in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus</span>, now through hope, and in the future in reality. For, as
John 12 (26) puts it: &#8220;Where I am, there also will my servant be. If anyone serves me, my Father
will honor him.&#8221; Also the Apocalypse 3 (21): &#8220;He who conquers I will grant him to sit with me
in my throne; as I myself have conquered and sat down with my Father on his throne.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">In these the Apostle uses the past tense in place of the future, proclaiming as already
accomplished what has yet to be done on account of the certitude of hope. Thus God has
<span style="font-weight: bold">quickened us</span> in soul, he <span style="font-weight: bold">has raised us up</span> in body, and <span style="font-weight: bold">has made us sit</span> with Christ in both
[body and soul].

</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Consequently, when he says <span style="font-weight: bold">that he might shew in the ages to come</span>, he discloses the final
cause of the blessing which has been given. It can be read in two ways, depending on whether
<span style="font-weight: bold">ages to come</span> pertains to the present or future life. If it applies to this life, then age is a certain
measure of time and a period of one generation. As though he affirmed: I am saying that we who
are the first-fruits of those who sleep (cf. 1 Thes 4:12 ff.), <span style="font-weight: bold">he has quickened in Christ that he
might show in the ages to come</span>, to those who will exist after us, the abundant riches of his
grace. And this is not on account of our merits, but in his own <span style="font-weight: bold">goodness towards us in Christ
Jesus</span>, that is, through Christ Jesus. &#8220;Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of these
I am the foremost. But I have received mercy for this reason, that in me first Christ Jesus might
display his perfect patience, as an example for those who would believe in him for eternal life&#8221;
(1 Tim. 1:15-16). Therefore, God has communicated copious gifts of grace to the early saints that
later generations would more easily be converted to Christ.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Or, <span style="font-weight: bold">age</span> can be taken in reference to the next life, of which Sirach 24 (14) states: &#8220;For eternity I
shall not cease to exist.&#8221; Although there will then be only one age, since it will be eternity, he
nevertheless says <span style="font-weight: bold">in the ages to come</span> on account of the numerous saints who will participate in
eternity; there are said to be as many ages as there are shared-in eternities. Psalm 145 (13) speaks
of these ages: &#8220;Your kingdom is an eternal kingdom.&#8221; In this sense he affirms: I say that he has
vivified us in hope, namely, through Christ or in grace <span style="font-weight: bold">that he might shew in the ages to come</span>,
that is, that he might bring to perfection in the next life, <span style="font-weight: bold">the abundant riches of his grace</span>. Such
an abundant grace with which, even in this world, he forgives many sins and confers the greatest
of gifts, will superabound even more in the next life, since there it will be enjoyed unfailingly.
&#8220;I have come that they might have a life,&#8221; namely, of grace in this world, &#8220;and have it more
abundantly&#8221; in the fatherland of glory (Jn 10:10).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">This occurs <span style="font-weight: bold">in his own goodness</span>. &#8220;Israel, how good God is to those who are pure of heart!&#8221; (Ps
73:1 ). &#8220;Yahweh is good to those who wait for him, to the soul that seeks him&#8221; (Lam 3:25). This
is <span style="font-weight: bold">towards us</span>; it is beyond our desire, our understanding, and beyond our capacity: &#8220;No eye has
seen any God but you acting like this for those who wait for him&#8221; (Is 64:4). And this is <span style="font-weight: bold">in Christ
Jesus</span>, that is, through Christ Jesus; for as grace is bestowed on us through Christ, so also is glory
communicated, which is grace brought to perfection. &#8220;Yahweh God bestows favors and honors&#8221;
(Ps 84:12). Through the same person we are beatified, through whom we are justified.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">He says <span style="font-weight: bold">that he might shew</span> because the treasure of grace is hidden within us; we have it &#8220;in
earthen vessels&#8221; as 2 Corinthians 4 (7) expresses it. &#8220;Behold what manner of charity the Father
has bestowed upon us, that we should be called and should be the sons of God,&#8221; after which
comes: &#8220;We know that when he shall appear we shall be like to him&#8221; (1 Jn 3:1-2). But that
hidden treasure, although it has not yet been revealed, is shown in the ages to come, since in the
fatherland everything relating to the transparent glory of the saints will be unveiled before us.
&#8220;The sufferings of this time are not worthy to be compared with the glory to come that shall be
revealed in us&#8221; (Rom 8: 18).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt">8 For by grace you are saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, for it is the gift of God.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt">9 Not of works, that no man may glory.</span></p>

in them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">When the Apostle was recounting above the blessing of God by which we have been freed from
sin, he inserted [the thought] that we had been saved by Christ&#8217;s grace (2:5). Now he intends to
prove that; he makes two points concerning it:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">First, he sets down his intention.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Secondly, he clarifies the point in question (2:8b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">I rightly declared, he says of the first, by whose grace you were saved; and indeed, I still
confidently say <span style="font-weight: bold">For</span>, in place of &#8220;because,&#8221; <span style="font-weight: bold">by grace you are saved</span>. &#8220;By the grace of God, I am
what I am&#8221; (1 Cor 15: 10), &#8220;being justified freely by his grace&#8221; (Rom 3:24). For to be saved is
the same as to be justified. Salvation implies a freedom from dangers; hence, man&#8217;s perfect
salvation will be in eternal life when he will be immune from all dangers, as a ship is said to be
safe when it has arrived at port. &#8220;You shall call your walls &#8216;salvation&#8217; and your gates &#8216;praise&#8217;&#8221;
(Is 60: 18).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Men receive the hope of this salvation when they are justified from sin in the present, and are
thus referred to as saved according to the expression of Romans 8 (24): &#8220;For we are saved by
hope.&#8221; But this salvation of grace is <span style="font-weight: bold">by faith</span> in Christ. In the justification of an adult who has
sinned, the movement of faith towards God coincides with the infusion of grace. &#8220;Your faith has
saved you. Go in peace&#8221; (Lk 8:48). &#8220;Being justified, therefore, by faith, we are at peace with God
through our Lord Jesus Christ&#8221; (Rom 5:1).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">When he next says <span style="font-weight: bold">and that not of yourselves</span>, he clarifies what he had spoken of:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">First, regarding faith, which is the foundation of the whole spiritual edifice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Secondly, regarding grace (2: 10).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">He eliminates two errors concerning the first point. The first of these is that, since he had said
we are saved by faith, any one can hold the opinion that faith itself originates within ourselves
and that to believe is determined by our own wishes. Therefore to abolish this he states <span style="font-weight: bold">and that
not of yourselves</span>. Free will is inadequate for the act of faith since the contents of faith are above
human reason. &#8220;Matters too great for human understanding have been shown to you&#8221; (Sir 3:25).
&#8220;No one knows what pertains to God except the Spirit of God&#8221; (1 Cor 2:11). That a man should
believe, therefore, cannot occur from himself unless God gives it, according to that text of
Wisdom 9 (17): &#8220;Who could ever have known your will, had you not given Wisdom and sent
your Holy Spirit from above.&#8221;

 For this reason he adds for it is the gift of God, namely, faith
itself. &#8220;For you have been granted, for the sake of Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to
suffer for him&#8221; (Phil 1:29). &#8220;To another, faith is given in the same Spirit&#8221; (1 Cor 12:9).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">The second error he rejects is that anyone can believe that faith is given by God to us on the merit
of our preceding actions. To exclude this he adds <span style="font-weight: bold">Not of</span> preceding <span style="font-weight: bold">works</span> that we merited at one
time to be saved; for this is the grace, as was mentioned above, and according to Romans 11 (6):
&#8220;If by grace, it is not now by works; otherwise grace is no more grace.&#8221; He follows with the
reason why God saves man by faith without any preceding merits, <span style="font-weight: bold">that no man may glory</span> in
himself but refer all the glory to God. &#8220;Not for our sake, Yahweh, not for our sake, but for the
sake of your name display your glory, because of your kindness, because of your faithfulness&#8221;
(Ps 115:1-2). &#8220;That no flesh should glory in his sight. It is due to him that you are in Christ Jesus,
who became for us wisdom from God, justice, sanctification and redemption&#8221; (1 Cor 1:29-30).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Next (2: 10), he clarifies what he had said regarding grace. Concerning this he does two things:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">First, he clarifies the infusion of grace.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Secondly, he declares the predestination of grace (2: l0b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">There are two essential characteristics of grace, they have already been spoken of. The first of
these is that what exists through grace is not present in man through himself or by himself, but
from the gift of God. In reference to this he states <span style="font-weight: bold">For we are his workmanship</span>, whatever good
we possess is not from ourselves but from the action of God. &#8220;Know that Yahweh is God: he
made us, the Almighty&#8221; (Ps 99:3). &#8220;Is he not your Father, who created you, made you and
fashioned you?&#8221; (Deut. 32:6). This is immediately linked with what went before: <span style="font-weight: bold">that no man
may glory for we are his workmanship</span>. Or, it can be joined with what was said above: <span style="font-weight: bold">For by
grace you are saved</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">The second essential characteristic of grace is that it is not from previous works; this is expressed
when he adds <span style="font-weight: bold">created</span>. To create anything is to produce it from nothing; hence, when anyone is
justified without preceding merits, he can be said to have been created as though made from
nothing. This creative action of justification occurs through the power of Christ communicating
the Holy Spirit. On this account he adds <span style="font-weight: bold">in Christ Jesus</span>, that is, through Christ Jesus. &#8220;For [in
Christ Jesus] neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything, but a new creation&#8221; (Gal.
6:15). &#8220;Send forth your Spirit, they are created anew&#8221; (Ps 104:30). Moreover, not only are the
habits of virtue
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote12', WPFootnote12 )"><img src="footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

 and grace given to us, but we are inwardly renewed through the Spirit in order
to act uprightly. Whence he goes on <span style="font-weight: bold">in good works</span> since the good works themselves are [made
possible] to us by God. &#8220;For you have accomplished all we have done&#8221; (Is 26:12).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Since &#8220;those he predestined he also called&#8221; through grace, as Romans 8 (30) expresses it,
therefore he adds something concerning predestination, saying, <span style="font-weight: bold">which</span> good works <span style="font-weight: bold">God has
prepared</span>. For predestination is nothing else than the pre-arrangement of God&#8217;s blessings, among
which blessings our good works themselves are numbered. God is said to prepare something for
us insofar as be disposes himself to give it to us. &#8220;Provide the land with grain, for you prepared
it for this&#8221; (Ps 64:10).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Lest anyone imagine that good works are prepared for us by God in such a way that we do not
cooperate in their realization through our free will, he annexes <span style="font-weight: bold">that we should walk in them</span>.
As though he said: Thus has he prepared them for us, that we might perform them for ourselves
through our free will. &#8220;For we are God&#8217;s co-workers&#8221; (1 Cor 3:9). For this reason the Apostle
said of himself: &#8220;By the grace of God, I am what I am. And his grace in me has not been in vain;
rather I have worked harder than all of them&#8212;yet not I, but the grace of God that is with me&#8221; (1
Cor 15:10). He expressly said we should walk to designate a progress in good works, in line with
that saying: &#8220;Walk while you have the light, so that darkness may not overtake you&#8221; (Jn 12:35);
&#8220;Walk then as children of the light&#8221; (Eph 5:8).</p>

recalls the favor shown them in their liberation from the state of paganism. Concerning this he
does two things:</p>

in the dessert&#8221; (Deut 9:7). &#8220;That you may remember the day of your coming out of Egypt, all the
days of your life&#8221; (Deut 16:3).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">When he states <span style="font-weight: bold">that you, being heretofore Gentiles </span>he recounts, in the second place, the
condition of their past state:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">First, as regards the evils they endured.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Secondly, as regards the goods of which they were deprived (2:12).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">In reference to the first he exposes three evils. First was the crime of paganism, by which they
were accustomed to worship idols; this he implies in <span style="font-weight: bold">that you being heretofore Gentiles</span>. &#8220;You
know that when you were heathens, you went to dumb idols according as you were led&#8221; (1 Cor
12:2). Some books have &#8220;You who were Gentiles&#8221; and omit everything until &#8220;But now in Christ
Jesus...&#8221; (v. 13). Secondly, he discusses their carnal way of life, saying <span style="font-weight: bold">in the flesh</span>, that is, living
lustfully. &#8220;And they who are in the flesh cannot please God&#8221; (Rom 8:8). Thirdly, he speaks of
the repugnance and contempt with which the Jews despised them. Hence he mentions <span style="font-weight: bold">who are
called uncircumcision by that</span> type of circumcision <span style="font-weight: bold">which is called circumcision in the flesh</span>
as the circumcised Jews performed this circumcision. He says <span style="font-weight: bold">made by hands</span> to distinguish it
from the spiritual circumcision spoken of in Colossians 2 (11-13): &#8220;In whom [Christ] you also
were circumcised with a circumcision not hand-made, by putting off the body of the flesh, but
in the circumcision of Christ, buried with him in baptism... And when you were dead in your sins
and the uncircumcision of your flesh, he has brought you to life together with him, forgiving you
all offenses.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Next (v. 12), he recounts the good things of which they were deprived:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">First from a share in the sacraments.

</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Secondly, from a knowledge of God, at <span style="font-weight: bold">and without God in this world </span>(v. 12).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Regarding the first he sets down three sacraments they were deprived of sharing in. They were,
first of all, without the fundamental truth of Christ; whence he affirms <span style="font-weight: bold">that you were at that
time without Christ, </span>without the promise of a Christ as was made to the Jews. &#8220;I will raise up
for David a just branch; and a king shall reign and shall be wise&#8221; (Jer 23:5). &#8220;Rejoice greatly, O
daughter of Sion, shout for joy, O daughter of Jerusalem: See, your King is coming to you,
triumphant and victorious&#8221; (Zech 9:9).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">They were deprived, in the second place, from the society of the saints as long as they remained
in paganism. He says they were <span style="font-weight: bold">aliens from Israel&#8217;s way of life</span>, since the Jews were not
permitted to mix with the Gentiles. &#8220;You shall not make any league with them, nor show them
mercy. Neither shall you make marriages with them&#8221; (Deut 7:2-3). &#8220;Jews do not communicate
with Samaritans&#8221; (Jn 4:9). With respect to those who&#8212;not without contempt&#8212;were accepted
into Judaism when they became proselytes he adds and <span style="font-weight: bold">strangers to the testaments</span>. As though
he asserted: These converts, when they went over to Judaism and became proselytes, were
accepted to partake of God&#8217;s covenants as strangers rather than as citizens. He says testaments
in the plural

 since the Old Testament was offered the Jews and the New was promised. &#8220;The
Lord made his covenant rest upon the head of Jacob&#8221; (Sir 44:25) can be understood of the Old
Testament. God promised to give them another covenant: &#8220;And I will make an everlasting
covenant with them&#8221; (Bar 2:35). This latter was granted to those &#8220;to whom belong the adoption
as children, the glory and the giving of the Law&#8221; (Rom 9:4).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">He also sets down another blessing of which they were deprived: the hope of future goods, when
he says <span style="font-weight: bold">having no hope of the promise </span>since &#8220;To Abraham were the promises made and to his
seed&#8221; (Gal 3:16).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Finally, he writes of the greatest injury from which they suffered, ignorance of God. <span style="font-weight: bold">And
without God in this world </span>means without the knowledge of God. &#8220;God has shown himself in
Judah&#8221; (Ps 76:2), but not among the Gentiles: &#8220;Not in the passion of lust, like the Gentiles that
do not know God&#8221; (1 Thes 4:5). This must be understood of the knowledge obtainable through
faith, for Romans 1 (21) speaks of their natural knowledge: &#8220;Although they knew God, they did
not glorified him as God or give him thanks.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">After this he recalls the blessings offered them through Christ in their [present] condition after
conversion. Concerning this he does two things:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -0.240833in; margin-left: 0.5in">First, he shows how they were made partakers of the goods previously denied them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -0.240833in; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Secondly, he shows that their participation in those goods is not that of strangers but of
citizens (2:19).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">The first part again has two sections:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">First, he depicts these blessings in a general way.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Secondly, he specifies them (2:14).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">With respect to the first: I have mentioned that in former times you were without Christ, alienated
from Israel&#8217;s way of life. <span style="font-weight: bold">But now</span>, after you have been converted to Christ, you are <span style="font-weight: bold">in Christ
Jesus</span>, intimately united to him through faith and love. &#8220;He who remains in love remains in God,
and God in him&#8221; (1 Jn 4:16). &#8220;For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means
anything, but a new creature&#8221; (Gal 6:15).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">You, I say, who some time were afar off, </span>severed from God, not by space but by what you
deserved, because it is said: &#8220;Keep distant from the wicked your salvation&#8221; (Ps 119:155), as well
as association with the saints and a share in the covenants, as has already been said. Now you are
made near to God and to his saints and covenants. &#8220;Your sons shall come from afar and your
daughters shall be carried in arms&#8221; (Is 60:4). &#8220;For some of them,&#8221; namely, the Gentiles, &#8220;have
come from far away&#8221; (Mk 8:3), from the land of distortion

<span style="font-weight: bold">you are made near by the blood of Christ, </span>that is, through his blood by which Christ draws
you: &#8220;And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all things to myself&#8221; (Is 12:32). This was
on account of his vehement love which most forcefully revealed itself in the death of the cross.
&#8220;I have loved you with an everlasting love.  Therefore have I maintained my faithful love for
you&#8221; (Jer 31:3).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Having recounted the blessings imparted to the Ephesians through Christ in a general way (2:13),
he now recounts them in greater detail. Concerning this he makes two points:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">First, he shows how they have converged with the Jewish people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Secondly, how they are drawn closer to God (2:16).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">The first has three divisions:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">First, he reveals the cause of this convergence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">Secondly, its manner (2:14b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Thirdly, its purpose (2:15b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Christ is the cause of this drawing together, for which reason he affirms <span style="font-weight: bold">For he is our peace,
who has made both one</span>. This is an emphatic way of speaking to better express the reality, as
though he said: Rightly do I say that you are drawn near each other, but this occurs through Christ
since he is the cause of <span style="font-weight: bold">our peace</span>. &#8220;My peace I give you&#8221; (Jn 14:27). It is usual to adopt this way
of speaking when the totality of the effect depends on its cause; for instance, we say that God
himself is our salvation because whatever salvation is present in us is caused by God. In the same
way, whatever peace we possess is caused by Christ and, as a result, whatever convergence [men
have with one another]. For when a man is at peace with another he can securely walk towards
or approach him. Hence, <span style="font-weight: bold">he is our peace</span>. Angels announced peace at his birth: &#8220;Glory to God
in the highest; and on earth peace to those he is pleased with&#8221; (Lk 2:14). Indeed, while Christ
lived in the body the world enjoyed the greatest peace, the like of which it had never before
possessed. &#8220;May the just man flourish in his days, and peace pour down till the moon be no
more&#8221; (Ps 72:7). He himself proclaimed peace when he arose from the dead: &#8220;He said to them:
&#8216;Peace be with you&#8217;&#8221; (Lk 24:36).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">It follows that he <span style="font-weight: bold">has made both one</span>, joining into unity both the Jews who worshiped the true
God and the Gentiles who were alienated from God&#8217;s cult. &#8220;And other sheep I have, that are not
of this fold; them also I must bring. And they shall bear my voice; and there shall be one fold and
one shepherd&#8221; (Jn 10:16). &#8220;One king shall be king over them all. And they shall no more be two
nations, neither shall they be divided any more into two kingdoms&#8221; (Ez 37:22).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">The manner of convergence is revealed when he states <span style="font-weight: bold">and breaking down the middle barrier</span>

of partition. </span>The method, then, consists in removing what is divisive. To understand the text we
should imagine a large field with many men gathered on it. But a high barrier was thrown across
the middle of it, segregating the people so that they did not appear as one people but two.
Whoever would remove the barrier would unite the crowds of men into one multitude, one
people would be formed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">What is said here should be understood in this way. For the world is likened to a field: &#8220;The field
is the world&#8221; (Mt 13:38); this field of the world is crowded with men, &#8220;Increase and multiply, and
fill the earth&#8221; (Gen 1:28). A barrier, however, runs down the field, some are on one side and the
rest on the other. The Old Law can be termed such a barrier, its carnal observances kept the Jews
confined: &#8220;Before the faith came, we were under the guardianship of the law, confined in
anticipation of the faith which was to be revealed&#8221; (Gal 3:23). Christ was symbolized through
the Old Law: &#8220;See, he stands behind our wall&#8221; (Cant. 2:9). Christ, however, has put an end to this
barrier and, since no division remained, the Jews and the Gentiles became one people. This is
what he says: I affirm that <span style="font-weight: bold">he has made both one</span> by the method of <span style="font-weight: bold">breaking down the middle
barrier</span>.<span style="font-weight: bold"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">I say a barrier <span style="font-weight: bold">of partition </span>and not a wall. A barrier of partition is one in which the stones are not
mortared together with cement; it is not built to last permanently but only for a specified time.
The Old Law was a barrier of partition for two reasons. First, because it was not mortared
together with charity which is, as it were, the cement uniting individuals among themselves and
everyone together with Christ. &#8220;Be careful to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace&#8221;
(Eph 4:3). The Old Law is a law of fear, persuading men to observe its commands by
punishments and threats. While that law was in force, those who kept it out of love belonged by
anticipation, as Augustine holds, to the New Testament which is the law of love.

 &#8220;For you have
not received the spirit of bondage again in fear but you have received the spirit of adoption of
sons&#8221; (Rom 8:15). Secondly, the Old Law is a barrier of partition because it was not meant to last
permanently but only for a definite time. &#8220;As long as the heir is a child, he is no different from
a servant, though he is master of all; but he is under tutors and governors until the time appointed
by his father. So we also, when we were children, were slaves to the elemental powers of the
world&#8221; (Gal 4:1-3).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">A problem arises here since he says <span style="font-weight: bold">breaking down the barrier of partition </span>and, on the
contrary, Matthew 5 (17) states: &#8220;Do not think that I have come to destroy the law or the
prophets. I have not come to destroy, but to fulfill.&#8221; I reply. The Old Law contained both moral
and ceremonial precepts. The moral commandments were not destroyed by Christ but fulfilled
in the counsels he added and in his explanations of what the Scribes and Pharisees had wrongly
interpreted. So he says in Matthew 5 (20): &#8220;Unless your justice abounds more than that of the
Scribes and Pharisees, you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.&#8221; And further on: &#8220;You
have heard that it has been said: &#8216;You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.&#8217; But I say
to you: Love your enemies; do good to those who hate you; and pray for those who persecute and
calumniate you&#8221; (Mt 5:43-44). He abolished the ceremonial precepts with regard to what they
were in themselves, but he fulfilled them with regard to what they prefigured, adding what was
symbolized to the symbol.

</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">It should be understood, therefore, that in saying breaking he refers to the observance of the
carnal law. To break down this barrier of partition is to destroy the hostility between the Jews and
Gentiles. The former wanted to observe the law and the latter bad little inclination to do so,

from which anger and jealousy sprung up between them. But certainly, Christ has abolished this
animosity in his assumed flesh. For at his birth peace was immediately proclaimed to men (cf.
Lk 2:14). Or, in his immolated flesh since &#8220;He has given himself for us as an offering and
sacrifice to God&#8221; (Eph 5:2). In this sacrifice all the former sacrifices were fulfilled and came to
an end. &#8220;For by a single offering he has perfected for ever those who are sanctified&#8221; (Heb. 10:14).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">What that barrier was he implies when he says <span style="font-weight: bold">the law of commandments, </span>as though he said:
<span style="font-weight: bold">Breaking down the barrier </span>which is <span style="font-weight: bold">the law of the commandments. </span>The Old Law is termed
the law of commandments, not because other laws lacked injunctions since the New Law has
commandments: &#8220;A new commandment I give you&#8221; (Jn 13:34). There are two reasons why [this
title is applied to the Old Law]. One is the great number of legal injunctions it contained, so many
that men could not possibly keep them all, according to that text of Acts 15 (10): &#8220;Now,
therefore, why tempt God to put a yoke upon the necks of the disciples which neither our fathers
nor we have been able to bear?&#8221; And Job 11 (6): &#8220;That he would tell you the secrets of wisdom,
which have multiple applications.&#8221; Or, it is called <span style="font-weight: bold">of commandments</span> meaning &#8220;of works.&#8221;
&#8220;Where then is your boasting? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? No, but by the law of
faith&#8221; (Rom 3:27). Thus the baptism of John was called a baptism of water since it would cleanse
only externally and not sanctify interiorly. Likewise, the Old Law was termed of works be cause
it ordained only what must be done, but did not confer the grace through which men would have
been assisted in fulfilling the law. The New Law, on the other hand, regulates what must be done
by giving commands, and it aids in fulfilling them by bestowing grace.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">I affirm [that Christ <span style="font-weight: bold">in his flesh</span> was] <span style="font-weight: bold">making void the law of commandments </span>as the imperfect
is made void by the perfect and the shadow by the truth. &#8220;When the perfect comes, the imperfect
will pass away&#8221; (1 Cor 13:10), that is, the imperfection and shadow of the Old Law of which
Hebrews 10 (1) asserts: &#8220;The law has a shadow of the good things to come, not the very image
of the things.&#8221; This happened <span style="font-weight: bold">by the decrees</span>, referring to the precepts of the New Testament
through which the law was annulled.

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">He reveals the purpose of the convergence when he states <span style="font-weight: bold">that he might make the two in
himself into one new man</span>. The end is that the aforementioned two peoples would be formed
into one people. Whatever unites must come together in some unity, and since the law divided
they could not be united in that law. But Christ took the place of the law, and faith in him, as the
truth of those symbols, made them one in himself. &#8220;That they may be one as we also are one&#8221; (Jn
17:22); &#8220;For, where there are two or three gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst
of them&#8221; (Mt 18:20).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">This is <span style="font-weight: bold">into one new man, making peace</span>. That is, into Christ himself who is called a new man
on account of the new manner of his conception: &#8220;For the Lord has created a new thing upon the
earth: a woman shall encompass a man&#8221; (Jer 31:22). Another factor is the novelty of the grace
he bestows: &#8220;For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any meaning, but
a new creature&#8221; (Gal 6:15); &#8220;and be renewed in the spirit of your mind, and put on the new man
who is created according to God&#8221; (Eph 4:23). [Christ is also a new man] on account of the new
commands he sets forth: &#8220;A new commandment I give you: that you love one another as I have
loved you&#8221; (Jn 13:34).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">This appears to correspond to the Apostle&#8217;s intention, yet in a Gloss the barrier is duplicated. On
the side of the Jews the law is set up as the obstacle, while on the Gentile&#8217;s side it is idolatry.

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">When he states <span style="font-weight: bold">and might reconcile both to God in one body</span>, he discloses how both draw near

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">First, he treats of their reconciliation to God.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Secondly, he writes of the manifestation of this reconciliation (2-17).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">It should be realized that love of neighbor is the way to peace with God; for, as is mentioned in
1 John 4 (20): &#8220;He who does not love his brother whom he sees, how can he love God whom he
does not see?&#8221; Let no one pretend he has peace with Christ, Augustine asserts, if he quarrels with
another Christian.

 Hence, he first mentions the peace among themselves Christ brought to men
and then the peace of men with God. For this reason he says <span style="font-weight: bold">that he might reconcile both</span> the
united peoples <span style="font-weight: bold">in one body</span> of the Church, namely, in Christ. &#8220;We, being many, are one body in
Christ&#8221; (Rom 12:5). Then he reconciles us <span style="font-weight: bold">to God</span> through faith and charity: &#8220;For God indeed
was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself&#8221; (2 Cor 5: 19).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">He achieved this by the cross, <span style="font-weight: bold">killing the enmities in himself</span>. In fulfilling the Old Testament
symbols, he killed the hostility that had arisen through the law between the Jews and the Gentiles.
But the hostility that existed between God and men through sin, he killed in himself when he
blotted out sin through the death of the Cross. He &#8220;who gave himself for our sins&#8221; (Gal 1-4);
&#8220;Christ was offered once to carry away the sins of many&#8221; (Heb. 9:28). Therefore, he says <span style="font-weight: bold">killing
the enmities</span>, that is, sins, <span style="font-weight: bold">in himself</span>, meaning in the immolation of his own body. &#8220;Making
peace through the blood of his cross, both as to the things that are on earth and the things that are
in heaven&#8221; (Col 1:20). &#8220;When we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his
Son&#8221; (Rom 5:10). &#8220;God wanted all fullness to dwell in him, and through him, to reconcile all
things unto himself&#8217; (Col 1:19-20). Since Christ satisfied sufficiently for our sins, reconciliation
occurred as a consequence of his having paid the price (cf. 1 Cor 6:20).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">The manifestation of the reconciliation is set down in <span style="font-weight: bold">And coming, he preached</span> where he
touches on:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">First, the proclamation of peace or reconciliation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Secondly, the cause and reason of this peace (2:18).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">The reconciliation of God to man through Christ has been made known because Christ himself
not only reconciled us to God and destroyed the hostilities, but also <span style="font-weight: bold">coming</span> in the flesh <span style="font-weight: bold">he
preached</span> and proclaimed <span style="font-weight: bold">peace</span>. Or, <span style="font-weight: bold">coming</span> after the resurrection when he stood in the midst
of the disciples and said. &#8220;Peace be to you&#8221; (Lk 24:36). &#8220;He has sent me to bring good news to
the afflicted, to heal the brokenhearted&#8221; (Is 61:1). &#8220;How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet
of the messenger who preaches peace, brings good news and announces salvation&#8221; (Is 52:7).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">He preached</span>, I say, not to one people only but <span style="font-weight: bold">to you</span> Gentiles <span style="font-weight: bold">that were afar off</span>; although not
in his own person, nonetheless he proclaimed peace to you through his Apostles. &#8220;Go, therefore,
and teach all nations&#8221; (Mt 28:19). &#8220;Hear, you that are far off, what I have done: and you that are
near, know my strength&#8221; (Is 33:13). Christ in his own person announced the <span style="font-weight: bold">peace to them that
were near</span>. &#8220;For I say that Christ became a servant of the circumcised to show God&#8217;s
truthfulness, to confirm the promises made to the patriarchs&#8221; (Rom 15:8). [Is 54:15 Vulgate
misses point].</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">He indicates the cause and form of peace by saying <span style="font-weight: bold">For by him we have access both, </span>that is, the
two peoples, <span style="font-weight: bold">in one Spirit</span>, meaning we are joined by the union of the Holy Spirit. &#8220;Careful to
keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace&#8221; (Eph 4:3). &#8220;One and the same Spirit produces
all these&#8221; (1 Cor 12:11). The way we enjoy access to the Father is through Christ since Christ
works through the Holy Spirit. &#8220;Now if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not
belong to him&#8221; (Rom 8:9). Hence, whatever happens through the Holy Spirit also occurs through
Christ.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">When he says <span style="font-weight: bold">to the Father, </span>[our access] also must be understood as pertaining to the whole
Trinity. For, by reason of the unity of the Divine Essence, the Son and the Holy Spirit are in the
Father, and the Father and the Son are in the Holy Spirit. In saying <span style="font-weight: bold">to the Father </span>he especially
shows that whatever the Son possesses he has from the Father, and that he recognizes he has it
from the Father.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Once he has made it clear that the Gentiles have been admitted to spiritual blessings together
with the Jews (2:13), he goes on to teach that in these blessings the Gentiles are not of less
eminence than the Jews themselves; they enjoy a completely equal access to Christ&#8217;s blessings.
In reference to this be does two things:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">First, he presents what he has in mind.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Secondly, he clarifies this presentation by an example (2:20).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Regarding the first he makes two points:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">First, he excludes what was [true of] their past state from their present state.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Secondly, he concludes to what is fitting for their present state (2:19b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">In drawing a conclusion, the Apostle says <span style="font-weight: bold">Now therefore you are no more strangers and
foreigners, </span>and it should be recognized that a similar conclusion follows from the premises.
First, indeed, from this, that both [Jews and Gentiles] are united and are reconciled to God. In
the second place, they both have access in one Spirit to the Father. Together they are conformed
to the whole Trinity; to the Father whom they approach, to the Son through whom, and to the
Holy Spirit in whom they have access in unity. Hence, they in no way lack a share in spiritual
goods.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">To understand the text it must be realized that the community of the faithful are sometimes
referred to as a house in the Scriptures: &#8220;that you may know how to behave thyself in the
household of God, which is the church of the living God&#8221; (1 Tim. 3:15). At other times it is
called a city: &#8220;Jerusalem, which is built as a city&#8221; (Ps 121:3). A city possesses a political
community whereas a household has a domestic one,
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote23', WPFootnote23 )"><img src="footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">

    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote23\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 these differ in two respects. For those who
belong to the domestic community share with one another private activities; but those belonging
to the civil community have in common with one another public activities. Secondly, the head
of the family governs the domestic community; while those in the civil community are ruled by
a king. Hence [the analogy]: what the king is in the realm, this the father is in the home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">The community of the faithful contains within it something of the city and something of the
home. If the ruler of the community is thought of, he is a father: &#8220;Our Father, who art in heaven&#8221;
(Mt 6:9); &#8220;I though you would me Father and would not turn from following me&#8221; (Jer 3:19). In
this perspective, the community is a home. But if you consider the subjects themselves, it is a city
since they have in common with one another the particular acts of faith, hope and charity. In this
way, if the faithful are considered in themselves, the community is a civil one; if, however, the
ruler is thought of, it is a domestic community.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">This is why the Apostle writes the two words here: <span style="font-weight: bold">strangers and foreigners</span>. For what the
stranger is to the home, that the foreigner is to the city. A stranger is an outsider, as it were, of
a family: &#8220;It is a miserable life to go from house to house, and where you are a guest you may not
open your mouth&#8221; (Sir 29:24). A foreigner is as an alien to the city into which he comes. As
though the Apostle said: Formerly you were estranged from the community of believers, as
strangers to a home and foreigners to a state&#8212;and as the proselytes were to the Old Law&#8212;but
this is true no longer, for you are no more strangers and foreigners. [Is 54:15 Vulgate misses the
point.]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Next (v, 19b), he draws the conclusion of what their present state is, stating but you are <span style="font-weight: bold">fellow
citizens with the saints and the domestics of God. </span>As if he had said: Since the community of
the faithful is termed a city in relation to its subjects, and a home relative to its ruler, the
assembly to which you are called is the city of the saints and the house of God. &#8220;He who made
perfect the glorious dwellings of Jacob speaks in you, city of God:&#8221; (Ps 87:3). Hence Augustine
remarks: &#8220;Two loves have formed two cities. For the love of God, even to the &#8220;contempt of self,&#8221;
namely, of the man loving, &#8220;builds the heavenly city of Jerusalem. But the love of self, even to
the contempt of God, builds the city of Babylon.

  }
</script>
  Everyone, then, either is a citizen with the
saints if he loves God to the contempt of self;
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote25', WPFootnote25 )"><img src="footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

  }
</script>
 or, if he loves himself even to the contempt of
God, he is a citizen of Babylon.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Consequently, when he says <span style="font-weight: bold">built upon the foundation of the Apostles, </span>he clarifies what has
been said. It is customary in the Scriptures that the figure, called metonymy, is used where the
container is substituted for what it contains, as a house sometimes refers to those who are in the
house. The Apostle employs this figure of speech concerning those who are in the house of God,
the faithful; as though they were one house, he compares them to a building. Regarding this he
does two things:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">First, he sets down what he intended.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Secondly, he shows that the Ephesians themselves have become parts of this building (2:22).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Concerning the first he does two things:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">First, he describes the foundation of this building.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Secondly, its construction or completeness (2:21).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">He writes of two foundations: one is primary and another secondary.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote26', WPFootnote26 )"><img src="footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 The Apostles and Prophets
are the secondary foundation. In this regard he states that they [the Ephesians] are not strangers
but fellow citizens who belong already to the spiritual edifice which is <span style="font-weight: bold">built upon the
foundation of the Apostles and Prophets,</span> that is, upon the teaching of the Apostles and
Prophets. Or, <span style="font-weight: bold">upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets</span> means upon Christ who is
the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets. As though he said: You are built upon the same
foundation on which the Apostles and Prophets, who were Jewish, were built.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">These two interpretations only differ in words. Yet the first is more suited [to the context]; if the
second was the better one there would be no point in adding <span style="font-weight: bold">Jesus Christ himself being the
chief cornerstone</span> since he would be the principal foundation. Hence this is more in harmony
with the first; although Christ would be both the chief stone and the principal foundation. In
meaning, however, they are in no way different since it is the same to say that Christ is the
foundation, and the teaching of the Apostles and Prophets is; after all, they proclaimed Christ
alone, and not themselves. To accept their doctrine is to accept Christ crucified: &#8220;We preach
Christ crucified&#8221; (1 Cor 1:23); and &#8220;We have the mind of Christ&#8221; (1 Cor 2:16). 1 Peter 1 (12)
affirms [of the Prophets]: &#8220;It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves but you,
in the things which are have been announced to you by those who preached the good news to
you.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Notice that the Apostles are designated as foundations: &#8220;O city founded by him on the holy
mountains&#8221; (Ps 87:1). I will lay your foundations with sapphires&#8221; (Is 54:11), that is, with saintly
men. In the Apocalypse 21 (14) they are expressly called foundations: &#8220;And the wall of the city
had twelve foundations, and on them were the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.&#8221;
They are referred to as foundations to the degree that their doctrine proclaims Christ. &#8220;Upon this
rock I will build my Church&#8221; (Mt 16:18).

</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Both <span style="font-weight: bold">Apostles and Prophets </span>are alluded to so that he might indicate that the doctrine of both is
necessary for salvation. &#8220;Therefore, every scribe instructed in the kingdom of heaven is like a
householder who brings forth out of his treasure new things and old&#8221; (Mt 13:52). Also, that he
might show the harmony between the two, of the one with the other, since there is an identical
foundation to both. What the Prophets foretold was to come, the Apostles proclaimed as
accomplished. &#8220;Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel
of God, which he had promised before by his prophets in the holy scriptures, concerning his Son&#8221;
(Rom 1: 1-3).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Christ Jesus alone is the principal foundation, in reference to this he says <span style="font-weight: bold">himself being the chief
cornerstone. </span>Here he states three things about him; he is a stone, is placed at the corner, and is
the chief one.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">He is a stone on account of the strength of the foundation. Whence Matthew 7 (25) speaks of the
house founded on a rock and built solidly; neither rains, nor floods, nor winds could destroy it.
Such was not the case with the house built on sand. &#8220;You saw a stone cut out of the mountain
without a hand being put to it&#8221; (Dan. 2:45). He is called a comer-stone on account of the
convergence of both [Jews and Gentiles]. As two walls are joined at the comer, so in Christ the
Jewish and Pagan peoples are united. &#8220;The stone which the builders rejected became the
cornerstone&#8221; (Ps 118:22): &#8220;This is the stone rejected by you, the builders, which became the
cornerstone.  And there salvation in no one else&#8221; (Acts 4:11-12). And Christ applies this text to
himself in Matthew 21 (42): &#8220;Have you never read in the Scriptures: The stone which the builders
rejected has become the cornerstone?&#8221; He is referred to as the chief one by reason of his heavenly
dignity: &#8220;See, I am laying a stone in Zion, a tested stone, a cornerstone, a precious stone, a
foundation stone&#8221; (Is 28:16).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">The foundation of a spiritual edifice contrasts with that of a material building. For a material
building rests on a foundation in the earth, the more important the foundation is, the deeper must
it be. A spiritual structure, on the other hand, has its foundation in heaven; as a result, the more
principal the foundation, the higher it necessarily Is Thus we could imagine a city, as it were,
coming down from heaven with its foundation in heaven and the building itself appearing to
come downward towards us below, according to that passage of the Apocalypse 21 (2): 1 John,
saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Next (v. 21), he treats of the building&#8217;s construction. In erecting any building four stages are
requisite. First is the foundation of the edifice, second is the construction, third its increase, and
fourth is the completion.

doctrine of the Apostles and Prophets: &#8220;For other foundation no man can lay, but that which is
laid; which is Christ Jesus&#8221; (1 Cor 3:11). He discusses the second briefly in <span style="font-weight: bold">all the building
being framed together. </span>Understood allegorically, this signifies the Church herself which is built
up when men are converted to the faith. Taken morally

 it signifies a sanctified soul, and then
this building is erected when good works are built upon Christ. &#8220;Lady wisdom builds her house&#8221;
(Prov. 14: 1); &#8216;Let each man take care how he builds on it&#8221; (1 Cor 3:10). With Christ as
foundation, every spiritual edifice&#8212;whether of the Jews or of the Gentiles&#8212;is constructed by
God&#8217;s power. &#8220;If Yahweh does not build the palace, in vain do its builders work on it.&#8221; (Ps
127:1). &#8220;Every house is built by someone; but the builder of all things is God&#8221; (Heb. 3:4). Yet
the building is constructed instrumentally either by the man who builds up himself, or by
prelates.

number of those saved increases. &#8220;The word of the Lord continued to spread, and the number of
the disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem&#8221; (Acts 6:7). It also grows when a man makes
progress in good works, and he grows in grace to the degree that he becomes a holy temple. A
temple is the dwelling plate of God and must be holy: &#8220;The Most High sanctifies his dwelling.&#8221;
(Ps 46:5). Since we should  be inhabited by God, that he might live in us, we ought to prepare
ourselves in order to be holy. &#8220;Do you not know that you are the temple of God, and that the
Spirit of God dwells in you?&#8221; (1 Cor 3:16). &#8220;See God&#8217;s dwelling is with men, and he will dwell
with them&#8221; (Rev 21:3).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">But are we not temples of God from the instant we possess charity? I reply that it is so. And the
more we progress, so much the more will God dwell within us. Hence, the fourth requisite to this
building is its perfection and completion, which he states to be <span style="font-weight: bold">in the Lord.</span></p>

is, you are incorporated like the others. &#8220;Come to him, the living stone, rejected indeed by men,
but chosen and honored by God. Be yourselves like living stones built into a spiritual house&#8221; (1
Pet 2:4-5). Therefore he adds <span style="font-weight: bold">into an habitation of God</span> that God may dwell in you through
faith. &#8220;That Christ may dwell by faith in your hearts&#8221; (Eph 3:17). Yet this cannot happen without
charity since &#8220;he who remains in love remains in God and God in him&#8221; (1 Jn 4:16). And charity
is bestowed on us through the Holy Spirit: &#8220;The love of God is poured forth in our hearts by the
Holy Spirit who is given to us&#8221; (Rom 5:5). Thus he adds <span style="font-weight: bold">in the Spirit</span>.</p>
