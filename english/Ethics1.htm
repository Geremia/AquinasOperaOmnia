    Since there are many operations and arts and sciences there must also be

    shipbuilding, navigation; of strategy, victory; of domestic economy, riches.

    In all such skills a subordination of one to another is found. For instance,
    the art of bridle-making is subordinated to the art of riding as also are
    the arts which make riding equipment. The art of riding in turn, and all
    military operations, come under strategy. In a similar way other arts are
    subordinated to still others.

    <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    1. As the Philosopher says in the beginning of the <i>Metaphysics</i> (Bk.
    1, Ch. 2, 982 a 18; St. Th. 2, 41-42), it is the business of the wise man to
    order. The reason for this is that wisdom is the most powerful perfection of
    reason whose characteristic is to know order. Even if the sensitive powers
    know some things absolutely, nevertheless to know the order of one thing to
    another is exclusively the work of intellect or reason. Now a twofold order
    is found in things. One kind is that of parts of a totality, that is, a
    group, among themselves, as the parts of a house are mutually ordered to
    each other. The second order is that of things to an end. This order is of
    greater importance than the first. For, as the Philosopher says in the
    eleventh book of the <i>Metaphysics</i> (Bk. XII, Ch. 10, 1075 a 15; St. Th.
    Bk. XII, Lect. 12, 2629-2631), the order of the parts of an army among
    themselves exists because of the order of the whole army to the commander.
    Now order is related to reason in a fourfold way. There is one order that
    reason does not establish but only beholds, such is the order of things in
    nature. There is a second order that reason establishes in its own act of
    consideration, for example, when it arranges its concepts among themselves,
    and the signs of concept as well, because words express the meanings of the
    concepts. There is a third order that reason in deliberating establishes in
    the operations of the will. There is a fourth order that reason in planning
    establishes in the external things which it causes, such as a chest and a
    house.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    2. Because the operation of reason is perfected by habit, according to the
    different modes of order that reason considers in particular, a
    differentiation of sciences arises. The function of natural philosophy is to
    consider the order of things that human reason considers but does not
    establish-understand that with natural philosophy here we also include
    metaphysics. The order that reason makes in its own act of consideration
    pertains to rational philosophy (logic), which properly considers the order
    of the parts of verbal expression with one another and the order of
    principles to one another and to their conclusions. The order of voluntary
    actions pertains to the consideration of moral philosophy. The order that
    reason in planning establishes in external things arranged by human reason
    pertains to the mechanical arts.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Accordingly it is proper to moral philosophy, to which our attention is at
    present directed, to consider human operations insofar as they are ordered
    one another and to an end.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    3. I am talking about human operations, those springing from man’s will
    following the order of reason. But if some operations are found in man that
    are not subject to the will and reason, they are not properly called human
    but natural, as, clearly appears in operations of the vegetative soul. These
    in no way fall under the consideration of moral philosophy. As the subject
    of natural philosophy is motion, or mobile being, so the subject of moral
    philosophy is human action ordered to an end, or even man,.as he is an agent
    voluntarily acting for an end.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    4. It must be understood that, because man is by nature a social animal,
    needing many things to live which he cannot get for himself if alone, he
    naturally is a part of a group that furnishes him help to live well. He
    needs this help for two reasons. First, to have what is necessary for life,
    without which he cannot live the present life; an for this, man is helped by
    the domestic group of which he is a part. For every man is indebted to his
    parents for his generation and his nourishment and instruction. Likewise
    individuals, who are members of the family, help one another to procure the
    necessities of life. In another way, man receives help from the group of
    which he is a part, to have a perfect sufficiency for life; namely, that man
    may not only live but live well, having everything sufficient for living;
    and in this way man is helped by the civic group, of which he is a member,
    not only in regard to bodily needs—as certainly in the state there are many
    crafts which a single household cannot provide—but also in regard to right
    conduct, inasmuch as public authority restrains with fear of punishment
    delinquent young men whom paternal admonition is not able to correct.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    5. It must be known moreover that the whole which the political group or the
    family constitutes has only a unity of order, for it is not something
    absolutely one. A part of this whole, therefore, can have an operation that
    is not the operation of the whole, as a soldier in an army has an activity
    that does not belong to the whole army. However, this whole does have an
    operation that is not proper to its parts but to the whole—for example, an
    assault of the entire army. Likewise the movement of a boat is a combined
    operation of the crew rowing the boat. There is also a kind of whole that
    has not only a unity of order but of composition, or of conjunction, or even
    of continuity, and according to this unity a thing is one absolutely; and
    therefore there is no operation of the part that does not belong to the
    whole. For in things all of one piece the motion of the whole and of the
    part is the same. Similarly in composites and in conjoined things, the
    operation of a part is principally that of the whole. For this reason it is
    necessary that such a consideration of both the whole and its parts should
    belong to the same science. It does not, however, pertain to the same
    science to consider the whole, which has solely the unity of order, and the
    parts of this whole.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    6. Thus it is that moral philosophy is divided into three parts. The first
    of these, which is called individual (monastic) ethics, considers an
    individual’s operations as ordered to an end. The second, called domestic
    ethics, considers the operations of the domestic group. The third, called
    political science, considers the operations of the civic group.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    7. Thus Aristotle as he begins the treatment of moral philosophy in the
    first part of this book called Ethics, or morals, first gives an
    introduction in which he does three things. First [1] he shows what he
    intends to do. Second [Lect. 3, II], at “Our study will be etc.” (B.1094 b
    13), he determines the manner of treatment. Third [III] in the same lecture,
    at “Now every man etc.” (B.1094 b 29), he explains what manner of person the
    student of this science ought to be. In regard to the initial point he does
    two things. First [A] he presents in advance certain things necessary to
    explain his intention. Second [Lect. 2, B], at “If our actions etc.” (B.1094
    a 19), he manifests his intention. In regard to the first he does two
    things. Initially [1] he shows how it is necessary to start with the end.
    Then [2], at “Since there are many etc.,” he compares habits and acts with
    the end. On the first point he does three things. He states initially [1, a]
    that all human beings are ordered to an end. Next [1, b], at “Now a certain
    diversity etc.,” he shows that there can be a number of ends. Last [ 1, c],
    at “If the ends are works etc.,” he makes a comparison among ends. In regard
    to the first point he does two things. He states his intention [i]; and
    then, at “For this reason etc.” [ii], he explains his purpose.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    8. In regard to the first we should consider that there are two principles
    of human acts, namely, the intellect or reason and the appetite, which are
    active principles as explained in the third book <i>De Anima</i> (Ch. XI,
    434 a5a22; St. Th. Lect. 16, 840-846). The intellect or reason considers
    both the speculative and the practical. The rational appetite is concerned
    with choice and execution. Now all these are ordered to some good as to
    their end, for truth is the end of speculation.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    Therefore, in the speculative intellect he includes teaching by which
    science is conveyed from teacher to student, while in the practical
    intellect he locates art which is right reason applied to things to be made,
    as is stated in the sixth book of this work (1153). He indicates that the
    act of the appetitive intellect is choice, and that execution is “actus.” He
    does not mention prudence, which is in the practical reason together with
    art, because choice is properly directed by prudence. He says therefore that
    each of these faculties obviously seeks some good as an end.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    9. Then [ii], at “For this reason,” he manifests his intention by the effect
    of good. In regard to this we should bear in mind that good is enumerated
    among the primary entities to such a degree—according to the Platonists—that
    good is prior to being. But, in reality, good is convertible with being. Now
    primary things cannot be understood by anything anterior to them, but by
    something consequent, as causes are understood through their proper effects.
    But since good properly is the moving principle of the appetite, good is
    described as movement of the appetite, just as motive power is usually
    manifested through motion. For this reason he says that the philosophers
    have rightly declared that good is what all desire.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    10. There is no problem from the fact that some men desire evil. For they
    desire evil only under the aspect of good, that is, insofar as they think it
    good. Hence their intention primarily aims at the good and only incidentally
    touches on the evil.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    11. The saying “... what all desire” is to be understood not only of those
    who knowingly seek good but also of beings lacking knowledge.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    These things by a natural desire tend to good, not as knowing the good, but
    because they are moved to it by something cognitive, that is, under the
    direction of the divine intellect in the way an arrow speeds towards a
    target by the aim of the archer. This very tendency to good is the desiring
    of good. Hence, he says, all beings desire good insofar as they tend to
    good. But there is not one good to which all tend; this will be explained
    later (58-59; 108-109). Therefore he does not single out here a particular
    good but rather discusses good in general. However, because nothing is good
    except insofar as it is a likeness and participation of the highest good,
    the highest good itself is in some way desired in every particular good.
    Thus it can be said that the true good is what all desire.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    12. Then [i, b], at “Now a certain diversity,” he indicates that there is a
    diversity of ends. In this we must keep in mind that the final good, to
    which the inclination of each thing tends, is its ultimate perfection. Now
    the first perfection is possessed after the manner of a form, but the second
    perfection by way of an operation. Consequently, there must be this
    diversity of ends: some are operations and others are the objects achieved,
    that is, the products which exist apart from the operations.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    13. For evidence of this we must consider that activity is of two kinds, as
    noted in the ninth book of the Metaphysics (Ch. 8, 1050 a 23; St. Th. lect.
    8, 1862-1865). One, which remains in the agent himself, as seeing, wishing
    and understanding, is an operation of the type properly called “action.” The
    other is an operation passing over into external matter and is properly
    called “making.” Sometimes a person accepts external matter only for use, as
    a horse for riding and a zither for playing, and at other times he takes
    external matter to change it into some other form, as when a carpenter
    constructs a house or a bed. Accordingly, the first and second of these
    operations do not have any product which is their term, but each of them is
    an end. The first, however, is more excellent than the second, inasmuch as
    it remains in the agent himself. But the third operation is a kind of
    generation whose term is a thing produced. So, in operations of the third
    type, the things done are the ends.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    14. Then [ i, c ], at “If the ends,” he presents the third type, saying that
    whenever the products which are extrinsic to the activities are ends, the
    things produced necessarily are better than the operations that brought them
    to be, as the thing generated is better than the generative action. The end
    is more important than the means—in fact, the means have goodness from their
    relation to the end.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    15. Then [2], at “Since there are many operations,” he compares habits and
    acts with the end. In this matter he does four things. First [2, a] he shows
    that different things are ordered to different ends. He says that, since
    there are many operations and arts and sciences, there must be different
    ends for each of them, for the ends and the means are proportional. This he
    shows by saying that the end of medical art is health; of shipbuilding,
    navigation; of strategy, victory; and of domestic economy or managing a
    household, riches. He accepts this last example on the opinion of the
    majority of men, for he himself proves in the first book of the
    <i>Politics</i> (Ch. 3-4, 1253 b 12-1254 a; St. Th. Lect. 2, 46-51; Ch.
    9-11, 1256 b 40-1259 a 36; St. Th. Lect. 7-9, 71-100) that riches are not
    the end of domestic economy but the instruments thereof.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    16. Second [2, b], at “In all such skills,” he arranges the order of habits
    among themselves. It happens that one operative habit, which he calls virtue
    (skill), is subordinated to another, as the art of bridle-making is
    subordinated to the art of riding because the rider tells the bridle-maker
    how he should make the bridle. In this way the rider is the designer, that
    is, the chief producer of the thing itself. The same arguments hold for the
    other arts making additional equipment needed for riding, such as saddles or
    the like. The equestrian art is again subordinated to the military, for in
    ancient times the army included not only mounted soldiers but everyone who
    fought for victory. Hence under military science there is not only the
    equestrian but every art or skill ordered to the prosecution of war-archery,
    ballistics and everything else of this kind. In this same way other arts are
    subordinated to still others.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    17. Third [2, c], at “It follows then,” he lays down the order of ends
    according to the order of habits. He says that in all arts or skills it is
    commonly true that the architectonic ends are absolutely more desirable to
    everyone than are the ends of the arts or skills that are subordinated to
    the chief ends. He proves this from the fact that men follow or seek the
    ends of the inferior arts or skills for the sake of the ends of the
    superior. The text, however, is suspensive, and should be read as follows:
    In all such skills a subordination of one to another is found... in all
    these the architectonic ends etc.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    18. Fourth [2, d], at “It does not matter,” he shows that it makes no
    difference in the order of ends, whether the end is a product or an
    activity. He says that it makes no difference in what pertains to this order
    that these ends be activities or some product other than the activities, as
    is evident from the explanation given above (16). The end of bridle-making
    is a finished bridle; but the end of horsemanship, which is of greater
    importance, is an operation, that is, riding. The contrary is true in
    medicine and gymnastics, for the end of medicine is something produced,
    namely, health. But of gymnastics which is comprised under it, the end is an

        Even though the good be the same for one man and for the whole state, it
        seems much better and more perfect to procure and preserve the good of
        the whole state. It is admirable, indeed, to preserve the good of an
        individual but it is better still and more divine to do this for a
        nation and for cities. With such a good as the object of our inquiry we
        may call our study political science.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        19. After having stated premises on which his proposition must rest, the
        Philosopher now begins to manifest it, that is, to show what the
        principal purpose of this science is [B]. To achieve this he does three
        things. First [1 ] he shows from what he has already said, that there is
        some supreme end of human affairs. Second [2], at “A knowledge of it
        etc.,” he shows that it is necessary to know this end. Third [3], at “It
        seems undoubtedly,” he shows to which science this knowledge belongs. He
        gives three proofs for the first statement. The principal one is this.
        Whenever an end is such that we wish other things because of it, and we
        wish it for itself and not because of something else, then that end is
        not only a good end but a supreme one. This is obvious from the fact
        that an end for the sake of which other ends are sought is of greater
        importance than they, as is evident from his earlier remarks (16). But
        it is necessary that there be some such end of human affairs. Therefore,
        human life or activity has some good end which is supreme.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        20. He proves the minor premise by an argument leading to an impossible
        conclusion. Thus, it is evident from the premises (16) that one end is
        desired on account of another. Now, either we arrive at some end which
        is not desired on account of another, or we do not. If we do, the
        proposition is proved. If, however, we do not find some such end, it
        follows that every end will be desired on account of another end. In
        this case we must proceed to infinity. But it is impossible in ends to
        proceed to infinity. Therefore, there must be some end that is not
        desired on account of another.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        21. That it is impossible in ends to proceed to infinity is proved also
        by an argument having an impossible resolution. If we should proceed to
        infinity in our desire for ends so that one end should always be desired
        on account of another to infinity, we will never arrive at the point
        where a man may attain the ends desired. But a man desires fruitlessly
        what he cannot get; consequently, the end he desires would be useless
        and vain. But this desire is natural, for it was said above (9) that the
        good is what all beings naturally desire. Hence it follows that a
        natural desire would be useless and vain. But this is impossible. The
        reason is that a natural desire is nothing else but an inclination
        belonging to things by the disposition of the First Mover, and this
        cannot be frustrated. Therefore, it is impossible that we should proceed
        to an infinity of ends.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        12. It follows that there must be some ultimate end on account of which
        all other things are desired, while this end itself is not desired on
        account of anything else. So there must be some supreme end of human
        affairs.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        23. Then [2], at “A knowledge of it,” he shows that the knowledge of
        this end is necessary for man. He proves this in two steps. First [2, a]
        he shows that it is necessary for man to know such an end. Second [2,
        b], at “This being the case etc.,” he manifests what man should know
        about it. He concludes then from what has been said (19-22), that it is
        necessary for man to know that there is a supreme end of human affairs
        because this has great importance for life, that is, it is of great help
        in all phases of human living. This conclusion is apparent for the
        following reasons. Nothing that is directed to another can be
        immediately attained by man unless he knows that other to which it is to
        he directed. An obvious indication of this is found in the example of
        the archer who shoots straight because he keeps his eye on the target at
        which he is aiming. Now man’s whole life ought to be ordered to the
        supreme and ultimate end of human life. It is necessary, therefore, to
        have a knowledge of this end of human life. The explanation is that the
        reason for the means must always be found in the end itself, as also is
        proved in the second book of the <i>Physics</i> (Ch. 9, 199 b 34-200 b
        10; St. Th. Lect. 15, 184-188).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        24. Then [2, b], at “This being the case,” he shows what ought to be
        known about that end. He states that inasmuch as the knowledge of the
        supreme end is necessary for human life, we must determine what, is the
        supreme end, and to which speculative or practical science its study
        belongs. By sciences he understands the speculative sciences, and by
        skills the practical sciences since there are principles of some
        operations. According to him we must make this attempt, in order to
        suggest the difficulty there is in grasping the ultimate end of human
        life, as in considering all ultimate causes. He says then that we should
        understand it in its general outlines, that is, with only the evidence
        of probability because such a manner of understanding is largely what is
        available in human things, as he will explain later on (131-134). Now
        the first of these two belongs to the treatise on this science because
        such a consideration is about the matter of this science. But the second
        belongs to the introduction, where its purpose is explained.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        25. Therefore when immediately after this material he says “It seems
        undoubtedly” [3], he shows to which science the consideration of this
        end should belong. In regard to this he does two things. First [3, a] he
        gives a reason in proof of his statement. Second [3, b], at “Now such a
        science etc.,” he proves something which he had previously presumed.
        First then, he states the reason for his proposal, which is this: the
        supreme end belongs to the most important and most truly architectonic
        science. This is clear from what was said above, for it was pointed out
        (16, 20) that the sciences or arts treating of the means to the end are
        contained under the science or art treating of the end. So it is
        necessary that the ultimate end should belong to the most important
        science concerned with the primary and most important end and to the
        truly architectonic science as directing the others in what they should
        do. But political science appears to be such, namely, the most important
        and the most truly architectonic. Therefore, it belongs to it to
        consider the supreme end.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        26. Then [3, b], at “Now such a science’ “ he proves what he had taken
        for granted: that political science is such a science. First [b, i] he
        proves that it is most truly architectonic, and next [b, ii], at “For
        even though the good etc.,” that it is most important. He handles the
        first statement in two ways. First [i, x] he ascribes to political
        science or politics the things which belong to an architectonic science.
        Second [i, y] from this he draws the conclusion he intended, at
        “Political science etc.” There are two characteristics of architectonic
        knowledge. One is that it dictates what is to be done by the art or
        science subject to it, as the equestrian art dictates the manner of
        bridle-making. The other is that it uses it for its own ends. Now the
        first of these is applicable to politics or political science both in
        regard to speculative and in regard to practical sciences-in different
        ways, however. Political science dictates to a practical science both in
        the matter of its activity, that is, whether or not it should operate,
        and in regard to the objects to which its operation is to be directed.
        It dictates to the smith not only that he use his skill but also that he
        use it in such a fashion as to make knives of a particular kind. Both
        (characteristics of architectonic knowledge) are ordered to the end of
        human living.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        27. But political science dictates to a speculative science only as to
        activity, but not concerning the specification of its proper activity.
        Political science orders that some teach or learn geometry, and actions
        of this kind insofar as they are voluntary belong to the matter of
        ethics and can be ordered to the goal of human living. But the political
        ruler does not dictate to geometry what conclusions it should draw about
        a triangle, for this is not subject to the human will nor can it be
        ordered to human living but it depends on the very nature of things.
        Therefore, he says that political science ordains which sciences, both
        practical and speculative, should be studied in a state, who should
        study them, and for how long.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        28. The other characteristic of an architectonic science, the use of
        subordinate sciences, belongs to political science only in reference to
        the practical sciences. Hence he adds that we see the most highly
        esteemed, the noblest skills, i.e., the operative arts, fall under
        political science-for example strategy, domestic economy, and rhetoric.
        Political science uses such skills for its own end, that is, for the
        common good of the state.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        29. Then [i, y], at “Political science in fact,” he draws a conclusion
        from two premises. He says that since political science uses the other
        practical sciences, as already noted (28), and since it legislates what
        is to be done and what omitted, as previously stated (27), it follows
        that the end of this science as architectonic embraces or contains under
        itself the ends of other practical sciences. Hence, he concludes, the
        end of political science is the good of man, that is, the supreme end of
        human things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        30. Then [b, ii], at “For even though the good be the same,” he shows
        that political science is the most important science from the very
        nature of its special end. It is evident that insofar as a cause is
        prior and more powerful it extends to more effects. Hence, insofar as
        the good, which has the nature of a final cause, is more powerful, it
        extends to more effects. So, even though the good be the same objective
        for one man and for the whole state, it seems much better and more
        perfect to attain, that is, to procure and preserve the good of the
        whole state than the good of any one man. Certainly it is a part of that
        love which should exist among men that a man preserve the good even of a
        single human being. But it is much better and more divine that this be
        done for a whole people and for states. It is even sometimes desirable
        that this be done for one state only, but it is much more divine that it
        be done for a whole people that includes many states. This is said to be
        more divine because it shows greater likeness to God who is the ultimate
        cause of all good. But this good common to one or to several states is
        the object of our inquiry, that is, of the particular skill called
        political science. Hence to it, as the most important science, belongs
        in a most special way the consideration of the ultimate end of human
        life.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        31. But we should note that he says political science is the most
        important, not simply, but in that division of practical sciences which
        are concerned with human things, the ultimate end of which political
        science considers. The ultimate end of the whole universe is considered
        in theology which is the most important without qualification. He says
        that it belongs to political science to treat the ultimate end of human
        life. This however he discusses here since the matter of this book
        covers the fundamental notions of political science.

        Our study will be adequately treated if it is investigated according to
        the nature of the subject matter. The same certitude should not be
        sought in all discussions just as the same exactness should not be
        expected in all the productions of art. Now good and just deeds, with
        which political science is concerned, are differently and mistakenly
        judged to such a degree that none of them seems to be good and just by
        nature but merely by disposition of law. Because of bad judgment, many
        have been harmed even by good things: some men have lost their lives by
        reason of riches, others by reason of physical courage. It is desirable
        therefore when treating of these variable subjects and when arguing from
        them as premises, to bring out roughly the outlines of the truth, and to
        conclude about those things which occur in the majority of cases.

        In this same spirit the student ought to take whatever is taught, for it
        is proper to an educated man to look for as much certitude in each study
        as the nature of the subject admits. It approximates the same thing to
        allow a mathematician to use rhetorical arguments and to demand
        conclusive demonstrations from a rhetorician.

        But it will certainly be very useful to have a knowledge of moral

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        32. After the Philosopher has shown what is the good principally
        intended in this science, he now [II] determines the method proper to
        this science. He does this first on the part of the teacher [II, a]; and
        then, at “in the same spirit etc.,” on the part of the student [II, b].
        In regard to the first he lays down this reason. The method of
        manifesting truth in any science ought to be suitable to the subject
        matter of that science. He shows this from the fact that certitude
        cannot be found, nor should it be sought, in the same degree in all
        discussions where we reason about anything. Likewise, the same method is
        not used in all products made by art; but each workman works with the
        material in a way suited to that material, in one way with the soil, in
        another with clay, in still another with metal. Now the matter of moral
        study is of such a nature that perfect certitude is not suitable to it.
        He shows this from two classes of things which seem to belong to the
        material with which moral study is concerned.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        33. In the matter of morals the first and foremost place is held by
        virtuous works. They are called just and are the chief concern of
        political science. Regarding them there are no agreed opinions, but
        rather a decided difference is found in what men judge about them. In
        this matter a variety of errors occur, for certain actions, considered
        just and good by some, are looked upon as unjust and bad by others
        according to different times and places and persons. Now a deed is
        considered vicious at one time and in one country, but at a different
        time and in a different country it is not c6nsidered to be so. Because
        of this disagreement, it happens that some are of the opinion that no
        action is just or good by nature but only by disposition of law. We
        shall treat more fully of this opinion in the second book of this work
        (245-254).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        34. Second, external goods that are used purposively by men have a moral
        consideration. In regard to them it happens that we find the mistake
        just mentioned inasmuch as these material goods are not always used in
        the same way by everyone. Some men are helped by them, while others
        indeed are harmed by them. Many are ruined by having riches—for
        instance, those who are murdered by robbers. Some by reason of their
        physical courage on which they rely have carelessly exposed themselves
        to dangers. Thus it is evident that moral matters are variable and
        divergent, not having the same certitude each time.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        35. Because, in the art of demonstrative science, principles must
        conform to conclusions, it is desirable and preferable when treating
        subjects so variable, and when proceeding from premises likewise
        variable, to bring out the truth first in a rough outline by applying
        universal principles to singulars and by proceeding from the simple
        (universal) to the complex (particular) where acts are concerned. For it
        is necessary in every practical science to proceed in a composite (i.e.,
        deductive) manner. On the contrary in speculative science, it is
        necessary to proceed in an analytical manner by breaking down the
        complex into elementary principles. Second, we should bring out the
        outlines of the truth, that is, an approximation to the truth. This is
        to proceed from the proper principles of this science. Moral science
        treats the acts of the will, and the thing moving the will is not only
        the good but even fictitious good. Third, we must speak of events as
        they happen in the majority of cases, that is, of voluntary acts that
        proceed from the will, inclined perhaps to one alternative rather than
        another but never operating under compulsion. In these, too, we must
        proceed in such a way that principles are conformable to conclusions.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        36. Then [II, b], at “In this same spirit,” he shows that the student
        must accept this limitation in moral matters. He says that it is proper
        that each one should take whatever is said to him by another in the same
        spirit, that is, as the matter warrants. The reason is that a learned or
        well-instructed man should look for as much certitude in any matter as
        the nature of the subject admits. There cannot be as much certainty in
        variable and contingent matter as in necessary matter which is always
        the same. Therefore, the educated man ought not to look for greater, nor
        be satisfied with less, certitude than is appropriate to the subject
        under discussion. It seems an equal fault to allow a mathematician to
        use rhetorical arguments and to demand from a rhetorician conclusive
        demonstrations such as a mathematician should give. But mistakes happen
        because the method appropriate to the matter is not considered.
        Mathematics is concerned with matter in which perfect certitude is
        found. Rhetoric, however, deals with political matter where a variety of
        views occurs.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        37. Then [III], at “Now every man,” he shows what sort of person the
        student of this science ought to be. First [III, a] he shows who is an
        incompetent student; and second [III, b], at “Furthermore etc.,” who is
        an unprofitable student. Third [III, c], at “But it will certainly
        etc.,” he explains the characteristics of the ideal student. In respect
        to the first lie does two things. First [a, i] he introduces certain
        things necessary to explain his proposition. He states that each man can
        judge well only the things he knows. Thus a man educated in one
        particular subject can judge well what belongs to that subject. But the
        man who is well educated in all subjects can judge well about all,
        without restriction to a particular subject.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        38. Second [a, ii], at “In keeping with this,” he proves his statement,
        namely, that a young man is not a good student of political science nor
        of any part of moral science comprised under political science, because
        as was said (37) a man can judge well only the things he knows. Now
        every student should make good judgments about what he studies, so that
        he may accept what is true but not what is false. Therefore, no one can
        be a good student unless he has some knowledge of what he ought to
        study. But a young
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        man does not have a knowledge of things belonging to moral science,
        which are known mostly by experience. A young man is inexperienced in
        the ways of life because of the very brevity of his life, while the
        principles of moral science proceed from what pertains to and also
        treats of the actions of human life. For instance, if it be said that
        the generous man keeps the cheaper things for himself and makes a
        present of the more expensive to others, a young man will perhaps judge
        this not to be true because of inexperience. It is the same with other
        social dealings. Hence it is evident that a young man is not a good
        student of political science.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        39. Then [III, b], at “Furthermore,” he shows who is an unprofitable
        student of this science. Here we must consider that moral science
        teaches men to follow reason and to refrain from the things to which the
        passions incline, such as concupiscence, anger, and the like. Toward
        these, men are inclined in two ways. In one way by choice, for instance,
        when a man of set purpose intends to satisfy his concupiscence. Such a
        one he calls a slave of his emotions. In another way, when a man
        resolves to abstain from harmful pleasures but is sometimes overcome by
        the urge of passion, so that contrary to his resolution he follows the
        promptings of passion. A man of this type is said to be incontinent.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        40. He affirms then that the one who is ruled by the emotions will study
        this science in vain, that is, without any result and uselessly without
        attaining its proper end. The end of this science is not knowledge
        alone, which those enslaved to passion can perhaps gain. But the end of
        this science, as of all practical sciences, is human action. Now those
        who follow the emotions do not attain virtuous acts. So in regard to
        this it makes no difference whether the student of this science is
        immature in age or immature in character, that is, a slave of the
        emotions. The reason is that, as the person immature in age fails to
        achieve the end of this science that is knowledge, so the immature in
        character fails to achieve the end that is action-His deficiency is not
        due to time but to the fact that he lives according to his emotions,
        seeking everything to which the emotions incline. Now, for such men the
        knowledge of this science is useless; the same may be said of the
        incontinent who do not act in accord with their. knowledge of moral
        matters.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        41. Then [III, c], at “But it will certainly,” he indicates the good
        student of this science. He says that it is very useful to have a
        knowledge of moral matters for those who regulate their desires and act
        in externals according to the dictates of reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        42. Last, in the conclusion he sums up what has been discussed in the
        introduction (1-41), stating that certain things have been said in a
        preliminary manner about the student—this was treated last; stating also
        what is the method of demonstrating—this was treated in the middle of
        the introduction; and last what is our purpose, namely, what is the
        principal aim of this science—this was treated first.

        But as to where happiness is to be found men are at variance. The
        multitude differs from the philosophers, for the people generally think
        that happiness consists in something apparent and obvious such as
        pleasure or riches or honors; some place it in one of these, others in
        another; and oftentimes even the same person shifts his position. For
        instance, the sick man thinks happiness is found in health, the poor man
        considers that it is found in riches, while men conscious of their own
        ignorance esteem those happy who give utterance to lofty ideas that are
        above their comprehension. Some philosophers [Platonists] were of the
        opinion that, over and above the many goods, there exists an absolute
        good which is the cause of goodness in all other things.

        It is perhaps vain to examine all these opinions, and it will be

        In this matter we should be aware of the difference in arguments, some
        of which proceed from principles and others to principles. Previously
        Plato had learnedly discussed the subject when he examined the question
        whether we proceed from or to principles like athletes in the race- b
        course running from or toward the judges. In either case we must start
        from things known. Now these are of two kinds, namely, things known to
        us and things known absolutely. Presumably then we should begin from
        what is known to us.

        One who is going to devote himself seriously to the study of good and
        just deeds and to political affairs in general ought to have been
        accustomed to a virtuous life. This will serve as a principle and if it
        be adequate he will have no need to know the reasons for virtuous
        conduct. A student with this upbringing will discover working principles
        within himself or readily acquire them from someone else. The man,
        however, who can do neither of these things should listen to the verdict
        of Hesiod [ <i>Works and Days</i>, 293]. That man, the poet says, is
        best who understands everything by himself; and that man good who takes
        what is well 10 said by another. But he who neither himself understands
        nor takes to heart what he hears from another is indeed a useless
        fellow.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        43. Having finished the introduction, Aristotle here begins the treatise
        on the science itself. He divides the treatise into three parts. In the
        first part he investigates happiness, which is the supreme human good,
        and he comes to the conclusion from a study of the subject that
        happiness is activity flowing from virtue. In the second part [Lect. 19]
        he discusses virtues at “If then happiness is a kind of operation
        according to perfect virtue etc.” (B.1102 a 4). In the third part he
        completes his treatise on happiness, explaining which operation it is
        and of what nature. This he does in the tenth book (B.1172 a 19) at
        “After these matters we ought perhaps next to discuss pleasure.” In
        regard to the first he does two things. First [1] he explains his
        intention. Second [II], at “As to the name etc,,” he carries it out. He
        says first, resuming what he was investigating before (9-13), that since
        all knowledge and choice aim at some good, that is, are ordered to some
        desired good as an end, we must discuss the nature of that good to which
        political science is ordered. Such is the highest good of all actions,
        that is, the highest among those attainable by human operation.
        Moreover, it was said above (18) that these two notions must be studied
        about the ultimate end of human good; what it is—this is here proposed
        for consideration and to what science it belongs and this was treated
        above in the introduction (25-30).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        44. Next [II], at “As to the name,” he treats happiness. He proceeds
        here in two steps. First [A] he investigates the opinions of others
        about happiness. Second [Lect.9], at “Let us return again to a
        consideration etc.” (B.1097 a 16), he states his own opinion. In regard
        to the initial point he does two things. First [A’] he gives the
        opinions of others about happiness. Second [Lect. 5; I], at “Let us
        return to the subject etc.” (B.1095 b 12), he examines these opinions.
        He handles the first point in two ways. Initially [1] he presents
        opinions about the ultimate end of human actions. Then [2], at “It is
        perhaps vain,” he points out how we should examine opinions of this
        kind. In regard to the first he does two things. He indicates the
        aspects of general agreement [1, a]; and then [1, b], at “But as to
        where happiness etc.,” he shows in what way there is disagreement.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        45. In the beginning he presents two points on which there is general
        agreement about the ultimate end. First [1, a], at “As to the name,” he
        asserts that both the many, that is, the common people and the cultured
        or philosophers, name happiness the highest human good. Second, they
        have a common understanding of the term because all consider that living
        well and acting well are identified with being happy.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        46. Then [1I, b ], at “But as to where happiness,” he shows in what
        respect the opinions of men differ about happiness. He affirms that
        especially about the nature of happiness men are at variance, i.e.,’hold
        different opinions. This difference is threefold. First of all the
        multitude does not think in this matter like the philosophers. People
        commonly consider that happiness consists in something apparent and
        obvious among the objects of sense, which alone are evident to the
        multitude and, therefore, so obvious as not to need exhaustive
        search-such as pleasure, riches, honor, and the like. The views of the
        philosophers on this point are given later (49).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        47. The second difference is found among the common people themselves.
        Some of them place happiness in one sensible good, others in another.
        The avaricious place it in riches, the self-indulgent in pleasures, the
        ambitious in honors.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        48. The third difference arises from the end in itself. Since it is
        characteristic of the ultimate end that it be greatly desired, people
        consider that to be happiness which is desired most of all. Now, need of
        a good increases the desire for it, and so the sick man who lacks health
        judges the supreme good to be health; the beggar looks upon riches in
        the same way. Likewise those who are conscious of their own ignorance
        esteem as happy others who give utterance to lofty ideas which are above
        the comprehension of the ignorant. All this pertains to the opinion of
        the multitude.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        49. But some among the philosophers, the Platonists were of the opinion
        that, over and above the many different sensible goods, there exists one
        which is absolute good and which is the separated essence of goodness
        itself. As the separated form of man was called by them “man in himself”
        so the separated good was “good in itself,” and this is the cause of the
        goodness of all other things as they partake of that highest good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        50. Then [2], at “It is perhaps vain,” he shows how we should proceed in
        our investigation of the aforesaid opinions. He handles the discussion
        in three steps. First [2, a] he shows which of these opinions we ought
        to investigate. Second [2, b], at “In this matter we should etc.,” he
        shows in what order we should do this. Third [2, c] he shows how the
        student should be disposed so that he may properly understand what is
        taught. He says then that to examine all opinions men hold about
        happiness would be useless for a good philosopher, inasmuch as some of
        them are altogether unreasonable. But it suffices to examine at most the
        opinions that on the surface are probable either because they give that
        appearance or at least are considered to have weight by many.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        51. Then [2, b], at “In this matter we should be aware,” he shows in
        what order we must discuss opinions of this sort and in general all
        moral matters. He points out a difference in the manner of reasoning.
        There are some argumentations proceeding from principles, that is, from
        causes to effects, such as demonstrations of the reasoned fact (<i
          >propter quid</i
        >). On the contrary, there are other argumentations proceeding from
        effects to causes or principles. These do not produce a demonstration of
        the reasoned fact but only of the fact (<i>quia</i>). This distinction
        was previously made by Plato when he inquired whether we should proceed
        from or to principles. Then he offers this example from the racecourse.
        In order to judge athletes running in a race certain
        <i>agonothetes</i> or judges were stationed at the beginning of the
        course. Sometimes the athletes started from the judges and ran to the
        finishing line, and sometimes they started from the end and ran toward
        the judges. Likewise there is a twofold order in the process of
        reasoning.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        52. In order to know the order of procedure in any subject we should
        reflect that it is necessary to begin from what is better understood.
        Through things better known we arrive at a knowledge of things unknown.
        Now things are said to be better known in two ways. Some are better
        known in regard to us such as the composite and the sensible; others are
        better known absolutely and in themselves, as the simple and the
        intelligible. Because we acquire knowledge by reasoning, we must proceed
        from what is better known to us. Now if the better known absolutely are
        the same as the better known to us, the reason proceeds from principles
        as in mathematics. If, however, the better known absolutely are
        different from the better known to us, then we must use the
        effect-to-cause procedure as in the natural and moral sciences.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        53. Then [2, c], at “One who is going,” he shows how a student of such
        subjects should be disposed. He says that since in moral matters we
        ought to begin from what is better known to us, that is, from certain
        effects noted about human acts, a man who wishes to be a competent
        student of moral science must be well-informed and experienced in the
        ways of human living, that is about external good and just actions or
        works of virtue, and in general about all civil matters like laws and
        political affairs and other things of this sort. The reason for this is
        that in moral matters we must take as a principle that a thing is so.
        For example, we accept from experience and custom that concupiscence is
        restrained by fasting.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        54. If this is obvious to someone it is not so necessary for him in
        acting to understand the total explanation. Thus to effect a cure a
        physician need know only that this medicine cures a particular malady.
        But to know the reason, we must have a scientific knowledge that is
        sought chiefly in speculative sciences. Now one who is skilled in human
        affairs either discovers working principles for himself and sees them as
        self-evident, or he readily acquires them from someone else. But a man
        about whom neither of these things can be correctly said should listen
        to the verdict of the poet Hesiod. He calls that man best who can
        understand by himself, and that man good who takes what is said by
        another. But the man who is capable neither of understanding by himself
        nor of bearing in mind what he hears from another is useless as far as
        acquiring a science is concerned.

        But this seems too superficial to be the good we are looking for. Honor
        consists in the action of those rendering it rather than anything in the

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        55. After the Philosopher has recounted the different opinions about
        happiness, he begins to investigate the truth of these opinions. First
        [I] he examines the opinion of, those discussing happiness from the
        moral point of view who place happiness in some good of this life.
        Second [Lect. 6], at “Perhaps it will be better” (B.1096 a 12), he
        examines the opinion of those who do not discuss happiness from the
        moral point of view but place it in some separated good. In regard to
        the first he does two things. He lays down a, notion [A] that opinions
        on this subject have in common; and next [B], at “Now, most men,” he
        begins to investigate the variety of opinions. Then, because the
        Philosopher seemed to have made a digression from his principal purpose
        while he was determining the mode of procedure, he returns to the point
        whence he had digressed, that is, to the opinions about happiness. He
        asserts that some seem to think, not without reason, that the final good
        called happiness is a good belonging to this life on the purely human
        level. This is the goal of all the works of life. Now, means are
        proportionate to that end. Hence it is probable that happiness is among
        the number of goods belonging to this life. But what the truth may be in
        this matter will be indicated later (60, 64, 65, 70-72).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        56. Next [B], at “Now, most men,” he searches for the truth about the
        things on which the opinions differ. In regard to this he does two
        things. First [A’] he examines the opinions that seem more likely to be
        true. Second [B’], at “As to the accumulator of riches etc.,” he
        examines an opinion rather remote from the truth. In regard to the first
        he does three things. First [1] he examines the opinion placing
        happiness in the things that pertain to a life of pleasure. Second [2],
        at “Men of superior refinement etc.,” he examines the opinion placing
        happiness in the things pertaining to public life. Third [3], at “Later
        on we shall investigate etc.,” he mentions the contemplative life. In
        regard to the first he does three things. First [A’, 1, a] he presents
        the opinion. Second [A’, 1, b], at “There are indeed three etc.,” he
        distinguishes three types of life without elaborating on them. Third
        [A’, 1, c], at “The majority of men etc.,” he examines the truth of the
        opinion presented.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        57. He says then in the first place that some men, from the goods of
        this life, choose pleasure and place happiness in it. They include not
        only the majority or the common people who by and large favor pleasure,
        but also persons eminent either in knowledge and teaching or in
        uprightness of life. Even the Epicureans, who considered pleasure the
        highest good, carefully cultivated the virtues. They did so, however, on
        account of pleasure, that is, for fear their pleasure would be hindered
        by means of contrary vices. The vice of gluttony, for instance, causes
        bodily suffering through excessive eating; because of theft a man is
        thrown into prison. So different vices are an impediment to pleasure in
        different ways. Since then the ultimate end is exceedingly delectable,
        they who make pleasure the highest good intensely love the life of
        pleasure.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        58. Then [A’, 1, b], at “There are indeed three,” he distinguishes three
        types of life: the sensual just mentioned, the public, and the
        contemplative. These he calls the most prominent types. For evidence of
        this we must now bear in mind what will later be discussed in the ninth
        book (1944-1949), that every man thinks his life to be that to which he
        is most strongly drawn, as the philosopher to philosophizing, the hunter
        to hunting, and so on. Because man is most strongly drawn to the last
        end, it is necessary that the types of life be distinguished according
        to the diversity of the ultimate end. Now the end has the nature of
        good, and good is threefold: the useful, the pleasurable, and the
        virtuous or honorable. Two of these, namely, the pleasurable and the
        virtuous or honorable, have the nature of end because both are desirable
        for their own sake. That indeed is called virtuous which is good
        according to reason, and this has pleasure attached to it. Hence the
        pleasurable, as distinguished from the virtuous, is so called in
        reference to the senses. Reason, we must remember, is both speculative
        and practical.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        59. Therefore, that life is called sensual which fixes its end in the
        pleasures of the senses; and that public which fixes its end in the good
        of the practical reason, for example, in the exercise of virtuous deeds;
        and that contemplative which fixes its end in the good of the
        speculative reason or in the contemplation of truth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        60. Next [A’, 1, c], at “The majority of men,” he examines the opinion
        cited above. In regard to this he does two things. First [c, i] he
        disproves it. Second (c, ii], at “They justify their choice etc.,” he
        advances a reason why some are drawn to this life. In regard to the
        first we must consider that the sensual life, which fixes its end in
        sense pleasure, necessarily has to place that end in those very intense
        pleasures following from the natural operations by which the individual
        is preserved by eating and drinking and the race by sexual intercourse.
        Now pleasures of this kind are found in both men and beasts. It follows
        then that the multitude of men who fix their end in such pleasures seem
        quite bestial in choosing a life which even the pigs enjoy. If the
        happiness of man would consist in this, dumb animals enjoying the
        pleasure of food and sexual intercourse would have to be called happy
        for the same reason. Assuming that happiness is a characteristically
        human good, it cannot possibly consist in these things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        61. Then [c, ii], at “They justify their choice,” he gives the reason
        why some hold this opinion. He says that the reason they offer is that
        many in high places, like kings and princes who are considered very
        happy by the common people, share the tastes of a certain Assyrian king
        named Sardanapalus who was much given to sensuality. On this account it
        is thought that pleasure is something very good since it is a thing
        highly esteemed by the great.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        62. At “Men of superior refinement” [2] he investigates opinions
        concerning the active or public life. First [2, a] he does this in
        regard to honor; and second [2, b], at “From this someone etc.,” in
        regard to virtue. This is a reasonable procedure, for the active or
        public life aims at the honorable good. Now it is called honorable as
        pertaining to the state of honor. Hence both honor itself and virtue,
        which is the cause of honor, appear to belong to it. In regard to the
        first he does three things. First [2, a, i], in presenting the opinion,
        he notes that persons of superior refinement, namely, the virtuous and
        those occupied in the active life, place happiness in honor.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        63. Second [2, a, ii], at “for honor seems,” he offers a reason for
        this: the sole purpose of public life appears to be honor which is
        rendered as a reward to the politically successful. Therefore, for those
        engaged in public life happiness probably seems to consist in honor.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        64. Third [2, a, iii], at “But this seems” he disproves this opinion by
        two reasons. In the first [iii, x] of these he says that in a way we
        divine the true nature of happiness, that is, we surmise happiness to be
        a good proper to the happy man, a thing belonging preeminently to him
        and taken from him with difficulty. But this is not true of honor which
        seems rather to consist in the action of the one rendering the honor,
        and to be in his power rather than in the power of the one honored.
        Therefore honor is something more extrinsic and superficial than the
        good we are seeking, which is happiness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        65. He gives the second reason at “Another reason” [iii, y]. Happiness
        is some very good thing which is not sought on account of another. But
        there is something better than honor, namely, that on account of which
        honor is sought. Men appear to seek honor in order to confirm the solid
        opinion they have formed of themselves that they are good men and that
        they may be assured of this by the judgment of others. They look,
        therefore, for honor from prudent men with correct judgment and from
        those who know them best and can be better judges. Hence they seek to be
        honored for their virtue, which is the source of man’s good, as will be
        shown in the second book (307-308). So virtue, for whose sake honor is
        sought, is a better thing than honor. It follows then that happiness
        does not consist in honor.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        66. Then [2, b], at “From this someone,” he investigates the opinion of
        those who place happiness in virtue. In regard to this he does two
        things. First [2, b, i] he states the opinion and says that perhaps
        someone will think, by reason of what was just said, that virtue rather
        than honor is the end of public life.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        67. Second [2, b, ii], at “But apparently,” he rejects this for two
        reasons. The first is that happiness seems to be a most perfect good.
        But virtue is not of such a nature, for sometimes it is found without
        the perfection of activity, as we see in those who are asleep and yet
        have the habit of virtue. It is possible, too, that a man may have the
        habit of virtue, but for lack of opportunity not perform a single act of
        a particular virtue during his whole life. This is particularly evident
        regarding magnanimity and magnificence, virtues perhaps possessed by a
        poverty-stricken person who is never able to perform great deeds.
        Therefore virtue is not the same as happiness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        68. He gives the second reason at “Moreover he may be” [2, b, iii]. It
        is this. It happens that one who has the habit of virtue may be
        ill-favored by fortune. Who will call such a man happy except someone
        obstinately defending a thesis against the plain truth? Therefore
        happiness is not the same as virtue. This, he says, is sufficient for
        his purpose. Enough has been said on the subject in his <i>Encyclis</i>,
        that is, in certain learned verses that Aristotle composed on happiness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        69. Then [3], at “Later on we shall investigate,” he mentions the
        contemplative life, saying that it will be investigated later on in the
        tenth book (2086-2125).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        70. At “As to the accumulator of riches” [B’, i], he examines another
        opinion, less probable, which places happiness in a thing which has the
        nature of a useful good, money. But this is incompatible with the nature
        of an ultimate end, for a thing is called useful because it is ordered
        to an end. However, since money has an over-all utility in respect of
        temporal goods, the opinion that places happiness in money has some
        probability.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        71. But he rejects it for two reasons [B’, i, a]. The first is that
        money is acquired under coercion and is parted with under coercion. But
        this is not in keeping with happiness, which is the goal of voluntary
        operations. Consequently happiness does not consist in money.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        72. He gives the second reason [B’, 1, b] at “and riches themselves.” It
        is this. We look for happiness as a good that is not sought for
        something else. But money is sought for something beyond itself since it
        is by its nature a useful good, as was just said (70). Therefore
        happiness does not consist in money.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        73. A further conclusion notes that pleasure, honor, and virtue, all of
        which were treated above (57-72), can be considered ultimate ends at
        least in the sense that they are sought for themselves, as was said (57,
        61, 63, 70)However, the ultimate end is not to be found in these, as has
        been shown (57-72), although many arguments have been marshalled by
        various philosophers to prove that happiness consists in these goods.
        But these discussions must be terminated.

        Those who hold this opinion did not postulate ideas in which priority
        and posteriority were found. On this account they made no provision for
        an idea of numbers. Now good is found in the category of substance and
        quality and relation. But being in itself, i.e., substance, is naturally
        prior to being in reference to something else, for the latter is likened
        to an offspring of being and an accident of it. Therefore there will not
        be any common idea for these.

        Furthermore, good is convertible with being. For good is predicated of
        substance such as God and intellect. It is predicated of quality such as
        virtues, of quantity such as the mean, of relation such as the useful,
        of time such as the opportune, of place such as a summerhouse, and so
        on. Hence it is obvious that one common idea of good that is universal
        does not exist. Otherwise good would not be found in every category but

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        74. After the Philosopher has rejected the opinion of those who place
        happiness in one of the obvious goods, here [A] he disproves the opinion
        of those placing it in a separate good, In regard to this he does two
        things. First [1] he shows the necessity of discussing this opinion.
        Second [2] he begins to disprove it. in regard to the first he does
        three things. First [1, a] he suggests the advantage of this inquiry.
        Second [1, b], at “even if the investigation etc.,” he points out what
        may seem an unpleasant aspect of the investigation. Third [1, c], at
        “However, it seems etc.,” he shows that this should not deter us from
        seeking the truth. In regard to the first we must consider that the
        separated good, in which the Platonists asserted that man’s happiness
        consists, was called a universal good. By participation in it all things
        are said to be good. Hence he says that perhaps it is better to
        investigate thoroughly the existence of this universal good and to
        inquire what its nature is than to discuss the opinions mentioned
        before. The investigation of the good is more philosophical and more
        properly belongs to the discussion of the true good and the ultimate end
        than do the opinions considered in themselves. If, however, they be
        considered according to our stated intention of inquiring about the
        opinions mentioned above, it would seem to be more in agreement with our
        plan. On this account he uses “perhaps,” an adverb indicating doubt.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        75. Then [1, b], at “even if the investigation,” he states what might
        deter him from an investigation of this opinion. He says that the
        investigation is made reluctantly because the opinion was introduced by
        friends of his, the Platonists. He himself was a disciple of Plato, and
        by rejecting this opinion he might seem to disparage his teacher. He
        raises the point here rather than in his other works where he likewise
        rejects the opinion of Plato because the repudiation of the opinion of a
        friend is not contrary to truth, which is the principal object in
        speculative sciences. It is, however, contrary to good morals, the
        subject discussed in this book.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        76. Then [1, c], at “However, it seems indeed better,” he shows that
        this consideration ought not to deter him. The reason is that it seems
        to be better, meaning more honorable and in agreement with good morals,
        and indeed obligatory, that a man should not hesitate to oppose his
        friends for the sake of truth. It is so necessary for good morals that
        without it virtue cannot be preserved. Unless a man prefer truth to his
        friends, it follows that he will make false judgment and bear false
        witness in their defense. This is contrary to virtue. While reason
        prescribes that all men should prefer truth to their friends, this holds
        in a special way for the philosophers whose calling is to study wisdom,
        which is knowledge of the truth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        77. That truth should be preferred to friends he proves in this way. He
        is the greater friend for whom we ought to have the greater
        consideration. Although we should have friendship for both truth and our
        fellow man, we ought rather to love truth because we should love our
        fellow man especially on account of truth and virtue, as will be shown
        in the eighth book (1575-1577). Now truth is a most excellent friend of
        the sort to whom the homage of honor is due. Besides, truth is a divine
        thing, for it is found first and chiefly in God. He concludes,
        therefore, that it is virtuous to honor truth above friends.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        78. Andronicus, the peripatetic, says that piety makes men faithful to
        and observant of the things of God. Along the same line is the judgment
        of Plato who, in rejecting the opinion of his teacher Socrates, says a
        man ought to care more for truth than anything else. Somewhere else too
        he affirms that while Socrates is certainly his friend, truth is still
        more so. In yet another place he says that we should have some care for
        the views of Socrates but more for truth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        79. Then [2], at “Those who hold his opinion,” he rejects the position
        of Plato who maintains that the happiness of man consists in a common
        idea or form of good. In regard to this he does two things. First [2, a]
        he shows there is no one common idea or form of good. Second [Lect. 8;
        2, b], at “But perhaps we should etc.” (B. 1096 b 29), he shows that
        even if there were, human happiness would not consist in it. In regard
        to the first he does two things. First [2, a, i] he shows that there
        cannot be one common idea of good. Second [Lect. 7; 2, a, ii], at
        “Someone will rightly etc.” (B. 1096 a 34), he examines the manner of
        speaking used by the Platonists when they talk about this idea. In
        regard to the first we must consider that Aristotle does not intend to
        reject the opinion insofar as Plato maintained a separated good on which
        all good would depend. In the twelfth book of the Metaphysics (Ch. 10,
        1075 a 11 sq.; St. Th. Lect. 12, 2627-2663), Aristotle expressly
        mentions a good, separated from the universe, to which the whole
        universe is ordered as an army is ordered to the good of the general. He
        does reject the opinion insofar as Plato held that the separated good is
        an idea common to all goods. He uses three reasons to disprove the
        opinion.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        80. The first [i, x] of these is taken from the argument of the
        Platonists themselves who did not postulate an idea for these classes of
        things in which priority and posteriority arefound, as is the case with
        numbers, for two is naturally prior to three. So the Platonists did not
        hold that number in general would have a separated idea. They did,
        though, place separated ideas for individual numbers, for example, two,
        three and so on. The reason for this is that the things in which
        priority and posteriority are found do not seem to be of one order and
        consequently do not partake of one idea. But among good things there is
        priority and posteriority. This is clear from the fact that good is
        found in the <i>quod quid est</i> or substance, and likewise in quality
        and also in other genera. Now it is evident that what is being in
        itself, such as substance, is naturally prior to all those things that
        have being only in relation to substance—as quantity, which is the
        measure of substance; quality, which is the disposition of substance;
        and relation, which is the reference of substance. The same is true in
        other categories that are all, as it were, the offspring of being or
        substance. This is being in the full sense, and from it are engendered
        and derived all other genera, which are called being to the extent that
        they are accidents of a substance. From this he concludes that there
        cannot be a common idea of good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        81. He lays down the second reason [i, y] at “Furthermore, good etc.” To
        understand this we must know that Plato held the “idea” to be the
        “ratio” or nature and essence of all things that partake of the idea. It
        follows from this that there cannot be one idea of things not having a
        common nature. But the various categories do not have one common nature,
        for nothing is predicated of them univocally. Now good, like being with
        which it is convertible, is found in every category. Thus the
        <i>quod quid est</i> or substance, God, in whom there is no evil, is
        called good; the intellect, which is always true, is called good. In
        quality good is predicated of virtue, which makes its possessor good; in
        quantity, of the mean, which is the good in everything subject to
        measure. In relation, good is predicated of the useful which is good
        relative to a proper end. In time, it is predicated of the opportune;
        and in place, of a location suitable for walking as a summerhouse. The
        same may be said of other categories. It is clear, therefore, that there
        is not some one good that is the idea or the common “ratio” of all
        goods. Otherwise good would not be found in every category but in one
        alone.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        82. He gives the third reason at “Moreover, because etc.” [i, z]. To
        understand this we must know the following. Things existing outside the
        mind, according to Plato, acquire the form of genus or species by
        participating in the “idea” so that the mind does not know a stone
        except by participating in the “idea” of stone. The mind in this way
        partakes of science and knowledge of those things when the “forms” or
        “ideas” of them are impressed in it. It follows that there is a single
        science of all the things that partake of one “idea.” If, therefore,
        there be one “idea” of all goods, it will belong to the study of one
        science. But we see that this is false even in regard to the goods
        belonging to a single category. He adds this for fear that someone may
        specify sciences according to the diversity of categories. We see,
        however, that strategy studies the opportune in war, medicine studies it
        in disease, and gymnastics in exercise. It remains then that there is
        not one common “idea” of all goods.

        Someone will rightly ask what they mean in calling anything “absolute”
        if in both absolute man and this particular man there exists one and the

        Contrary to what they have asserted, some doubt arises because their
        words are not said of every good and yet they do so apply. Now things
        are said to be good according to one species of good which are sought
        and desired for their own sake, and things productive or in some way
        preservative of these or prohibitive of their contraries are said to be
        good according to an other species. It is obvious then that good is
        predicated in two ways, for some things are sought for their own sake

        If things in themselves are demonstrated as absolute good, then the same

        In what way then are they to be called good? Not as things purely
        equivocal. Are they at least to be compared as things referring to one

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        83.The Philosopher has shown above that there is no common idea of all
        goods. But because the separated good is called by the Platonists not
        only the “idea” or “form” of good but also absolute good, Aristotle here
        intends to inquire whether it is properly called by this name [(2, a)
        ii]. In regard to to this he does two things. First [ii, x] he shows
        that the separated good is not properly named absolute good. Second [ii,
        y], at “Contrary to what etc.,” he shows that to postulate a separated
        good as absolute is inconsistent with saying that it is the common idea
        or form of all goods. In regard to the first he does three things. First
        [x, aa] he shows that the separated good is not properly called absolute
        (<i>per se</i>) good. Second [x, bb], at “It may not be countered etc.,”
        he rules out a particular rejoinder. Third [x, cc], at “A more likely
        explanation etc.,” he compares this doctrine with the Pythagorean view.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        84. In regard to the first we must consider that the separated good,
        which is the cause of all goods, ought to be placed in a higher degree
        of goodness than the good things about us because the separated good is
        the ultimate end of all. But it seems that, according to this doctrine,
        it is not a higher degree in goodness than other goods. This is apparent
        because the Platonists called each of the separated things absolute or
        in itself, as man in himself and even horse in itself. Now it is clear
        that one and the same nature belongs to man who lives among us and to
        man in himself, that is, ideal man. He proves this by the fact that
        ideal man and man clothed with matter do not differ as man, but they do
        differ in certain other respects—for example, this particular man has
        matter. Thus the notions of animal and man do not differ in animality
        but rather in man’s rational principle that he has over and above
        animality. So too it seems that the ideal man does not differ from this
        particular man in the nature of man but because this particular man has
        matter in addition to being man. For the same reason the good that is
        called absolute will not have goodness different in nature from this
        particular good, although there can be a difference in other respects
        than the nature of good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        85. Then [x, bb], at “It may not,” he rules out a particular answer.
        Someone could say that the good in itself is better because eternal
        while the goods here are perishable. Indeed, a thing that lasts longer
        does seem better and more desirable. To exclude this he points out that
        the good in itself is eternal does not mean that it is better. The
        eternal differs from the non-eternal by reason of duration, and the
        difference of duration of a thing is outside the nature of the species,
        as life that lasts only a day and life more enduring are not different
        by reason of life but only by duration. So then if good be understood as
        one species, its duration will be outside the nature of good. The longer
        duration of a thing then does not make that thing any better.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        86. If we do not hold that there is one species or idea of good as the
        Platonists did, but that good, like being, is predicated in every genus,
        duration itself will be a good of time. It would, in that case, add
        something to goodness. Hence what is more lasting will be better. But
        this cannot be said if the good is one species in itself. It follows
        then that it is not better because eternal.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        87. Then [x, cc], at “A more likely explanation,” he compares this
        opinion with that of the Pythagoreans. We must consider that according
        to the Platonists the nature of the one and the good is the same, and so
        they identified one in itself and good in itself. Hence they were
        obliged to postulate one first good. The Pythagoreans did not do this’
        however, but they put one among the things contained in the list of the
        good under which they placed:

        likely explanation than the Platonists because the Pythagoreans were not
        compelled to hold one nature for the good. Even Speusippus, who was a
        son of Plato’s sister and his successor in the Academy, did not follow
        Plato but Pythagoras on this point. He adds that further discussion of
        the subject will be taken up in the Metaphysics. (Cf. Bk. I, Ch. 5, 986
        a 13-986 b 9; St. Th. Lect. 8, 124-133, Cf. Bk. XI, Ch. 9, 1066 a 13-17;

        89. Then [ii, y], at “Contrary to what,” he shows that the assertion
        that the separated good is an absolute good or a good in itself is
        inconsistent with their view that there is one idea or form of all
        goods. He does three things on this point. Firstly, [y, aa] he shows
        that an absolute good cannot be an idea common to all goods. Second [y,
        bb], at “Let us separate etc.,” he shows that there cannot be a common
        idea of all things called good in themselves. Third [y, cc], at “In what
        way etc.,” he handles a pertinent query. He says then in the first place
        that contrary to what the Platonists assert, there seems to be a subtle
        hesitation here. When they speak about the good in itself, it does not
        seem from the obvious meaning of their words that the discussion
        concerns every good, but as much can be gathered from the context

        as they are good in some way for the sake of others, which in their turn
        are really good, are called good for another reason. In a third way,
        some things are called good because they prevent the contrary evil. It
        is clear, therefore, that good is predicated in two ways. Primary goods
        are good in themselves. As we have already remarked (9-13, 58) they are
        sought for themselves. Both of the other things called good the
        productive or preservative of good and the restrictive of contrary evil
        are called good in reference to things good in themselves. It is obvious
        then that the “ratio’, of absolute good is not suited to all goods.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        gi. Then [y, bb], at “Let us separate,” he shows that the “ratio” of
        absolute good cannot belong to all goods in themselves. First [bb, a’]
        he declares his intention. We must consider that those things that are
        productive or preservative of goods in themselves, or restrictive of
        contraries, are called good because they are useful, and the nature of
        absolute good does not belong to the merely useful. Let us then separate
        from these useful things the things that are in themselves good and see
        whether they can be designated good according to one form, which is
        called absolute good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        92. Second [bb, b’], at “But what would you,” he investigates this last
        point by proposing a question: what kinds of things should be considered
        goods in themselves? He presents this question in two parts. In the
        first he asks whether we are to call absolute whatever goods are sought
        for themselves alone to the exclusion of all others, so that they are
        not ordered to any further use. Such would be, for example, sight, and
        certain kinds of pleasure and honors. These things are sometimes sought
        for the sake of something else to which they are useful, but even if
        they have no use beyond themselves they are good and desirable in
        themselves. The second part of the question asks whether there is any
        other absolute good besides the idea or form itself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        93. Third [bb, c’] at “Wherefore the idea,” he resolves the second part
        just mentioned. He concludes that if nothing else be a good in itself
        except the idea, then the idea will be a kind of exemplar whose likeness
        will be impressed on others. An exemplar is useless if it has no
        likeness to some thing else. Hence it follows that the idea is useless
        if there is no other good in itself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        94. Fourth [bb, d’], at “Things in themselves,” he resolves the first
        part in this way. If all the aforementioned things are good in
        themselves by partaking of the idea which is itself good, the same
        nature of goodness must appear in all of them, as we find the same
        nature of whiteness in snow and in white’ lead from the fact that they
        share in the one form. But this apparently is not true of the things
        mentioned above. Honor, prudence, and pleasure differ in their natures,
        that is, the nature of honor precisely as honor differs from the nature
        of prudence as prudence. Moreover, the nature of honor as a good differs
        from the nature of prudence as it is a good. There is not, then, one
        nature of goodness in all good things nor are they all desirable under
        the same aspect. Hence it remains that what is called absolute good is
        not something common as one idea or form common to all goods.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        95. Then [y, cc], at “In what way,” he handles a pertinent query. This
        inquiry belongs here since predication according to different reasons is
        made in the first of two ways according to meanings that are without any
        relation to any one thing. These are purely equivocal because it happens
        by chance that the same word has been used by one person for one thing,
        and then by someone else for an entirely different thing, as is plainly
        evident in the case of different men having the same name. In another
        way, one word is used of several things with meanings not entirely
        different but having some sort of common likeness. Sometimes they agree
        in referring to one principle, as a thing is called military because it
        is a soldier’s weapon (like a sword), or his clothing (like a uniform),
        or his transportation (like a horse). Sometimes they agree in referring
        to one end. Thus medicine is called healthy because it produces health,
        diet is called healthy because it preserves health, and urine in its
        turn is called healthy because it is a sign of health. Sometimes the
        agreement is according to a different proportion to the same subject, as
        quality is called being because it is a disposition of a being in
        itself, i.e., a substance, and quantity because it is a measure of
        substance, and so on. Or the agreement is according to one proportion to
        different subjects. For instance, sight has the same proportion to the
        body as intellect to the soul. Hence as sight is a power of a physical
        organ so also is the intellect a power of the soul without the
        participation of the body.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        96. In this fashion, therefore, he affirms that “good” is predicated of
        many things not with meanings entirely different, as happens with
        things,completely equivocal, but according to analogy or the same
        proportion, inasmuch as all goods depend on the first principle of
        goodness, that is, as they are ordered to one end. Aristotle indeed did
        not intend that the separated good be the idea and “ratio” of all goods
        but their principle and end. Likewise, all things are called good by an
        analogy or the same proportion just as sight is the good of the body and
        intellect is the good of the soul. He prefers this third way because it
        is understood according to goodness inherent in things. The first two
        ways, however, are ascribed to a separated goodness from which a thing
        is not so properly denominated.

        This reasoning certainly has some probability, although it does not seem
        to square with what we observed in the sciences. While sciences tend to
        some good and seek the necessary, they all neglect to use a knowledge of
        the separated good. But it is not reason able to suppose that all
        artists and scientists would be ignorant of and would fail to seek a

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        97. After the Philosopher has explained that there is no common idea of
        good, now [2, b] he shows that even if there were, it would not follow
        that happiness would have to be sought according to it. In regard to
        this he does three things. First [i] he presents a proof of his
        position. Second [ii], at “Perhaps some will think etc.,” he gives an
        apparent rejoinder. Third (iii], at “This reasoning certainly etc.,” he
        refutes it. He says first that the manner of predicating good according
        to one or different reasons must now be put aside because more accurate
        study of the matter properly belongs to another branch of philosophy,
        metaphysics. Likewise, the consideration of the idea of good is not
        pertinent to our purpose. As reason for these statements he maintains
        that if there were one good univocally predicated of all, or even if a
        separated good did exist in itself, it would obviously not be a thing
        produced or possessed by man. Now it is precisely such a thing we are
        seeking.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        98. We are looking for the happiness that is the end of human acts. The
        end, however, of man is either some thing he does or some external
        thing. This can be the end of man because either it is produced, as a
        house is the end of building or it is possessed as a thing that is used.
        Now it is clear that the common or separated good cannot be the
        operation itself of man, nor is it something produced by man. Moreover,
        it does not seem to be something possessed by man as he possesses things
        used in this life. Obviously, then, the common or separated good is not
        the good of man that is the object of our present search.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        99. Then [ii], at “Perhaps,” he gives an apparent rejoinder. Someone
        might say that the separated good, although not produced or possessed by
        man, nevertheless is the pattern of all the good produced and possessed.
        Now one who wishes to understand the copies ought to know the pattern.
        So it would seem that one should know the separated good itself for the
        sake of the goods produced and possessed. The reason is that, having the
        separated good as a guide, we will be better able to know and
        consequently better able to acquire the things that are good for us, as
        an artist looking at a model is better able to paint a likeness. too.
        Then [iii], at “This reasoning certainly,” he refutes this response by
        two reasons. The first [iii, x] he takes from ordinary observation.
        While the reason given seems probable, he says that it does not appear
        to be in agreement with what we observe in other sciences. All sciences
        and arts tend to some good, as we said above (8), and to attain the end
        aimed at, each uses what is necessary for itself. None of them, though,
        uses the knowledge of this separated good. This would not be reasonable
        if some advantage could be derived from it. Therefore, the knowledge of
        this separated good contributes nothing to the goods produced and
        possessed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        101. He offers a second reason [iii, y] at “Indeed the separated good
        would be useless.” This is taken from the very nature of the thing. He
        states that the good under consideration is altogether useless for the
        sciences and the arts, both in regard to their exercise, since a weaver
        or a carpenter is in no way aided in the practice of his art by a
        knowledge of that separated good, and in regard to the acquisition of a
        science or an art. No one becomes a better physician or a better soldier
        because he has studied the separated form of good. The reason he assigns
        is that an exemplar, at which it is necessary to gaze, must be in
        conformity with the work produced. Art, however, does not produce some
        good in common or an abstract good but a good that is concrete and
        individual. A physician does not intend health in the abstract but in
        the concrete, the health of this particular man. He does not give
        medicine to mankind in general but to this individual man. We must
        conclude then that the knowledge of a universal and separated good is
        not needed either for the acquisition or for the exercise of the
        sciences.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        102. On this note he concludes his discussion of the opinions offered
        about happiness.

        Let us return again to a consideration of the good we are seeking in
        order to find out what it is. It seems that the good differs in
        different operations and arts. In medicine it is one good, in war it is
        another, and in other arts, still other goods. As the thing sought in
        every activity, the good is the end for the sake of which other things
        are done. This will be health in medicine, victory in war, a building in
        architecture, something else in some other art. In every activity and
        choice there is an end, the agent doing everything he does for the sake
        of that end. Therefore, if there is an end for all that we do, this will
        be the good intended. If there are many ends, there will be many goods,
        and in this case our discussion- will go beyond the many until it
        arrives at that supreme good.

        We must make a considerable effort to give this a fuller explanation.
        Apparently there are many ends, some of which we choose for the sake of
        something else like riches, flutes, and in general all instruments. It
        is obvious then that not all ends are perfect. But the ultimate end
        appears to be perfect. Wherefore, if there be only one of this kind, it
        will be what we are looking for. If there are a number of goods, then it
        is the most perfect of these. Now we call that object which is desired
        for its own sake more perfect than one that is desired for some further
        purpose. That which is never desired for any further utility is more
        perfect than the things desirable in themselves and for the sake of this
        further purpose. In the event that the object is perfect without
        qualification it will always be desirable for itself and never for
        anything beyond itself. Happiness in fact seems especially to be of this
        nature, for we choose it in every case for itself and never for
        something else. Honor and pleasure and knowledge and every virtue we do
        indeed choose for themselves, for we would choose every one of them even
        if no advantage accrued to us. But we choose them also on account of
        happiness because we hope to become happy. On the other hand, no one
        chooses happiness for the sake of these goods or for any other good
        whatsoever.

        The same seems to follow from the viewpoint of self-sufficiency, for the
        perfect good apparently is self-sufficient. We call it self-sufficient
        not only as adequate for a man living a solitary life by himself but
        also for his parents, children, wife, friends in general, and fellow
        citizens because this good naturally will include man’s social life. But
        some limitation must be placed on the number provided for, since the
        extension to relatives, neighbors and friends might go on without limit.
        We must return to examine this question later. Now we call that
        self-sufficient which, taken alone, makes life desirable and lacking
        nothing. In our opinion happiness is of this nature.

        Moreover, happiness without further addition will be the most desirable
        of all things. With any addition it will certainly be more desirable
        even though the addition be ever so slight. The reason is that the
        addition has increased the good, and a greater good is always more
        desirable. Therefore, happiness as the end of all human actions is the
        perfect self-sufficient good.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        103. After the Philosopher has thoroughly discussed the opinions of
        others about happiness, he now gives his own opinion on the subject. He
        divides this treatment into two parts. In the first [1] he shows what
        happiness is. In the second [Lect. 18; II], at “Having settled these
        matters etc.” (B. 1101b 10), he treats a particular property of
        happiness. He makes a twofold division of the first part. In the first
        division [A] he shows what happiness is. In the second [Lect. 15], at
        “Many changes take place etc.” (B.1100 a 5), he solves a particular
        problem. In regard to the first he does two things. First [A’] he shows
        what happiness is. Second [Lect. 12], at “In our study of the principles
        etc.” (B.1098 b 8), he shows that everything said about happiness is in
        agreement with this doctrine. In regard to the first he does two things.
        First [1] he proposes some general notions and conditions of happiness
        that are obvious to nearly everyone. Second [Lect. 10; 2], at “But to
        say that happiness etc.” (B.1097 b 22), he inquires into the nature of
        happiness. In regard to the first he does two things. First [a] he
        states that happiness is the ultimate end. Second [b], at “We must make
        etc.,” he lays down the conditions belonging to the ultimate end.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        104. Therefore, he says first that, after completing the treatise
        (43-102) on the opinions of others, we must again return to a
        consideration of the good that is the subject of our
        inquiry—happiness—to find out what it is. Our first consideration about
        it must be that in different activities and arts the good sought
        differs. In the medical art the good sought is health, and in the
        military art victory, and in other arts some other good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        105. If it be asked what good is sought in every art and in every
        activity, we must know that it is the object for the sake of which all
        other things are done. In medicine everything is done on account of
        health, in war everything is done on account of victory, and in
        architecture everything is done for the sake of the building to be
        constructed. Likewise, in every other activity the good sought is some
        one thing for the sake of which all other things are done. This good,
        the object of every activity or choice, is called the end, for the end
        is nothing else than that for the sake of which other things are done.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        106. If, therefore, there should be some end immediately apparent to
        which all the products of all arts and human activities are directed,
        such an end will be the good unqualifiedly sought, that is, the thing
        intended in all human operations. But if at this point many goods arise
        to which the different ends of different arts are ordered, our reason
        will have to inquire beyond this number until it arrives at this one
        thing, that is, some obvious good. There must be, indeed, one ultimate
        end for man precisely as man because of the unity of human nature, just
        as there is one end for a physician as physician because of the unity of
        the art of medicine. This ultimate end of man is called that human good
        which is happiness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        107. Then [b], at “We must make,” he lays down two conditions of the
        ultimate end. The first [b, i] is that it be a perfect thing; the second
        [b, ii], that it be self-sufficient, at “The same seems to follow etc.”
        The ultimate end is the ultimate term of desire’s natural inclination.
        But in order that something be the ultimate term of natural inclination,
        two things are required. First that it be a thing actually having a
        species and not on the way to have a species. The generation of fire,
        for instance, is not terminated at the disposition to the form but at
        the form itself. Now a thing that has form is perfect, but a thing that
        is merely disposed to a form is imperfect. Therefore, the good that is
        the ultimate end must be a perfect good. Second, the term of the natural
        inclination must be integral since nature is not deficient in necessary
        things. Hence the end of human generation is not a deformed man but a
        perfect man. Likewise the ultimate end that is the term of desire must
        be self-sufficient as an integral good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        108. In regard to the perfection of a final good we must consider that,
        as an agent moves towards the end, so the end moves the desire of the
        agent. Hence the gradations of the ends must be in proportion to the
        gradations of the agent. Now an agent may be of three kinds. One, the
        most imperfect, does not operate by its own form but only insofar as
        moved by another, as a hammer forges a blade. Hence, the effect in the
        acquired form is not like this agent but like the one who moves the
        agent. Another, a perfect agent, operates indeed according to its form
        so that the effect is like it, as fire gives off heat, but nevertheless
        it must be moved by some prior principal agent. In this respect it
        partakes imperfectly of the nature of an instrument. A third agent, the
        most perfect, operates according to its own form and is not moved by any
        other.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        109. The same is true in the order of ends. There we find an object
        desired not on account of some formal goodness existing in itself but
        only as useful for something else like bitter medicine. We find also an
        object is indeed desirable on account of what it is, but besides, it is
        desired for something else like sweet-tasting medicine. This is better
        than the first. But the most perfect good is that which is so desired
        for its own sake that it is never desired for the sake of anything else.
        Here then the Philosopher distinguishes three degrees of good. He says,
        as we have just stated (107-109), that we must give a more complete
        explanation of the ultimate end by examining the conditions required for
        it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        110. There are also, it seems, many degrees of ends. Some of these we
        choose purely for the sake of something else, riches, for instance,
        which are sought for their utility in human living. Flutes on which
        music is made is another example. All such instruments are ends sought
        merely because of their usefulness. It is obvious that such ends are
        imperfect. The best end, namely the ultimate end, must be perfect.
        Therefore, if there is only one such end, it must be the ultimate end we
        are looking for. If, however, there are many perfect ends, the most
        perfect of these should be the best and the ultimate. What is desirable
        in itself is more perfect than what is desirable because of another. It
        clearly follows then that what is never desired for some thing beyond
        itself is more perfect than the things which, although sought for
        themselves, are also sought as a means.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        111. Therefore, that is absolutely perfect which is always desirable for
        itself and never for another. But happiness appears to be of this
        nature, for we never seek it for something else but always for itself.
        We do choose honor, pleasure, knowledge, and virtue for themselves. We
        would choose them or have a desire for them even if no other good would
        come to us through them. In fact we choose them for happiness precisely
        because we think we will be happy in having them. But no one chooses
        happiness for them or for anything else. We conclude then that happiness
        is the most perfect good, and consequently the ultimate and best end.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        112. Then [b, ii], at “The same seems,” he treats the self-sufficiency
        of happiness-first [ii, x] in regard to that which pertains to the
        nature of sufficiency, and second [ii, y], at “Moreover, happiness
        etc.,” as regards the prefix “self.” He says first that the same
        conclusion seems to follow from self-sufficiency as well as from
        perfection: happiness is the best and the ultimate end. Indeed, the
        latter two follow one another, for the perfect good seems to be
        self-sufficient. If it is not sufficient in some particular, it does not
        perfectly satisfy desire, and so it will not be the perfect good. It is
        called a self-sufficient good not because it suffices merely for one man
        living a solitary life but also for his parents, children, wife,
        friends, and fellow citizens as well, so that it will adequately provide
        the necessaries in temporal matters, instruction and counsel in
        spiritual matters for them too. Such extension is required because man
        is a social animal, and his desire is not satisfied in providing for
        himself but he wants to be in a position to take care of others. This,
        however, must be understood within limits.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        113. If someone should want to extend such care not only to his own
        relatives and friends but even to the friends of his friends this would
        go on indefinitely so that no one could have a sufficiency and therefore
        no one could be happy, if happiness would require such infinite
        sufficiency. In this work the Philosopher speaks of happiness as it is
        attainable in this life, for happiness in a future life is entirely
        beyond the investigation of reason. To what extent a man needs a
        sufficiency to be happy will have to be investigated again elsewhere,
        namely, in domestic ethics or in political science.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        114. Because he has already shown (112-113) that the perfect good called
        happiness ought to be sufficient not for one man alone but for all whose
        care is incumbent upon him, next he explains the nature of what is
        called self-sufficient. He says that the self-sufficient is that which,
        even when had by itself, makes life desirable and free from want.
        Happiness does this eminently, otherwise it would not terminate the
        inclination of desire if something that man needed remained outside it.
        Certainly everyone in need desires to have what he lacks. Hence it is
        clear that happiness is a self-sufficient good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        115. Then [ii, y], at “Moreover,” he explains the nature of
        self-sufficiency as regards the expression “self.” A thing is said to be
        self-sufficient when, taken apart from other things, it is sufficient.
        This can happen in two ways. First in such a manner that the perfect
        good, which is called self-sufficient, would be incapable of receiving
        an increase of goodness from another-a condition of the being that is
        totally good, God. As an additional part is not greater than the whole
        since the part itself is included in the whole, so too any good
        whatsoever added to God does not increase His goodness because the
        addition is good only by participating in the divine goodness. Likewise,
        a thing taken alone, no addition being made, is said to be sufficient in
        that it has everything a man absolutely needs.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        116. In this sense happiness, the subject of our present discussion, has
        self-sufficiency because of itself it furnishes everything that is
        absolutely necessary, but it does not supply everything that can come to
        a man. Man can be made better by an additional good. But a man’s desire
        for this does not remain unsatisfied because a desire controlled by
        reason, such as a truly happy man should have, is undisturbed by the
        things that are unnecessary even though attainable. Happiness,
        therefore, has this quality above everything else; it is desirable even
        when not augmented by other goods. However, if it does receive an
        addition, be it ever so small, surely that is even more desirable. The
        reason is that by the accession, a superabundance or an increase of good
        is effected, and because something is a greater good, it is more
        desirable.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        117. Last, he repeats in the epilogue the conclusion of what has been
        established (104-116), namely, that since happiness is the ultimate end
        of all our activities, it is the perfect good and self-sufficient.

        What therefore will it be? Life belongs even to plants and we are in
        search of something characteristic of man. The life of nutrition and
        growth must then be ruled out. Even the life of sense experience, which
        is a step higher, is shared with the horse, cow, and other animals. The
        remaining type of life belongs to the rational part of man and finds its
        expression in. actions. This rational part either follows the dictates
        of reason, or it possesses and exercises the power of understanding. Of
        the two functions, the latter seems the more correct, for when we speak
        of reasoning, we signify the exercise of our rational powers.

        The function of man, therefore, is activity of the soul according to
        reason or at least not independent of reason. Now as a rule we classify
        in the same way the function of an artist and of a skillful artist, of a
        flute player and of a good flute player. This applies generally where
        skill is an addition to the function, for a flute player is one who
        plays the flute and a good flute player one who plays the flute well. If
        then we place the function of man in a certain kind of life, that is, of
        an activity of the soul according to reason, it will be proper to a good
        man to act well and to the best of his ability according to reason. In
        every case the good of man will consist in action conformable to virtue,
        and if there are a number of virtues, action conformable to the best and
        most perfect of them.

        Further, it must extend to a complete life. A single swallow or one good
        day does not mean that spring has come. So one day (of goodness) or a

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        118. After the Philosopher has laid down certain conditions of
        happiness, he here [2] examines its definition. Concerning this he does
        three things. First [2, a] he shows the necessity of this inquiry.
        Second [2, b], at “Perhaps this can be done etc.,” he searches for the
        definition of happiness. Third [Lect. 11], at “In this way, therefore
        etc.” (B. 1098 a 20), he shows that the definition given is insufficient
        and further inquiry must be made. He says first that all admit that
        happiness is the very best of things including the belief that it is the
        ultimate end and the perfect self-sufficient good. But it is rather
        obvious that some clarification must be made about happiness to give us
        a knowledge of its specific nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        119. Then [2, b], at “Perhaps this,” he investigates the definition of
        happiness in a twofold manner. First [b, i] he inquires into its genus,
        and second [b, ii], at “The function of man,” into its differences. The
        first point requires a threefold procedure. First [i, x] he shows that
        happiness consists in an activity of man. Second [i, y], at “Have a
        weaver etc.,” he shows that there is an activity proper to man. Third
        [i, z], at “What therefore etc.,” he shows which is man’s proper
        activity. He says first that the nature of happiness can be made evident
        by consideration of human activity. When a thing has a proper operation,
        the good of the thing and its well-being consist in that operation. Thus
        the good of a flute player consists in his playing, and similarly the
        good of the sculptor and of every artist in their respective activity.
        The reason is that the final good of everything is its ultimate
        perfection, and the form is its first perfection while its operation is
        the second. If some exterior thing be called an end, this will be only
        because of an operation by which a man comes in contact with that thing,
        either by making it as a builder makes a house, or by using or enjoying
        it. Accordingly, the final good of everything must be found in its
        operation. If then man has some characteristic activity, his final good
        which is happiness must consist in this. Consequently, happiness is the
        proper operation of man.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        120. But if happiness is said to consist in something else, either this
        will be a thing fitting man for an operation of this kind, or it will be
        something he attains by his operation, as God is said to be the
        beatitude of man.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        121. Then [i, y], at “Have a weaver,” he proves in two ways that there
        is an operation proper to man. He does this first [y, aa] by activities
        that are incidental to man. It may happen that a man is a weaver,
        tanner, grammarian, musician, or anything else of the kind. In none of
        these capacities does he lack a proper operation, for otherwise he would
        possess them as empty and useless things. Now it is far more unfitting
        that a thing ordained by divine reason, as is the naturally existent,
        should be unprofitable and useless than a thing arranged by human
        reason. Since, therefore, man is a being possessing a natural existence,
        it is impossible that he should be by nature without a purpose, or a
        proper operation. There is then a proper operation of man no less than
        of the abilities that are incidental to him. The reason is that
        everything, either natural or acquired by art, exists by means of its
        form which is a principle of some operation. Hence as each thing has a
        proper existence by its form so also does it have a proper operation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        122. Second [y, bb], at “If the eye,” he proves the same truth by means
        of the human members. We must consider that the same mode of operation
        is found in the whole and in the parts of man, because, as the soul is
        the act of the whole body, so certain powers of the soul are acts of
        certain parts of the body, as sight is of the eye. But each part of man
        has a proper operation; for example, the operation of the eye is seeing;
        and of the hand, touching; and of the feet, walking; and so of the other
        parts. We conclude, therefore, that some operation proper to man as a
        whole exists.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        123. Then [i, z], at “What therefore, he explores the nature of the
        operation proper to man. Now it is evident that each thing has an
        operation which belongs to it according to its form. But the form of man
        is his soul, whose act is life, not indeed life as the mere existence of
        a living thing, but a special vital operation, for example,
        understanding or feeling. Hence happiness obviously consists in some
        vital operation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        124. It cannot be said that man’s happiness should arise from any kind
        of life, for even plants have life. But happiness is sought as a good
        characteristic of man since it is called a human good. Likewise,
        happiness must be different from the life of nutrition or growth, which
        even vegetables posses. From this we take it that happiness does not
        consist in health, beauty, strength, or great stature, for all these
        things result from activities of vegetative life.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        125. On the step above the life of mere nutrition and growth is the life
        of sense experience. Again, this is not proper to man but is possessed
        by horses, oxen, and other animals. In this kind of life, then,
        happiness does not consist. So we. conclude that human happiness is not
        found in any form of sense perception or pleasure.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        126. Beyond the life of assimilation and of sense experience there
        remains only the life that functions according to reason. This life is
        proper to man, for he receives his specific classification from the fact
        that he is rational. Now the rational has two parts. One is rational by
        participation insofar as it is obedient to and is regulated by reason.
        The other is rational by nature as it can of itself reason and
        understand. The rational by nature is more properly called rational
        because a thing possessed intrinsically is always more proper than a
        thing received from another. Since, therefore, happiness is the most
        proper good of man, it more likely consists in the rational by nature
        than in the rational by participation. From this we can see that
        happiness will more properly be found in the life of thought than in a
        life of activity, and in an act of reason or intellect than in an act of
        the appetitive power controlled by reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        127. Then [b, ii], at “The function of man,” he inquires into the
        specific differences of happiness. He divides the inquiry into two parts
        [ii, x] according to the two specific differences investigated, and he
        begins the second part [ii, y] at “Further, it must extend etc.” First
        then we know from the premises (126) that the proper function of a man
        is a psychic activity in accord with reason itself or at least not
        independent of reason. The latter is mentioned because of the activity
        of the appetite controlled by reason. Now as a rule we find that the
        function of a thing generally and the efficient activity of that thing
        are of the same nature, except that allowance must be made for the part
        played by skill. For example, the function of a harpist is to play the
        harp, and the function of a good harpist is to play the harp well. The
        same is true of all other functions.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        128. If, therefore, man’s proper role consists in living a certain kind
        of life, namely, according to the activity of reason, it follows that it
        is proper to a good man to act well according to reason, and to the very
        good man or the happy man to do this in superlative fashion. But this
        belongs to the nature of virtue that everyone who has virtue should act
        well according to it, as a horse with good training or “virtue” should
        run well. If, then, the activity of the very good man or the happy man
        is to act well, in fact to act to the best of his ability according to
        reason, it follows that the good of man, which is happiness, is an
        activity according to virtue. If there is only one virtue for man, his
        activity according to that virtue will be happiness. If there are a
        number of such virtues for man, happiness will be te activity according
        to the best of them. The reason is that happiness is not only the good
        of man but the best good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        129. Then [ii, y], at “Further, it must extend,” he inquires into the
        other specific difference of happiness. Continuity and perpetuity, to
        some extent, are also required for happiness. These qualities are
        naturally desired by the appetite of a person endowed with reason, who
        apprehends not a particular being, as our senses do, but also being in
        itself. Now being is of itself desirable. It follows then that, as an
        animal which apprehends a particular being by its senses desires that
        particular being, so also man apprehending being in itself desires it as
        always existing and not this particular being alone. So continuity and
        perpetuity, which are not found in the present life, belong to the
        nature of perfect happiness. Hence perfect happiness cannot be had in
        this life. However,the happiness attainable here must extend to a
        complete life, that is through the whole life of man. As the sight of a
        single swallow or one clear day does not prove that spring is here, so a
        single good deed is not enough to make a man happy. It arises rather
        form the continued performance of good deeds throughout his whole life.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        130. From this discussion, therefore, it is clear that happiness is a
        virtue-oriented activity proper to man in a complete life.

        Likewise, we must not seek causes equally in all matters but in some it
        suffices to establish a fact. This is the case with the first principles
        of a science since a principle is a starting point. Now, we understand
        some principles by induction, some by observation, some by custom and
        others in other ways.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        131.After the Philosopher has investigated the definition of happiness
        itself, he now [3] shows in a twofold fashion what may still remain to
        be done. He indicates first [3, a] what remains to be done, and second
        [3, b], at “We must recall etc.,” how this should be done. In regard to
        the initial point he does three things. First [a, i] he manifests what
        has been done and what remains to be done. He says that the final good
        of man which is happiness has been previously sketched (103-130). By a
        sketch he understands that knowledge through some common principles
        which indeed give a picture of the matter but not in such a way that the
        nature of that thing in particular is manifested. The reason for this
        is, as he himself says, that a thing should first be studied according
        to its general characteristics, i.e., by a general description which is
        like it and in a way extrinsic to it. Then with other matters clarified,
        we must take up what was previously sketched roughly and etch in the
        lines more sharply. For this reason he himself will take up in greater
        detail the treatise on happiness toward the end of this work (Bk. X, Ch.
        6-8, 1176 a 30-1179 a 33; St. Th. Lect. 9-13, 2065-2136).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        132. Second [a, ii], at “It would indeed seem,” he assigns the reason
        for the statement just made (131) saying that it seems natural for man
        to advance from the imperfect knowledge which covers a good description
        things to a perfect knowledge of them by filling in the details. This he
        does by investigating first one part and then another, for it is
        according to man’s nature to proceed by the steps of reason to a
        knowledge of the truth. Reason has this peculiar characteristic that it
        grasps the truth gradually, and as a consequence man properly perfects
        himself in knowledge little by little. On the contrary, separated or
        intellectual substances attain at once to the knowledge of the truth
        without any such investigation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        133. Third [a, iii], at “In this matter time,” he shows how a man may be
        helped in this procedure. He says that time seems to be, as it were, a
        discoverer of things well suited to sketch a subject and to be of
        special assistance in the work. The meaning is not that time itself
        contributes anything but that this help comes with time. If someone
        should busy himself investigating the truth for a period, he will be
        aided in the discovery of the truth by the passage of time. This is true
        in the case of the same person who will understand subsequently what he
        had not understood before, and also for different persons~ as in the
        case of a man who learns the things discovered by his predecessors and
        adds something himself. In this way improvements have been made in the
        arts, in which a small discovery was made first and afterwards notable
        advances were made by the efforts of various men, each looking upon it
        as a duty to supply what is lacking in the knowledge of his
        predecessors.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        134. But if, on the contrary, application to study be neglected, time is
        rather a cause of forgetfulness, as is said in the fourth book of the
        Physics (Ch. 12, 221 a 32; St. Th. Lect. 20, 604). We see indeed that
        the negligent individual forgets what he knows, and in human history we
        observe that many sciences which flourished among the ancients gradually
        have been lost when interest in them ceased.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        135. Then [3, b], at “We must recall,” he shows how we must follow up
        the remainder of our task. First [b, i] he presents this in general by
        recalling to mind what was said in the introduction (32, 36), that we
        must not look for the same certitude in all subjects but in each
        according to the matter, namely, that which is proper to the subject
        taught.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        136. Second [b, ii], at “For a carpenter,” he makes specific what he has
        said. First [ii, x] he takes up what must be handled differently for
        different subjects, and second [ii, y], at “In all cases we must etc.,”
        what must be observed generally in all subjects. In regard to the first
        he gives a threefold difference. The first of these [x, aa] is the
        difference between a practical and a speculative science. He says
        therefore that a carpenter, who is a practical man, and a geometrician,
        who is a theorist, study a straight line for different reasons. A
        practical—man—a carpenter studies a line insofar as it is useful for his
        work, in sawing wood or in doing anything else of this nature. But the
        geometrician investigates what a line is—its qualities and its nature by
        considering the properties and potentialities. He is interested only in
        the study of truth. We must proceed in the first way to avoid many
        discussions that are out of place in practical sciences. Fore instance,
        in moral matters we must steer clear of an exhaustive treatment of the
        intellect and the other powers of the soul to the neglect of the study
        of human acts themselves. It is a serious defect in any science to
        squander time on matter outside the science.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        l17. He treats a second difference at “Likewise, we must not” [x, bb].
        Here he considers the difference between principles and deductions made
        from them. He says that the cause is not to be sought equally in all
        matters, otherwise we would proceed to infinity in demonstrating. But in
        some cases it is sufficient to show clearly that a thing is so. This is
        true of principles that are taken for granted in a science, since they
        are the beginning and cannot be reduced to anything previous. Now
        principles themselves are not manifested in the same way. But some are
        understood by induction form particular examples, for instance, that
        every number is even or odd. Some are taken from observation, as in
        nature, that every living thing needs nourishment. Some are taken from
        custom, as in morals, that sensual desires are diminished if we do not
        give into them. Still other principles are manifested in still other
        ways, as in the practical arts principles are learned by a sort of
        experience.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        138. Then [ii, y], at “In all cases we must,” he sets down the procedure
        to be followed generally in all such matters. He says. that a person out
        to persist in going over thoroughly each set of principles, both
        speculatively and practically, in the way a knowledge of their nature
        demands and in studying how men understand them. Thus a man will learn
        how to distinguish one principle from an other, and one set of
        principles from another set. A knowledge of principles is a great help
        in understanding the conclusions that flow form them. Indeed a single
        principle seems to be more than half of the whole, since the content of
        a science is contained in the principles. He adds that many answers we
        look for in a science are clear from one principle well understood and
        completely thought out.

        Goods have been classified as (a) external, (b) of the soul, and (c) of

        But besides, it makes a great difference whether the chief good be
        placed in possession or use, in habit or activity because a habit may
        exist in a person not actually performing any good, for instance, in one

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        139. After the Philosopher has shown in general what happiness is, he
        proposes here [I] to confirm the view he has just given, by what is said
        by others on happiness. Concerning this he does two things. First [I, A]
        he indicates his intention. Then [I, B ], at “Goods have been etc.,” he
        begins to carry it out. He says first that it is most important to have
        a principle thoroughly understood. The principle in practical matters is
        the ultimate end. To insure a more careful study of it, we must examine
        not only the conclusions and the premises from which the discussion of
        the reasoner proceeds, but also the observations of others concerning
        the principle itself, namely, the ultimate end or happiness. He then
        assigns the reason for this procedure, that everything harmonizes with
        the truth. This is so because, as will be said in the sixth book (1143),
        truth is the good of the intellect. Good, as explained later (320), is
        achieved only in the concurrence of all the factors pertaining to the
        perfection of the thing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        140. Evil, on the contrary, comes about in a variety of ways by the
        defect of any single necessary qualification. No evil, however, can be
        found in which the good is completely corrupted, as will be shown in the
        fourth book (8o8). So not only all good things are in agreement with the
        good but even evil things in that they retain something of good. In a
        similar way all false things are in agreement with the truth insofar as
        they retain some likeness of truth. It is not possible that the mind
        holding a false opinion is completely deprived of the knowledge of the
        truth, because by means of the true it immediately judges something
        false as lacking in the truth. This is what he understands by saying
        that the true is at variance with the false, somewhat like a right angle
        with an oblique angle.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        141. Then [I, B], at “Goods have been classified,” he begins to carry
        out his intention, first in respect to what he has affirmed about
        happiness. In regard to this he does two things. First [B, A’] he shows
        that what is the consensus of others is in agreement with his view
        (touching on the things said above by him at “... our opinion is in
        agreement”). Second [B, B’], at “Everything that philosophers etc.,” he
        shows that the points on which others disagree substantiate his view. In
        regard to the initial point he does two things. First [A’, 1] he shows
        that what is commonly said by philosophers is in harmony with the given
        description of happiness. Second [A’, 2], at “This coincides with etc.,”
        he shows that the same is true from what is generally affirmed by
        everyone. He proves the first observation in two ways, and
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        142. initially [A, 1, a] by dividing human goods into three classes. Of
        these some (a) are external, as riches, honors, friends, and such like.
        (b) Others concern the soul, as knowledge, virtue, and the like. These
        are the chief goods, for external things are for the sake of the body,
        and the body for the sake of the soul, as matter for form and as an
        instrument for a principal agent. Now the common view of all
        philosophers is that the goods of the soul are the most important.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        143. The Stoics and the Peripatetics held divergent views about some
        goods. The Stoics were of the opinion that some goods are not human
        goods because they do not make man better. The Peripatetics, that is,
        the followers of Aristotle, asserted indeed that external goods are the
        least of goods—the goods of the body being, as it were, means—but the
        chief goods in their judgment were the goods of the soul, by which man
        is made good. Other goods, however, according to them are called good
        insofar as they serve as means toward the principal goods. Thus
        happiness, since it is the chief good, must be numbered among the goods
        of the soul. Hence it is evident that the placing of happiness in an
        operation of the rational soul, as we said above (110-126), is in
        agreement with this ancient opinion common to all philosophers, that the
        most important goods are those belonging to the soul.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        144. Second [A’, 1, b], at “It was stated accurately,” he proves the
        same thing in a different way. The soul he says, has two kinds of
        operations. Some of these pass into external matter, as weaving and
        building. Operations of this sort are not ends but things done for ends,
        that is, woven cloth and a completed house. Other operations of the
        soul, however,remain in the agent himself, as understanding and willing.
        Operations of this kind are ends. It was correctly stated (119-120),
        when we said that happiness is an operation and not a product, that acts
        and operations themselves are ends. Thus happiness is classified as one
        of the goods belonging to the soul and not an external good. Now in an
        immanent action the operation itself is a perfection and a good of the
        agent, but in a transient action the perfection and the good is found in
        the external effect. Hence not only is the aforesaid view in agreement
        with the position of the philosophers who hold that goods of the soul
        are the chief goods—and we said happiness was concerned with the
        operation of the soul—but also in this, that we place happiness in the
        operation itself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        145. Then (A’, 2], at “This coincides,” he shows that the things
        generally agreed on about happiness fit in with our view, for it was
        said above (45, 128) that everyone identifies living a good life and
        doing well with being happy. What we said is in agreement with this
        notion or understanding of happiness because a good life appears to be
        good activity and happiness seems to be of this nature. Those things
        truly are said to live which of themselves are moved to activity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        146. Then [B, B’], at “Everything that philosophers,” he shows that even
        the things in which others differ are in agreement with the aforesaid
        view. On this point he does three things. First [B’, 1] he brings
        forward the points on which men differ about happiness. Second [B’, 2],
        at “Our definition of happiness etc.,” he shows that each of these is in
        agreement with the above view. Finally [Lect. 14; 3], at “Next we
        investigate etc.” (B. 1099 b 9), he asks and answers a certain question
        concerning the premises. In regard to the first he does three things.
        First [B’, 1, a] he states what he wishes to show, that everything that
        was looked for in happiness by various philosophers in various ways
        seems “to be found in our notion,” that is, to be preserved in his view.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        147. Second [B’, 1, b], at “Some have taught” he gives different views
        on happiness. (1) The first. [b,. i] of these is that happiness consists
        in virtue. This has three variations. Some taught that (a) any virtue,
        especially moral virtue which perfects the appetite under the control of
        the reason constitutes happiness. To others it seemed that (b) happiness
        consists in prudence which which perfects the practical reason. Still
        others think that (c) happiness is found in wisdom which is the ultimate
        perfection of the speculative reason.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        148. The second opinion [b, ii] holds that all or any of these may
        constitute happiness provide that pleasure be added. This is understood
        in two senses. Some maintained that (a) virtue and pleasure almost in
        equal measure constitute happiness. Others (b), while placing happiness
        in virtue primarily, assign a secondary role to pleasure.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        149. (3) A third opinion [b, iii] adds to these elements of happiness a
        full measure of external goods, like riches and other material goods.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        150. Third [B’, 1, c], at “The rank and file,” he indicates the
        difference in the persons holding the foregoing views. He says that the
        majority, that is, the common people and some men of antiquity who were
        not well grounded in such matters, held some of these opinions such as
        pleasure and riches being necessary for happiness. But others, the
        minority but distinguished and famous men, held that happiness consisted
        rather ingoods of the soul. It is likely that none of these was entirely
        wrong but that each of them was right on some points.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        151. Then [B’, 2], at “Our definition of happiness,” he shows that these
        views are in agreement with what he previously assigned to happiness.
        First [2, a] he shows that this is true of the first opinion which held
        that virtue is happiness. Second [Lect. 13; 2, b], at “The life of those
        etc.” (B. 1099 a 9), he shows that it is true of the second opinion
        which adds pleasure. Finally [Lect. 13; c, i], at “It seems, however
        etc.” (B. 1099 a 32), that it is true of the third opinion which adds
        external goods. In regard to the first assertion he does two things.
        First [2, a, i] he shows that the first opinion given is in agreement
        with his. Second [2, a, ii], he shows how his opinion is better. He
        affirms, therefore, that the definition of happiness given above (130)
        as an activity according to virtue is acceptable to those who held that
        all virtue or one virtue constitutes happiness. It is evident that
        virtuous activity is something belonging to virtue.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        152. Then [a, ii], at “But besides, it makes a great difference” he
        shows that his own view is better: first [ii, x] from reason; second
        [ii, y], from a custom among men by the words “At the Olympic games.” He
        says first that it makes a great deal of difference in external goods
        whether the most important good is in the possession of a thing or in
        its use—which is obviously better than possession. It is the same, too,
        with a habit of virtue and its operation or in its use—which is
        obviously better than possession. It is the same, too with a habit of
        virtue and its operation or use which is of greater value than the
        habit. A habit can exist in a person who is not actually doing any good
        act, as in one who is asleep or not engaged in any way whatsoever. But
        this is not possible with an operation. It necessarily follows that that
        man should operate in whom there is an operation, and that he should
        produce a good effect if there be in him a virtuous operation.
        Consequently, a virtuous operation is more perfect than virtue itself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        153. Then [ii, y] when he says “At the Olympic games,” he proves the
        same thing by a custom among men. Concerning this we must know that in
        Macedonia there is a very high mountain called Olympus where certain
        competitive sports, called Olympic games were held. In these, not the
        strongest and best looking athletes but only the winning contestants
        received the crown., for those who did not compete were ineligible for
        the prize. So also, of those who are good and best in virtuous living,
        only those are illustrious and happy who actually perform good deeds.
        Hence it is better to say that happiness is a virtuous operation than
        virtue itself.

        It should be added that every virtuous person rejoices in virtuous acts,
        for no one win call a man just who does not enjoy doing just deeds; no
        one will call a man generous who does not enjoy giving generously.
        Similarly we speak of men in other virtuous activities. From this it is
        clear that actions in accord with virtue are pleasurable in themselves.

        Granting this, such actions are noble and good. In fact they have each
        of these qualities in the highest degree, if a good man judge truly in
        this matter as we have said he does. Happiness is the best, therefore,

        These qualities do not belong to different things as the inscription at
        Delos has it: “The best is the just thing, the most desired is health,
        and the sweetest is the heart’s desire.” But they are all found together
        in the most virtuous actions. In all these or in the best-of these we

        for it is impossible, or at least difficult, for an indigent man to
        perform certain virtuous actions. Many good deeds become feasible, as we
        have pointed out, by the aid of friends and money and political
        influence. Then too the lack of other blessings, like noble birth, good
        children, and physical beauty spoil a man’s happiness. One who is
        extremely ugly, lowborn, or alone in the world and without children
        cannot be entirely happy. Much less is he happy who is cursed with
        wayward children or evil associates or who has lost friends by death. In
        our opinion then it seems that happiness has need of external prosperity
        to a degree.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        154. After the Philosopher has shown how the first opinion, which places
        happiness in virtue, is in agreement with the definition given above,
        and how it differs from it, he now does the same [b] regarding the
        second opinion, which holds that happiness in virtue together with
        pleasure. On this point he does two things. First [b, i], he shows how
        this position harmonizes with his own opinion. Second [b, ii], at “This
        type of life etc.,” he shows how it differs. On the initial point he
        does two things. First [i, x] he states his proposition; and then [i, y]
        gives evidence for his statement at “Now pleasure is etc.” He says,
        therefore, first that the life of those who act virtuously is itself
        pleasurable. Happiness then which we place in an operation of virtue
        does not lack pleasure which, in their judgment, happiness requires.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        155. Then [i, y], at “Now pleasure is,” he proves his statement by
        showing first that virtuous actions should be pleasurable [i, y, aa] and
        second [i, y, bb], at “Many experience etc.,” that this pleasure is
        preferable to others. He says first that pleasure is an activity proper
        to animals. Although we may attribute a natural appetite to inanimate
        things, we attribute pleasure only to a being having perception. From
        this we see that pleasure properly belongs to the activities of a soul,
        one of which is happiness. Now in activities of this kind, everyone
        finds pleasure in what he is fond of. As a lover desires the thing which
        is absent, so he takes pleasure in it when it is present. In this way a
        lover of horses finds pleasure in a horses; and a lover of shows, in a
        show. Hence it is evident that every virtuous person loves the
        activities of his own virtue as something agreeable to him. To the
        extent that the just man loves justice he will take pleasure in doing
        just deeds. It is universally true that virtuous operations are
        pleasurable to virtuous persons who love virtue.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        156. Then [i, y, bb], at “Many experience,” he shows that this pleasure
        is preferable to others. He explains that the things pleasurable to the
        majority of men are contrary to one another. Prodigality, for instance
        is a source of pleasure to the spendthrift, while hoarding delights the
        miser. This happens because these pleasures are not in accord with human
        nature common to all men, in other words with reason, but rather with
        the corruption of an appetite departing from reason. But to men loving
        the good of virtue, these things are pleasurable that are inherently so,
        that is, that are agreeable to man according to reason, the perfection
        of his nature. Because of this, all virtuous men take pleasure in the
        same things—virtuous operations—which are naturally pleasurable to men
        according to right reason. These are pleasurable not only to men but
        also in their very nature. But evil actions give pleasure to men who get
        used to them by corrupt habits. Since then what is of itself and by
        nature such is preferable, pleasure arising from virtuous operation will
        be more delightful than other pleasures.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        157. Then [b, ii], at “This type of life,” he shows in what respect this
        opinion may not be true. In regard to this he does two things. First
        [ii, x] he states a proposition. Second [ii, y], at “It should be added
        etc.,” he gives evidence for his statement. We must, therefore, consider
        in regard to the first, that those who hold that happiness consists in
        virtue together with pleasure seemed to intimate that virtue may have
        need of some extrinsic pleasure for the perfection of happiness.
        Aristotle disagrees her saying that the life of those who act in accord
        with virtue does not need pleasure as an extrinsic addition. That life
        is pleasurable in itself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        158. Then [ii, y], at “It should be added,” he gives evidence for what
        he has affirmed. In regard to this he does three things. First [ii, y,
        aa] he proves that virtuous life is pleasurable in itself. Second [ii,
        y, bb], at “Granting this, such actions etc.,” he proves that it has
        nobility and goodness in a high degree. Third [ii, y, cc], at “These
        qualities do not etc.,” he excludes a false opinion. He says first that
        to the reasons proving (154-156) that virtuous actions are naturally
        pleasurable, we must add that pleasure necessarily belongs to virtue and
        pertains to its very nature. There is no virtuous person who does not
        enjoy the good deeds he does. He proves this inductively by saying that
        no one will call that man just who does not rejoice in doing just deeds.
        A similar observation may be made of the generous man and of a man
        practicing any virtue. The reason is that the act of a virtuous man is
        agreeable to him according to a proper habit, and as a consequence he
        derives pleasure form it. From this it is clear that virtuous actions
        are pleasurable in themselves and do not require pleasure external to
        them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        159. Then [ii, y, bb], at “Granting this,” he shows that actions in
        accord with virtue are not only pleasurable but also noble and good.
        Actions indeed are pleasurable to an agent when they are agreeable to
        him by reason of a proper habit. They are noble or beautiful because of
        a right order of circumstances as of parts, for beauty consists in a
        fitting arrangement of parts. They are good because of ordered to the
        end.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        166. He adds that each of these three qualities belongs to virtuous
        actions in a high degree. He proves this by te judgment of a good man.
        Such a man, since he has the right feeling for human works, judges them
        correctly. In another field the man with a healthy sense of taste will
        make correct judgment on flavors. But a good man judges that actions in
        accord with virtue are eminently pleasurable, noble nad good, so much so
        that he puts them before any other pleasures, beauties or goods. Since
        therefore, happiness consists in virtuous actions, it follows that
        happiness is the best, most beautiful and most pleasant.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        161. Then [ii, y, cc], at “These qualities do not belong,” he excludes
        from his doctrine a certain opinion. To understand this we must recall
        the inscription in Apollo’s temple at Delos: “The best is what is most
        just. The most desired is to be healthy. The most delightful is that
        which one desires to enjoy.” But the Philosopher says that these three
        qualities do not belong to different things but all three belong to
        virtuous actions in all of which or in the best of which happiness
        consists. Therefore there is one—happiness—which is the best, most
        beautiful, most desired or most delightful.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        162. Then [c], at “It seems, however,” he comes to the third opinion
        which held that external goods are necessary to happiness. In regard to
        this he does three things. First [c, il he brings out in what way this
        opinion may conform to the truth. Second [c, ii], at “for it is
        impossible etc.,” he gives evidence for his statement. Third [c, iii] at
        “For this reason some etc.,” he draws a conclusion from the premises. He
        says first that the third opinion given above (149) seems true in this
        that happiness has need of external good, as was indicated previously
        (111).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        163. Then [c, ii], at “for it is impossible,” he gives evidence for his
        statement. In this matter we must consider that happiness needs certain
        external goods as instruments to perform the good deeds in which
        happiness consists. Touching on this he says that it is impossible or
        difficult for a man, who does not possess the means for gifts and
        expenditures, to practice certain virtuous acts. In many works of virtue
        we make use of friends, wealth, and political power, as in the case of
        someone who is a ruler or an official. There are some external goods
        which lend a beauty to happiness insofar as they make a man pleasing in
        the eyes of others giving him a kind of splendor. At this point he adds
        that a lack of certain externals clouds a man’s happiness making him as
        it were contemptible in the eyes of others, as is evident in a man who
        lacks noble birth, good children or even physical beauty. A man is not
        entirely happy when he is ugly since this makes him contemptible and
        despised. The same is true of one who is lowborn or who does not have
        good children. Much less is he happy who has wicked sons or friends, for
        this limits his virtuous activity. Likewise, it is incompatible with
        happiness to have lost good friends by death, for such a loss means
        grief of heart. So it seems then that happiness has some need of goods
        of fortune.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        164. Then [c, iii], at “For this reason,” he comes to the conclusion
        that although happiness consists in virtuous actions, nevertheless it
        needs external goods to some extent. Such externals are called goods of
        fortune because they often fall into a man’s lap, or, in bad luck,
        desert him. For this reason some have held that good fortune and
        happiness are identical. But others have identified happiness with
        virtue, as was said above (66-68).

        For the same reason children are not really happy, in that they have not
        yet attained sufficient age for the performance of virtuous deeds.
        Children are called happy because they give promise of happiness, while

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        165. After the Philosopher has shown how different opinions are in
        agreement with the definition of happiness presented above, here [3] he
        naturally investigates the cause of happiness. First [3, a] he states
        the question, and second [3, b], at “If anything etc.,” he explains it.
        In regard to the first we must consider that happiness must proceed from
        either a <i>per se</i> and determined cause, or an incidental and
        indetermined cause, that is, chance. If from a <i>per se</i> and
        determined cause, this will be either human or divine. In the case of a
        human cause, the effect is produced in us in three ways: first by
        learning, as a science; second by practice, as a moral virtue; third by
        exercise, as a military drill and other things of this kind.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        166. Accordingly he proposes the question in three parts. The first
        concerns a human cause. He asks whether happiness is something that can
        be learned asa science, or that can be acquired by habit as a moral
        virtue, or that can to some extent be had by training, like setting-up
        exercises. The second part concerns a divine cause. He asks whether
        happiness is something divine in us and a sharing in some way of godlike
        qualities which are above men. The third part concerns an incidental and
        indetermined cause. In other words he asks whether happiness occurs to
        man by chance.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        167. Then [3, b], at “If anything,” he explains the question first [b,
        i] as it were in parts by considering the individual sections of the
        question; and then [b, ii], by offering a common reason taken from the
        definition of happiness at “Whit we seek is evident etc.” In regard to
        the first he does three things. First [i, x] he shows it is eminently
        reasonable for happiness to have a divine cause. Second [i, y], at “On
        the other hand etc.,” he shows that it is acceptable for it to have a
        human cause. Third [i, z], at “If such is the case,” he shows it is not
        fitting for it to be an effect of chance. He say first that if the gods
        (i.e. beings called gods by the ancients) make gifts to men, it is
        reasonable that happiness be the gift of the supreme God because it is
        the most excellent of human goods. It is obvious that a thing is led to
        a higher end by a higher virtue or power, for instance, man is led to a
        higher end by military art than by bridle-making. Hence it is reasonable
        that the ultimate end, happiness, should come to man from the highest
        power of all, the supreme God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        168. That separated substances may bestow something on men becomes
        evident from the fact that men and separated substances are alike in the
        power of intelligence. As the lower bodies are brought to perfection by
        the higher bodies so the lower intellectual beings by the superior
        intellectual beings. But there is no reason to delay any longer on this
        matter for it because it belongs rather to another science, metaphysics.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        169. Then [i, y], at “On the other hand,” he shows it is acceptable to
        say that happiness has a human cause. Although God is the principal
        cause, man does contribute something to happiness. Aristotle shows this
        in two ways. First [y, aa], the fact that happiness has a human cause
        does not do away with its chief characteristic, that it is most
        excellent and divine. He says that if happiness is not a gift sent
        directly by God but comes to men by virtue as a thing acquired by habit,
        or by study as a thing to be learned, or by exercise as a thing to be
        had by training, nevertheless it seems to be something especially
        divine. The reason is that since happiness is the reward and end of
        virtue, it follows that it is something most excellent and divine and
        blessed. A thing is not called divine only because it comes from God but
        also because it makes us like God in goodness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        170. Second [y, bb], at “It will also,” he proves the same point in this
        way. Applicable to happiness is the idea that what belongs to the
        purpose of a nature should be something common to the things having that
        nature, for nature does not fail in what it intends except in the
        minority of cases. So if happiness is the end of human nature, it must
        be common to all or many having human nature. This principle remains
        intact if the cause be a human one. If happiness be had through
        discipline and study it could come to everyone who is not impeded in the
        performance of virtuous works either by defect of nature as those who
        are naturally stupid, or by an evil habit which imitates nature. From
        this it is clear that the happiness spoken of by the Philosopher, does
        not consist in that contact with separated intelligence by which man can
        understand all things, as certain people have maintained. Such
        experience does not happen to very many, in fact, to no one in this
        life.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        171. Then [i, z], at “If such is the case,” he rejects chance as the
        cause of happiness for two reasons. First [z, aa], things that are in
        accord with nature are very good, since nature produces what is
        suitable. The same is true also of everything made by art or by any
        cause whatsoever. This is especially the case with the principal cause
        from which happiness, as the most excellent good, seems to depend. ne
        reason is that art and all efficient causes operate for the sake of
        good. It follows, then, that every agent should most aptly arrange, as
        far as possible, what he does. This particularly applies to God who is
        the cause of all nature. The things which are in accord with nature seem
        to be better from their very make-up. But it is better that happiness
        springs from a <i>per se</i> cause, either divine or human, than from
        chance which is an incidental cause, for what is <i>per se</i> is
        preferable to what is incidental. Consequently, chance is not the cause
        of happiness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        172. He offers a second reason [z, bb] at “Besides, to abandon.”
        Happiness is the most perfect of all human goods because all others are
        ordered to it as to an end. Now it would be very harmful if this good
        were to depend on chance, for other goods would be much more subject to
        chance. As a result man’s zeal in pursuing these goods would vanish, a
        most perilous situation. Chance, therefore, is not the cause of
        happiness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        173. Then [b, ii], at “What we seek,” he settles the question we are
        considering. He says it is evident, from the definition already given
        (130), where the truth lies in our investigation of the present
        question. As was previously indicated (127-128), happiness is an
        activity of the rational soul in accord with virtue. Now what is in
        accord with virtue is according to reason influenced by some divine
        cause. But what is according to chance is contrary to reason. It follows
        that happiness does not spring form chance but from some human cause
        immediately and from a divine cause principally and ultimately. Certain
        other goods, however, in which chance plays a part, do conduce to
        happiness, but happiness does not chiefly consist in them. Some, though,
        are necessary for a certain enrichment of happiness, and others work
        instrumentally to attain it, as we have said (169). But we must not
        attribute happiness to chance because of these secondary goods.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        174. Then [c], at “This-that happiness,” he shows that the previously
        discussed definition of happiness is in agreement not only with the
        opinions of others on happiness but also with observations made in
        keeping with his own opinion. In regard to this he does two things.
        First [c, i] he shows what concurs with his earlier remarks about
        happiness (19-42). Second [c, ii], at “This is why etc.,” he concludes
        what is the correct view in accord with this opinion. He says first
        “this”—that happiness is an activity in accord with virtue—“is
        apparent,” that is, in harmony with the words of the introduction
        (19-42). We said there that the best human good, happiness, is the end
        of political science whose goal manifestly is activity in accord with
        virtue. Political science is especially concerned with framing laws and
        apportioning rewards and punishments in order to develop good citizens
        and doers of good works. This is to operate in accord with virtue.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        175. Then [c, ii], at “That is why,” he concludes from the reason
        assigned that happiness cannot be attributed to certain beings according
        to what has been correctly laid down. First [ii, x] he says that no dumb
        animal is called happy, and rightly so because none of them can share in
        the activity of virtue which is in accord with reason and which
        constitutes happiness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        176. Second [ii, y], at “For the same reason,” he also excludes children
        from happiness saying that for a similar reason they cannot be called
        happy. Lacking sufficient age they have not attained that full use of
        reason requisite for the performance of virtuous actions. If children
        are sometimes called happy, this is because we see in them sings that
        give promise of future excellence. At present, therefore, they are not
        happy, for happiness, as we have indicated (127-126) needs perfect
        virtue to be not only a good but the best operation and a life perfected
        by good activity which is continuous and permanent.

        misfortune. This meaning, though, gives rise to a problem. It seems that
        the dead no less than the living, even though unaware of it, are
        influenced by good and evil, for instance, by honors and dishonors, by
        the prosperity and misfortune of children and of descendants in general.

        A difficulty, however, here presents itself. It may happen that a man
        lived happily to a ripe old age and has died a worthy death, and
        afterwards many changes take place in regard to his children. Some of
        them are good and have gained a position in life they well deserve,
        while others are just the opposite. Indeed, it does happen that children
        are quite different from their parents. Now it is incongruous that a
        dead man should suffer these same changes so that he at one time becomes
        happy and then again unhappy. On the other hand, it seems unfitting that
        the affairs of the children should in no way affect the parents, at
        least for a certain length of time.

        But we must return to our first problem. Perhaps from its solution light
        will be shed on our present difficulty. Let us suppose that we must look
        at the end and then declare each man happy, not because he is happy but
        because he formerly was happy. Now nonsensical, if when a man is happy
        we may not affirm it of him since we are unwilling to call the living
        happy on account of the changes in the present life, because we think
        happiness permanent and not easily changeable, and because fortune often
        goes in cycles for the same persons. Obviously, if we use fortune as our
        norm we will very often call the same person happy and again unhappy as
        though he were a chameleon, and declare him happy and yet insecure in
        his happiness.

        177. After the Philosopher has shown what happiness is, he here raises a
        problem about happiness, namely [A], whether anyone can be called happy
        in this life. On this point he proceeds in three steps. First [A’] he
        gives the reason for the problem. Second [B’], at “Is no man then etc.,”
        he presents the problem. Third [Lect 16, C’], at “We ought not to make
        etc.” (B. 1100 b 7), he gives the solution. He says first that many
        changes take place in life; for life rarely remains the same either good
        or bad. It is stable in few things, changing from good fortune to bad
        and from bad to good. Sometimes, indeed, the changes occur in small
        matters and sometimes in great, and sometimes in matters of medium
        importance. Changes of this sort occur at any age, in adolescence,
        maturity or old age.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        178. Sometimes it happens that a man has had an abundance of external
        goods all his life, and in old age falls into great misfortune as Priam
        did, according to the epic poem of Homer. No one will call that man
        happy who has enjoyed such goods of fortune and ends his life in misery.
        The fact that one has been reduced from great prosperity to extreme
        wretchedness seems to add to his misery.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        179. Then [B’], at “Is no man then,” he proposes the difficulty. But
        first [B’, 2], at “If we hold this etc.,” he brings up an objection.
        Third [B, 3], at “We may say etc.,” he rejects a particular answer.
        First then he asks the question about the view of Solon, one of the
        seven wise men, who framed the laws of the Athenians. Considering man’s
        life as subject to the changes of fortune, Solon said that no one ought
        to be called happy so long as he lives, but only at the end of his life.
        In light of what happened to Priam, the question arises whether any man
        is to be called happy so long as he lives. Is it best, as Solon holds,
        to consider the end of life if happiness continues that long, in order
        that a man may be called happy? Or should this be disregarded?
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        180. Then [B, 2], at “If we hold,” he brings up an objection to the
        question that was asked, and disproves the saying of Solon. If we hold
        as true what Solon said, it follows that man will be happy only when he
        dies. But this seems unreasonable on other grounds, for example, because
        death is the worst of evils and happiness the greatest of perfections.
        Besides, happiness is a kind of activity, as we indicated above
        (119-126). But a dead man does not seem to have an activity. The dead,
        therefore, cannot be called happy. It should be noted that the
        Philosopher is not here speaking of happiness in a future life, but of
        happiness in the present life. Can we attribute happiness to man while
        he lives or only at death?
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        181. Then [B’, 3], at “We may say,” he rejects an answer, and this for
        two reasons. He gives the second reason [3, b] at “But we must return to
        our first problem etc.” In regard to the first [3, a] he does two
        things. Initially [a, i] he propose an answer and rejects it. Second [a,
        ii] by reason of this he brings up a problem at “A difficulty, however,
        here presents itself etc.” In regard to the first point we must consider
        that the previous argument of Aristotle showed that a man is not happy
        in death. Now this will be granted by anyone who says that a dead man is
        not happy: Solon did not mean that a man is happy when he dies. But he
        did mean that when a man is dead, a valid argument can be made about his
        happiness, because the dead man is now beyond the danger of evils and
        misfortune so that there is no longer any doubt about it. But he rejects
        this answer saying it contains an uncertainty.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        182. A dead man differs from a living man in the loss of consciousness.
        A good ting or a bad thing—such as defamation of character, the murder
        of his children, or the loss of riches—could conceivably happen to
        someone still living, and he might not feel it precisely because he does
        not know about it. By the same argument, it seems, some good or evil
        could happen to a dead man who is unaware of it. Here Aristotle is
        talking about good and evil in public life as his examples—“honor and
        dishonor”—show. Sometimes certain honors are given to the dead when they
        are praised and their memory celebrated. Likewise certain dishonors are
        heaped upon them, for example, when their bodies are exhumed and their
        remains burned. Also something good or bad can happen to them by reason
        of the prosperity or misfortune of their children and their
        grandchildren. Then it would seem that not even the dead are entirely
        beyond evils nad misfortunes. Consequently, even in death men cannot be
        called happy.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        183. Then [a, ii], at “A difficulty, however,” he interposes a
        difficulty arising from the premises. Such things as the prosperity and
        misfortunes of children and grandchildren present a problem for him. It
        happens sometimes that a man lives happily—in the way we have described
        happiness—to old age and dies a worthy death but afterwards many changes
        take place in regard to his children, some of whom are good after the
        example of a worthy father, but others just the opposite. Indeed it does
        happen that children are quite different from their parents: good
        parents have wicked children and wealthy parents, needy children. from
        this statement something unfitting seems to follow for both parents and
        children.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        184. it is inappropriate that a dead man should suffer change because of
        misfortunes of this sort, so that he who at one time is happy now
        becomes unhappy. On the other hand it seems improper if, at least for a
        short time after death, the lot of children should in no way affect the
        happiness of deceased parents.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        185. Then [3, b], at “But we must return,” he gives a second reason for
        rejecting the previous answer. He says that, passing over the second
        problem, we must return to the first, the solution of which will shed
        light on the truth of the second. Now it seems that the answer given is
        not consistent. If we must look to the end of life and then call a man
        happy, not because he is then truly happy but because he was previously
        happy, there seems to be this inconsistency: that wen a man is happy, we
        may not say of him that he is happy, since the truth of a statement in
        he past is founded on the statement being true at the time it actually
        occurred. Therefore “ <i>fuisse</i> ” is true of a thing because “
        <i>esse</i> ” was true of it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        186. But some were unwilling to call a man happy because of the changes
        in the present life inasmuch as they were under the impression that
        happiness was something permanent and not easily changeable; otherwise
        it would not satisfy the natural desire. For everyone naturally desires
        to remain secure in the good he possesses. But the wheel of fortune very
        often turns for the same persons, so that they change from good fortune
        to bad and conversely. Thus it is evident that if in judging about
        happiness we sould follow the consideration of fortune and should say of
        someone that he is happy in this life, very often we will say of one and
        the same person that he is happy and again that he is unhappy. In this
        way we will be saying that a person is happy after the manner of a
        chameleon, an animal which changes color in keeping iwth different
        surroundings. We will be declaring that the happy are insecure in their
        happiness which is contrary to the nature of happiness.

        This contention is strengthened by what we have just learned, for
        virtuous actions are more uniformly constant than other human
        activities. They are more abiding apparently than the speculative

        Many events differing in importance happen by the change of fortune. A
        short run of good luck or of bad luck clearly does not notably affect

        happier life, for external goods were made to enrich human life and
        their use is becoming and a means of virtue. On the contrary, great and
        frequent evils cause the happy man external annoyance and internal
        affliction bringing about sadness and hindering many good works.
        However, even here the good of virtue shines forth when a man gracefully

        If virtuous actions play the dominant role in a happy life that we have
        indicated, a happy person will not become unhappy nor will he sometimes
        perform hateful and evil actions. As a truly good and wise man in the

        misfortunes but only by great and frequent ones. After such

        “This, contention is strengthened,” he applies it to the solution of the
        present problem. In regard to the initial point we should consider that
        while happiness consists essentially in the performance of virtuous
        actions, external goods that are subject to fortune are in a way tools
        of happiness. Hence he says we ought not to make changes of luck the
        norm for reckoning a man happy or unhappy, because man’s good or evil,
        which is judged by reason, does not consist principally in such changes
        of luck. Human living however does stand in need of external goods as
        means, as has been indicated (163). But virtuous actions are the
        principal and predominant factor in a man’s happiness so that he can be
        called happy principally because he acts virtuously. On the contrary,
        vicious actions are powerful and dominant in the opposite state, which
        is misery, so that he is truly miserable who is occupied with evil
        deeds.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        188. Then [1, b], at “This contention is strengthened,” he applies what
        was said just now (187) to the solution of the problem. First [b, i] he
        shows that deeds of virtue are especially long-lasting compared to other
        human things. Second [b, ii], at “The happy man will have etc.,” he
        shows that in keeping with what was said, happiness can endure all
        during life. Third [b, iii], at “If virtuous actions play etc.,” he
        shows that all inconveniences are avoided if we follow this teaching. He
        says first that what we have now learned (186) about the permanence of
        happiness confirms our contention that virtuous actions are of foremost
        importance in happiness. The reason is that no human activity is found
        so uniformly constant as these. It is clear that external goods, and
        even internal bodily goods, because material and corporeal, are subject
        to change by their nature. But the goods that belong to he soul are
        changeable only indirectly, and so less liable to change. Of the goods
        pertaining to a man’s soul, some belong to the intellect as the
        sciences, and some to the activities of living as the virtues. These
        virtues are indeed more lasting than the disciplines, i.e., the
        demonstrative sciences.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        189. However, this must not be understood as referring to the matter,
        for demonstrative sciences have as their object necessary things which
        cannot be otherwise. It is to be understood rather as referring to the
        exercise of the act. Now we do not have the same opportunity to
        cultivate the study of the sciences continually as we do to practice
        virtue, for situations are constantly arising where we must act
        according to virtue or contrary to virtue as in the use of food,
        association with women, conversations with other men and similar actions
        with which human life is continuously concerned. Hence it is reasonable
        that the habit of virtue be more firmly fixed in man because it is used
        more than the habit of science.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        190. Among the virtues themselves, the most noble seem to be more
        lasting both because they are more intense and because men work more
        constantly to live according to them. Such are the virtuous operations
        in which happiness consists, because they are most perfect as has been
        proved (128, 130, 150, 160, 164). This is naturally the reason why man
        does not forget to be virtuous because he continually has the occasion
        to exercise the virtues. Another reason too is that virtue consists
        chiefly in the inclination of the appetite which is not destroyed by
        forgetfulness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        191. Then [b, ii], at “The happy man will have,” he shows that according
        to this doctrine happiness can last a lifetime. He says that virtuous
        actions are most lasting, as was pointed out (188-190). If then
        happiness be placed principally in them as we have said (153-190), it
        would follow that the happy man will have what was inquired about in a
        previous question, that is, he will be happy all his life. He proves
        this first [ii, x] from the actions themselves at “He will always.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        192. One who has a habit perfectly can act always or almost continually
        according to that habit in everything he does. The happy man possesses
        perfect virtue, as was explained above (187, 188). Consequently, he can
        always or nearly always or nearly always perform virtuous actions in a
        life of activity and can attentively consider in a life of
        contemplation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        193. Second [ii, y], at “Because he is really good,” he shows the same
        thing from the goods of fortune, an object of lesser importance in
        happiness. He says [y, aa] that the happy man will bear all changes of
        fortune most admirably and will be eminently prudent in all matters,
        since he is really a good man and not superficially so. He is
        “foursquare” without reproach, or, as some have explained, perfect in
        the four cardinal virtues. But this interpretation does not seem to be
        according to the mind of Aristotle who has never been found making such
        an enumeration. The tetragon does however indicate something perfect in
        virtue after the manner of a cube, which has six squared surfaces and so
        lies evenly on any surface. Similarly the virtuous person is of an even
        temperament in any fortune. Since therefore, it pertains to virtue to
        bear all fortune becomingly, obviously the happy man will not cease to
        act virtuously because of any change of fortune. He shows this then in
        detail [y, bb], as it were by way of division, when he adds “Many
        events.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        194. He says that since many good and bad things differing in importance
        may happen by changes of fortune, it is evident that a short run of good
        luck and likewise a short run of bad luck do not cange life from
        happiness to misery or conversely. If, however, they are great and
        frequent they will be either good or bad. If good, they will make a
        man’s life happier. The reason is that, as was indicated above (169,
        173), happiness has need of external goods either as adornments or as
        means of virtuous actions. In regard to adornments he says that they
        were made to enrich the life of man. As to the means of virtuous action,
        he says that the use of external goods is becoming and virtuous insofar
        as virtues make use of them to perform worthy deeds.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        195. If on the contrary the evils should be frequent and great, they
        will cause the happy man external annoyance and internal affliction,
        because internally they bring about sadness and externally they hinder
        good works. However they do not eliminate virtuous action entirely,
        because virtue makes good use even of misfortunes themselves. In this
        way the good of virtue shines forth insofar as a man gracefully endures
        frequent and great misfortunes, not because he may not feel the sorrow
        or sadness as the Stoics held but, being courageous and magnanimous, his
        reason does not succumb to such afflictions.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        196. This, in fact, was the difference between the Stoics and the
        Peripatetics, whose leader was Aristotle. The Stoics held that sorrow in
        no way afflicts a virtuous man, because, in their view, corporeal or
        external things are not in any sense a good of man. The Peripatetics, on
        the contrary, said that a virtuous man is affected by sadness, yet this
        does not overwhelm reason but is moderated by it. In their opinion
        corporeal and external things do not constitute the greatest but the
        least good of man and this in the degree that they help him.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        197. But it should be observed that some change could happen that would
        entirely take away a man’s happiness by hindering virtuous action
        altogether. for example, some sickness could cause madness or insanity
        or any other mental breakdown. Since happiness may not be attained
        except by living humanly or in accord with reason, when the use of
        reason is gone, human living is not possible. Consequently, in what
        concerns living humanly, the condition of madness must be equated with
        the condition of death. So seemingly we must say the same of him who
        continues in virtuous action until loss of mind as if he had continued
        until death.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        198. Then [b, iii], at “If virtuous actions play,” he excludes the
        unsuitable things that seemed to follow from the premises. He says that
        if virtuous actions play the dominant role in happiness, as we have
        asserted (188), it will not follow that the happy man becomes unhappy on
        account of misfortunes, or that because of misfortune he will perform
        actions contrary to virtue. But by reason of his perfect virtue the
        happy man—it can be predicted—will bear all changes of fortune
        becomingly like a truly good and wise man. In other words he will act
        according to virtue under every condition. Even if he does not perform
        the same actions in every contingency, he will always act most nobly
        according as the circumstances are favorable or unfavorable. He will use
        the material that fortune provides in the way that a good general with
        an awareness of the condition of his army ought to dispose his existing
        forces to the best advantage in battle. A commander will do one thing if
        he has seasoned troops and another if he has an army of raw recruits.
        Likewise, a cobbler ought to make the best shoes possible from the
        leather at hand. He will of course make better shoes form one piece of
        leather than from another. The same may be said of all other craftsmen.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        199. If this is so, the unhappy man will not be made happy by any
        additional good fortune. The reason is hat he will use that good fortune
        badly and the evildoer will always remain unhappy. Likewise the happy
        man will not fall into the misfortune of Priam. First because he will
        prudently guard against it. Second, because if he should be stricken
        unexpectedly, he will bear it most gracefully, as we have pointed out
        (198). He will not, therefore, be changed easily from happiness to
        unhappiness by any misfortune whatsoever except by frequent and great
        changes that deprive him of the use of reason. If he has been made
        unhappy, he will not readily become happy again but he will need an
        abundance of great and noble things acquired after a long time by the
        exercise of virtuous action and by the restoration of external fortune.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        200. Then [1, c], when he says “What therefore,” he brings to an end his
        own thoughts on happiness. He says that nothing hinders us from calling
        that man happy who acts in accord with perfect virtue and has sufficient
        external goods for virtuous activity, not just for a short time but all
        during life or at least for a long period. This is enough for a man to
        be called happy in this life.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        201. If we wish to understand happiness in the most perfect sense,
        possible, we must add to the definition of happiness that the happy man
        will live his whole life as we have indicated (129) and will complete it
        by dying in a manner befitting reason. It appears that this condition
        must be added because the future is unknown to us. Now all that is
        perfect and best seems to belong to the definition of happiness, since
        it is the ultimate end. In this second way Solon was speaking of
        happiness. If the case be as just described (200) we shall call those
        men happy in this life who have now and will have in the future the
        conditions we have laid down (177-186).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        202. But because these things seem not to measure up in all respects to
        the conditions required for happiness above (104-117), he adds that
        those we call happy are men subject to change in this life, who cannot
        attain perfect beatitude. Since a natural desire is not in vain, we can
        correctly judge that perfect beatitude is reserved for man after this
        life. He concludes with the remark that we have said enough on these
        points.

        Many and vastly different things happen in fortune. Since some of these
        touch us closely and others remotely, it would be a long, even an
        endless, task to determine the extent of each. It will be enough to
        discuss the subject in broad and general terms. Some of the fortunes
        affecting a man himself are of sufficient importance to better the
        conditions of life while others are of lesser moment. We can affirm the

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        203. After the Philosopher has solved the principal doubt concerning the
        change of fortune for the happy man, here [2] he settles a doubt raised
        above (183) about the change of fortune in regard to friends. On this
        point he does two things. First [2, a] he compares the good fortunes and
        misfortunes happening to friends with those which happen to man himself.
        Second [2, b], at “It makes much more etc.,” he compares the events that
        happen to the dead with what happens to the living. In regard to the
        first he does two things. Initially [a, i] he proposes that the things
        that happen to one’s friends affect the man himself. Second [a, ii], at
        “Many and vastly different etc.,” he shows what the things are and what
        their nature is. He affirms, first, that to say that the prosperity of
        great grandchildren or of descendants in general and of all friends
        would have no effect on the happiness of a man, living or dead, seems to
        be incongruous for two reasons. Primarily indeed, because it would be
        contrary to the nature of friendship, that is a union among friends to
        such an extent that one considers as his own what belongs to the other.
        Then too, because this would be contrary to the common opinion which
        cannot be entirely false.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        204. Then [a, ii], at “Many vastly different things,” he shows what
        events may affect the happiness of a friend and the nature of these
        events. He says that many and vastly different things happen in
        prosperity or adversity, in kind, in quantity, in time, and in other
        respects. Some of them touch us closely and others remotely. If then we
        should wish to determine in every case which of them affect the man
        himself and which do not, the task would be a long one, in fact almost
        endless, because differences happen in an infinite variety of ways.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        205. With regard to the fortunes affecting a man himself it is
        sufficient to note in general, and so to speak, typically, by way of
        distinctive qualities or superficial likeness, that some acts of fortune
        are of sufficient importance and influence to change the condition of
        human life and do contribute to happiness. Others, however, are of
        lesser moment an help man’s life but little. The same thing takes place
        in the events that happen to any of our friends except that things of
        lesser moment happenting to blood-relatives affect us more.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        206. Then [2, b], at “It makes much more difference,” he shows in what
        manner the changing fortunes of friends affect a person—it is rather
        evident how this touches a man while he lives, even how this may affect
        the dead. On this point he does two things. First [b, i] he shows in
        what way there is a difference in regard to this about the living and
        the dead. Second [b, ii] he inquires whether the lot of friends affect
        the dead, since it is clear they do affect the living. This he does at
        “Perhaps we should rather inquire.” On the first point we must consider
        that the dead are outside the present life, the happiness of which
        Aristotle here intends to inquire about, as appears from what has been
        previously said (180). They have contact with this life only as they
        remain in the memories of the living. The dead, therefore, may be
        compared in this way to the living—when we consider this life—as the
        events actually happening now are compared to those that took place long
        ago and are now recounted—for example, the Trojan war or any incident of
        this kind.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        207. He then remarks that it makes a great difference whether a
        particular misfortune befalls men while they are living or after hey are
        dead—a far greater difference than it makes in a tragedy whether certain
        evil deeds like murder, robbery, or any other kind of misfortune be
        recounted by the playwrights as preceding the action of the drama or are
        performed in the course of it. The reason is that in the first case (the
        living and the dead) the same misfortunes affect them but in a different
        way because of their different states, for some are actually engaged in
        human affairs, but some of the trials befalling them are recounted as
        here and now taking place, while others as having previously occurred.
        Because happiness refers rather to persons than to things happening
        externally, the Philosopher says that the first difference (which refers
        to the living and the dead)—precisely as it pertains to the point at
        issue, namely, a change of happiness—is of more importance than the
        second (which refers to actions in tragedies). And by reason of a
        similar inference concerning the difference of events, he says that we
        must consider the difference in our question.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        208. Now it is clear that even though a recitation of past evils in a
        way influences the the hearer who is in some measure affected by them,
        it does not do so to the extent of changing his condition. Consequently,
        much less do fortunes change the condition of the dead. This is brought
        out by the Philosopher to clear up, as it were, the statement made above
        (184), which concluded that if something affects men who are not
        conscious, it affects also the dead.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        209. Then [b, ii], at “Perhaps we should rather inquire,” he inquires
        last whether things happening to friends affect the dead in some way.
        First [ii, x] he examines the proposition; and second [ii, y], he brings
        to a conclusion his chief proposal at “Therefore the good actions.” He
        says first that we should rather inquire whether the dead in any way
        share in the prosperity and adversity that take place in this life. That
        a man is not changed from happiness to unhappiness or the other way
        round seems sufficiently established. The reason is that if an event
        taking place here, either good or bad, affects the dead, it will be
        fleeting and insignificant in itself or in its effect on them. But if
        this is the case, it will not be so great or of such a nature as to make
        them happy who are not happy, nor to take away happiness from them who
        have it. It has been said already (194) that trifling happenings do not
        cause a change in life. If then an insignificant event, among the things
        that happen, affects the dead, it follows that their condition of
        happiness will not be changed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        210. Then [ii, y], at “Therefore the good actions,” he concludes his
        opinion. He says that the good actions done by friends or the evil
        befalling them seem to have some influence on te dead, and misfortunes
        too seem to affect them. But these take place in such a manner and to
        such an extent that they do not make the happy unhappy or the unhappy
        happy, nor do they change the dead in such things as wisdom or virtue or
        the like. However, the construction can be conditioned by the words “If
        this be the case.” Then the statement “do have some influence” will be
        properly conditional, and the conjunctive particle will be superfluous.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        211. It seems that Aristotle intends that the things said here are to be
        understood of the dead not as they are in themselves but as they live in
        the memory of men. In this way what happens to their friends after death
        seems to affect the dead so that their memory and glory become more
        distinct and more obscure. But this, he says, is indeed a fleeting thing
        because nothing is more fleeting than what exists only in the opinion of
        men. He says also that it is an insignificant thing especially for he
        dead themselves because it belongs to htme only to the extent they are
        remembered by men.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        212. The questions, however, whether the souls of men survive in some
        fashion after death and whether they are aware of or are changed in any
        way by what occurs in this life do not pertain to our purpose since the
        Philosopher here is treating of the happiness of the present life, as is
        evident from what was said above (206). Consequently inquiries of this
        kind, which need to be considered at some length, must be omitted at
        this point lest in this science which is practical many discussions
        outside its scope be carried on—a procedure that the Philosopher
        condemned (136). Elsewhere we have treated these subjects more fully.

        Praise surely belongs to virtue since doers of good works are praised
        for activity of body and of soul in accord with virtue. But perhaps a

        over the study of laudatory statements. It is obvious now to us from our

        This appears to be true also from the nature of a principle. Now men do

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        213. After the Philosopher has shown what happiness is, here [II] he
        inquires about a certain property of happiness. First [II, A] he asks a
        question, and second [II, B], he ascertains the truth, at “Now a thing
        that is praiseworthy etc.” He says that after determining the preceding
        matters, it is necessary to examine whether happiness is of the number
        of goods to be honored or to be praised. He proves that happiness must
        be contained under the one or the other kind of good by the fact that
        happiness is not in the genus of potentiality. A man is not praised or
        honored because he has the potentiality to good but because he is
        somehow disposed to good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        214. To have an understanding of this question, we must consider that
        honor and praise differ in a twofold manner. First on the part of that
        in which honor or praise consists. In this respect honor is more
        extensive than praise. Honor signifies testimony manifesting a person’s
        excellence either by word or by deed, as when one genuflects to another
        or rises for him. But praise consists only in words. Second, praise and
        honor differ in regard to that for which they are given, for both are
        given on account of some excellence. Now there are two kinds of
        excellence. One is absolute and in this sense honor is due to it. But
        the other is an excellence in relation to some end, and in this sense
        praise is due.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        215. Then [II, B], at “Now a thing that is,” he answers the question.
        First [B, A’] he shows that happiness is of the number of goods to be
        honored because it is a thing perfect and best. In the second place [B,
        B] he shows the same thing from the fact that happiness has the nature
        of a principle, at “This appears to be true also etc.” On the first
        point he does two things. Initially [A’, I] he shows to whom praise is
        given. Second [A’, 2] he concludes that something better than praise is
        given to the best, at “If praise belongs etc.” In regard to the initial
        point he does two things. First [1, a] he presents his proposition.
        Second [1, b] he presents his proposition. Second [1, b] he proves the
        proposition at “Thus we generally praise the just etc.” He says first
        that everything that is praised seems to be praiseworthy for two reasons
        simultaneously: (1) because it has a certain kind of disposition in
        itself and (2) because it has a relation of some sort to another.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        216. Then [1, b], at “Thus we generally praise,” he proves the
        proposition first [1, b, i] from human praises and second [1, b, ii]
        from divine praises at “Our point is obvious too from the praises of the
        gods.” In regard to the first we must consider that a man is praised
        both because of virtue of mind and because of power or strength of body.
        By reason of virtue of mind, a man (for instance, one who is just or
        brave or virtuous in any way) is praised for having virtue. The virtue
        also is praised, and this is because of something else, namely, virtuous
        works and actions. The virtuous man and virtue itself then are praised
        insofar as they are ordered to do the work of virtue. Second, a aman is
        praised by reason of power or strength of body because he is strong in
        fighting, swift in running, and so forth. This happens because the
        athlete is in a way ordered to something good in itself and desirable as
        worthy of achievement.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        217. We must pay attention to the difference between virtues or powers
        of mind and body. It is sufficient in the praise of virtue of soul that
        a man be well disposed to the proper act of the virtue. The reason is
        that the good of man consists in the very act of virtue, for instance,
        for running or for wrestling. Human goodness does not consist in such
        things, since a man can run, wrestle, or fight for both as good and an
        evil purpose. Consequently, when speaking of the praises of the virtues
        of the soul he said they are praised because of works and actions (that
        flow from them). But in speaking of the powers of the body he indicated
        that they are praised in relation to something else.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        218. Then [1, b, ii], at “Our point is obvious too,” he explains what is
        meant by divine praises. If something be praiseworthy absolutely and not
        as related to some other thing, it follows that the thing is
        praiseworthy in all circumstances. But this is clearly false in the case
        of praises given to separated substances that he calls gods. It would
        seem ridiculous to praise them for things that are praised in men, for
        instance, because they are not overcome by concupiscence or fear. This
        is so because praises are given by reason of a relation to something
        else, as has been pointed out (214).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        219. Then [A’, 2], at “If praise,” he concludes his proposition from
        what has been said. First [2, a] he puts the conclusion this way. Praise
        is given to the things whose goodness is considered in relation to
        something else. But the best things are not ordered to anything else but
        rather other things are ordered to them. Therefore, something better
        than praise is given to the best. In a somewhat similar way, there is
        science for the study of speculative principles, but something higher
        than science, understanding. Science is concerned with conclusions which
        are known by means of principles. Likewise, praise is concerned with
        things whose goodness is for the sake of others. But honor, a thing
        better than praise, is concerned with things to which other things are
        ordered.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        220. Second [2, b], at “This seems to be true,” he proves the previous
        conclusion from what is commonly held. First [2, b, i] in regard to the
        things of which there is something better than praise; and second [2, b,
        ii] in regard to the things of which there is praise at “Praise surely
        belongs etc.” In regard to the first he does two things. To prove his
        proposition he first [i, x] presents what seems to be commonly held and
        second [ i, y] what seemed so to Eudoxus at “Apparently Eudoxus.” He
        says first that it seems commonly held that there is something better
        than praise for the best. This is made clear from the fact that those
        ascribing to the gods as it were something better than praise call them
        blessed and happy. They say the same, too, of the best among men who
        have a certain likeness to the gods by reason of excellence. As we
        ascribe something better than praise to the best among men, so also to
        the best of goods like happiness. No one praises happiness in the way he
        praises a just or virtuous man. Something better is ascribed to
        happiness when we call it blessedness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        221. Then [i, y], at “Apparently Eudoxus” he reduces the saying of
        Eudoxus to the same argument. Now Eudoxus called pleasure the first
        fruits of good, saying that pleasure is the supreme good. He thinks this
        is intimated from the following. Pleasure is a good that is not praised
        because in itself it is something better than the things that are
        praised. No one indeed is praised on account of pleasure, for instance,
        God and any other good in itself. The reason is that things whose
        goodness is praised are referred to things good in themselves. Things
        that are praised are praised precisely because they are somehow related
        to the things that are good in themselves.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        222. Then [2, b, ii], at “Praise surely,” he proves what he said in
        respect of the things to which praise is given. He says that praise
        belongs to virtue which makes us doers of good works, for a person is
        praised because of activity of body or soul as was just mentioned
        (216-217). But a consideration of the words used by men in bestowing
        compliments pertains more properly to rhetoricians who labor over the
        study of laudatory statements. It belongs to the kind of subject that
        deals with praise or dispraise (<i>demonstrativum genus</i>)—one of the
        three falling under the study of rhetoric, as is clear from the
        Philosopher in the first book of the Rhetoric (Ch. 3, 1358 b 21-1359 a
        5) and from Tully (Cicero) in his Rhetoric (<i>De Oratore</i>, Bk. II,
        Ch. x, xi). So far as we are concerned it is obvious from the above
        (220) that happiness is of the number of goods to be honored because it
        is a perfect good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        223. Then [B, B’], at “This appears to be true also,” he proves his
        proposition from the nature of a principle. We look upon the principle
        and the cause of goods as a thing to be honored, for it is as it were
        something divine, since God is the first principle of all good. But
        happiness is the principle of all human good because men do all that
        they do by reason of happiness. Now the end in things to be done and
        things to be desired has the nature of a principle because the nature of
        the means is understood from the end. Hence it follows that happiness is
        a good to be honored.

        The virtue we are investigating then will be human virtue, for we were
        seeking human good and human happiness. Now we call that virtue human
        which is proper not to the body but to the soul. Besides, we say that
        happiness is an activity of the soul. Since this is so, obviously the
        statesman must know to some extent the things pertaining to the soul, as
        he who is to heal the eyes or the whole body should know something about
        physiology. In fact the knowledge of the statesman should be greater
        insofar as political science is nobler and more important than medicine.
        But skillful physicians make it their business to know much about the
        body. Therefore, the statesman must study the soul.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">COMMENTARY OF ST. THOMAS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        224. After the Philosopher has finished the treatise on happiness, he
        begins the consideration of virtue. First [I] he premises certain things
        necessary for the study of virtue. Second (B. 1103 a 14) he begins to
        define virtue in the beginning of the second book at “Virtue is of two
        kinds etc.” [Lect. 1]. In regard to the first he does three things.
        First [I, A] he shows that it pertains to this science to study virtue.
        Second [I, B], at “The virtues we are etc.,” he assumes certain things
        we must know about the parts of the soul. Third [Lect. 20; C], at
        “Virtue is divided etc.” (B. 1103 a 4), he divides virtue according to
        the division of the parts of the soul. He proves the initial point in
        two ways. First [A, A’] by a reason taken from the doctrine on
        happiness. It was pointed out previously (128, 130, 150, 160, 164, 175,
        187, 190) that happiness is an action according to perfect virtue. Hence
        we can study happiness better by means of knowledge of virtue. In
        keeping with this, he completes the treatise on happiness when he
        finishes the study of all the virtues in the tenth book (1953-2180).
        Since then the principal object of this science is the good of man,
        which is happiness, an inquiry into virtue fittingly comes within the
        scope of this science.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        225. Second [A, B] at “Now political science,” he proves the proposition
        from the particular nature of this science. Political science seems
        really to make a special study of virtue and its attainment. Indeed the
        object of political science is to produce good citizens obedient to the
        laws (as is evident from the lawmakers of the Cretes and the Spartans
        who had model states, and from others framing similar laws to make men
        virtuous). But the study of the present science is connected with
        political science because its principles are given here. Obviously then
        a consideration of virtue will be suitable to this science. Accordingly
        in the introduction (25-31) we placed political science, which
        investigates the ultimate end of human actions, above all other
        sciences.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        226. Then [I, B], at “The virtue,” he takes up certain questions
        pertaining to the parts of the soul, which are necessary for the
        knowledge of virtues. On this point he does two things. First [B, A’] he
        shows it is necessary that such things be discussed in this science.
        Second [B, B’] he takes them up at “Certain things about the soul etc.”
        In regard to the first he does two things. First [A’, 1] he shows that
        it is necessary in this science to consider certain questions about the
        parts of the soul. Second [A, 2], at “The soul must be studied etc.,” he
        shows how we must consider these questions. First, since it is our
        intention to investigate virtue, we understand that we are speaking of
        human virtue. We have just now noted (224) that we are looking for human
        good and human happiness in this science. If, therefore, we seek virtue
        for the sake of happiness, we necessarily seek human virtue. But that
        virtue is peculiarly human which is proper to the soul, for it does not
        belong to the body nor is it shared in common with other beings.
        Pertinent here is what we said before (123-126), that happiness is an
        activity of the soul.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        227. In the study of the soul whose virtue he seeks, the statesman is
        compared to the physician who studies the body seeking its health.
        Obviously then the statesman must know to some extent the things
        belonging to the soul, as the physician who treats the eyes and the
        whole body must study something about the eyes and the whole body. The
        obligation of the statesman to study the soul whose virtue he seeks is
        greater because political science is more important than the science of
        medicine—a fact we know from what was said previously (25-30.
        Consequently, the study of political science must be more thorough. We
        see that skillful physicians study many things which will give them a
        knowledge of the body and not merely what concerns cures. Hence a
        statesman gives some thought to the soul.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        228. Then [A’, 2], at “The soul must be studied,” he shows in what way
        the statesman ought to investigate these things. In this science, he
        says, the soul must be studied for the sake of the virtues and human
        actions that are the principle objects here investigated. Therefore, the
        study of the soul must be such as suffices for the things chiefly
        sought. If a man should wish to make a more exhaustive study, he will be
        imposing a greater task than the object of our investigation requires.
        So too in all other things sought for the sake of an end, the extent of
        them must be measured according to the end itself.
      </p>

        229. Then [B, B’], at “Certain things about the soul,” he takes up the
        things we must consider here about the parts of the soul. First [B’, 1]
        he divides the parts of the soul into rational and irrational. Second
        [Lect. 20; 2], at “One part of the irrational soul etc.” (B.1102 a 33),
        he subdivides the irrational. Third [Lect. 20; 31, at “If however we
        must etc.” (B. 1103 a 2), he subdivides the other member of the first
        division, that is, the rational part of the soul. In regard to the first
        he does two things. First [1, a] he gives the division. Second [1, b],
        at “But whether the parts etc.,” he says that a certain question must be
        left unanswered. He says first that certain things about the soul have
        been adequately treated in the book <i>De Anima</i>, which he calls
        extraneous discussions because he wrote the book as an epistle to
        persons living at a considerable distance. The books that he was
        accustomed to teach his students (auditors) were called reports or notes
        (auditions), as the books of the <i>Physics</i> are entitled on the
        audition of classes about nature; or they are called extraneous for the
        better reason that they are outside the scope of the immediate science.
        However, here we must use the things discussed in that book, for
        instance, one part of the soul is rational, another part irrational as
        is asserted in the third book <i>De Anima</i> (Ch. 9, 432 a 27; St. Th.
        Lect. 14, 797).

        230. Then [1, b], at “But whether the parts,” he asks a certain question
        which is to be left unanswered intentionally. Are the two parts of the
        soul, rational and irrational, distinct from one another in their
        subject according to location and position, as particles of a body or of
        some other divisible continuum? Plato located the rational part or power
        in the brain, the emotional part in the heart, and the assimilative part
        in the liver. Or perhaps these two parts are not divided according to
        subject but only in concept as in the circumference of a circle the
        convex and concave are not distinguished by subject but in concept
        alone. He says that so far as it concerns us at present, it does not
        matter which opinion is held. Hence he leaves the question unanswered
        because it does not pertain to our present purpose.

        It seems that the vegetative part and potency of the soul are most
        active during sleep. Now good and evil persons are hardly
        distinguishable in their sleep. Hence the saying that the happy are no
        better off than the miserable for half their lives. This is a reasonable
        doctrine, for sleep is a cessation from the operation according to which
        the soul is called good and evil. Yet perhaps certain activities do
        penetrate the soul of the sleeper gradually. In this way the dreams of
        the virtuous become better than the dreams of other persons. But what we
        have now said on this subject will suffice. Therefore, discussion of the

        virtue.

        We praise the rational principle in the incontinent and continent man,
        for reason rightly induces to what is best. But something besides reason
        seems to be innate in them, which conflicts with reason and resists
        reason. As paralyzed members of the body are said to move wrongly to the
        left contrary to the will choosing the right, so also in the soul, for
        the movement of the incontinent are to things contrary to reason. While
        the uncontrolled movement can be seen in bodies, it is invisible in the

        besides reason which is contrary and resistant to reason. But how this

        Apparently the irrational part is twofold. The vegetative power does not
        partake of reason at all. But the concupiscible power and every
        appetitive power participate to some extent because they heed and are
        obedient to reason. Therefore, we say that reason holds the place of a

        to be intellectual virtues, while liberality and sobriety are called
        moral. When speaking of man’s good morals we do not describe him as wise

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        231. After the philosopher has divided the parts of the soul into
        rational and irrational, here [2] he subdivides the irrational part.
        First [2, a] he presents one member of the subdivision; and then [2, b],
        he presents the other at “Seemingly there is another part etc.” In
        regard to the initial point he does two things. First [a, i] he mentions
        an irrational part of the soul. Then [a, ii] he shows that this part is
        not properly human, at “Because this power etc.” He says first that one
        of the parts of the irrational soul is like the plant soul and is common
        to all things living here below. It is that part which is the cause of
        assimilation and growth. Such a part of the soul is found in every being
        that assimilates food not only in creatures after birth but even before
        birth, as in embryos that are obviously nourished and grow.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        232. Likewise this part of the soul is discovered not only in the highly
        organized animals having all the senses and endowed with local motion
        but also in the lowest animals, like oysters having only the sense of
        touch and rooted to one place. Evidently all these creatures live and
        have some kind of soul. But this vegetative type of soul rather than
        some other part is more reasonably assigned to these lowest animals
        because the effects of this part are more evident in them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        233. Then [a, ii], at “Because this power,” he shows that the
        aforementioned part of the soul is not human. First [a, ii, x] he
        concludes this from the premises. We call human that which is
        distinctive of man. If then a part of the soul is altogether common, it
        will not be human.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        234. Secondly [a, ii, y], at “It seems that,” he adds a proof from a
        particular evident sign. This part of the soul is found to be especially
        active during sleep, for when he natural heat has returned to the
        internal organs and the animal is asleep, digestion works better. But
        what is proper to man precisely as he is said to be good or evil
        operates only slightly during sleep. Good and evil persons are hardly
        distinguishable in their sleep. Hence the saying that the happy do not
        differ from the unhappy for half their life which is spent in sleep. The
        reason is that judgment of the intellect is bound during sleep, and the
        external senses do not function, although the imagination and he power
        of nutrition are active.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        235. It is reasonable that the god and evil, the happy and the unhappy
        are indistinguishable while asleep because that part of man by which he
        is called good ceases to function during sleep. Good and evil men differ
        while asleep not on account of a difference occurring during their
        slumbers but because of what happened in their waking moments. Conscious
        activity gradually penetrates to the soul of the sleeper so that the
        things a man has seen or heard or thought while awake, present
        themselves to his imagination in sleep. In this way the virtuous who
        spend their wakeful hours in good works have more edifying dreams than
        other persons who occupy their conscious moments with idle and evil
        woks. What we have now said on this subject will suffice (2334-235). We
        conclude then from the premises (233-235), that the nutritive part of
        the soul is not adapted by nature to participate in human virtue.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        236. Then [2, b], at “Seemingly there is,” he presents the other member
        of the division. First [b, i] he indicates what he intends; and second
        [b, ii] he proves his proposition at “We praise the rational etc.” He
        says first that besides the vegetative part of the soul, there seems to
        be another part, irrational like the vegetative, but participating in
        reason to some extent. In this it differs from the vegetative part that
        has nothing whatsoever to do with human virtue as was just said (235).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        237. Then [b, ii], at “We praise the rational,” he proves his
        proposition: first [b, ii, x] that there is another part of the
        irrational soul; second [b, ii, y] that this part participates in reason
        at “Now this part seems to share in reason.” He proves the first by an
        argument taken from continent and incontinent men. In this matter we
        praise the part of the soul having reason because it rightly deliberates
        and induces to what is best, as if by entreaty and persuasion.
        Both—continent and incontinent—choose abstain from unlawful pleasures.
        But seemingly in both there is something innate in them other than
        reason, and this something conflicts with reason and resists or hinders
        reason in the execution of its choice. Obviously it is something
        irrational, since it is contrary to reason. The sensitive appetite,
        whichdesires what is pleasant to sense and at times opposes what reason
        judges absolutely good, would be such a thing. This appetite in the
        continent man is restrained by reason, for he certainly has evil desires
        but his reason does not follow them. On the other hand the appetite in
        the incontinent man overcomes reason, which is seduced by evil desires.

        238. Then he adds an illustration. The members of the body are
        incapacitated when they cannot be controlled by the regulative power of
        the soul, as happens to paralytics and the intoxicated who move to the
        left side when hey wish to move to the right. This is true also of the
        souls of incontinent persons who are moved to the opposite of what the
        reason chooses. But the process is not so apparent in the parts of the
        soul as in the parts of the body. We see clearly in what way a bodily
        member moves unnaturally, but the movement of the parts of the soul is
        not so obvious to us. Despite this, we must judge there is something
        that is contrary to reason and resists it. But how this may differ from
        reason—whether by subject or by concept alone—does not matter at
        present.

        239. Then [b, ii, y], at “Now this part,” he shows that an irrational
        part of this kind participates in reason. His first argument [y, aa] is
        based on acts taking place within man; his second [y, bb], at
        “Persuasion, reproach)” is based on acts external to man, With the first
        he does two things. First [aa, a’] he shows that this irrational part
        participates in reason. Second [aa, b’] he finishes the treatment of the
        difference of this irrational “ part from the part presented above, at
        “Apparently the irrational part.” He says first that the irrational
        part, of which we have now spoken (233-235), seems in some way to
        participate in reason, as was just said (236). This is obvious in the
        continent man whose sensitive appetite obeys reason. Although he may
        have evil desires, nevertheless he does not act according to them but
        according to reason. In the sober or temperate man this part of the soul
        is even more fully subject to reason. Such a man has so subdued his
        sensitive appetite that evil desires in him are not vehement. We may say
        thesame of the courageous man and of anyone endowed with the habit of
        moral virtue. The reason is that in these men nearly everything—both
        external actions and internal desires—harmonize with reason.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        240. Then [aa, b’], at “Apparently the irrational,” he concludes the
        difference between the two irrational parts from the premises. He says
        that according to the premises the irrational part is apparently
        twofold. Now the vegetative part, found in plants, does not partake of
        reason in any way, for it is not obedient to the direction of reason.
        But the concupiscible power and every appetitive power like the
        irascible emotion and the will participate in reason in some measure
        because they heed the movement of the reason and are obedient to its
        regulations. Hence we say reason holds the place of a father giving
        guidance and of friends offering advice. But reason here does not play
        the role of a mere theorist like the reason of a mathematician, for the
        irrational part of the soul does not partake in any way of reason
        understood in this sense.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        241. Then [y, bb], at “Persuasion, reproach,” he shows through the
        things externally done that the irrational part participates in reason.
        In his opinion this is indicated from the fact that the persuasion of
        friends, the reproach of superiors and the entreaties of inferiors aim
        to keep a man from following his desires. But all these would be useless
        unless this part of the irrational soul could share in reason. From this
        too it is apparent that reason is not controlled by the movements of the
        passions of the sensitive appetite but quite the contrary—reason can
        restrain such movements. Therefore, reason is not governed by the
        motions of the heavenly bodies, which can effect some change in the
        sensitive appetite of the soul through a change in the human body. Since
        the intellect or reason is not a faculty of any bodily organ, it is not
        directly subject to the action of any bodily power. The same is true of
        the will that is in the reason, as was said in the third book
        <i>De Anima</i> (Ch. 3, 427 a 21; St. Th. Lect. 4, 617-621).

        242. Then [3], at “If however,” he subdivides the other member of the
        first division, the rational part of the soul. According to him (if we
        must say that that part of the soul that participates in reason is
        rational in some way) the rational part will be of two kinds: one,
        having reason principally and in itself, is rational by nature. But the
        other is inherently adapted to obey reason as a father, and is called
        rational by participation. In accord with this, one member is contained
        under both rational and irrational. Now, one part of the soul, the
        vegetative, is irrational alone; another part is rational alone, the
        intellect and reason. Still another part is of itself irrational but
        rational by participation, like the sensitive appetite and th will.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        243. Then [C], at “Virtue is divided,” he divides virtue according to
        this difference in the parts of the soul. He says that virtue is
        designated or divided according to the above-mentioned difference in the
        parts of the soul. Since human virtue perfects the work of man which is
        done according to reason, human virtue must consist in something
        reasonable. Since the reasonable is of two kinds, by nature and by
        participation, it follows that there are two kinds of human virtue. One
        of these is placed in what is rational by nature and is called
        intellectual. The other is placed in what is rational by participation,
        that is, in the appetitive part of the soul, and is called moral.
        Therefore, he says, we call some of the virtues intellectual and some
        moral. Wisdom, understanding and prudence are said to be intellectual
        virtues, while liberality and sobriety are called moral.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        244. He proves this point from human praises. When we wish to praise
        someone for good morals, we do not describe him as wise and intelligent,
        but as sober and mild-tempered. We do not praise a man for good morals
        alone but also for the habit of wisdom. Praiseworthy habits are called
        virtues. Therefore, besides the moral virtues, there are also
        intellectual virtues like wisdom, understanding, and some others of this
        kind. Thus ends the first book.
