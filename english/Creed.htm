        <span style="font-weight: bold">What Is Faith?</span><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        The Nature and Effects of Faith.—The first thing that is necessary for
        every Christian is faith, without which no one is truly called a
        faithful Christian. Faith brings about four good effects. The first is
        that through faith the soul is united to God, and by it there is between
        the soul and God a union akin to marriage. “I will espouse you in faith”
        [Hosea 2:20]. When a man is baptized the first question that is asked
        him is: “Do you believe in God?” This is because Baptism is the first
        Sacrament of faith. Hence, the Lord said: “He who believes and is
        baptized shall be saved” [Mk 16:16].Baptism without faith is of no
        value. Indeed, it must be known that no one is acceptable before God
        unless he have faith. “Without faith it is impossible to please God”[Heb
        11:6]. St. Augustine explains these words of St. Paul, “All that is not
        of faith is sin” [Rom 14:23], in this way: “Where there is no knowledge
        of the eternal and unchanging Truth, virtue even in the midst of the
        best moral life is false.”<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        The second effect of faith is that eternal life is already begun in us;
        for eternal life is nothing else than knowing God. This the Lord
        announced when He said: “This is eternal life, that they may know you,
        the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you sent.” [Jn 17:3].This
        knowledge of God begins here through faith, but it is perfected the
        future life when we shall know God as He is. Therefore, St. Paul says:
        “Faith is the substance of things to be hoped for” [Heb 11:1].No one
        then can arrive at perfect happiness of heaven, which is the true
        knowledge of God, unless first he knows God through faith. “Blessed are
        they who have not seen and have believed” [Jn 20:29].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        The third good that comes from faith is that right direction which it
        gives to our present life. Now, in order that one live a good life, it
        is necessary that he know what is necessary to live rightly; and if he
        depends for all this required knowledge on his own efforts alone, either
        he will never attain such knowledge, or if so, only after a long time.
        But faith teaches us all that is necessary to live a good life. It
        teaches us that there is one God who is the rewarder of good and the
        punisher of evil; that there is a life other than this one, and other
        like truths whereby we are attracted to live rightly and to avoid what
        evil. “The just man lives by faith”[Hab 2:4]. This is evident in that no
        one of the philosophers before the coming of Christ could, through his
        own powers, know God and the means necessary for salvation as well as
        any old woman since Christ’s coming knows Him through faith. And,
        therefore, it is said in Isaiah that “the earth is filled with the
        knowledge of the Lord” [11:9].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        The fourth effect of faith is that by it we overcome temptations: “The
        holy ones by faith conquered kingdoms” [Heb 11:33]. We know that every
        temptation is either from the world or the flesh or the devil. The devil
        would have us disobey God and not be subject to Him. This is removed by
        faith, since through it we know that He is the Lord of all things and
        must therefore be obeyed. “Your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion,
        goes about seeking whom he may devour. Resist him, strong in faith” [1
        Pet 5:8].The world tempts us either by attaching us to it in prosperity,
        or by filling us with fear of adversity. But faith overcomes this in
        that we believe in a life to come better than this one, and hence we
        despise the riches of this world and we are not terrified in the face of
        adversity. “This is the victory which overcomes the world: our faith” [1
        Jn 5:4].The flesh, however, tempts us by attracting us to the swiftly
        passing pleasures of this present life. But faith shows us that, if we
        cling to these things inordinately, we shall lose eternal joys. “In all
        things taking the shield of faith” [Eph 6:16].We see from this that it
        is very necessary to have faith.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        “The Evidence of Things that Appear Not.”—But someone will say that it
        is foolish to believe what is not seen, and that one should not believe
        in things that he cannot see. I answer by saying that the imperfect
        nature of our intellect takes away the basis of this difficulty. For if
        man of himself could in a perfect manner know all things visible and
        invisible, it would indeed be foolish to believe what he does not see.
        But our manner of knowing is so weak that no philosopher could perfectly
        investigate the nature of even one little fly. We even read that a
        certain philosopher spent thirty years in solitude in order to know the
        nature of the bee. If, therefore, our intellect is so weak, it is
        foolish to be willing to believe concerning God only that which man can
        know by himself alone. And against this is the word of Job: “Behold, God
        is great, exceeding our knowledge” [Job 36:26]. One can also answer this
        question by supposing that a certain master had said something
        concerning his own special branch of knowledge, and some uneducated
        person would contradict him for no other reason than that he could not
        understand what the master said! Such a person would be considered very
        foolish. So, the intellect of the Angels as greatly exceeds the
        intellect of the greatest philosopher as much as that of the greatest
        philosopher exceeds the intellect of the uneducated man. Therefore, the
        philosopher is foolish if he refuses to believe what an Angel says, and
        far greater fool to refuse to believe what God says. Against such are
        these words: “For many things are shown to you above the understanding
        of men” [Sir 3:25].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, again, if one were willing to believe only those things which one
        knows with certitude, one could not live in this world. How could one
        live unless one believed others? How could one know that this man is
        one’s own father? Therefore, it is necessary that one believe others in
        matters which one cannot know perfectly for oneself. But no one is so
        worthy of belief as is God, and hence they who do not believe the words
        of faith are not wise, but foolish and proud. As the Apostle says: “He
        is proud, knowing nothing” [1 Tim 6:4].And also: “I know whom I have
        believed; and I am certain” [2 Tim 1:12].And it is written: “You who
        fear the Lord, believe Him and your reward shall not be made void” [Sir
        2:8].Finally, one can say also that God proves the truth of the things
        which faith teaches. Thus, if a king sends letters signed with his seal,
        no one would dare to say that those letters did not represent the will
        of the king. In like manner, everything that the Saints believed and
        handed down to us concerning the faith of Christ is signed with the seal
        of God. This seal consists of those works which no mere creature could
        accomplish; they are the miracles by which Christ confirmed the sayings
        of the apostles and of the Saints.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        If, however, you would say that no one has witnessed these miracles, I
        would reply in this manner. It is a fact that the entire world
        worshipped idols and that the faith of Christ was persecuted, as the
        histories of the pagans also testify. But now all are turned to
        Christ—wise men and noble and rich—converted by the words of the poor
        and simple preachers of Christ. Now, this fact was either miracle or it
        was not. If it is miraculous, you have what you asked for, a visible
        fact; if it is not, then there could not be a greater miracle than that
        the whole world should have been converted without miracles. And we need
        go no further. We are more certain, therefore, in believing the things
        of faith than those things which can be seen, because God’s knowledge
        never deceives us, but the visible sense of man is often in error.<br />

        ><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Among all the truths which the faithful must believe, this is the first—
        that there is one God. We must see that God means the ruler and provider
        of all things. He, therefore, believes in God who believes that
        everything in this world is governed and provided for by Him. He who
        would believe that all things come into being by chance does not believe
        that there is a God. No one is so foolish as to deny that all nature,
        which operates with a certain definite time and order, is subject to the
        rule and foresight and an orderly arrangement of someone. We see how the
        sun, the moon, and the stars, and all natural things follow a determined
        course, which would be impossible if they were merely products of
        chance. Hence, as is spoken of in the Psalm, he is indeed foolish who
        does not believe in God: “The fool said in his heart: There is no God”
        [Ps 13:1].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        There are those, however, who believe that God rules and sustains all
        things of nature, and nevertheless do not believe God is the overseer of
        the acts of man; hence they believe that human acts do not come under
        God’s providence. They reason thus because they see in this world how
        the good are afflicted and how the evil enjoy good things, so that
        Divine Providence seems to disregard human affairs. Hence the words of
        Job are offered to apply to this view: “He does not consider our things;
        and He walks about the poles of heaven” [22:14]. But this is indeed
        absurd. It is just as though a person who is ignorant of medicine should
        see a doctor give water to one patient and wine to another. He would
        believe that this is mere chance, since he does not understand the
        science of medicine which for good reasons prescribes for one wine and
        for another water. So is it with God. For God in His just and wise
        Providence knows what is good and necessary for men; and hence He
        afflicts some who are good and allows certain wicked men to prosper. But
        he is foolish indeed who believes this is due to chance, because he does
        not know the causes and method of God’s dealing with men. “I wish that
        God might speak with you, and would open His lips to you, that He might
        show you the secrets of wisdom, and that His law is manifold: and you
        might understand that He exacts much less of you than your iniquity
        deserves” [Job 11:5-6].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        We must, therefore, firmly believe that God governs and regulates not
        only all nature, but also the actions of men. “And they said: The Lord
        shall not see; neither shall the God of Jacob understand. Understand, ye
        senseless among the people, and, you fools, be wise at last. He who
        planted the ear, shall He not hear, He who formed the eye, does He not
        consider?... The Lord knows the thoughts of men” [Ps 93:7-11]. God sees
        all things, both our thoughts and the hidden desires of our will. Thus,
        the necessity of doing good is especially imposed on man since all his
        thoughts, words and actions are known in the sight of God: “All things
        are naked and open to His eyes” [Heb 4:13].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe that God who rules and regulates all things is but one God.
        This is seen in that wherever the regulation of human affairs is well
        arranged, there the group is found to be ruled and provided for by one,
        not many. For a number of heads often brings dissension in their
        subjects. But since divine government exceeds in every way that which is
        merely human, it is evident that the government of the world is not by
        many gods, but by one only.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Motives for believing in many gods</span
        ><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        There are four motives which have led men to believe in a number of
        gods:<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        (1) The dullness of the human intellect. Dull men, not capable of going
        beyond sensible things, did not believe anything existed except physical
        bodies. Hence, they held that the world is disposed and ruled by those
        bodies which to them seemed most beautiful and most valuable in this
        world. And, accordingly, to things such as the sun, the moon and the
        stars, they attributed and gave a divine worship. Such men are like to
        one who, going to a royal court to see the king, believes that whoever
        is sumptuously dressed or of official position is the king! “They have
        imagined either the sun and moon or the circle of the stars... to be the
        gods that rule the world. With whose beauty, if they being delighted,
        took them to be gods...” [Wis 7:2-3].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        (2) The second motive was human adulation. Some men, wishing to fawn
        upon kings and rulers, obey and subject themselves to them and show them
        honor which is due to God alone. After the death of these rulers,
        sometimes men make them gods, and sometimes this is done even whilst
        they are living. “That every nation may know that Nabuchodonosor is god
        of the earth, and besides him there is no other” [Judith 5:29].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        (3) The human affection for sons and relatives was a third motive. Some,
        because of the excessive love which they had for their family, caused
        statues of them to be erected after their death, and gradually a divine
        honor was attached to these statues. “For men serving either their
        affections or their kings, gave the incommunicable Name to stones and
        wood” [Wis 14:21].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        (4) The last motive is the malice of the devil. The devil wished from
        the beginning to be equal to God, and thus he said: “I will ascend above
        the height of the clouds. I will be like the Most High” [Is 14:14].The
        devil still entertains this desire. His entire purpose is to bring about
        that man adore him and offer sacrifices to him; not that he takes
        delight in a dog or cat that is offered to him, he does relish the fact
        that thereby irreverence is shown to God. Thus, he spoke to Christ: “All
        these will I give you, if you fall down and adore me” [Mt 4:9].For this
        reason those demons who entered into idols said that they would be
        venerated as gods. “All the gods of the Gentiles are demons” [Ps
        105:5].“The things which the heathens sacrifice, they sacrifice to
        devils, and not to God” [1 Cor 10:20].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Although all this is terrible to contemplate, yet at times there are any
        who fall into these above-mentioned four causes. Not by their words and
        hearts, but by their actions, they show that they believe in many gods.
        Thus, those who believe that the celestial bodies influence the will of
        man and regulate their affairs by astrology, really make the heavenly
        bodies gods, and subject themselves to them. “Be not afraid of the signs
        of heaven which the heathens fear. For the laws of the people are vain”
        [Jer 10:2-3].In the same category are all those who obey temporal rulers
        more than God, in that which they ought not; such actually set these up
        as gods. “We ought to obey God rather than men” [Acts 5:29]. So also
        those who love their sons and kinsfolk more than God show by their
        actions that they believe in many gods; as likewise do those who love
        food more than God: “Whose god is their belly” [Phil 3:19]. Moreover,
        all who take part in magic or in incantations believe that the demons
        are gods, because they seek from the devil that which God alone can
        give, such as revealing the future or discovering hidden things. We
        must, therefore, believe that there is but one God.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        It has been shown that we must first of all believe there is but one
        God. Now, the second is that this God is the Creator and maker of heaven
        and earth, of all things visible and invisible. Let us leave more subtle
        reasons for the present and show by a simple example that all things are
        created and made by God. If a person, upon entering a certain house,
        should feel-a warmth at the door of the house, and going within should
        feel a greater warmth, and so on the more he went into its interior, he
        would believe that somewhere within was a fire, even if he did not see
        the fire itself which caused this heat which he felt. So also is it when
        we consider the things of this world. For one finds all things arranged
        in different degrees of beauty and worth, and the closer things approach
        to God, the more beautiful and better they are found to be. Thus, the
        heavenly bodies are more beautiful and nobler than those which are below
        them; and, likewise, the invisible things in relation to the visible.
        Therefore, it must be seen that all these things proceed from one God
        who gives His being and beauty to each and everything. “All men are
        vain, in whom there is not the knowledge of God: and who by these good
        things that are seen could not understand Him that is. Neither by
        attending to the works have acknowledged who was the workman.... For by
        the greatness of the beauty, and of the creature, the creator of them
        may be seen, so as to be known thereby” [Wis 13:1,5]. Thus, therefore,
        it is certain for us that all things in the world are from God.<br />
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Errors</span><br /></p>
      <p>
        There are three errors concerning this truth which we must avoid. First,
        the error of the Manicheans, who say that all visible created things are
        from the devil, and only the invisible creation is to be attributed to
        God. The cause of this error is that they hold that God is the highest
        good, which is true; but they also assert that whatsoever comes from
        good is itself good. Thus, not distinguishing what is evil and what is
        good, they believed that whatever is partly evil is essentially evil—as,
        for instance, fire because it burns is essentially evil, and so is water
        because it causes suffocation, and so with other things. Because no
        sensible thing is essentially good, but mixed with evil and defective,
        they believed that all visible things are not made by God who is good,
        but by the evil one. Against them St. Augustine gives this illustration.
        A certain man entered the shop of a carpenter and found tools which, if
        he should fall against them, would seriously wound him. Now, if he would
        consider the carpenter a bad workman because he made and used such
        tools, it would be stupid of him indeed. In the same way it is absurd to
        say that created things are evil because they may be harmful; for what
        is harmful to one may be useful to another. This error is contrary to
        the faith of the Church, and against it we say: “Of all things visible
        and invisible” [Nicene Creed].“In the beginning God created heaven and
        earth” [Gen 1:1]. “All things were made by Him” [Jn 1:3].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        The second error is of those who hold the world has existed from
        eternity: “Since the time that the fathers slept, all things continue as
        they were from the beginning of the creation” [2 Pet 3:4].They are led
        to this view because they do not know how to imagine the beginning of
        the world. They are, says Rabbi Moses, in like case to a boy who
        immediately upon his birth was placed upon an island, and remained
        ignorant of the manner of child-bearing and of infants’ birth. thus,
        when he grew up, if one should explain all these things to him, he would
        not believe how a man could once have been in his mother’s womb. So also
        those who consider the world as it is now, do not believe that it had a
        beginning. This is also contrary to the faith of the Church, and hence
        we say: “the Maker of heaven and earth.” For if they were made, they did
        not exist forever. “He spoke and they were made” [Ps 148:5 ].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        The third is the error which holds that God made the world from
        pre-existing matter (<i>ex praejacenti materia</i>). They are led to
        this view because they wish to measure divine power according to human
        power; and since man cannot make anything except from material which
        already lies at hand, so also it must be with God. But this is false.
        Man needs matter to make anything, because he is a builder of particular
        things and must bring form out of definite material. He merely
        determines the form of his work, and can be only the cause of the form
        that he builds. God, however, is the universal cause of all things, and
        He not only creates the form but also the matter. Hence, He makes out of
        nothing, and thus it is said in the Creed: “the Creator of heaven and
        earth.” We must see in this the difference between making and creating.
        To create is to make something out of nothing; and if everything were
        destroyed, He could again make all things. He, thus, makes the blind to
        see, raises up the dead, and works other similar miracles. “Your power
        is at hand when You will” [Wis 12:18].<br />
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Benefits</span><br /></p>
      <p>
        From a consideration of all this, one is led to a fivefold benefit. (1)
        We are led to a knowledge of the divine majesty. Now, if a maker is
        greater than the things he makes, then God is greater than all things
        which He has made. “With whose beauty, if they being delighted, took
        them to be gods, let them know how much the Lord of them is more
        beautiful than they... Or if they admired their power and their effects,
        let them understand by them that He that made them, is mightier than
        they” [Wis 13:3-4]. Hence, whatsoever can even be affirmed or thought of
        is less than God. “Behold: God is great, exceeding our knowledge” [Job
        36:26].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        (2) We are led to give thanks to God. Because God is the Creator of all
        things, it is certain that what we are and what we have is from God:
        “What do you have that you did not receive?” [1 Cor 4:7]. “The earth is
        the Lord’s and the fullness thereof; the world and all who dwell on it”
        [Ps 23:1]. “We, therefore, must give thanks to God: What shall I render
        to the Lord for all the things that He has done for me?” [Ps 115:12].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        (3) We are led to bear our troubles in patience. Although every created
        thing is from God and is good according to its nature, yet, if something
        harms us or brings us pain, we believe that such comes from God, not as
        a fault in Him, but because God permits no evil that is not for good.
        Affliction purifies from sin, brings low the guilty, and urges on the
        good to a love of God: “If we have received good things from the hand of
        God, why should we not receive evil?” [Job 2:10].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        (4) We are led to a right use of created things. Thus, we ought to use
        created things as having been made by God for two purposes: for His
        glory, “since all things are made for Himself” [Prov 16:4] (that is, for
        the glory of God), and finally for our profit: “Which the Lord your God
        created for the service of all the nations” [Deut 4:19]. Thus, we ought
        to use things for God’s glory in order to please Him no less than for
        our own profit, that is, so as to avoid sin in using them: All things
        are yours, and we have given you what we received of your hand” [1 Chron
        29:14]. Whatever we have, be it learning or beauty, we must revere all
        and use all for the glory of God.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        (5) We are led also to acknowledge the great dignity of man. God made
        all things for man: “You subjected all things under his feet” [Ps 8:8],
        and man is more like to God than all other creatures save the Angels:
        “Let us make man to Our image and likeness” [Gen 1:26]. God does not say
        this of the heavens or of the stars, but of man; and this likeness of
        God in man does not refer to the body but to the human soul, which has
        free will and is incorruptible, and therein man resembles God more than
        other creatures do. We ought, therefore, to consider the nobleness of
        man as less than the Angels but greater than all other creatures. Let us
        not, therefore, diminish his dignity by sin and by an inordinate desire
        for earthly things which are beneath us and are made for our service.
        Accordingly, we must rule over things of the earth and use them, and be
        subject to God by obeying and serving Him. And thus we shall come to he
        enjoyment of God forever.<br />

        It is not only necessary for Christians to believe in one God who is the
        Creator of heaven and earth and of all things; but also they must
        believe that God is the Father and that Christ is the true Son of God.
        This, as St. Peter says, is not mere fable, but is certain and proved by
        the word of God on the Mount of Transfiguration. “For we have not by
        following artificial fables made known to you the power and presence of
        our Lord Jesus Christ; but we were eyewitnesses of His greatness. For He
        received from God the Father honor and glory, this voice coming down to
        Him from the excellent glory: ‘This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well
        pleased. Listen to Him.’ And this voice, we heard brought from heaven,
        when we were with Him in the holy mount” [2 Pet 1:16]. Christ Jesus
        Himself in many places called God His Father, and Himself the Son of
        God. Both the Apostles and the Fathers placed in the articles of faith
        that Christ is the Son of God by saying: “And (I believe) in Jesus
        Christ, His (i.e., God’s) only Son”.<br />
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Errors</span><br /></p>
      <p>
        There were, however, certain heretics who erred in this belief.
        Photinus, for instance, believed that Christ is not the Son of God but a
        good man who, by a good life and by doing the will of God, merited to be
        called the son of God by adoption; and so Christ who lived a good life
        and did the will of God merited to be called the son of God. Moreover,
        this error would not have Christ living before the Blessed Virgin, but
        would have Him begin to exist only at His conception. Accordingly, there
        are here two errors: the first, that Christ is not the true Son of God
        according to His nature; and the second, that Christ in His entire being
        began to exist in time. Our faith, however, holds that He is the Son of
        God in His nature, and that he is from all eternity. Now, we have
        definite authority against these errors in the Holy Scriptures, Against
        the first error it is said that Christ is not only the Son, but also the
        only-begotten Son of the Father: “The only begotten Son who is in the
        bosom of the Father, He has declared Him:” [Jn 1:18]. And again the
        second error it is said: “Before Abraham was made, I AM” [Jn 8:58]. It
        is evident that Abraham lived before the Blessed Virgin. And what the
        Fathers added to the other [Nicene] Creed, namely, “the only-begotten
        Son of God,” is against the first error; and “born of the Father before
        all ages” is against the second error.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Sabellius said that Christ indeed was before the Blessed Virgin, but he
        held that the Father Himself became incarnate and, therefore, the Father
        and the Son is the same Person. This is an error because it takes away
        the Trinity of Persons in God, and against it is this authority: “I am
        not alone, but I and the Father who sent Me” [Jn 8:16]. It is clear that
        one cannot be sent from himself. Sabellius errs therefore, and in the
        [Nicene] Creed of the Fathers it is said: “God of God; Light of Light,”
        that is, we are to believe in God the Son from God the Father, and the
        Son who is Light from the Father who is Light.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Arius, although he would say that Christ was before the Blessed Virgin
        and that the Person of the Father is other than the Person of the Son,
        nevertheless made a three-fold attribution to Christ: (1) that the Son
        of God was a creature; (2) that He is not from eternity, but was formed
        the noblest of all creatures in time by God; (3) that God the Son is not
        of one nature with God the Father, and therefore that He was not true
        God. But this too is erroneous and contrary to the teaching of the Holy
        Scriptures. It is written: “I and the Father are one” [Jn 10:30]. That
        is, in nature; and therefore, just as the Father always existed, so also
        the Son; and just as the Father is true God, so also is the Son. That
        Christ is a creature, as said by Arius, is contradicted in the “Symbol”
        by the Fathers: “True God of true God;” and the assertion that Christ is
        not from eternity but in time is also contrary to the [Nicene] Creed:
        “Begotten not made;” and finally, that Christ is not of the same
        substance as the Father is denied by the [Nicene] Creed: “Consubstantial
        with the Father.”<br />
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold">The truth</span><br /></p>
      <p>
        It is, therefore, clear we must believe that Christ is the Only-begotten
        of God, and the true Son of God, who always was with the Father, and
        that there is one Person of the Son and another of the Father who have
        the same divine nature. All this we believe now through faith, but we
        shall know it with a perfect vision in the life eternal. Hence, we shall
        now speak somewhat of this for our own edification.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        It must be known that different things have different modes of
        generation. The generation of God is different from that of other
        things. Hence, we cannot arrive at a notion of divine generation except
        through the generation of that created thing which more closely
        approaches to a likeness to God. We have seen that nothing approaches in
        likeness to God more than the human soul. The manner of generation in
        the soul is effected in the thinking process in the soul of man, which
        is called a conceiving of the intellect. This conception takes its rise
        in the soul as from a father, and its effect is called the word of the
        intellect or of man. In brief, the soul by its act of thinking begets
        the word. So also the Son of God is the Word of God, not like a word
        that is uttered exteriorly (for this is transitory), but as a word is
        interiorly conceived; and this Word of God is of the one nature as God
        and equal to God.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        The testimony of St. John concerning the Word of God destroys these
        three heresies, viz., that of Photinus in the words: “In the beginning
        was the Word;” that of Sabellius in saying: “And the Word was with God;”
        and that of Arius when it says: “And the Word was God” [Jn 1:1].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        But a word in us is not the same as the Word in God. In us the word is
        an accident; whereas in God the Word is the same as God, since there is
        nothing in God that is not of the essence of God. No one would say God
        has not a Word, because such would make God wholly without knowledge;
        and therefore, as God always existed, so also did His Word ever exist.
        Just as a sculptor works from a form which he has previously thought
        out, which is his word; so also God makes all things by His Word, as it
        were through His art: “All things were made by Him” [Jn 1:3].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, if the Word of God is the Son of God and all the words of God bear
        a certain likeness of this Word, then we ought to hear the Word of God
        gladly; for such is a sign that we love God. We ought also believe the
        word of God whereby the Word of God dwells in us, who is Christ: “That
        Christ may dwell by faith in your hearts” [Eph 3:17]. “And you have not
        His word abiding in you” [Jn 5:38]. But we ought not only to believe
        that the Word of God dwells in us, but also we should meditate often
        upon this; for otherwise we will not be benefitted to the extent that
        such meditation is a great help against sin: your words have I hidden in
        my heart, that I may not sin against You” [Ps 108:11]. Again it is said
        of the just man: “On His law he shall meditate day and night” [Ps 1:2].
        And it is said of the Blessed Virgin that she “kept all these words,
        pondering them in her heart” [Lk 2:19]. Then also, one should
        communicate the word of God to others by advising, preaching and
        inflaming their hearts: “Let no evil speech proceed from your mouth; but
        that which is good, to the edification of faith” [Eph 4:29]. Likewise,
        “let the word of Christ dwell in you abundantly in all wisdom, teaching
        and admonishing one another” [Col 3:16]. So also: “Preach the word; be
        instant in season, out of season; reprove, entreat, rebuke in all
        patience and doctrine” [2 Tim 4:2]. Finally, we ought to put the word of
        God into practice: “Be doers of the word and not hearers only, deceiving
        yourselves” [James 1:22].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        The Blessed Virgin observed these five points when she gave birth to the
        Word of God. First, she heard what was said to her: “The Holy Spirit
        shall come upon you” [Lk 1:35]. Then she gave her consent through faith:
        “Behold the handmaid of the Lord” [Lk 1:38]. And she also received and
        carried the Word in her womb. Then she brought forth the Word of God
        and, finally, she nourished and cared for Him. And so the Church sings:
        “Only a Virgin nourished Him who is King of the Angels” [Fourth
        Responsory, Office of the Circumcision, Dominican Breviary.].<br />

      </p>
      <p>
        The Christian must not only believe in the Son of God, as we have seen,
        but also in His Incarnation. St. John, after having written of things
        subtle and difficult to understand, points out the Incarnation to us
        when he says: “And the Word was made flesh” [Jn 1:14]. Now, in order
        that we may understand something of this, I give two illustrations at
        the outset.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        It is clear that there is nothing more like the Word of God than the
        word which is conceived in our mind but not spoken. Now, no one knows
        this interior word in our mind except the one who conceives it, and then
        it is known to others only when it is pronounced. So also as long as the
        Word of God was in the heart of the Father, it was not known except by
        the Father Himself; but when the Word assumed flesh—as a word becomes
        audible—then was It first made manifest and known. “Afterwards He was
        seen upon earth and conversed with men” [Baruch 3:38]. Another example
        is that, although the spoken word is known through hearing, yet it is
        neither seen nor touched, unless it is written on paper. So also the
        Word of God was made both visible and tangible when He became flesh. And
        as the paper upon which the word of a king is written is called the word
        of the king, so also Man to whom the Word of God is conjoined in one
        “hypostasis”. is called the Son of God. “Take a great book and write in
        it with a man’s pen” [Is 7:1]. Therefore, the holy Apostles affirmed:
        “Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary.”<br />
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Errors</span><br /></p>
      <p>
        On this point there arose many errors; and the holy Fathers at the
        Council of Nicea added in that other Creed a number of things which
        suppress all these errors.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Origen said that Christ was born and came into the world to save even
        the devils, and, therefore, at the end of the world all the demons will
        be saved. But this is contrary to the Holy Scripture: Depart from Me,
        you cursed, into everlasting fire which was prepared for the devil and
        his angels” [Mt 25:41]. Consequently, to remove this error they added in
        the Creed: “Who for us men (not for the devils) and for our salvation,
        came down from heaven.” In this the love of God for us is made more
        apparent.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Photinus would have Christ born of the Blessed Virgin, but added that He
        was a mere man who by a good life in doing the will of God merited to
        become the son of God even as other holy men. This, too, is denied by
        this saying of John: “I came down from heaven, not to do My own will but
        the will of Him who sent Me” [Jn 6:38]. Now if Christ were not in
        heaven, He would not have descended from heaven, and were He a mere man,
        He would not have been in heaven. Hence, it is said in the Nicene Creed:
        “He came down from heaven.”<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Manichaeus, however, said that Christ was always the Son of God and He
        descended from heaven, but He was not actually but only in appearance
        clothed in true flesh. But this is false, because it is not worthy of
        the Teacher of Truth to have anything to do with what is false, and just
        as He showed His physical Body, so it was really His: “Handle, and see;
        for a spirit does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have” [Lk
        24:39]. To remove this error, therefore, they added: “And He was
        incarnate.”<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Ebion, who was a Jew, said that Christ was born of the Blessed Virgin in
        the ordinary human way. But this is false, for the Angel said of Mary:
        “That which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit” [Mt 1:20]. And
        the holy Fathers to destroy this error, added: “By the Holy Spirit.”<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Valentinus believed that Christ was conceived by the Holy Spirit, but
        would have the Holy Spirit deposit a heavenly body in the Blessed
        Virgin, so that she contributed nothing to Christ’s birth except to
        furnish a place for Him. Thus, he said, this Body appeared by means of
        the Blessed Virgin, as though she were a channel. This is a great error,
        for the Angel said: “And therefore also the Holy One which shall be born
        of you shall be called the Son of God” [Lk 1:35]. And the Apostle adds:
        “But when the fullness of time was come, God sent His Son, made of a
        woman” [Gal 4:4]. Hence the Creed says: “Born of the Virgin Mary.”<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Arius and Apollinarius held that, although Christ was the Word of God
        and was born of the Virgin Mary, nevertheless He did not have a soul,
        but in place of the soul was His divinity. This is contrary to the
        Scripture, for Christ says: “Now is My soul troubled” [Jn 12:27]. And
        again: “My soul is sorrowful even unto death” [Mt 26:38]. For this
        reason the Fathers added: “And was made man.” Now, man is made up of
        body and soul. Christ had all that a true man has save sin. All the
        above-mentioned errors and all others that can be offered are destroyed
        by this, that He was made man. The error of Eutyches particularly is
        destroyed by it. He held that, by a commixture of the divine nature of
        Christ with the human, He was neither purely divine nor purely human.
        This is not true, because by it Christ would not be a man. And so it is
        said: “He was made man.” This destroys also the error of Nestorius, who
        said that the Son of God only by an indwelling was united to man. This,
        too, is false, because by this Christ would not be man but only in a
        man, and that He became man is clear from these words: “He was in habit
        found as man” [Phil 2:7]. “But now you seek to kill Me, a man who have
        spoken the truth to you, which I have heard of God” [Jn 8:40].<br />
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Lessons</span><br /></p>
      <p>We can learn something from all this:<br /></p>
      <p>
        (1) Our faith is strengthened. If, for instance, someone should tell us
        about a certain foreign land which he himself had never seen, we would
        not believe him to the extent we would if he had been there. Now, before
        Christ came into the world, the Patriarchs and Prophets and John the
        Baptist told something of God; but men did not believe them as they
        believed Christ, who was with God, nay more, was one with God. Hence,
        far more firm is our faith in what is given us by Christ Himself: “No
        one has ever seen God; the only-begotten Son who is in the bosom of the
        Father, He has declared Him” [Jn 1:18]. Thus, many mysteries of our
        faith which before the coming of Christ were hidden from us, are now
        made clear.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        (2) Our hope is raised up. It is certain that the Son of Man did not
        come to us, assuming our flesh, for any trivial cause, but for our
        exceeding great advantage. For He made as it were a trade with us,
        assuming a living body and deigning to be born of the Virgin, in order
        to grant us His divinity. [Cf. Mass prayer at mixing of water and wine].
        And thus He became man that He might make man divine.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        (3) Our charity is enkindled. There is no proof of divine charity so
        clear as that God, the Creator of all things, is made a creature; that
        Our Lord is become our brother, and that the Son of God is made the Son
        of man: “For God so loved the world as to give His only-begotten Son”
        [Jn 3:16]. Therefore, upon consideration of this our love for God ought
        to be re-ignited and burst into flame.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        (4) This induces us to keep our souls pure. Our nature was exalted and
        ennobled by its union with God to the extent of being assumed into union
        with a Divine Person.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Indeed, after the Incarnation the Angel would not permit St. John to
        adore him, although he allowed this to be done before by even the
        greatest patriarchs [Rev 22:8]. Therefore, one who reflects on this
        exaltation of his nature and is ever conscious of it, should scorn to
        cheapen and lower himself and his nature by sin. Thus, says St. Peter:
        “By these He has given us most great and precious promises; that by them
        you may be made partakers of the divine nature; flying the corruption of
        that concupiscence which is in the world” [2 Pet 1:4].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, by consideration of all this, our desire to come to Christ is
        intensified. If a king had a brother who was away from him a long
        distance, that brother would desire to come to the king to see, to be
        with him and to abide with him. So also Christ is our brother, and we
        should desire to be with Him and to be united to Him. “Wherever the body
        shall be, there shall the eagles also gathered together” [Mt 24:28]. The
        Apostle desired “to be dissolved and be with Christ” [Phil 1:23]. And it
        is this desire which grows in us as we meditate upon the Incarnation of
        Christ.<br />

          buried.”</span

      </p>
      <p>
        It is just as necessary for the Christian to believe in the passion and
        death of the Son of God as it is to believe in His Incarnation. For, as
        St. Gregory says, “there would have been no advantage in His having been
        born for us unless we had profited by His Redemption.” That Christ died
        for us is so tremendous a fact that our intellect can scarcely grasp it;
        for in no way does it fall in the natural way of our understanding. This
        is what the Apostle says: “I work in your days, a work which you will
        not believe, if any man shall tell it to you” [Acts 13:41, from Hab
        1:5]. The grace of God is so great and His love for us is such that we
        cannot understand what He has done for us. Now, we must believe that,
        although Christ suffered death, yet His Godhead did not die; it was the
        human nature in Christ that died. For He did not die as God, but as
        man.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        This will be clear from two examples, one of which is taken from
        himself. Now, when a man dies, in the separation of the soul from the
        body the soul does not die but the body or flesh does die. So also in
        the death of Christ, His Divinity did not die, but His man nature
        suffered death. But if the Jews did not slay the Divinity of Christ, it
        would seem that their sin was not any greater than if they killed any
        ordinary man. In answering this we say that it is as if a king were
        clothed only in one garment, and if someone befouled this garment, such
        a one has committed as grave a crime as if he had defiled the king
        himself. Likewise, although the Jews could not slay God, yet in putting
        to death the human nature which Christ assumed, they were as severely
        punished as if they had put the Godhead itself to death. Another example
        is had from what we said before, viz., that the Son of God is the Word
        of God, and the Word of God made flesh is like the word of a king
        written on paper. So if one should tear this royal paper in pieces, it
        would be considered that he had rent apart the word of the king. Thus,
        the sin of the Jews was as grievous as if they had slain the Word of
        God.<br />
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Why?</span><br /></p>
      <p>
        But what need was there that the Son of God should suffer for us? There
        was a great need; and indeed it can be assigned to two reasons. The
        first is that it was a remedy against sin, and the second is for an
        example of what we ought to do. It was a remedy to such an extent that
        in the passion of Christ we find a remedy against all the evils which we
        incur by our sins. And by our sins we incur five different evils.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        The first evil that man incurs by sin is the defilement of his soul.
        Just as virtue gives the soul its beauty, so sin makes it ugly. “How
        happened it, O Israel, that you art in your enemies’ land?... You art
        defiled with the dead” [Baruch 3:10-11]. But all this is taken away by
        the passion of Christ, whereby Christ poured out His blood as a laver
        wherein sinners are cleansed: “Who loved us and washed us from our sins
        in His own blood” [Rev 1:5]. So, too, the soul is washed by the blood of
        Christ in baptism because then a new birth is had in virtue of His
        blood, and hence when one defiles one’s soul by sin, one offers insult
        to Christ and sins more gravely than before one’s baptism. “A man who
        has violated the law of Moses dies without any mercy at the testimony of
        two or three witnesses. How much worse punishment do you think will be
        deserved by one who treads underfoot the Son of God and esteemes the
        blood of the testament unclean!” [Heb 10:28-29].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Secondly, we commit an offense against God. A sensual man loves the
        beauty of the flesh, but God loves spiritual beauty, which is the beauty
        of the soul. When, however, the soul is defiled by sin, God is offended
        and the sinner incurs His hatred: “To God the wicked and his wickedness
        are hateful alike” [Wis 14:9]. This also is removed by the passion of
        Christ, which made satisfaction to God the Father for sin—a thing which
        man of himself could never do. The charity and obedience of Christ in
        His suffering were greater than the sin and disobedience of the first
        man: “When we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of
        His Son” [Rom 5:10].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Thirdly, we have been weakened by sin. When a person sins the first
        time, he believes that he will thereafter keep away from sin, but what
        happens is the very opposite. This is because by that first sin he is
        weakened and made more prone to commit sins, and sin more and more has
        power over him. Such a one, as far as he alone is concerned, has lowered
        himself to such a condition that he cannot rise up, and is like to a man
        who jumps into a well from which, without God’s help, he would never be
        rescued. After the fall of man, our nature was weakened and corrupted,
        and we were made more prone to sin. Christ, however, lessened this
        sickness and weakness, although He did not entirely take it away. So now
        man is strengthened by the passion of Christ, and sin is not given such
        power over him. Moreover, he can rise clean from his sins when aided by
        God’s grace conferred by the Sacraments, which receive their efficacy
        from the passion of Christ: “Our old man is crucified with Him, that the
        body of sin may be destroyed” [Rom 6:6]. Indeed, before the passion of
        Christ few there were who lived without falling into mortal sin; but
        afterwards many have lived and are living without mortal sin.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Fourthly, we incur the punishment due to sin. For the justice of God
        demands that whosoever sins must be punished. This punishment, however,
        is in proportion to the guilt. But the guilt of mortal sin is infinite,
        because it is an offense against the infinite good, namely, God, whose
        commandments the sinner holds in contempt. Therefore, the punishment due
        to mortal sin is infinite. Christ, however, through His passion has
        taken away this punishment from us and borne it Himself: “Who Himself
        bore our sins (that is, the punishment due to sin) in His body upon the
        tree” [1 Pet 2:24]. The passion of Christ was of such value that it
        sufficed to expiate for all the sins of the whole world, even of a
        hundred thousand worlds. And so it is that, when a man is baptized, he
        is released from all his sins; and so also is it that the priest
        forgives sins; and, again, the more one conforms himself to the passion
        of Christ, the greater is the pardon and the grace which he gains.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Fifthly, we incur banishment from the kingdom of heaven. Those who
        offend kings are compelled to go into exile. Thus, man is expelled from
        heaven on account of sin. Adam was driven out of paradise immediately
        after his sin, and the gate of paradise was shut. But Christ by His
        sufferings and death opened this gate and recalled all the exiles to the
        kingdom. With the opening of the side of Christ, the gate of paradise is
        opened; and with the pouring out of His blood, guilt is washed away,
        satisfaction is made to God, infirmity is removed, punishment is
        expiated, and the exiles are called back to the kingdom. Hence, the
        thief received the immediate response: “This day you shall be with Me in
        paradise” [Lk 23:43]. Never before was this spoken to anyone, not to
        Adam, not to Abraham, not to David; but this day (i.e., as soon as the
        gate is opened) the thief, having asked for pardon, received it: “Having
        a confidence in the entering into the holies by the blood of Christ”
        [Heb 10:19].<br />
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Consequences</span><br /></p>
      <p>
        From all this then is seen the effect of the passion of Christ as a
        remedy for sin. But no less does it profit us as an example. St.
        Augustine says that the passion of Christ can bring about a complete
        reformation of our lives. Whoever wishes to live perfectly need do
        nothing other than despise what Christ despised on the cross, and desire
        what Christ desired. There is no virtue that did not have its example on
        the Cross.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        So if you seek an example of charity, then, “greater love than this no
        one has, than to lay down his life for his friends” [Jn 15:13]. And this
        Christ did upon the Cross. If, therefore, He gave His life or us, we
        ought to endure any and all evils for Him: “What shall I render to the
        Lord for all the things that He has done for me?” [Ps 15:12].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        If you seek an example of patience, you will find it in its highest
        degree upon the Cross. Great patience is exemplified in two ways: either
        when one suffers intensely in all patience, or when one suffers that
        which he could avoid if he so wished. Christ suffered greatly upon the
        Cross: “All you who pass by the way, look and see if there is any sorrow
        like My sorrow” [Lam 1:12]. And with all patience, because, “when He
        suffered, He did not threaten” [1 Pet 2:23]. And again: “He shall be led
        as a sheep to the slaughter and shall be dumb before His shearer, and
        shall not open His mouth” [Is 53:7]. He could have avoided this
        suffering, but He did not: “Do you think that I cannot ask My Father,
        and He will give Me presently more than twelve legions of Angels?” [Mt
        26:23]. The patience of Christ upon the cross, therefore, was of the
        highest degree: “Let us run by patience to the fight proposed to us;
        looking on Jesus, the author and finisher of faith, who, having joy set
        before Him endured the cross, despising the shame” [Heb 12:1-2].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        If you seek an example of humility, look upon Him who is crucified;
        although He was God, He chose to be judged by Pontius Pilate and to be
        put to death: “Your cause has been judged as that of the wicked” [Job
        36:17]. Truly “that of the wicked,” because: “Let us condemn Him to a
        most shameful death” [Wis 2:20]. The Lord chose to die for His servant;
        the Life of the Angels suffered death for man: “He humbled Himself,
        becoming obedient unto death, even to the death of the cross” [Phil
        2:8].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        If you seek an example of obedience, imitate Him who was obedient to the
        Father unto death: “For by the disobedience of one man, many were made
        sinners; so also by the obedience of one, many shall be made just” [Rom
        5:19].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        If you seek an example of contempt for earthly things, imitate Him who
        is the King of kings, the Lord of rulers, in whom are all the treasures
        of wisdom; but on the Cross He was stripped naked, ridiculed, spat upon,
        bruised, crowned with thorns, given to drink of vinegar and gall, and
        finally put to death. How falsely, therefore, is one attached to riches
        and raiment, for: “They divided My garments amongst them; and upon My
        robe they cast lots” [Ps 21:19]. How falsely to honors, since “I was
        covered with lashes and insults;” how falsely to positions of power,
        because “taking a crown of thorns, they placed it upon My brow;” how
        falsely to delicacies of the table, for “in My thirst they gave Me to
        drink of vinegar” [Ps 68:22]. Thus, St. Augustine, in commenting on
        these words, “Who, having joy set before Him, endured the Cross
        despising the shame” [Heb 12:2]. says: “The man Christ despised all
        earthly things in order to teach us to despise them.<br />

          >“He Descended to the Underworld. The third day He arose again from
          the dead.”</span
        ><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        The death of Christ was the separation of His soul from His body as it
        is with other men. But the Divinity was so indissolubly conjoined to the
        Man-Christ that although His soul and body were disunited, His Divinity
        was always most perfectly united to both the soul and body. This we have
        seen above. Therefore in the Sepulchre His body was together with the
        Son of God who together with His soul descended to the underworld.<br />
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Why descend?</span><br /></p>
      <p>
        There are four reasons why Christ together with His soul descended to
        the underworld. First, He wished to take upon Himself the entire
        punishment for our sin, and thus atone for its entire guilt. The
        punishment for the sin of man was not alone death of the body, but there
        was also a punishment of the soul, since the soul had its share in sin;
        and it was punished by being deprived of the beatific vision; and as yet
        no atonement had been offered whereby this punishment would be taken
        away. Therefore, before the coming of Christ all men, even the holy
        fathers after their death, descended into the underworld. Accordingly in
        order to take upon Himself most perfectly the punishment due to sinners,
        Christ not only suffered death, but also His soul descended to the
        underworld. He, however, descended for a different cause than did the
        fathers; for they did so out of necessity and were of necessity taken
        there and detained, but Christ descended there of His own power and free
        will: “I am counted among them that go down to the pit; I am become as a
        man without help, free among the dead” [Ps 87:5–Vulgate]. The others
        were there as captives, but Christ was freely there.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        The second reason is that He might perfectly deliver all His friends.
        Christ had His friends both in the world and in the underworld. The
        former were His friends in that they possessed charity; and the latter
        were they who departed this life with charity and faith in the future
        Redeemer, such as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, David, and other just
        and good men. Therefore, since Christ had dwelt among His friends in
        this world and had delivered them by His death, so He wished to visit
        His friends who were detained in the underworld and deliver them also:
        “I will penetrate all the lower parts of the earth, and will behold all
        that hope in the Lord” [Sir 24:45].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        The third reason is that He would completely triumph over the devil.
        Now, a person is perfectly vanquished when he is not only overcome in
        conflict, but also when the assault is carried into his very home, and
        the seat of his kingdom is taken away from him. Thus Christ triumphed
        over the devil, and on the Cross He completely vanquished him: “Now is
        the judgment of this world; now shall the prince of this world (that is,
        the devil) be cast out” [Jn 12:31]. To make this triumph complete,
        Christ wished to deprive the devil of the seat of his kingdom and to
        imprison him in his own house—which is the underworld. Christ,
        therefore, descended there, and despoiled the devil of everything and
        bound him, taking away his prey: “And despoiling the principalities and
        powers, He hath exposed them confidently in open show, triumphing over
        them in Himself” [Col 2:15]. Likewise, Christ who had received the power
        and possession of heaven and earth, desired too the possession of the
        underworld, as says the Apostle: “That in the name of Jesus every knee
        should bow, of those that are in heaven, on earth, and under the earth”
        [Phil 2:10]. “In My name they shall cast out devils” [Mk 16:17].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        The fourth and final reason is that Christ might free the just who were
        in the underworld. For as Christ wished to suffer death to deliver the
        living from death, so also He would descend into the underworld to
        deliver those who were there: “You also by the blood of your testament,
        sent forth your prisoners out of the pit where there is no water” [Zech
        9:11]. And again: “O death, I will be your death; O hell, I will be your
        bite” [Hosea 13:14]. Although Christ wholly overcame death, yet not so
        completely did He destroy the underworld, but, as it were, He bit it. He
        did not free all from the underworld, but those only who were without
        mortal sin. He likewise liberated those without original sin, from which
        they, as individuals, were freed by circumcision; or before [the
        institution of]. circumcision, they who had been saved through their
        parents’ faith (which refers to those who died before having the use of
        reason); or by the sacrifices, and by their faith in the future coming
        of Christ (which refers to adults)”. The reason they were there in the
        underworld is original sin which they had contracted from Adam, and from
        which as members of the human race they could not be delivered except by
        Christ. Therefore, Christ left there those who had descended there with
        mortal sin, and the non-circumcised children. Thus, it is seen that
        Christ descended into the underworld, and for what reasons. Now we may
        gather four considerations from this for our own instruction.<br />
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Considerations</span><br /></p>
      <p>
        (1) A firm hope in God. No matter how much one is afflicted, one ought
        always hope in the assistance of God and have trust in Him. There is
        nothing so serious as to be in the underworld. If, therefore, Christ
        delivered those who were in the underworld, what great confidence ought
        every friend of God have that he will be delivered from all his
        troubles! “She [that is, wisdom] did not forsake the just when he was
        sold, but delivered him from sinners. She went down with him into the
        pit. And in bonds she did not leave him” [Wis 10:13]. God helps in a
        special manner those who serve Him, and hence the servant of God should
        feel secure in Him: “He who fears the Lord shall tremble at nothing and
        shall not be afraid; for He is his hope” [Sir 34:16].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        (2) We ought to conceive a fear of God and avoid all presumption. We
        have already seen that Christ suffered for sinners and descended into
        the underworld for them. However, He did not deliver all sinners, but
        only those who were free from mortal sin. He left there those who
        departed this life in mortal sin. Hence, anyone who descends into hell
        in mortal sin has no hope of deliverance; and he will remain in hell as
        long as the holy fathers remain in paradise, that is, for all eternity:
        “And these shall go into everlasting punishment; but the just, into life
        everlasting” [Mt 25:46].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        (3) We ought to arouse in ourselves a mental anxiety. Since Christ
        descended into the underworld for our salvation, we ought in all care go
        down there in spirit by considering, for instance, its punishments as
        did that holy man, Hezechiah: “I said: In the midst of my days I shall
        go to the gates of the underworld” [Is 38:10]. Indeed, he who during
        this life frequently descends into hell by thinking of it, will not
        easily fall into hell at death; for such meditation keeps one from sin,
        and draws one out of it. We see how men of this world guard themselves
        against wrongdoing because of the temporal punishment; but with how much
        more care ought they avoid the punishment of hell which far exceeds all
        else in its duration, its severity, and its varied nature! “In all your
        works remember your last end, and you shall never sin” [Sir 7:40].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        (4) There comes to us in this an example of love. Christ descended into
        the underworld in order to deliver His own; and so we should go down
        there to rescue our own. They cannot help themselves. Therefore, let us
        deliver those who are in purgatory. He would be very hard-hearted who
        does not come to the aid of a relative who is detained in an earthly
        prison; but much more cruel is he who will not assist a friend who is in
        purgatory, for there is no comparison between the pains of this world
        and of that: “Have pity on me, have pity on me, at least you my friends,
        because the hand of the Lord hath touched me” [Job 19:21]. “It is
        therefore a holy and wholesome thought to pray for the dead, that they
        may be loosed from their sins” [2 Mac 12:46]. We may assist these souls
        in three ways as St. Augustine tells us, viz., through Masses, prayers,
        and almsgiving. St. Gregory adds a fourth, that is, fasting. All this is
        not so amazing, for even in this world a friend can pay a debt for his
        friend; but this applies only to those who are in purgatory.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        We must necessarily know two things: the glory of God and the punishment
        of hell. For being attracted by His glory and made fearful by
        punishments, we take warning and withdraw ourselves from sin. But for us
        to appreciate these facts is very difficult. Thus, it is said of God’s
        glory: “But the things that are in heaven, who shall search out?” [Wis
        9:16]. For those who are worldly minded this is indeed difficult,
        because “he that is of the earth, of the earth he is, and of the earth
        he speaks” [Jn 3:31]; but it is easier for the spiritually minded,
        because, “he who comes from above is above all,” as is said in the same
        place. Accordingly, God descended from heaven and became incarnate to
        teach us heavenly things. Once it was difficult to know about the
        punishments of the underworld: “no one has been known to have returned
        from the underworld” [Wis 2:1], as it is said in the person of the
        wicked. But this cannot be said now, for just as Christ descended from
        heaven to teach us heavenly things, so also He came back from the region
        of the underworld to teach us about it. It is, therefore, necessary that
        we believe not only that Christ was made man, and died, but also that He
        arose again from the dead. Therefore, it is said in the Creed: “The
        third day He arose again from the dead.”<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >Uniqueness of Christ’s resurrection</span
        ><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        We find that many arose from the dead, such as Lazarus [Jn 11:1-44], the
        son of the widow [Lk 7:11-16], and the daughter of the Ruler of the
        synagogue [Mk 5:35-43]. But the resurrection of Christ differed from the
        resurrection of these and of all others in four points.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        (1) Christ’s resurrection differed from that of all others in its cause.
        Those others who arose did so not of their own power, but either by the
        power of Christ or through the prayers of some Saint. Christ, on the
        contrary, arose by His own power, because He was not only Man but also
        God, and the Divinity of the Word was at no time separated either from
        His soul or from His body. Therefore, His body could, whenever He
        desired, take again the soul, and His soul the body: “I lay down My
        life, that I may take it again.... And I have power to lay it down; and
        I have power to take it up again” [Jn 10:18]. Christ truly died, but not
        because of weakness or of necessity but rather of His own will entirely
        and by His own power. This is seen in that moment when He yielded up the
        Spirit; He cried out with a loud voice [Mt 27:50], which could not be
        true of others at the moment of dying, because they die out of
        weakness... For this the centurion said: “Indeed, this was the Son of
        God” [Mt 27:54]. By that same power whereby He gave up His soul, He
        received it again; and hence the Creed says, “He arose again,” because
        He was not raised up as if by anyone else. “I have slept and have taken
        My rest; and I have risen up” [Ps 3:6]. Nor can this be contrary to
        these words, “This Jesus God raised again” [Acts 2:32], because both the
        Father and the Son raised Him up, since one and the same power is of the
        Father and the Son.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        (2) Christ’s resurrection was different as regards the life to which He
        arose. Christ arose again to a glorious and incorruptible life: “Christ
        is risen from the dead by the glory of the Father” [Rom 6:4]. The
        others, however, were raised to that life which they had before, as seen
        of Lazarus and the others.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        (3) Christ’s resurrection was different also in effect and efficacy. In
        virtue of the resurrection of Christ all shall rise again: “And many
        bodies of the saints that had slept arose” [Mt 28:52]. The Apostle
        declares that “Christ is risen from the dead, the first fruits of those
        who sleep” [1 Cor 15:20]. But also note that Christ by His Passion
        arrived at glory: “Ought not Christ to have suffered these things and so
        to enter into His glory?” [Lk 24:26]. And this is to teach us how we
        also may arrive at glory: “Through many tribulations we must enter into
        the kingdom of God” [Acts 14:21].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        (4) Christ’s resurrection was different in point of time. Christ arose
        on the third day; but the resurrection of the others is put off until
        the end of the world. The reason for this is that the resurrection and
        death and nativity of Christ were “for our salvation” [Nicene Creed],
        and thus He wished to rise again at a time when it would be of profit to
        us. Now, if He had risen immediately, it would not have been believed
        that He died; and similarly, if He had put it off until much later, the
        disciples would not have remained in their belief, and there would have
        been no benefit from His Passion. He arose again, therefore, on the
        third day, so that it would be believed that He died, and His disciples
        would not lose faith in him.<br />
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Instructions</span><br /></p>
      <p>
        From all this we can take four things for our instruction. Firstly, let
        us endeavor to arise spiritually, from the death of the soul which we
        incur by our sins, to that life of justice which is had through penance:
        “Rise, you who sleep, and arise from the dead; and Christ shall
        enlighten you” [Eph 5:14]. This is the first resurrection: “Blessed and
        holy is he who has part in the first resurrection” [Rev 20:6].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Secondly, let us not delay to rise until our death, but do it at once,
        since Christ arose on the third day: “Delay not to be converted to the
        Lord; and defer it not from day to day” [Sir 5:8]. You will not be able
        to consider what pertains to salvation when weighed down by illness,
        and, moreover, by persevering in sin, you will lose part of all the good
        which is done in the Church, and you will incur many evils. Indeed, the
        longer you possess the devil, the harder it is to put him away, as St.
        Bede tells us.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Thirdly, let us rise up again to an incorruptible life in that we may
        not die again, but resolve to sin no more: “Knowing that Christ, rising
        again from the dead, dies now no more. Death shall no more have dominion
        over Him.... So do you also reckon that you are dead to sin, but alive
        unto God, in Christ Jesus our Lord. Neither yield ye your members as
        instruments of iniquity unto sin; but present yourselves to God, as
        those that are alive from the dead” [Rom 6:9,11-14].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Fourthly, let us rise again to a new and glorious life by avoiding all
        that which formerly were the occasions and the causes of our death and
        sin: “As Christ is risen from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we
        also may walk in newness of life” [Rom 6:4]. This new life is the life
        of justice which renews the soul and leads it to the life of glory.<br />

          >“He ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of God, the
          Father Almighty.”</span
        ><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides the resurrection of Christ, we must also believe in His
        ascension; for He ascended into heaven on the fortieth day. Hence, the
        Creed says: “He ascended into heaven.” Concerning this we ought to
        observe three things, viz., that it was sublime, reasonable, and
        beneficial.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        It was certainly sublime that Christ ascended into heaven. This is
        expounded in three ways. Firstly, He ascended above the physical heaven:
        “He... ascended above all the heavens” [Eph 4:10]. Secondly, He ascended
        above all the spiritual heavens, i.e., spiritual natures: “Raising
        [Jesus] up from the dead and setting Him on His right hand in the
        heavenly places. Above all principality and power and virtue and
        dominion and every name that is named, not only in this world but also
        in that which is to come. And He subjected all things under His feet”
        [Eph 1:20-22]. Thirdly, He ascended up to the very throne of the Father:
        “Lo, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven. And He came
        to the Ancient of days” [Dan 7:13]. “And the Lord Jesus, after He had
        spoken to them, was taken up into heaven and sat at the right hand of
        God” [Mk 16:19]. Now, it is not to be taken in the literal sense, but
        figuratively, that Christ is at the right hand of God. Inasmuch as
        Christ is God, He is said to sit at the right hand of the Father, that
        is, in equality with the Father; and as Christ is man, He sits at the
        right hand of the Father, that is, in a more preferable place. The devil
        once feigned to do this: “I will ascend above the height of the clouds.
        I will be like the Most High” [Is 14:13-14]. But Christ alone succeeded
        in this, and so it is said: “He ascended into heaven, and sits at the
        right hand of the Father.” “The Lord said to my Lord: Sit You at My
        right hand” [Ps 109:1].<br />
      </p>
      <p>The Ascension of Christ into heaven is in accord with reason:<br /></p>
      <p>
        (1) because heaven was due to Christ by His very nature. It is natural
        for one to return to that place from whence he takes his origin. The
        beginning of Christ is from God, who is above all things: “I came forth
        from the Father and am come into the world; again I leave the world and
        I go to the Father” [Jn 16:28]. “No man ascended into heaven, but He who
        descended from heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven.” [Jn 3:13] The
        just ascend into heaven, but not in the manner that Christ ascended,
        i.e., by His own power; for they are taken up by Christ: “Draw me, we
        will run after You” [Sg 1:3]. Or, indeed, we can say that no man but
        Christ has ascended into heaven, because the just do not ascend except
        in so far as they are the members of Christ who is the head of the
        Church. “Wherever the body shall be, there shall the eagles also be
        gathered together” [Mt 24:28].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        (2) Heaven is due to Christ because of His victory. For He was sent into
        the world to combat the devil, and He did overcome him. Therefore,
        Christ deserved to be exalted above all things: “I also have overcome
        and am set down with My Father in His throne” [Rev 3:21].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        (3) The Ascension is reasonable because of the humility of Christ. There
        never was humility so great as that of Christ, who, although He was God,
        yet wished to become man; and although He was the Lord, yet wished to
        take the form of a servant, and, as St. Paul says: “He was made obedient
        unto death” [Phil 2:8], and descended even into the underworld. For this
        He deserved to be exalted even to heaven and to the throne of God, for
        humility leads to exaltation: “He who humbles himself shall be exalted”
        [Lk 14:11]. “He who descended is the same also who ascended above all
        the heavens” [Eph 4:10].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        The Ascension of Christ was very beneficial for us. This is seen three
        ways. Firstly, as our Leader, because He ascended in order to lead us;
        for we had lost the way, but He has shown it to us. “For He who opens
        the breach shall go up before them” [Micah 2:13]. and thus we may be
        made certain of possessing the heavenly kingdom: “I go to prepare a
        place for you” [Jn 14:2]. Secondly, that He might draw our hearts to
        Himself: “For where your treasure is, there is your heart so” [Mt 6:21].
        Thirdly, to let us withdraw from worldly things: “Therefore, if you be
        risen with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is
        sitting at the right hand of God. Mind the things that are above, not
        the things that are upon the earth” [Col 3:1].<br />

          >“From thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead.”</span
        ><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        It is of the office of the King and Lord to pronounce judgment: “The
        king who sits on the throne of judgment scatters away all evil with His
        look” [Prov 20:8]. Since Christ, therefore, ascended into heaven and
        sits at the right hand of God as Lord of all, it is clear that His is
        the office of Judge. For this reason we say in the rule of Catholic
        faith that “He shall come to judge the living and the dead.” Indeed the
        Angels have said that: “This Jesus who has been taken up from you into
        heaven shall come again as you have seen Him going into heaven” [Acts
        1:11].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        We shall consider three facts about the judgment: (1) the form of the
        judgment; (2) the fear of the judgment; (3) our preparation for the
        judgment.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold">The form of the judgment</span><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, concerning the form of the judgment there is a threefold question.
        Who is the judge, who are to be judged, and upon what will they be
        judged? Christ is the Judge: “It is He who is appointed by God to be
        judge of the living and of the dead” [Acts 10:42]. We may here interpret
        “the dead” to mean sinners and “the living” to mean the just; or “the
        living” to refer to those who at that time were living and “the dead” to
        mean those who had died. Christ of a certain is Judge, not only in that
        He is God, but also in that He is man. The first reason for this is
        because it is necessary that they who are to be judged may see the
        Judge. But the Godhead is so wholly delightful that no one could behold
        it without great enjoyment; and hence the damned are not permitted to
        see the Judge, nor in consequence to enjoy anything. Christ, therefore,
        of necessity will appear in the form of man so that He may be seen by
        all: “And He has given Him power to do judgment, because He is the Son
        of man” [Jn 5:27]. Again Christ deserved this office as Man, for as Man
        He was unjustly judged, and therefore God constitutes Him Judge of the
        entire world: “Your cause has been judged as that of the wicked. Cause
        and judgment You shall recover” [Job 36:17]. And, lastly, if God alone
        should judge men, they, being terrified, would despair; but this despair
        disappears from men if they are to be judged by a Man: “And then they
        shall see the Son of man coming in a cloud” [Lk 11:27].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        All are to be judged—those who are, who were, and who will be: “We must
        all be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, that every one may
        receive the proper things of the body, according as he hath done,
        whether it be good or evil” [2 Cor 5:10]. There are, says St. Gregory,
        four different classes of people to be judged. The chief difference is
        between the good and the wicked.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Of the wicked, some will be condemned but not judged. They are the
        infidels whose works are not to be discussed because, as St. John says:
        “He who does not believe is already judged” [Jn 3:18]. Others will be
        both condemned and judged. They are those possessing the faith who
        departed this life in mortal sin: “For the wages of sin is death” [Rm
        6:23]. They shall not be excluded from the judgment because of the faith
        which they possessed.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Of the good also, some will be saved and shall not be judged. they are
        the poor in spirit for God’s sake who rather shall judge others: “Amen,
        I say to you that you, who have followed Me, in the regeneration when
        the Son of man shall sit on the seat of His majesty, you also shall sit
        on twelve seats judging the twelve tribes of Israel” [Mt 19:28]. Now,
        this is not to be understood only of the disciples, but of all those who
        are poor in spirit; for otherwise Paul, who labored more than others,
        would not be among this number. These words, therefore, must refer also
        to all the followers of the apostles and to all apostolic men: “Know you
        not that we shall judge Angels? [1 Cor 6:3]. “The Lord will enter into
        judgment with the ancients of His people and its princes” [Is 3:14].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Others shall both be saved and judged, that is, they who die in a state
        of righteousness. For although they departed this life in justice,
        nevertheless they fell somewhat amiss in the business of temporal
        matters, and hence shall be judged but saved. The judgment will be upon
        all their deeds good and bad: “Walk in the ways of your heart,... and
        know that for all these God will bring you into judgment” [Eccles 11:9].
        “And all things that are done, God will bring into judgment for every
        error, whether it be good or evil” [Eccles 12:14]. Even idle words shall
        be judged: “But I say to you that every idle word that men shall speak,
        they shall render an account for it in the day of judgment” [Mt 12:36].
        And thoughts also: “For inquisition shall be made into the thought of
        the ungodly” [Wis 1:9]. Thus, the form of the judgment is clear.<br />

        The judgment ought indeed to be feared. (a) Because of the wisdom of the
        Judge. God knows all things, our thoughts, words and deeds, and “all
        things are naked and open to his eyes.[Heb 4:13]. “All the ways of men
        are open to His eyes” [Prov 16:2]. He knows our words: “The ear of
        jealousy hears all things” [Wis 1:10]. Also our thoughts: “The heart is
        perverse above all things and unsearchable. Who can know it? I am the
        Lord, who search the heart and prove the reins; who give to every one
        according to his way and according to the fruit of his devices” [Jer
        17:9-10]. There will be infallible witnesses— men’s own consciences:
        “Who show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience
        bearing witness to them; and their thoughts between themselves accusing
        or also defending one another, in the day when God shall judge the
        secrets of men” [Rm 2:15-16].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        (b) Because of the power of the Judge, who is almighty in Himself:
        “Behold, the Lord God will come with strength” [Is 40:10]. And also
        almighty in others: “The whole world shall fight with Him against the
        unwise” [Wis 5:21]. Hence, Job says: “Whereas there is no man that can
        deliver out of your hand” [Job 10:7]. “If I ascend into heaven, You are
        there; if I descend into the underworld, You art present,” says the
        Psalmist.[Ps 138:8].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        (c) Because of the inflexible justice of the Judge. The present is the
        time for mercy; but the future is the time solely for justice; and so
        the present is our time, but the future is God’s time: “When I shall
        take a time, I shall judge justices” [Ps 74:3 Vulgate]. “The jealousy
        and rage of the husband will not spare in the day of revenge. Nor will
        he yield to any man’s prayers; nor will he accept for satisfaction ever
        so many gifts” [Prov 6:34-35].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        (d) Because of the anger of the Judge. He shall appear in different ways
        to the just and to the wicked. To the just, He will be pleasant and
        gracious: “They will behold the King of beauty” [Is 33:17]. To the
        wicked He will be angry and pitiless, so that they may say to the
        mountains: “Fall upon us and hide us from the wrath of the Lamb” [Rev
        6:16]. But this anger of God does not bespeak in Him any perturbation of
        soul, but rather the effect of His anger which is the eternal punishment
        inflicted upon sinners.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Our preparation for the judgment</span
        ><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, against this fear of the judgment we ought to have four remedies.
        The first is good works: “Will you then not be afraid of the power? Do
        what is good, and you shall have praise from the same” [Rm 13:3]. The
        second is confession and repentance for sins committed; and this ought
        to include sorrow in thinking of hem, feeling of shame in confessing
        them, and all severity in making satisfaction for them. And these will
        take away the eternal punishment. The third is giving of alms, which
        makes all things clean: “Make friends of the mammon of iniquity; that
        when you fail, they may receive you into everlasting dwellings” [Lk
        16:9]. The fourth is charity, viz., the love of God and our neighbor,
        for “charity covers a multitude of sins” [1 Pt 4:8].<br />

      </p>
      <p>
        As we have said, the Word of God is the Son of God just as in a way the
        word of man is the concept of his intellect. But sometimes man has a
        word which is dead. This is when, for instance, he conceives what he
        ought to do, but he has not the will to do it; or when one believes but
        does not practise; then his faith is said to be dead, as St. James
        points out [2:17]. The word of God, however, is alive: “For the word of
        God is living” [Hb 4:12]. It is necessary, therefore, that in God there
        be will and love. Thus, St. Augustine says: “The word of God which we
        plan to speak is knowledge with love” [ <i>De Trinitate</i> IX, 10].
        Now, as the Word of God is the Son of God, God’s love is the Holy
        Spirit. Hence, it is that one possesses the Holy Spirit when he loves
        God: “The charity of God is poured forth in our hearts, by the Holy
        Spirit who is given to us” [Rm 5:5].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        There are some who held false opinions concerning the Holy Spirit. They
        said, for instance, that He was only the servant and minister of God.
        Hence, to remove these errors the holy Fathers added [in the Nicene
        Creed] five phrases concerning the Holy Spirit.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        “The Holy Spirit, the Lord.”—The first is, that although there are other
        spirits, such as the Angels who are ministers of God. “Art they not all
        ministering spirits?” [Hb 1:14], nevertheless the Holy,Spirit is the
        Lord. “God is a Spirit” [Jn 4:24] and, “Now the Lord is a Spirit” [2 Cor
        3:17], and also, “Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty” [2
        Cor 3:11]. The reason is that He makes us love God and cease to love the
        world. Thus, the Creed says: “In the Holy Spirit, the Lord.”<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        “And Giver of life.”—The second phrase is there because the soul’s life
        is to be united to God, inasmuch as God is the life of the soul, and as
        truly as the soul is the life of the body. Now, the Holy Spirit unites
        the soul to God through love, because He is the love of God, and
        therefore He gives life. “It is the spirit who gives life” [Jn 6:64].
        Therefore, it is said: “and Giver of life.”<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        “Who Proceeds from the Father and the Son.”—The third is that the Holy
        Spirit is one in substance with the Father and the Son; because as the
        Son is the Word of the Father, so the Holy Spirit is the love both of
        the Father and the Son, and, therefore, He proceeds from them both.
        Moreover, just as the Word of God is of the same substance as the
        Father, so also is Love [Holy Spirit]. of the same substance as the
        Father and the Son. Hence, it is said: “who proceeds from the Father and
        the Son.” From this it is seen that the Holy Spirit is not a
        Creature.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        “Who... is Adored and Glorified.”—The fourth phrase is that the Holy
        Spirit as regards adoration is equal to the Father and the Son: “The
        true adorers shall adore the Father in spirit and truth” [Jn 4:23].
        “Teach all nations; baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the
        Son and of the Holy Spirit” [Mt 28:19]. Hence, it is said: “Who together
        with the Father and the Son is adored.”<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        “Who Spoke through the Prophets.”—The fifth phrase, wherein the Holy
        Spirit is declared equal to God, is that the holy prophets spoke on
        behalf of God. It is clear that, if the Holy Spirit were not God, then
        it would not be said that the prophets had spoken of God on His behalf.
        Thus, says St. Peter: “The holy men of God spoke, inspired by the Holy
        Spirit” [2 Pt 1:21]. Also: “The Lord God sent me, and His Spirit” [Is
        48:16]. And so it is said: “Who spoke through the prophets.”<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        In all this two errors are condemned. The Manicheans said that the Old
        Testament was not from God. But this is false because the Holy Spirit
        spoke through the prophets. Likewise, the error of Priscillian and
        Montanus was that they believed that the prophets did not speak by the
        Holy Spirit but were somewhat beside themselves.<br />
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Benefits</span><br /></p>
      <p>Many benefits come to us from the Holy Spirit:<br /></p>
      <p>
        (1) He cleanses us from our sins. The reason is that one must repair
        that which one has made. Now, the soul is created by the Holy Spirit,
        because God has made all things through Him; for God, by loving His
        goodness, created everything: “You love all things that are, and hate
        none of the things which You made” [Wis 11:25]. Thus, Dionysius says:
        “Divine love did not permit Him to be without offspring” [
        <i>Div nom.</i> IV, 20]. It is necessary, therefore, that the hearts of
        men, destroyed by sin, be made anew by the Holy Spirit: “Send forth your
        Spirit, and they shall be created; and You shall renew the face of the
        earth” [Ps 103:30]. Nor is it any wonder that the Spirit cleanses, since
        all sins are taken away by love: “Many sins are forgiven her, because
        she has loved much” [Lk 7:47]. “Charity covers all sins” [Prov 10:12].
        And likewise: “Charity covers a multitude of sins” [1 Pt 4:8].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        (2) The Holy Spirit enlightens the intellect, since all that we know, we
        know through the Holy Spirit: “But the Paraclete, the Holy Spirit, whom
        the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things and bring
        all things to your mind, whatsoever I shall have said to you” [Jn
        14:26]. Also: “His unction teaches you all things” [1 Jn 2:27].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        (3) He assists us and, to a certain extent, compels us to keep the
        commandments. No one can keep the commandments unless he loves God: “If
        any one love Me, he will keep My word” [Jn 14:23]. Thus, the Holy Spirit
        makes us love God: “And I give you a new heart and put a new spirit
        within you; and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and
        will give you a heart of flesh. And I will put My Spirit in the midst of
        you; and I will cause you to walk in My commandments and to keep My
        judgments and do them” [Ez 36:26-27].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        (4) He strengthens in us the hope of eternal life, because He is the
        pledge to us of this our destiny: “You were signed with the Holy Spirit
        of promise who is the pledge of our inheritance” [Eph 1:13]. He is, as
        it were, the surety of our eternal life. The reason is that eternal life
        is due to man inasmuch as he is become the son of God; and this is
        brought about in that he is made like unto Christ; and this, in turn,
        follows from his having the Spirit of Christ, and this is the Holy
        Spirit: “For you have not received the spirit of bondage again in fear;
        but you have received the spirit of adoption of sons, whereby we cry:
        Abba (Father). For the Spirit Himself giveth testimony to our spirit
        that we are the sons of God” [Rm 8:15-16]. And also: “Because you are
        sons, God sent the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying: Abba,
        Father” [Gal 4:6].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        (5) He counsels us when we are in doubt, and teaches us what is the will
        of God: “He that has an ear let him hear what the Spirit says to the
        churches” [Rev 2:7]. Likewise: “I may hear him as a master” [Is
        50:4].<br />

        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >“I Believe in the Holy Catholic Church.”</span
        ><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        We see that in a man there are one soul and one body; and of his body
        there are many members. So also the Catholic Church is one body and has
        different members. The soul which animates this body is the Holy Spirit.
        Hence, after confessing our faith in the Holy Spirit, we are bid to
        believe in the Holy Catholic Church. Thus, in the Symbol it is said,
        “the Holy Catholic Church.”<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        It must be known that “church” is the same as assembly. So, the Holy
        Church is the same as the assembly of the faithful, and every Christian
        is a member of this Church, of which it is written: “Draw near to Me,
        you unlearned; and gather yourselves together into the house of
        discipline” [Sir 51:31].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        The Church has four essential conditions, in that she is one, holy,
        catholic, and strong and firm.<br />
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold">One</span><br /></p>
      <p>
        Of the first, it must be known that the Church is one. Although various
        heretics have founded various sects, they do not belong to the Church,
        since they are but so many divisions. Of her it is said: “One is My
        dove; My perfect one is but one” [Sg 6:8]. The unity of the Church
        arises from three sources:<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        (1) the unity of faith. All Christians who are of the body of the Church
        believe the same doctrine. “I beseech you... that you all speak the same
        thing and that there be no schisms among you” [1 Cor 1:10]. And: “One
        Lord, one faith, one baptism”[Eph 4:5];<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        (2) the unity of hope. All are strengthened in one hope of arriving at
        eternal life. Hence, the Apostle says: “One body and one Spirit, as you
        are called in one hope of your calling”[Eph 4:4];<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        (3) the unity of charity. All are joined together in the love of God,
        and to each other in mutual love: “And the glory which You hast given
        Me, I have given them; that they may be one, as We also are one” [Jn
        17:22]. It is clear that this is a true love when the members are
        solicitous for one another and sympathetic towards each other: “We
        should in every way grow up in Him who is the head, Christ. From whom
        the whole body, being joined and fit together, by every joint with which
        it is supplied, when each part is working properly, makes bodily growth
        and builds itself up in charity” [Eph 4:15-16]. This is because each one
        ought to make use of the grace God grants him, and be of service to his
        neighbor. No one ought to be indifferent to the Church, or allow himself
        to be cut off and expelled from it; for there is but one Church in which
        men are saved, just as outside of the ark of Noah no one could be
        saved.<br />
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Holy</span><br /></p>
      <p>
        Concerning the second mark, holiness, it must be known that there is
        indeed another assembly, but it consists of the wicked: “I hate the
        assembly of the wicked” [Ps 25:5]. But such a one is evil; the Church of
        Christ, however, is holy: “For the temple of God is holy, which you are”
        [1 Cor 3:17]. Hence, it is said: “the Holy Church.”<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        The faithful of this Church are made holy because of four things: (1)
        Just as a church is cleansed materially when it is consecrated, so also
        the faithful are washed in the blood of Christ: “Jesus Christ... who
        hath loved us and washed us from our sins in His own blood” [Rev 1:5].
        And: “That He might sanctify the people by his blood, he suffered
        outside the gate” [Hb 13:12]. (2) Just as there is the anointing of the
        church, so also the faithful are anointed with a spiritual unction in
        order to be sanctified. Otherwise they would not be Christians, for
        Christ is the same as Anointed. This anointing is the grace of the Holy
        Spirit: “He who confirms us with you in Christ and who has anointed us,
        is God” [2 Cor 1:21]. And: “You are sanctified... in the name of our
        Lord Jesus Christ” [1 Cor 6:11]. (3) The faithful are made holy because
        of the Trinity who dwells in the Church; for wherever God dwells, that
        place is holy. “The place where you stand is holy” [Joshua 5:16]. And:
        “Holiness befits your house, O Lord” [Ps 92:5]. (4) Lastly, the faithful
        are sanctified because God is invoked in the Church: “But You, Lord, are
        among us, and your name is called upon by us; forsake us not” [Jer
        14:9]. Let us, therefore, beware, seeing that we are thus sanctified,
        lest by sin we defile our soul which is the temple of God: “Do you not
        know that you are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in
        you? But if any man violates the temple of God, him shall God destroy”
        [1 Cor 3:16-17].<br />
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Catholic</span><br /></p>
      <p>
        The Church is Catholic, that is, universal. Firstly, it is universal in
        place, because it is worldwide. This is contrary to the error of the
        Donatists. For the Church is a congregation of the faithful; and since
        the faithful are in every part of the world, so also is the Church:
        “Your faith is spoken of in the whole world” [Rm 1:8]. And also: “Go
        into the whole world and preach the gospel to every creature” [Mk
        16:15]. Long ago, indeed, God was known only in Judea; now, however, He
        is known throughout the entire world. The Church has three parts: one is
        on earth, one is in heaven, and one is in purgatory. Secondly, the
        Church is universal in regard to all the conditions of mankind; for no
        exceptions are made, neither master nor servant, neither man nor woman:
        “Neither bond nor free; there is neither male nor female” [Gal 3:28].
        Thirdly, it is universal in time. Some have said that the Church will
        exist only up to a certain time. But this is false, for the Church began
        to exist in the time of Abel and will endure up to the end of the world:
        “Behold, I am with you all days, even to the consummation of the world”
        [Mt 28:20]. Moreover, even after the end of the world, it will continue
        to exist in heaven.<br />
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Apostolic</span><br /></p>
      <p>
        The Church is firm. A house is said to be firm if it has a solid
        foundation. The principal foundation of the Church is Christ: “For other
        foundation no men can lay but that which is laid, which is Christ Jesus”
        [1 Cor 3:11]. The secondary foundation, however, is the Apostles and
        their teaching. Therefore, the Church is firm. It is said in the
        Apocalypse that the city has “twelve foundations,” and therein were
        “written the names of the twelve Apostles” [Rev 21:14]. From this the
        Church is called Apostolic. Likewise, to indicate this firmness of the
        Church St. Peter is called the crowning head.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        The firmness of a house is evident if, when it is violently struck, it
        does not fall. The Church similarly can never be destroyed, neither by
        persecution nor by error. Indeed, the Church grew during the
        persecutions, and both those who persecuted her and those against whom
        she threatened completely failed: “And whoever falls upon this stone,
        shall be broken; but on whomever it falls, it shall grind him to powder”
        [Mt 21:44]. As regards errors, indeed, the more errors arise, the more
        surely truth is made to appear: “Men corrupt in mind, reprobate in
        faith; but they shall proceed no further” [2 Tim 3:8].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Nor shall the Church be destroyed by the temptations of the demons. For
        she is like a tower towards which all flee who war against the devil:
        “The name of the Lord is a strong tower” [Prov 18:10]. The devil,
        therefore, is chiefly intent on destroying the Church, but he will not
        succeed, for the Lord has said: “The gates of the underworld shall not
        prevail against it” [Mt 16:18].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        This is as if He said: “They shall make war against you, but they shall
        not overcome you.” And thus it is that only the Church of Peter (to whom
        it was given to evangelize Italy when the disciples were sent to preach)
        was always firm in faith. On the contrary, in other parts of the world
        there is either no faith at all or faith mixed with many errors. The
        Church of Peter flourishes in faith and is free from error. This,
        however, is not to be wondered at, for the Lord has said to Peter: “But
        I have prayed for you, that your faith fail not; and thou, being once
        converted, confirm your brethren” [Lk 22:32].<br />

        ><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        As in our natural body the operation of one member works for the good of
        the entire body, so also is it with a spiritual body, such as is the
        Church. Because all the faithful are one body, the good of one member is
        communicated to another: “And every one members, one of another” [Rm
        12:5]. So, among the points of faith which the Apostles have handed down
        is that there is a common sharing of good in the Church. This is
        expressed in the words, “the Communion of Saints”. Among the various
        members of the Church, the principal member is Christ, because He is the
        Head: “He made Him head over all the Church, which is His body” [Eph
        1:22]. Christ communicates His good, just as the power of the head is
        communicated to all the members.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        This communication takes place through the Sacraments of the Church in
        which operate the merits of the passion of Christ, which in turn
        operates for the conferring of grace unto the remission of sins. These
        Sacraments of the Church are seven in number.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        “Baptism.”—The first is Baptism which is a certain spiritual
        regeneration. Just as there can be no physical life unless man is first
        born in the flesh, so spiritual life or grace cannot be had unless man
        is spiritually reborn. This rebirth is effected through Baptism: “Unless
        a man be born again of water and the Holy Spirit, he cannot enter into
        the kingdom of God” [Jn 3:5]. It must be known that, just as a man can
        be born but once, so only once is he baptized. Hence, the holy Fathers
        put into the Nicene Creed: “I confess one baptism.” The power of Baptism
        consists in this, that it cleanses from all sins as regards both their
        guilt and their punishment. For this reason no penance is imposed on
        those who are baptized, no matter to what extent they had been sinners.
        Moreover, if they should die immediately after Baptism, they would
        without delay go to heaven. Another result is that, although only
        priests “ex officio” may baptize, yet any one may baptize in case of
        necessity, provided that the proper form of Baptism is used. This is: “I
        baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
        Spirit.” This Sacrament receives its power from the passion of Christ.
        “All we who are baptized in Christ Jesus are baptized in His death” [Rm
        6:3]. Accordingly there is a threefold immersion in water after the
        three days in which Christ was in the sepulchre.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        “Confirmation.”—The second Sacrament is Confirmation. Just as they who
        are physically born need certain powers to act, so those who are reborn
        spiritually must have the strength of the Holy Spirit which is imparted
        to them in this Sacrament. In order that they might become strong, the
        Apostles received the Holy Spirit after the Ascension of Christ: “Stay
        you in the city till you be endowed with power from on high” [Lk 24:49].
        This power is given in the Sacrament of Confirmation. They, therefore,
        who have the care of children should be very careful to see that they be
        confirmed, because great grace is conferred in Confirmation. He who is
        confirmed will, when he dies, enjoy greater glory than one not
        confirmed, because greater grace will be his.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        “Holy Eucharist.”—The Eucharist is the third Sacrament. In the physical
        life, after man is born and acquires powers, he needs food to sustain
        and strengthen him. Likewise in the spiritual life, after being
        fortified, he has need of spiritual food; this is the Body of Christ:
        “Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink His blood, you
        shall not have life in you “[Jn 6:54]. According to the prescribed law
        of the Church, therefore, every Christian must at least once a year
        receive the Body of Christ, and in a worthy manner and with a clean
        conscience: “For he who eats and drinks unworthily [that is, by being
        conscious of unconfessed mortal sin on his soul, or with no intent to
        abstain from it] eats and drinks judgment to himself” [1 Cor 11:29].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        “Penance.”—The fourth Sacrament is Penance. In the physical life, one
        who is sick and does not have recourse to medicine, dies; so in the
        spiritual order, one becomes ill because of sin. Thus, medicine is
        necessary for recovery of health; and this is the grace which is
        conferred in the Sacrament of Penance: “Who forgives all your
        iniquities; who heals all your diseases” [Ps 102:3]. Three things must
        be present in the Sacrament of Penance: contrition, which is sorrow for
        sin together with a resolution not to sin again; confession of sins, as
        far as possible entire; and satisfaction which is accomplished by good
        works.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        “Extreme Unction.”—Extreme Unction is the fifth Sacrament. In this life
        there are many things which prevent one from a perfect purification from
        one’s sins. But since no one can enter into eternal life until he is
        well cleansed, there is need of another Sacrament which will purify man
        of his sins, and both free him from sickness and prepare him for entry
        into the heavenly kingdom. This is the Sacrament of Extreme Unction.
        That this Sacrament does not always restore health to the body is due to
        this, that perhaps to live is not to the advantage of the soul’s
        salvation. “Is any man sick amongst you? Let him bring in the priests of
        the Church and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the
        name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith shall save the sick man. And
        the Lord shall raise him up; and if he be in sins, they shall be
        forgiven him” [James 5:14-15]. It is now clear that the fullness of life
        is had from these five Sacraments.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        “Holy Orders.”—It is necessary that these Sacraments be administered by
        chosen ministers. Therefore, the Sacrament of Orders is necessary, by
        whose powers these Sacraments are dispensed. Nor need one note the life
        of such ministers, if here and there one fail in his office, but
        remember the virtue of Christ through whose merits the Sacraments have
        their efficacy, and in whose Name the ministers are but dispensers: “Let
        a man so account of us as of the ministers of Christ and the dispensers
        of the mysteries of God” [1 Cor 4:1]. This then is the sixth Sacrament,
        namely, Orders.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        “Matrimony.”—The seventh Sacrament is Matrimony, and in it men, if they
        live uprightly, are saved; and thereby they are enabled to live without
        mortal sin. Sometimes the partners in marriage fall into venial sin,
        when their concupiscence does not extend beyond the rights of matrimony;
        but if they do go beyond such rights, they sin mortally.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        By these seven Sacraments we receive the remission of sins, and so in
        the Creed there follows immediately: “the forgiveness of sins.” The
        power was given to the Apostles to forgive sins. We must believe that
        the ministers of the Church receive this power from the Apostles; and
        the Apostles received it from Christ; and thus the priests have the
        power of binding and loosing. Moreover, we believe that there is the
        full power of forgiving sins in the Church, although it operates from
        the highest to the lowest, i.e., from the Pope down through the
        prelates.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        We must also know that not only the efficacy of the Passion of Christ is
        communicated to us, but also the merits of His life; and, moreover, all
        the good that all the Saints have done is communicated to all who are in
        the state of grace, because all are one: “I am a partaker of all those
        who fear You” [Ps 118:63]. Therefore, he who lives in charity
        participates in all the good that is done in the entire world; but more
        specially does he benefit for whom some good work is done; since one man
        certainly can satisfy for another. Thus, through this communion we
        receive two benefits. One is that the merits of Christ are communicated
        to all; the other is that the good of one is communicated to another.
        Those who are excommunicated, however, because they are cut off from the
        Church, forfeit their part of all the good that is done, and this is a
        far greater loss than being bereft of all material things. There is a
        danger lest the devil impede this spiritual help in order to tempt one;
        and when one is thus cut off, the devil can easily overcome him. Thus it
        was in the primitive Church that, when one was excommunicated, the devil
        even physically attacked him.<br />

      <p style="text-align: center">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">“The Resurrection of the Body”</span
        ><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Not only does the Holy Spirit sanctify the Church as regards the souls
        of its members, but also our bodies shall rise again by His power: “We
        believe in Him that raised up Jesus Christ, Our Lord, from the dead” [Rm
        4:24]. And: “By a man came death: and by a Man the resurrection of the
        dead” [1 Cor 15:21]. In this there occur four considerations: (1) the
        benefits which proceed from our faith in the resurrection; (2) the
        qualities of those who shall rise, taken all in general; (3) the
        condition of the blessed; (4) the condition of the damned.<br />
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Benefits</span><br /></p>
      <p>
        Concerning the first, our faith and hope in the resurrection is
        beneficial in four ways. Firstly, it takes away the sorrow which we feel
        for the departed. It is impossible for one not to grieve over the death
        of a relative or friend; but the hope that such a one will rise again
        greatly tempers the pain of parting: “And we will not have you ignorant,
        brethren, concerning those who are asleep, that you be not sorrowful, as
        others who have no hope” [1 Thes 4:12].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Secondly, it takes away the fear of death. If one does not hope in
        another and better life after death, then without doubt one is greatly
        in fear of death and would willingly commit any crime rather than suffer
        death. But because we believe in another life which will be ours after
        death, we do not fear death, nor would we do anything wrong through fear
        of it: “That, through death He might destroy him who had the empire of
        death, that is to say, the devil, and might deliver those who through
        fear of death were all their life subject to bondage” [Hb 2:14].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Thirdly, it makes us watchful and careful to live uprightly. If,
        however, this life in which we live were all, we would not have this
        great incentive to live well, for whatever we do would be of little
        importance, since it would be regulated not by eternity, but by brief,
        determined time. But we believe that we shall receive eternal rewards in
        the resurrection for whatsoever we do here. Hence, we are anxious to do
        good: “If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men
        most miserable” [1 Cor 15:19].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, it withdraws us from evil. Just as the hope of reward urges us
        to do good, so also the fear of punishment, which we believe is reserved
        for wicked deeds, keeps us from evil: “But they who have done good
        things shall come forth unto the resurrection of life; but they who have
        done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment” [Jn 5:29].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Qualities of those who arise</span
        ><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a fourfold condition of all those who shall take part in the
        resurrection:<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        (a) The Identity of the Bodies of the Risen.—It will be the same body as
        it is now, both as regards its flesh and its bones. Some, indeed, have
        said that it will not be this same body which is corrupted that shall be
        raised up; but such view is contrary to the Apostle: “For this
        corruptible must put on incorruption” [1 Cor 15:53]. And likewise the
        Sacred Scripture says that by the power of God this same body shall rise
        to life: “And I shall be clothed again with my skin; and in my flesh I
        shall see my God” [Job 19:26].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        (b) The Incorruptibility of the Risen Bodies.—The bodies of the risen
        shall be of a different quality from that of the mortal body, because
        they shall be incorruptible, both of the blessed, who shall be ever in
        glory, and of the damned, who shall be ever in punishments: “For this
        corruptible must put on incorruption; and this mortal must put on
        immortality” [1 Cor 15:53]. And since the body will be incorruptible and
        immortal, there will no longer be the use of food or of the marriage
        relations: “For in the resurrection they shall neither marry nor be
        married, but shall be as the Angels of God in heaven” [Mt 22:30]. This
        is directly against the Jews and Muslims: “Nor shall he return any more
        into his house” [Job 7:10].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        (c) The Integrity of the Risen Bodies.—Both the good and the wicked
        shall rise with all soundness of body which is natural to man. He will
        not be blind or deaf or bear any kind of physical defect: “The dead
        shall rise again incorruptible” [1 Cor 15:52], this is to mean, wholly
        free from the defects of the present life.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        (d) The Age of the Risen Bodies.—All will rise in the condition of
        perfect age, which is of thirty-two or thirty-three years. This is
        because all who were not yet arrived at this age, did not possess this
        perfect age, and the old had already lost it. Hence, youths and children
        will be given what they lack, and what the aged once had will be
        restored to them: “Until we all attain the unity of faith and of the
        knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the
        age of the fullness of Christ” [Eph 4:13].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Condition of the blessed</span><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        It must be known that the good will enjoy a special glory because the
        blessed will have glorified bodies which will be endowed with four
        gifts:<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        (a) Brilliance.—“Then shall the just shine as the sun in the kingdom of
        their Father” [Mt 13:43].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        (b) Impassibility (i.e., Incapability of Receiving Action).—“It is sown
        in dishonor; it shall rise in glory.” [1 Cor 15:43] “And God shall wipe
        away all tears from their eyes; and death shall be no more. Nor
        mourning, nor crying, nor sorrow shall be anymore, for the former things
        are passed away” [Rev 21:4].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        (c) Agility.—“The just shall shine and shall run to and fro like sparks
        among the reeds” [Wis 3:7].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        (d) Subtility.—“It is sown a natural body; it shall rise a spiritual
        body” [1 Cor 15:44]. This is in the sense of not being altogether a
        spirit, but that the body will be wholly subject to the spirit.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Condition of the damned</span><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        It must also be known that the condition of the damned will be the exact
        contrary to that of the blessed. Theirs is the state of eternal
        punishment, which has a fourfold evil condition. The bodies of the
        damned will not be brilliant: “Their countenances shall be as faces
        burnt” [Is 13:8]. Likewise they shall be passible, because they shall
        never deteriorate and, although burning eternally in fire, they shall
        never be consumed: “Their worm shall not die and their fire shall not be
        quenched” [Is 66:24]. They will be weighed down, and the soul of the
        damned will be as it were chained therein: “To bind their kings with
        fetters, and their nobles with manacles of iron” [Ps 149:8]. Finally,
        they will be in a certain manner fleshly both in soul and body: “The
        beasts have rotted in their dung” [Joel 1:17].<br />
        <br /></p

    <a name="12" id="12">
      <p style="text-align: center">

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">
        <span style="font-weight: bold">“Life everlasting. Amen.”</span><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        The end of all our desires, eternal life, is fittingly placed last among
        those things to be believed; and the Creed says: “life everlasting.
        Amen.” They wrote this to stand against those who believe that the soul
        perishes with the body. If this were indeed true, then the condition of
        man would be just the same as that of the beasts. This agrees with what
        the Psalmist says: “Man when he was in honor did not understand; he has
        been compared to senseless beasts, and made like to them” [Ps 48:21].
        The human soul, however, is in its immortality made like unto God, and
        in its sensuality alone is it like the brutes. He, then, who believes
        that the soul dies with the body withdraws it from this similarity to
        God and likens it to the brutes. Against such it is said: “They knew not
        the secrets of God, nor hoped for the wages of justice, nor esteemed the
        honor of holy souls. For God created man incorruptible, and to the image
        of His own likeness He made him” [Wis 2:22-23].<br />
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Life everlasting</span><br /></p>
      <p>
        We must first consider in this Article what is everlasting life. And in
        this we must know that in everlasting life man is united to God. God
        Himself is the reward and the end of all our labors: “I am your
        protector, and your reward exceeding great” [Gen 15:1]. This union with
        God consists, firstly, in a perfect vision: “We see now through a glass
        in a dark manner; but then face to face” [1 Cor 13:12]. Secondly, in a
        most fervent love; for the better one is known, the more perfectly is
        one loved: “The Lord said it, whose fire is in Sion, and His furnace in
        Jerusalem” [Is 31:9]. Thirdly, in the highest praise. “We shall see, we
        shall love, and we shall praise,” as says St. Augustine [
        <i>City of God</i> XX, 30]. “Joy and gladness shall be found therein,
        thanksgiving and the voice of praise” [Is 51:3].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, too, in everlasting life is the full and perfect satisfying of
        every desire; for there every blessed soul will have to overflowing what
        he hoped for and desired. The reason is that in this life no one can
        fulfill all his desires, nor can any created thing fully satisfy the
        craving of man. God only satisfies and infinitely exceeds man’s desires;
        and, therefore, perfect satiety is found in God alone. As St. Augustine
        says: “You have made us for You, O Lord, and our heart is restless until
        it rests in You” [ <i>Confessions</i> I, 1]. Because the blessed in the
        Fatherland will possess God perfectly, it is evident that their desires
        will be abundantly filled, and their glory will exceed their hopes. The
        Lord has said: “Enter into the joy of the Lord” [Mt 25:21]. And as St.
        Augustine says: “Complete joy will not enter into those who rejoice, but
        all those who rejoice will enter into joy.” “I shall be satisfied when
        your glory shall appear” [Ps 16:15]. And again: “Who satisfies your
        desire with good things” [Ps 102:5].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Whatever is delightful will be there in abundant fullness. Thus, if
        pleasures are desired, there will be the highest and most perfect
        pleasure, for it derives from the highest good, namely, God: “Then shall
        you abound in delights in the Almighty” [Job 22:26]. “At the right hand
        are delights even to the end” [Ps 15:10]. Likewise, if honors are
        desired, there too will be all honor. Men wish particularly to be kings,
        if they be laymen; and to be bishops, if they be clerics. Both these
        honors will be there: “And has made us a kingdom and priests” [Rev
        5:10]. “Behold how they are numbered among the children of God” [Wis
        5:5]. If knowledge is desired, it will be there most perfectly, because
        we shall possess in the life everlasting knowledge of all the natures of
        things and all truth, and whatever we desire we shall know. And whatever
        we desire to possess, that we shall have, even life eternal: “Now, all
        good things come to me together with her” [Wis 7:11]. “To the just their
        desire shall be given” [Prov 10:24].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Again, most perfect security is there. In this world there is no perfect
        security; for in so far as one has many things, and the higher one’s
        position, the more one has to fear and the more one wants. But in the
        life everlasting there is no anxiety, no labor, no fear.<br />
      </p>

        “And My people shall sit in the beauty of peace”[Is 32:10], and “shall
        enjoy abundance, without fear of evils” [Prov 1:33].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, in heaven there will be the happy society of all the blessed,
        and this society will be especially delightful. Since each one will
        possess all good together with the blessed, and they will love one
        another as themselves, and they will rejoice in the others’ good as
        their own. It will also happen that, as the pleasure and enjoyment of
        one increases, so will it be for all: “The dwelling in you is as it were
        of all rejoicing” [Ps 86:7 Vulgate].<br />
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Lot of the wicked</span><br /></p>
      <p>
        The perfect will enjoy all this in the life everlasting, and much more
        that surpasses description. But the wicked, on the other hand, will be
        in eternal death suffering pain and punishment as great as will be the
        happiness and glory of the good. The punishment of the damned will be
        increased, firstly, by their separation from God and from all good. This
        is the pain of loss which corresponds to aversion, and is a greater
        punishment than that of sense: “And the unprofitable servant, cast out
        into the exterior darkness” [Mt 25:30]. The wicked in this life have
        interior darkness, namely sin; but then they shall also have exterior
        darkness.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Secondly, the damned shall suffer from remorse of conscience: “I will
        rebuke you, and set the charge before you” [Ps 49:21]. “Groaning for
        anguish of spirit” [Wis 5:3]. Nevertheless, their repentance and
        groaning will be of no avail, because it rises not from hatred of evil,
        but from fear and the enormity of their punishments. Thirdly, there is
        the great pain of sense. It is the fire of hell which tortures the soul
        and the body; and this, as the Saints tell us, is the sharpest of all
        punishments. They shall be ever dying, and yet never die; hence it is
        called eternal death, for as dying is the bitterest of pains, such will
        be the lot of those in hell: “They are laid in the underworld like
        sheep; death shall feed upon them” [Ps 48:15]. Fourthly, there is the
        despair of their salvation. If some hope of delivery from their
        punishments would be given them, their punishment would be somewhat
        lessened; but since all hope is withdrawn from them, their sufferings
        are made most intense: “Their worm shall not die, and their fire shall
        not be quenched.[Is 46:24].<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        We thus see the difference between doing good and doing evil. Good works
        lead to life, evil drags us to death. For this reason, men ought
        frequently to recall these things to mind, since they will incite one to
        do good and withdraw one from evil. Therefore, very significantly, at
        the end of the Creed is placed “life everlasting,” so that it would be
        more and more deeply impressed on the memory. To this life everlasting
        may the Lord Jesus Christ, blessed God for ever, bring us! Amen.<br /></p
