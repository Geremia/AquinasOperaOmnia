                                    first way for the power of God Himself, who

                                    because the capacity for forgiveness on the

                                                excusat peccatum ut non sit

                                                Holy Spirit which were numbered

                                                until death. In this, the sin
                                                against the Holy Spirit is said
                                                to be unforgivable because in no
                                                way is it forgiven or can be
                                                forgiven, since after death man

                                                sin, according to what he was in
                                                the moment of his death, as
                                                Ecclesiastes 11:3 states "In

                                                either against the Father or the
                                                Son, which endures right up
                                                until death is unforgivable.
                                                Thus the sin against the Holy
                                                Spirit would not be unforgivable
                                                in a way different from (the

                                                be said that every sin against
                                                the Father or the Son is a
                                                venial sin. For Gregory says in
                                                his <i>4th. Dialogue</i> that
                                                even venial sins are forgiven
                                                after this life. However, this
                                                is expressly false since
                                                ignorance does not thus always
                                                excuse from sin so that it is
                                                not damnable, but rather so that
                                                it might be less damnable. For
                                                this reason, others state that
                                                impenitence, which designates
                                                the continuous duration in sin
                                                right up until death, need not
                                                be (a necessary condition for a
                                                sin being) a sin against the
                                                Holy Spirit. For even in one
                                                sole movement of the will, a man
                                                can sin against the Holy Spirit,
                                                as occurs with certain
                                                sins.</font
