        176. With a view to the science under investigation we must attack first
        those subjects which must first be investigated. These are all the
        subjects about which some men have entertained different opinions, and
        any other besides these which has been omitted.
      </p>
      <p>
        177. Now for those who wish to investigate the truth it is worth the
        while to ponder these difficulties well. For the subsequent study of
        truth is nothing else than the solution of earlier problems. For it is
        impossible to untie a knot without knowing it. But a perplexity on the
        part of the mind makes this evident in regard to the matter at hand; for
        insofar as the mind is perplexed, to that extent it experiences
        something similar to men who are bound; for in both cases it is
        impossible to move forward. For this reason, then, it is first necessary
        to consider all the difficulties and the reasons for them.
      </p>
      <p>
        178. [This is also necessary] for another reason, namely, that those who
        make investigations without first recognizing the problem are like those
        who do not know where they ought to go.
      </p>
      <p>
        179. Again, one would not even know when he finds the thing which he is
        seeking [and when not]; for the goal is not evident to such a man, but
        it is evident to one who previously discussed the difficulties.
      </p>
      <p>
        180. Furthermore, one who has heard all the arguments of the litigants,
        as it were, and of those who argue the question, is necessarily in a
        better position to pass judgment.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        338. Having indicated in Book II (331) the method of considering the
        truth, the Philosopher now proceeds with his
        <span style="font-weight: bold">study of the truth</span>. First he
        proceeds <span style="font-weight: bold">disputatively</span>,
        indicating those points which are open to question so far as the truth
        of things is concerned. Second (529), he begins to establish what is
        true, and he does this in Book IV, which begins: “There is a certain
        science.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The first part is divided into two sections. In the first, he states
        what he intends to do. In the second (346), he proceeds to do it (“The
        first problem”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he states what he
        intends to do. Second (339), he gives the reasons for this (“Now for
        those”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He says first, then, that with a view to this science which we are
        seeking about first principles and what is universally true of things,
        we must attack, first of all, those subjects about which it is necessary
        to raise questions before the truth is established. Now there are
        <span style="font-weight: bold">disputed points</span> of this kind for
        two reasons, either because the ancient philosophers entertained a
        different opinion about these things than is really true, or because
        they completely neglected to consider them.
      </p>
      <p>339. <b>Now for those</b> (177).</p>
      <p>Here he gives four arguments in support of this thesis:</p>
      <p>
        First, he says that for those who wish to investigate the truth it is
        “worth the while,” i.e., worth the effort, “to ponder these difficulties
        well,” i.e., to examine carefully those matters which are open to
        question. This is necessary because the subsequent study of truth is
        nothing else than the solution of earlier difficulties. Now in loosening
        a physical knot it is evident that one who is unacquainted with this
        knot cannot loosen it. But a difficulty about some subject is related to
        the mind as a physical knot is to the body, and manifests the same
        effect. For insofar as the mind is puzzled about some subject, it
        experiences something similar to those who are tightly bound. For just
        as one whose feet are tied cannot move forward on an earthly road, in a
        similar way one who is puzzled, and whose mind is bound, as it were,
        cannot move forward on the road of speculative knowledge. Therefore,
        just as one who wishes to loosen a physical knot must first of all
        inspect the knot and the way in which it is tied, in a similar way
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >one who wants to solve a problem must first survey all the
          difficulties and the reasons for them</span
        >.
      </p>
      <p>340. <b>[This is also necessary]</b> (178).</p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the second argument. He says that
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >those who wish to investigate the truth without first considering the
          problem are like those who do not know where they are going</span
        >. This is true for this reason, that, just as the terminus of a journey
        is the goal intended by one who travels on foot, in a similar way the
        solution of a problem is the goal intended by one who is seeking the
        truth. But it is evident that one who does not know where he is going
        cannot go there directly, except perhaps by chance. Therefore, neither
        can one seek the truth directly unless he first sees the problem.
      </p>
      <p>341. <b>Again, one would</b> (179).</p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the third argument. He says that, just as one who is
        ignorant of where he is going does not know whether he should stop or go
        further when he reaches his appointed goal, in a similar way
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >one who does not know beforehand the problem whose solution marks the
          terminus of his search cannot know when he finds the truth which he is
          seeking and when not</span
        >. For he does not know what the goal of his investigations is, but this
        is evident to one who knew the problem beforehand.
      </p>
      <p>342. <b>Furthermore</b> (180).</p>
      <p>
        He gives the fourth argument, which is taken from the viewpoint of a
        judge. For a judge must pass judgment on the things which he hears. But
        just as one can pass judgment in a lawsuit only if he hears the
        arguments on both sides, in a similar way one who has to
        <span style="font-weight: bold">pass judgment</span> on a philosophy is
        necessarily in a better position to do so
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >if he will hear all the arguments</span
        >, as it were, of the disputants.
      </p>
      <p>
        343. Now it must be noted that it was for these reasons that Aristotle
        was accustomed, in nearly all his works, to set forth the problems which
        emerge before investigating and establishing what is true. But while in
        other works Aristotle sets down the problems one at a time in order to
        establish the truth about each one, in this work he sets forth
        <span style="font-weight: bold">all the problems at once</span>, and
        afterwards in the proper order establishes the things that are true. The
        reason for this is that other sciences consider the truth in a
        particular way, and therefore it belongs to them to raise problems of a
        particular kind about individual truths. But just as it belongs to this
        science to make a universal study of truth, so also does it belong to it
        to discuss all the problems which pertain to the truth. Therefore it
        does not discuss its problems one at a time but all at once.
      </p>
      <p>
        344. There can also be another reason [why Aristotle proceeds in this
        way], namely, that those problems on which he touches are chiefly those
        about which the philosophers have held different opinions. However, he
        does not proceed to investigate the truth in the same order as the other
        philosophers did. For
        <span style="text-decoration: underline"
          >he begins with things which are sensible and evident and proceeds to
          those which are separate from matter</span
        >, as is evident below in Book VII (1566), whereas the other
        philosophers wanted to apply intelligible and abstract principles to
        sensible things. Hence, because he did not intend to establish the truth
        in the same order as that followed by the other philosophers, and from
        whose views these problems arise, he therefore decided to give first all
        the problems in a separate section, and afterwards to solve these
        problems in their proper order.
      </p>
      <p>
        345. Averroes gives another reason [for Aristotle’s procedure]. He says
        that Aristotle proceeds in this way because of the relationship of this
        science to logic, which will be touched on below in Book IV (588); and
        therefore he made dialectical discussion a principal part of this
        science.<br /></p

      </p>
      <p>
        181. The first problem concerns the things about which we raised
        questions in our introductory statements, i.e., whether it belongs to
        one science or to many to speculate about the causes.
      </p>
      <p>
        182. And there is also the problem whether it belongs to this science to
        know only the principles of substance, or also the principles on which
        all sciences base their demonstrations, e.g., whether it is possible to
        affirm and deny one and the same thing at the same time or not; and
        other such principles. And if this science deals with substance, there
        is the question whether one science deals with all substances, or many
        sciences. And if many, whether all are cognate, or whether some should
        be called wisdom and others something else.
      </p>
      <p>
        183. It is also necessary to inquire whether sensible substances alone
        must be said to exist, or whether there are other substances in addition
        to these; and whether they are unique, or whether there are many classes
        of substances, aswas claimed by those who created the Forms and made the
        objects of mathematics an intermediate class between these Forms and
        sensible substances. As we have said, then, it is necessary to examine
        these questions.
      </p>
      <p>
        184. There is also the problem whether this speculation has to do with
        substances alone or also with the proper accidents of substances. And we
        must inquire about sameness and difference, likeness and unlikeness,
        contrariety, priority and posteriority, and all other such things which
        the dialecticians attempt to treat (basing their investigations only on
        probabilities); for to them too it belongs to theorize about all these
        things. Furthermore, we must investigate all those essential accidents
        of these same things; and not only what each one of them is, but also
        whether there is one contrary for each one.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p><i>Q. 1: Does this science make use of all four causes?</i></p>
      <p>
        346. Following out his announced plan, the Philosopher begins to set
        down the problems which are encountered in establishing the truth; and
        he divides this into two parts. In the first, he gives these problems;
        and in the second (369), he gives the reasons for these problems, by
        indicating the arguments on either side of the question (“Therefore let
        us discuss”).
      </p>
      <p>
        Now it was stated in Book II (335) that it is necessary to seek the
        method of a science before seeking the science itself. Therefore he
        gives, first, the problems which pertain to this science’s method of
        investigation. Second (355), he gives the problems which pertain to the
        first principles with which this science deals, as has been stated in
        Book I (36) (“And we must inquire”).
      </p>
      <p>
        Now a science is concerned with two things, as was said in Book II
        (336), namely, a study of the causes by which it demonstrates and the
        things with which it deals. Hence in regard to the first point he does
        two things. First, he presents a problem concerning the investigation of
        causes. Second (347), he presents several problems concerning the things
        with which this science deals (“And there is also the problem”)
      </p>
      <p>
        He says, then, that the first problem is one which we proposed in the
        issues raised at the end of Book II (336), which is, so to speak, the
        prologue to the whole of science, i.e., whether a study of the four
        causes in their four classes belongs to one science or to many different
        sciences And this is to ask whether it belongs to one science, and
        especially to this science, to demonstrate by means of all the causes,
        or rather whether some sciences demonstrate by one cause and some by
        another.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i
          >Q. 2: Does it consider both principles of substance and principles of
          knowledge?</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>347. <b>And there is also the problem</b> (182).</p>
      <p>
        Here he raises problems about the things which this science considers.
        First, he inquires about the things which this science considers about
        substances; and second (350), about substances themselves (“It is also
        necessary”). In regard to the first he raises three questions. For if it
        is supposed, from what was said in Book I (35), that this science
        considers first principles, the first question here will be whether it
        belongs to this science to know only the first principles of substances,
        or also to consider the first principles of demonstration, by means of
        which all sciences demonstrate. For example, should this science
        consider whether it is possible to affirm and deny one and the same
        thing at the same time or not? And the same thing applies to the other
        first and self-evident principles of demonstration.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i
          >Q. 3: Is its subject all substances, or do different sciences
          consider different substances?</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        348. And if this science considers substance as the primary kind of
        being, the second question is whether there is one science which
        considers all substances, or whether there are many sciences which
        consider different substances. For it seems that there should be many
        sciences which consider many substances.
      </p>
      <p><i>Q. 4: Is it distinct from other sciences?</i></p>
      <p>
        349. And if there are many sciences which consider many substances, the
        third question is whether all are “cognate,” i.e., whether all belong to
        one class, as geometry and arithmetic belong to the class of
        mathematical science, or whether they do not, but some to the class of
        wisdom and some to another class, for example, to the class of natural
        philosophy or to that of mathematical science. For according to the
        first point of view it seems that they do not belong to one class, since
        material and immaterial substances are not known by the same method.
      </p>
      <p><i>Q. 5. Are there immaterial substances, and of what kind?</i></p>
      <p>350. <b>It is also necessary</b> (183).</p>
      <p>
        Here he adds to the number of questions about substance; and he does
        this by raising two questions. The first question is whether sensible
        substances alone must be held to exist, as the philosophers of nature
        claimed, or whether there are in addition to sensible substances other
        immaterial and intelligible substances, as Plato claimed.
      </p>
      <p>
        351. And if there are some substances separate from sensible things, the
        second question is whether “they are unique,” i.e., whether they belong
        only to one class, or whether there are many classes of such substances.
        For certain men, understanding that there is a twofold abstraction,
        namely, of the universal from the particular, and of the mathematical
        form from sensible matter, held that each class is self-subsistent. Thus
        they held that there are separate substances which are subsisting
        abstract universals, and between these and particular sensible
        substances they placed the objects of mathematics—numbers, continuous
        quantities, and figures—which they regarded as separate subsisting
        things. Concerning the questions which have now been raised, then, it is
        necessary to investigate them below. He does this, first, by arguing
        both sides of the question, and, second, by determining its truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i
          >Q. 6: Does this science consider accidents or properties of
          substance?</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>352. <b>There is also the problem</b> (184).</p>
      <p>
        Here he asks whether this science’s investigations extend to accidents;
        and he raises three questions. The first is whether this science, seeing
        that it is called the philosophy of substance, speculates about
        substance alone, or whether it also speculates about the proper
        accidents of substance; for it seems to be the office of the same
        science to consider a subject and the proper accidents of that subject.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Q. 7: How does it differ from logic in considering these things?</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        353. The second question is whether this science considers certain
        things which seem to be proper accidents of being and which belong to
        all beings, namely, sameness and difference, likeness and unlikeness,
        contrariety, priority, and posteriority, and all others of this kind
        which are treated by the dialecticians, who deal with all things.
        However, they do not examine such things according to necessary premises
        but according to probable ones. For from one point of view it seems
        that, since these accidents are common ones, they pertain to
        first-philosophy; but from another point of view it seems that, since
        they are considered by the dialecticians, whose office it is to argue
        from Probabilities, an examination of them does not belong to the
        consideration of the philosopher, whose office it is to demonstrate.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Q. 8: Does it consider how these accidents are inter-related?</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        354. And since certain proper attributes naturally flow from these
        common accidents of being, the third question is whether it is the
        function of the philosopher to consider in regard to the common
        accidents only their quiddity or also their properties; for example,
        whether there is one opposite for each one.<br /></p

        185. And we must inquire whether it is genera that constitute the
        principles and elements of things, or the parts into which each existing
        thing is divided. And if it is genera, whether it is those that are
        predicated of individuals first or last. And we must also inquire
        whether animal or man is a principle, and exists more truly than the
        singular.
      </p>
      <p>
        186. But most of all it is necessary to investigate and treat the
        question whether besides matter there is any cause in the proper sense
        or not; and whether it is separable or not; and whether it is
        numerically one or many. And we must ask whether there is anything
        besides the <i>synolon</i> (and by <i>synolon</i> I mean matter when
        something is predicated of it), or nothing; or whether this is true of
        some things but not of others, [and what these things are].
      </p>
      <p>
        187. Further, we must inquire whether the principles of things are
        limited in number or in kind, both those in the intelligible structures
        of things and those in the underlying subject; and whether the
        principles of corruptible and of incorruptible things are the same or
        different; and whether they are all incorruptible, or whether those of
        corruptible things are corruptible. And the most difficult question of
        all, and the most disputed one, is whether unity and being are not
        something different from the substances of existing things, as the
        Pythagoreans and Plato say, or whether this is not the case, but the
        underlying subject is something different,” as Empedocles holds of love,
        another thinker of fire, another of water, and another of air. And we
        must inquire whether the principles of things are universals or singular
        things.
      </p>
      <p>
        188. Again, we must inquire whether they exist potentially or actually.
        And also whether they are principles of things in some other way or in
        reference to motion; for these questions present great difficulty.
      </p>
      <p>
        189. And in addition to these questions we must inquire whether numbers
        or lengths and points are somehow substances or not. And if they are
        substances, whether they are separate from sensible things or are found
        in them. Concerning all these matters it is not only difficult to
        discover what is true, but it is not even easy to state the problems
        well.

          genera?</i

      </p>
      <p>
        355. Having raised questions pertaining to the method of investigation
        which this science uses, the Philosopher now raises questions pertaining
        to the things which this science considers. And since this science
        considers first principles, as has been stated in Book I (35), he
        therefore raises here questions pertaining to the principles of things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now both the Forms and the objects of mathematics were held to be the
        first principles of things. Therefore, first, he raises questions
        concerning the Forms; and second (366), concerning the objects of
        mathematics (“And in addition to these”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he asks what things
        are principles; and second (361), what sort of beings they are
        (“Further, we must inquire”).
      </p>
      <p>
        And since separate universals were held to be the principles of things,
        he asks, first, whether universals are the principles of things; and
        second (357), whether separate entities are the principles of things
        (“But most of all”).
      </p>
      <p>
        Concerning the first he asks two questions. The first is whether genera
        constitute the principles and elements of things, or the ultimate parts
        into which each individual thing is dissolved. This question arises
        because an element is that of which a thing is first composed and into
        which it is ultimately dissolved. Now we find a twofold mode of
        composition and dissolution. One has to do with the intelligible
        constitution, in which species are resolved into genera, and according
        to this mode genera seem to be the principles and elements of things, as
        Plato claimed. The other mode of composition and dissolution has to do
        with the real order; for example, natural bodies are composed of fire,
        air, water and earth, and are dissolved into these. It was for this
        reason that the natural philosophers claimed that the elements
        constitute the first principles of things.
      </p>
      <p>
        356. And assuming that genera are the principles of things, the second
        question is whether the principles of things are to be identified with
        the universals which are predicated of individual things, i.e., the
        lowest species, which he calls genera after the usage of the Platonists,
        because the lowest species contain under themselves many individuals
        just as genera contain many species; or whether it is rather the first
        and most common genera that constitute principles, for example, which of
        the two is more of a principle, animal or man; for man is a principle
        according to the Platonists, and is more real than any singular man. Now
        this problem arises because of two divisions which reason makes. One of
        these is that whereby we divide genera into species, and the other is
        that whereby we resolve species into genera. For it seems that whatever
        is the last term in a process of division is always the first principle
        and element in a process of composition.
      </p>
      <p><i>Q. 10: Is there an immaterial principle? Is it one or many?</i></p>
      <p>357. <b>But most of all</b> (186).</p>
      <p>
        Here he inquires whether separate entities are the principles of things;
        and he raises four questions. For since the first philosophers of nature
        posited only a material cause, the first question is whether besides
        matter there is anything else that is a cause in the proper sense or
        not.
      </p>
      <p>
        358. And granted that there is some other cause besides matter, the
        second question is whether it is separable from matter, as Plato held,
        or as Pythagoras held.
      </p>
      <p>
        359. And if there is something separable from matter, the third question
        is whether it is a single thing, as Anaxagoras claimed, or many, as
        Plato and Aristotle himself claimed.
      </p>
      <p><i>Q. 11: Is individuality distinct from the specific form?</i></p>
      <p>
        360. The fourth question is whether there is anything “besides the
        <i>synolon</i>,” i.e., the concrete whole, or nothing; or whether there
        is something in certain cases and not in others; and what kind of things
        they are in those cases in which there is something else, and what kind
        of things they are in those in which there is not. And he explains what
        a <i>synolon</i> or concrete whole is; i.e., it is matter when something
        is predicated of it. Now in order to understand this we must note that
        Plato claimed that man and horse, and universals which are predicated in
        this way, are certain separate Forms; and that man is predicated of
        Socrates or Plato by reason of the fact that sensible matter
        participates in a separate Form. Hence Socrates or Plato is called a
        synolon or concrete whole, because each is constituted as a result of
        matter participating in a separate form. And each is, as it were, a kind
        of predicate of matter. Hence the Philosopher asks here whether the
        whatness of the individual thing is something else in addition to the
        individual thing itself, or not; or also whether it is something rise in
        the case of some things and not in that of others. The Philosopher will
        answer this question in Book VII (7356).
      </p>
      <p>361. <b>Further, we must inquire</b> (187).</p>
      <p>
        Here he raises questions about the way in which principles exist. And
        since being is divided by the one and many, and by act and potency, he
        asks, first, whether these principles are
        <span style="font-weight: bold">one or many</span>; and second (365),
        whether they are actual or potential (“Again, we must inquire”). In
        regard to the first he asks four questions:
      </p>
      <p>
        <i
          >Q. 12 The first is whether the principles of things are limited in
          number or in kind</i
        >; as we say, for example, that there are three principles of nature.
        Now the statement that they are limited in number can mean that the
        principle of nature is numerically a single form and a single matter and
        privation. And the statement that they are limited in kind can mean that
        there are many material principles which have in common the specific
        nature of material principle, and so on for the rest. And since some of
        the philosophers, such as the Platonists, attributed formal causes to
        things, while others, such as the ancient natural philosophers,
        attributed only material causes to things, he adds that this question is
        applicable both “in the intelligible structures,” i.e., in formal
        causes, “and in the underlying subject,” i.e., in material causes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i
          >Q. 13: Are the principles of corruptible and incorruptible things the
          same or different?</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        362. (2) The second question is whether the principles of corruptible
        and of incorruptible things are the same or different. And if they are
        different, whether all are incorruptible, or whether the principles of
        corruptible things are corruptible and those of incorruptible things are
        incorruptible.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i
          >Q. 14: Are “one” and “being” the same as or distinct from specific
          natures?</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        363. (3) The third question is whether unity and being signify the very
        substance of things and not something added to the substance of things,
        as the Pythagoreans and Platonists claimed; or whether they do not
        signify the substance of things, but something else is the subject of
        unity and being, for example, fire or air or something else of this
        kind, as the ancient philosophers of nature held. Now he says that this
        question is the most difficult and most puzzling one, because on this
        question depends the entire thought of Plato and Pythagoras, who held
        that numbers are the substance of things.
      </p>
      <p>
        364. The fourth question is whether the principles of things are
        “somehow universals or are in some sense singular things,” i.e., whether
        those things which are held to be principles have the character of a
        principle in the sense of a universal intelligible nature, or according
        as each is a particular and singular thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        365.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Again, we must inquire</span> (188).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he asks whether these principles exist potentially or actually.
        This question seems to refer especially to material principles; for it
        can be a matter of dispute whether the first material principle is some
        actual body, such as fire or air, as the ancient philosophers of nature
        held, or something which is only potential, as Plato held. And since
        motion is the actualization of something in potency, and is, in a sense,
        midway between potentiality and actuality, he therefore adds another
        question: whether the principles of things are causes only in reference
        to motion, as the philosophers of nature posited only principles of
        motion, either material or efficient, or also whether they are
        principles which act in some other way than by motion, as Plato claimed
        that sensible things are caused by immaterial entities by a certain
        participation in these. Futhermore, he says that these questions have
        been raised because they present the greatest difficulty, as is clear
        from the manner in which the philosophers have disagreed about them.
      </p>
      <p>
        366.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">And in addition to these</span> (189).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he raises questions concerning the objects of mathematics, which
        are posited as the principles of things. He raises two questions. The
        first is whether numbers, lengths, figures and points are somehow
        substances, as the Pythagoreans or Platonists held, or whether they are
        not, as the philosophers of nature held.
      </p>
      <p>
        367. And if they are substances, the second question is whether they are
        separate from sensible things, as the Platonists held, or exist in
        sensible things, as the Pythagoreans held.
      </p>
      <p>
        368. Now these questions are raised as problems which must be debated
        and settled below, because in these matters it is not only difficult to
        discover the truth, but it is not even easy to debate the matter
        adequately by finding probable arguments for either side of the
        question.<br /></p

      </p>
      <p>
        190. Therefore let us discuss first the problem about which we first
        spoke (181): whether it is the office of one science or of many to study
        all the classes of causes.
      </p>
      <p>
        191. For how will it be the office of one science to come to principles
        since they are not contrary?
      </p>
      <p>
        192. Furthermore, in the case of many existing things not all the
        principles are present. For how can a principle of motion be present in
        all immobile things, or how can the nature of the good be found there?
        For everything which is a good in itself and by reason of its own nature
        is an end and thus a cause, because it is for its sake that other things
        come to be and exist. Further, the end and that for the sake of which
        something comes to be is the terminus of some action. But all actions
        involve motion. Therefore it would be impossible for this principle to
        be present in immobile things, nor could there be an <i>autoagathon</i>,
        i.e., a good in itself. Hence in mathematics too nothing is proved by
        means of this cause, nor is there any demonstration on the grounds that
        a thing is better or worse. Nor does anyone make any mention at all of
        anything of this kind. And for this reason some of the Sophists, for
        example, Aristippus, disregarded these. For in the other arts, even in
        the servile ones, such as building and cobbling, all things are to be
        explained on the grounds that they are better or worse; but the
        mathematical sciences give no account of things which are good or evil.
      </p>
      <p>
        193. But on the other hand, if there are many sciences of the causes,
        and different sciences for different principles, which of these must be
        said to be the one that is being sought, or which one of those who have
        them is best informed about the subject under investigation?
      </p>
      <p>
        194. For it is possible for the same thing to have all the classes of
        causes; for example, in the case of a house the source of motion is the
        art and the builder, the reason for which is its function, the matter is
        earth and stones, and the form is the plan.
      </p>
      <p>
        195. Therefore, from the things which were established a little while
        ago (14-26:C 36-51) as to which of the sciences one should call wisdom,
        there is reason for calling every one of them such. For inasmuch as
        wisdom takes precedence and is a more authoritative science, and one
        which the others, like slaves, have no right to contradict, then the
        science which deals with the end and the good is such a science, because
        other things are for the sake of this.
      </p>
      <p>
        196. But insofar as wisdom has been defined (24:C 49) as the science of
        first causes and of what is most knowable, such a science will be about
        substance. For while a subject may be known in many ways, we say that he
        who knows what a thing is in its being knows it better than he who knows
        it in its nonbeing. And in the former case one knows better than
        another, especially he who knows what a thing is, and not how great it
        is or of what sort it is or anything that it is naturally disposed to do
        or to undergo. Further, in the case of other things too we think that we
        know every single thing, and those of which there are demonstrations,
        when we know what each is, for example, what squaring is, because it is
        finding the middle term. The same thing is true in other cases.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        197. But with regard to processes of generation and actions and every
        change, we think that we know these perfectly when we know the principle
        of motion. But this differs from and is opposite to the end of motion.
        And for this reason it seems to be the province of a different science
        to speculate about each one of these causes.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p><i>Q 1: Can one science consider many causes?</i></p>
      <p>
        369. Having raised the questions which cause difficulty in this science,
        Aristotle begins here to treat them dialectically. This is divided into
        three parts. In the first part, he treats the questions which pertain to
        the method of investigation of this science. In the second (403), he
        treats the questions which pertain to substances (“Furthermore, there
        is”). In the third (423), he treats the questions which pertain to the
        principles of substances (“Concerning the principles”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does three things. First, he argues
        dialectically about this science’s method of investigation, with
        reference to the causes by means of which it demonstrates; second (387),
        with reference to the first principles of demonstration (“But insofar”);
        and third (393), with reference to substances themselves (“And there is
        the problem”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he takes up again the
        question about which he plans to argue
        <span style="font-weight: bold">dialectically</span>, concluding from
        the order in which the questions have been listed that it is necessary
        first to debate those issues which were stated first in the list of
        questions, namely, whether it is the function of one science or of many
        to investigate all the classes of causes; so that in this way the order
        of argument corresponds to the order in which the questions have been
        raised.
      </p>
      <p>
        370. <span style="font-weight: bold">For how will it be</span> (191).
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, he gives the arguments relating to this question; and in regard
        to this he does three things. First (191), he gives an argument for the
        purpose of showing that it is not the office of a single science to
        consider all the classes of causes. Second (193:C 376), assuming that it
        belongs to different sciences to consider the different classes of
        causes, he asks which class of cause it is that is investigated by first
        philosophy. He argues on both sides of this question (“But on the other
        hand”). Third (197:C 386), he draws from this second dispute the
        conclusion of the first arguments (“But-with regard to”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first (191) he gives two arguments. He says that since
        it belongs to one science to consider contraries, how will it belong to
        one science to consider principles since they are not contrary? This
        view, if it is considered superficially, seems to be of no importance;
        for it appears to follow from the destruction of the antecedent, as if
        one were to argue thus: if principles are contraries, they belong to one
        science; therefore, if they are not contraries, they do not belong to
        one science.
      </p>
      <p>
        371. Therefore it can be said that in these disputes the Philosopher not
        only uses probable arguments but sometimes also uses sophistical ones
        when he gives arguments introduced by others. But it does not seem
        reasonable that in such an important matter so great a Philosopher would
        have introduced an argument which is both trifling and insignificant.
        Hence a different explanation must be given, namely, that if one rightly
        considers the nature of the various things which belong to the same
        science, some belong to a single science-insofar as they are different,
        but others insofar as they are reduced to some one thing. Hence many
        other different things are found to belong to one science insofar as
        they are reduced to one thing, for example, to one whole, one cause, or
        one subject. But contraries and all opposites belong essentially to one
        science by reason of the fact that one is the means of knowing the
        other. And from this comes this probable proposition that all different
        things which are contraries belong to one science. Therefore, if
        principles were different and were not contraries, it would follow that
        they would not belong to one science.
      </p>
      <p>
        372.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Furthermore, in the case of</span>
        (192).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the second argument, which runs thus. In the case of
        different things which belong to one science, whatever science considers
        one also considers another. This is evident in the case of contraries,
        which are different and belong essentially to one science without being
        reduced to some other unity. But not every science which considers one
        cause considers all causes. Therefore the study of all the causes does
        not belong to a single science.
      </p>
      <p>
        373. He proves the minor premise thus: Different sciences deal with
        different beings, and there are many beings to which all the causes
        cannot be assigned. He makes this dear, first, with regard to that cause
        which is called the source of motion; for it does not seem that there
        can be a principle of motion in immobile things. Now certain immobile
        things are posited, especially by the Platonists, who claim that numbers
        and substances are separate entities. Hence, if any science considers
        these, it cannot consider the cause which is the source of motion.
      </p>
      <p>
        374. Second, he shows that the same thing is true of the final cause,
        which has the character of good. For it does not seem that the character
        of goodness can be found in immobile things, if it is conceded that
        everything which is good in itself and by reason of its own nature is an
        end. And it is a cause in the sense that all things come to be and exist
        because of it and for its sake. However, he says “everything which is
        good in itself and by reason of its own nature” in order to exclude the
        useful good, which is not predicated of the end but of the means to the
        end. Hence those things which are said to be good only in the sense that
        they are useful for something else are not good in themselves and by
        reason of their own nature. For example, a bitter potion is not good in
        itself but only insofar as it is directed to the end, health, which is a
        good in itself. But an end, or that for the sake of which something
        comes to be, seems to be the terminus of an action. But all actions seem
        to involve motion. Therefore it seems to follow that this principle,
        i.e., the final cause, which has the character of goodness, cannot exist
        in immobile things. Further, since those things which exist of
        themselves apart from matter must be immobile, it therefore does not
        seem possible that “an autoagathon,” i.e., a good-in-itself, exists, as
        Plato held. For he called all immaterial and unparticipated things
        entities which exist of themselves, just as he called the Idea of man,
        man-in-himself, as though not something participated in matter. Hence he
        also called the good-in-itself that which is its own goodness
        unparticipated, namely, the first principle of all things.
      </p>
      <p>
        375. Moreover, with a view to strengthening this argument he introduces
        an example. For, from the fact that there cannot be an end in the case
        of immobile things, it seems to follow that in the mathematical
        sciences, which abstract from matter and motion, nothing is proved by
        means of this cause, as in the science of nature, which deals with
        mobile things, something is proved by means of the notion of good. For
        example, we may give as the reason why man has hands that by them he is
        more capable of executing the things which reason conceives. But in the
        mathematical sciences no demonstration is made in this way, that
        something is so because it is better for it to be so, or worse if it
        were not so; as if one were to say, for example, that the angle in a
        semi-circle is a right angle because it is better that it should be so
        than be acute or obtuse. And because there can be, perhaps, another way
        of demonstrating by means of the final cause (for example, if one were
        to say that, if an, end is to be, then what exists for the sake of an
        end must first be), he therefore adds that in the mathematical sciences
        no one makes any mention at all of any of those things which pertain to
        the good or to the final cause. And for this reason certain sophists, as
        Aristippus, who belonged to the Epicurean school, completely disregarded
        any demonstrations which employ final causes, considering them to be
        worthless in view of the fact that in the servile or mechanical arts,
        for example, in the “art of building,” i.e., in carpentry, and in that
        of “cobbling,” all things are explained on the grounds that something is
        better or worse; whereas in the mathematical sciences, which are the
        noblest and most certain of the sciences, no mention is made of things
        good and evil.
      </p>
      <p>
        376. <span style="font-weight: bold">But on the other hand</span> (193).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he interjects another question. First, he states this question,
        which has two parts. The first part of the question is this. If
        different causes are considered by many sciences, so that a different
        science considers a different cause, then which of these sciences should
        be called the one “that is being sought,” i.e., first philosophy? Is it
        the one which considers the formal cause, or the one which considers the
        final cause, or the one which considers one of the other causes? The
        second part of the question is this: If there are some things which have
        many causes, which one of those who consider those causes knows that
        subject best?
      </p>
      <p>
        377. <span style="font-weight: bold">For it is possible</span> (194).
      </p>
      <p>
        He clarifies the second part of the question by the fact that one and
        the same thing is found to have every type of cause. For example, in the
        case of a house the source of motion is the art and the builder; the
        reason, for which, or the final cause of the house, “is its function,”
        i.e., its use, which is habitation; its material cause is the earth,
        from which the walls and floor are made; and its specifying or formal
        cause is the plan of the house, which the architect, after first
        conceiving it in his mind, gives to matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        378.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Therefore from the things</span> (195)
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he takes up again the question as to which of the aforesaid
        sciences we can call wisdom on the basis of the points previously
        established about wisdom at the beginning of this work (14:C 36),
        namely, whether it is the science which considers the formal cause, or
        the one which considers the final cause, or the one which considers one
        of the other causes. And he gives in order arguments relating to each of
        the three causes, saying that there seems to be some reason why “every
        oxie of the sciences,” i.e., any one which proceeds by means of any
        cause at all, should be called by the name of wisdom. First, he speaks
        of that science which proceeds by means of the final cause. For it was
        stated at the beginning of this work that this science, which is called
        wisdom, is the most authoritative one, and the one which directs others
        as subordinates. Therefore, inasmuch as wisdom “takes precedence,” i.e.,
        is prior in the order of dignity and more influential in its
        authoritative direction of the other sciences (because it is not right
        that the others should contradict it but they should take their
        principles from it as its servants), it seems that that science “which
        deals with the end and the good,” i.e., the one which proceeds by means
        of the final cause, is worthy of the name of wisdom. And this is true
        because everything else exists for the sake of the end, so that in a
        sense the end is the cause of all the other causes. Thus the science
        which proceeds by means of the final cause is the most important one.
        This is indicated by the fact that those arts which are concerned with
        ends are more important than and prior to the other arts; for example,
        the art of navigation is more important than and prior to the art of
        ship-building. Hence, if wisdom is pre-eminent and regulative of the
        other sciences, it seems that it proceeds especially by means of the
        final cause.
      </p>
      <p>
        379. <span style="font-weight: bold">But insofar as wisdom</span> (196).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he introduces the arguments relating to the formal cause. For it
        was said in the prologue of this work (26:C 51) that wisdom is concerned
        with first causes and with whatever is most knowable and most certain.
        And according to this it seems to be concerned with “substance,” i.e.,
        it proceeds by means of the formal cause. For among the different ways
        of knowing things, we say that he who knows that something exists, knows
        more perfectly than he who knows that it does not exist. Hence in the
        <i>Posterior Analytics</i> the Philosopher proves that an affirmative
        demonstration is preferable to a negative demonstration. And among those
        who know something affirmatively, we say that one knows more perfectly
        than another. But we say that he knows more perfectly than any of the
        others who knows what a thing is, and not he who knows how great it is,
        or what it is like, or what it can do or undergo. Therefore, to know a
        thing itself in the most perfect way absolutely is to know what it is,
        and this is to know its substance. But even in knowing other things, for
        example, a thing’s properties, we say that we know best every single
        thing about which there are demonstrations when we also know the
        whatness of their accidents and properties; because whatness is found
        not only in substance but also in accidents.
      </p>
      <p>
        380. He gives the example of squaring, i.e., squaring a surface of
        equally distant sides which is not square but which we say we square
        when we find a square equal to it. But since every rectangular surface
        of equally distant sides is contained by the two lines which contain the
        right angle, so that the total surface is simply the product of the
        multiplication of one of these lines by the other, then we find a square
        equal to this surface when we find a line which is the proportional mean
        between these two lines. For example, if line A is to line B as line B
        is to line C, the square of line B is equal to the surface contained by
        C and A, as is proved in Book VI of Euclid’s <i>Elements</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        381. This becomes quite evident in the case of numbers. For 6 is the
        proportional mean between 9 and 4; for 9 is related to 6 in the ratio of
        11/2 to 1, and so also is 6 to 4. Now the square of 6 is 36, which is
        also produced by multiplying 4 by 9; for 4 x 9 = 36. And it is similar
        in all other cases.
      </p>
      <p>
        382.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">But with regard to processes</span>
        (197)
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he gives an argument pertaining to the cause of motion. For in
        processes of generation and actions and in every change we see that we
        may say that we know a thing when we know its principle of motion, and
        that motion is nothing else than the actuality of something mobile
        produced by a mover, as is stated in the <i>Physics</i>, Book III. He
        omits the material cause, however, because that cause is a principle of
        knowing in the most imperfect way; for the act of knowing is not caused
        by what is potential but by what is actual, as is stated below in Book
        IX (805:C 1894)
      </p>
      <p>
        383. Then after having given those arguments which pertain to the second
        question, he introduces an argument which is based on the same reasons
        as were given above (191:C 370 ff.) in reference to the first question,
        namely, that it is the office of a different science to consider all
        these causes by reason of the fact that in different subject-matters
        different causes seem to have the principal role, for example, the
        source of motion in mobile things, the quiddity in demonstrable things,
        and the end in things which are directed to an end.
      </p>
      <p>
        384. However, we do not find that Aristotle explicitly solves this
        question later on, though his solution can be ascertained from the
        things which he establishes below in different places. For in Book IV
        (533) he establishes that this science considers being as being, and
        therefore that it also belongs to it, and not to the philosophy of
        nature, to consider first substances; for there are other substances
        besides mobile ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        But every substance is either a being of itself, granted that it is only
        a form; or it is a being by its form, granted that it is composed of
        matter and form. Hence inasmuch as this science considers being, it
        considers the <span style="font-weight: bold">formal</span> cause before
        all the rest. But the first substances are not known by us in such a way
        that we know what they are, as can be understood in some way from the
        things established in Book IX (1904); and thus in our knowledge of them
        the formal cause has no place.
      </p>
      <p>
        But even though they are immobile in themselves, they are nevertheless
        the cause of motion in other things after the manner of an end. Hence
        inasmuch as this science considers first substances, it belongs to it
        especially to consider the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">final</span> cause and also in a way the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">efficient</span> cause.
      </p>
      <p>
        But to consider the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">material</span> cause in itself does not
        belong to it in any way, because matter is not properly a cause of being
        but of some definite kind of being, namely, mobile substance. However,
        such causes belong to the consideration of the particular sciences,
        unless perhaps they are considered by this science inasmuch as they are
        contained under being; for it extends its analysis to all things in this
        way.
      </p>
      <p>
        385. Now when these things are seen it is easy to answer the arguments
        which have been raised. For, first, nothing prevents the different
        causes in this science from belonging to a single existing thing, even
        though they are not contraries, because they are reducible to one
        thing—being in general—as has been stated (384).
      </p>
      <p>
        And in a similar way, even though not every science considers all of the
        causes, still nothing prevents one science from being able to consider
        all of the causes or several of them insofar as they are reducible to
        some one thing. But to be more specific, it must be said that in the
        case of immobile things nothing prevents the source of motion and the
        end or good from being investigated. By immobile things I mean here
        those which are still causes of motion, as the first substances.
        However, in the case of those things which are neither moved cause
        motion there is no investigation of the source of motion, or of the end
        in the sense of the end of motion, although an end can be considered as
        the goal of some operation which does not involve motion. For if there
        are held to be intellectual substances which do not cause motion, as the
        Platonists claimed, still insofar as they have an intellect and will it
        is necessary to hold that they have an end and a good which is the
        object of their will. However, the objects of mathematics neither are
        moved nor cause motion nor have a will. Hence in their case the good is
        not considered under the name of good and end, although in them we do
        consider what is good, namely, their being and what they are. Hence the
        statement that the good is not found in the objects of mathematics is
        false, as he proves below in Book IX (1888).
      </p>
      <p>
        386. The reply to the second question is already clear; for a study of
        the three causes, about which he argued dialectically, belongs to this
        science.<br /></p

      <p>
        198. But with respect to the principles of demonstration there is also
        the problem whether they are studied by one science or by many. By
        principles of demonstration I mean the common axioms from which fall]
        demonstrations proceed, e.g., “everything must either be affirmed or
        denied,” and “it is impossible both to be and not to be at the same
        time,” and all other such propositions. Is there one science which deals
        with these principles and with substance or are there different
        sciences? And, if not one, which of the two must be called the one that
        is now being sought?
      </p>
      <p>
        199. Now it would be unreasonable that these things should be studied by
        one science; for why should the study of these be proper to geometry
        rather than to any other science? In a similar way, then, if this study
        pertains to any science but cannot pertain to all, an understanding of
        these principles is no more proper to the science which studies
        substance than it is to any other science.
      </p>
      <p>
        200. But at the same time how will there be a science of these
        principles? For we already know what each one of them is; and therefore
        the other arts use them as something known. However, if there is
        demonstration of them, there will have to be some subject-genus, and
        some of the principles will have to be properties and others axioms. For
        there cannot be demonstration of all things, since demonstration must
        proceed from something, and be about something, and [be demonstration]
        of certain things. It follows, then, that there is a single genus of
        demonstrable things; for all demonstrative sciences use axioms.
      </p>
      <p>
        201. But on the other hand, if the science which considers substance
        differs from the one which considers axioms, which of these sciences is
        the more important and prior one? For axioms are most universal and are
        the principles of all things. And if it does not belong to the
        philosopher to establish the truth and falsity [of these principles], to
        what other person will it belong?
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        <i>Q. 2: Is the science of substance also that of first principles?</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        387. Having debated the first question which had to do with the study of
        causes, Aristotle’s intention here is to argue dialectically about the
        science which is concerned with the study of the first principles of
        demonstration; and in regard to this he does three things. First, he
        raises the question. Second (388), he argues one side of the question.
        Third (391), he argues on the other side of the question.
      </p>
      <p>
        Accordingly, he states, first, the problem relating to the first
        principles of demonstration, namely, whether the study of these
        principles belongs to one science or to many. Further, he explains what
        the principles of demonstration are, saying that they are the common
        conceptions of all men on which all demonstrations are based, i.e.,
        inasmuch as the particular principles of the proper demonstrated
        conclusions derive their stability from these common principles. And he
        gives an example of first principles, especially this one, that
        everything must either be affirmed or denied [of some subject]. Another
        principle which he mentions is that it is impossible for the same thing
        both to be and not to be at the same time. Hence the question arises
        whether these principles and similar ones pertain to one science or to
        many. And if they pertain to one science, whether they pertain to the
        science which investigates substance or to another science. And if to
        another science, then which of these must be called wisdom, or first
        philosophy, which we now seek.388. <b>Now it would be</b> (199).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he argues one side of the question with a view to showing that it
        is not the office of one science to consider all first principles, i.e.
        the first principles of demonstration and substance. He gives two
        arguments, of which the first runs thus: since all sciences employ these
        principles of demonstration, there seems to be no reason why the study
        of them should pertain to one science rather than to another; nor again
        does it seem reasonable that they should be studied by all sciences,
        because then it would follow that the same thing would be treated in
        different sciences; but that would be superfluous. Hence it seems to
        follow that no science considers these principles. Therefore, for the
        very same reason that it does not belong to any of the other sciences to
        give us a knowledge of such principles, for this reason too it follows
        that it does not belong to the science whose function it is to consider
        substance.
      </p>
      <p>389. <b>But at the same time</b> (200).</p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the second argument, which runs thus. In the sciences
        there are two methods by which knowledge is acquired. One is that by
        which the whatness of each thing is known, and the other is that by
        which knowledge is acquired through demonstration. But it does not
        belong to any science to give us a knowledge of the principles of
        demonstration by means of the first method, because such knowledge of
        principles is assumed to be prior to all the sciences. For "we already
        know" what each one of them is, i.e., we know from the very beginning
        what these principles signify, and by knowing this the principles
        themselves are immediately known. And since such knowledge of principles
        belongs to us immediately, he concludes that all the arts and sciences
        which are concerned with other kinds of cognitions make use of these
        pinciples as things naturally known by us.
      </p>
      <p>
        390. But it is proved in the same way that a knowledge of these
        principles is not presented to us in any science by means of
        demonstration, because if there were demonstration of them, then three
        principles would have to be considered, namely, some subjectgenus, its
        properties and the axioms. In order to clarify this he adds that there
        cannot be demonstration of all things; for subjects are not demonstrated
        but properties are demonstrated of subjects. Concerning subjects,
        however, it is necessary to know beforehand whether they exist and what
        they are, as is stated in Book I of the <i>Posterior Analytics</i>. The
        reason is that demonstration must proceed from certain things as
        principles, which are the axioms, and be about something, which is the
        subject, and [be demonstration] of certain things, which are properties.
        Now according to this it is immediately evident of one of these three,
        i.e., the axioms, that they are not demonstrated, otherwise there would
        have to be certain axioms prior to the axioms; but this is impossible.
        Therefore, having dismissed this method of procedure as obvious, he
        proceeds to consider the subject-genus. For since one science has one
        subject-genus, then that science which would demonstrate axioms would
        have one subject-genus. Thus there would have to be one subjectgenus for
        all demonstrative sciences, because all demonstrative sciences use
        axioms of this kind.
      </p>
      <p>391. <b>But on the other hand</b> (201).</p>
      <p>
        Here he argues the other side of the question. For if it is said that
        there is one science which deals with sucn principles, and another which
        deals with substance, the problem will remain as to which of these
        sciences is the more important and prior one. For, on the one hand,
        since the axioms are most universal and are the principles of everything
        that is treated in any of the sciences, it seems that the science which
        deals with such principles is the most important one. Yet, on the other
        hand, since substance is the first and principal kind of being, it is
        evident that first-philosophy is the science of substance. And if it is
        not the same science which deals with substance and with the axioms, it
        will not be easy to state to which of the other sciences it belongs to
        consider the truth and falsity of these axioms, i.e., if it does not
        belong to first philosophy, which considers substance.
      </p>
      <p>
        392. The Philosopher answers this question in Book IV (590) of this
        work. He says that the study of the axioms belongs chiefly to the
        [first] philosopher inasmuch as it pertains to him to consider being in
        general, to which first principles of this kind essentially belong, as
        is most evident in the case of the very first principle: it is
        impossible for the same thing both to be and not to be [at the same
        time]. Hence all the particular sciences use principles of this kind
        just as they use being itself, although it is the first philosopher who
        is chiefly concerned with this. And the first argument is solved in this
        way.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the second argument is solved thus: the [first] philosopher does not
        consider principles of this kind in such a way as to make them known by
        defining them or by demonstrating them in an absolute sense, but by
        refutation, i.e., by arguing disputatively against those who deny them,
        as is stated in Book IV (608).<br /></p

      <p>
        202. And there is the problem whether there is one science which deals
        with all substances, or many sciences.
      </p>
      <p>
        203. If there is not one science, then with what substances must this
        science deal?
      </p>
      <p>
        204. But it is unreasonable that there should be one science of all
        substances; for then one science would demonstrate all essential
        accidents, i.e., if it is true that every demonstrative science
        speculates about the essential accidents of some subject by proceeding
        from common opinions. Hence it is the office of the same science to
        study the essential accidents of the same subject-genus by proceeding
        from the same opinions. For it belongs to one science to consider that
        something is so, and it belongs to one science to consider the
        principles from which demonstrations proceed, whether to the same
        science or to a different one. Hence it belongs to one science to
        consider accidents, whether they are studied by these sciences or by one
        derived from them.
      </p>
      <p>
        205. Further, there is the problem whether this science is concerned
        only with substances or also with accidents. I mean, for example, that
        if a solid is a kind of substance, and also lines and surfaces, the
        question arises whether it is the function of the same science to know
        these and also the accidents of each class of things about which the
        mathematical sciences make demonstrations, or whether it is the concern
        of a different science.
      </p>
      <p>
        206. For if it is the concern of the same science, a particular one will
        undertake these demonstrations and this will be the one which deals with
        substance. However, there does not seem to be any demonstration of the
        quiddity.
      </p>
      <p>
        207. But if it is the concern of a different science, which science will
        it be that studies the accidents of substances? For to solve this is
        very difficult.

          well as accidents?</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        393. Having debated the questions the third question, which pertains to
        which pertain to the scope of investigation of this science, he now
        treats the study of substances and accidents. This is divided into two
        parts inasmuch as he discusses two questions on this point. The second
        (403) begins where he says, “Furthermore, there is.”
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does three things. First, he raises the
        question whether there is one science that considers all substances, or
        whether there are many sciences that consider different substances.
      </p>
      <p>394. <b>If there is not</b> (203).</p>
      <p>
        Second, he argues the first side of the question with a view to showing
        that there is one science of all substances. For if there were not one
        science of all substances, then apparently it would be impossible to
        designate the substance which this science considers, because substance
        as substance is the primary kind of being. Hence it does not seem that
        one substance rather than another belongs to the consideration of the
        basic science.
      </p>
      <p>395. <b>but it is unreasonable</b> (204).</p>
      <p>
        Third, he argues the other side of the question, saying that it is
        unreasonable to hold that there is one science of all substances. For it
        would follow that there would be one demonstrative science of all
        essential accidents. And this is true because every science which
        demonstrates certain accidents speculates about the essential accidents
        of some particular subject, and it does this from certain common
        conceptions. Therefore, since a demonstrative science considers the
        accidents only of some particular subject, it follows that the study of
        some subject-genus belongs to the same science that is concerned with
        the study of the essential accidents of that genus and vice versa, so
        long as demonstrations proceed from the same principles.
      </p>
      <p>
        396. But sometimes it happens to be the function of some science to
        demonstrate from certain principles that a thing is so, and sometimes it
        happens to be the function of some science to demonstrate the principles
        from which it was demonstrated that a thing is so, sometimes to the same
        science and sometimes to a different one.
      </p>
      <p>
        An example of its being the function of the
        <span style="font-weight: bold">same</span> science is seen in the case
        of geometry, which demonstrates that a triangle has three angles equal
        to two right angles in virtue of the principle that the exterior angle
        of a triangle is equal to the two interior angles opposite to it; for to
        demonstrate this belongs to geometry alone. And an example of its being
        the function of a
        <span style="font-weight: bold">different</span> science is seen in the
        case of music, which proves that a tone is not divided into two equal
        semitones by reason of the fact that a ratio of 9 to 8, which is
        superparticular, cannot be divided into two equal parts. But to prove
        this does not pertain to the musician but to the arithmetician. It is
        evident, then, that sometimes sciences differ because their principles
        differ, so long as one science demonstrates the principles of another
        science by means of certain higher principles.
      </p>
      <p>
        397. But if it is assumed that the principles are identical, sciences
        could not differ so long as the accidents are the same and the
        subject-genus is the same, as if one science considered the subject and
        another its accidents. Hence it follows that that science which
        considers a substance will also consider its accidents, so that if there
        are many sciences which consider substances, there will be many sciences
        which consider accidents. But if there is only one science which
        considers substances, there will be only one science which considers
        accidents. But this is impossible, because it would then follow that
        there would be only one science, since there is no science which does
        not demonstrate the accidents of some subject. Therefore it is not the
        function of one science to consider all substances.
      </p>
      <p>
        398. This is treated in Book IV (546) of this work, where it is shown
        that the examination of substance as substance belongs to the first
        science, whose province it is to consider being as being; and thus it
        considers all substances according to the common aspect of substance.
        Therefore it belongs to this science to consider the common accidents of
        substance. But it belongs to the particular sciences, which deal with
        particular substances, to consider the particular accidents of
        substances, just as it belongs to the science of nature to consider the
        accidents of mobile substance. However, among substances there is also a
        hierarchy, for the first substances are immaterial ones. Hence the study
        of them belongs properly to first-philosophy, just as the philosophy of
        nature would be first philosophy if there were no other substances prior
        to mobile corporeal substances, as is stated below in Book VI (1170).
      </p>
      <p>399. <b>Further, there is the problem</b> (205).</p>
      <p>
        Here he raises another question regarding the study of substance and
        accidents. Concerning this he does three things. First, he raises the
        question whether the investigation of this science is concerned with
        substance alone or also with the attributes that are accidents of
        substances. For example, if we say that lines, surfaces and solids are
        substances of some sort, as some held, the question arises whether it
        belongs to the same science to consider such things and also their
        proper accidents, which are demonstrated in the mathematical sciences,
        or whether it belongs to another science.
      </p>
      <p>
        400.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">For if it is the concern</span> (206).
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, he argues one side of the question. For if it belongs to the
        same science to consider accidents and substances, then, since a science
        which considers accidents demonstrates accidents, it follows that a
        science which considers substance demonstrates substances. But this is
        impossible; for the definition of a substance, which expresses the
        quiddity’ is indemonstrable. Hence it will belong to the same science to
        consider substances and accidents.
      </p>
      <p>
        401.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">But if it is the concern</span> (207).
      </p>
      <p>
        Third, he argues the other side of the question: if different sciences
        consider substance and accident, it will not be possible to state which
        science it is that speculates about the accidents of substance; because
        the science which would do this would consider both, although this would
        seem to pertain to all sciences; for every science considers the
        essential accidents of its subject, as has been explained.
      </p>
      <p>
        402. The Philosopher answers this question in Book IV (570) of this
        work, saying that it is also the office of that science which is
        concerned with the study of substance and being to consider the proper
        accidents of substance and being. Yet it does not follow that it would
        consider each in the same way, i.e., by demonstrating substance as it
        demonstrates accidents, but by defining substance and by demonstrating
        that accidents either belong to or do not belong to it, as is explained
        more fully at the end of Book IX (1895) of this work.<br /></p

      </p>
      <p>
        208. Furthermore, there is the problem whether sensible substances alone
        must be said to exist, or others besides these. And whether there is one
        genus or many genera of substances, as is held by those who speak of the
        Forms and the intermediate entities with which they say the mathematical
        sciences deal.
      </p>
      <p>
        209. Now the way in which we say that the Forms are both causes and
        substances in themselves has been treated in our first discussions
        concerning all of these things (69).
      </p>
      <p>
        210. But while they involve difficulty in many respects, it is no less
        absurd to say that there are certain other natures besides those which
        exist in the heavens, and that these are the same as sensible things,
        except that the former are eternal whereas the latter are corruptible.
        For they [i.e., the Platonists] say nothing more or less than that there
        is a man-in-himself and horse-in-itself and health-in-itself, which
        differ in no respect [from their sensible counterparts]; in which they
        act like those who say that there are gods and that they are of human
        form. For just as the latter made nothing else than eternal men, in a
        similar way the former make the Forms nothing else than eternal sensible
        things.
      </p>
      <p>
        211. Furthermore, if anyone holds that there are intermediate entities
        in addition to the Forms and sensible substances, he will face many
        problems. For evidently there will be, in like manner, lines in addition
        to ordinary sensible lines, and the same will be true of other classes
        of things. Therefore, since astronomy is one of these [mathematical
        sciences], there will be a heaven in addition to the one we perceive,
        and a sun and moon, and the same will be true of the other celestial
        bodies. And how are we to accept these things? For it is unreasonable
        that a heaven should be immobile, but that it should be mobile is
        altogether impossible. The same thing is true of the things with which
        the science of perspective is concerned, and of harmonics in
        mathematics, because for the same reasons it is also impossible that
        these should exist apart from sensible things. For if there are
        intermediate sensible objects and senses, evidently there will be
        intermediate animals between animals-in-themselves and those which are
        corruptible.
      </p>
      <p>
        212. Again, one might also raise the question as to what things these
        sciences must investigate. For if geometry, which is the art of
        measuring the earth, differs from geodesy, which is the art of dividing
        the earth, only in this respect that the latter deals with things which
        are perceptible by the senses, whereas the former deals with those which
        are imperceptible, evidently there will be, in addition to the science
        of medicine, another science midway between the science of medicine
        itself and this particular science of medicine; and this will be true of
        the other sciences. But how is this possible? For then there will be
        certain healthy things besides those which are sensible and besides
        health-in-itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        213. Similarly, neither does it seem that geodesy is concerned with
        continuous quantities which are sensible and corruptible. For in this
        case it would be destroyed when they are destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
        214. Nor again will astronomy deal with sensible continuous quantities,
        or with this heaven. For the lines we perceive by the senses are not
        such as those of which geometry speaks, since none of the things
        perceived by the senses are straight or round in this way. For the
        circle does not touch the rule at a point, but in the way in which
        Protagoras spoke in arguing against the geometricians. Neither are the
        motions or revolutions of the heavens similar to the things of which
        geometry speaks, nor do points have the same nature as the stars.
      </p>
      <p>
        215. However, there are also some who say that these intermediate
        entities, which are below the Forms and above sensible things, do not
        exist outside of sensible things but in them. But to enumerate all the
        impossible consequences which follow from this theory would require too
        long a discussion. It will be sufficient to propose the following
        consideration.
      </p>
      <p>
        216. It is unreasonable that this should be so only in the case of such
        things, but evidently it is also possible for the Forms to exist in
        sensible things, because both of these views depend on the same
        argument.
      </p>
      <p>
        217. Furthermore, it would be necessary for two solids to occupy the
        same place.
      </p>
      <p>
        218. And [the objects of mathematics] would not be immobile since they
        exist in sensible things, which are moved.
      </p>
      <p>
        219. Moreover, on the whole, to what end would anyone hold that they
        exist but exist in sensible things? For the same absurdities as those
        described will apply to these suppositions. For there will be a heaven
        in addition to the one which we perceive, although it will not be
        separate but in the same place; but this is quite impossible.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">Chapter 3</p>
      <p>
        In these matters, then, it is difficult to see how it is possible to
        have any positive truth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p><i>Q. 5: Are there substances besides sensible ones?</i></p>
      <p>
        403. Having debated the questions which pertain to the scope of this
        science, the Philosopher now treats dialectically the questions which
        pertain to the substances themselves with which this science is chiefly
        concerned. In regard to this he does three things. First, he raises the
        questions. Second (406), he indicates the source from which arguments
        can be drawn in support of one side of the question (“Now the way”).
        Third (407), he argues on the other side of the question (“But while
        they involve”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first part of this division he raises two questions.
        The first question is whether sensible substances alone are found in the
        universe, as certain of the ancient philosophers of nature claimed, or
        whether besides sensible substances there are certain others, as the
        Platonists claimed.
      </p>
      <p>
        404. And assuming that besides sensible substances there are certain
        others, the second question is whether these substances belong to one
        genus, or whether there are many genera of substances. For he considers
        both opinions. For some thinkers held, that in addition to sensible
        substances there are only separate Forms, i.e., an immaterial
        man-in-himself and horse-in itself and so on for the other classes of
        things, whereas others held that there are certain other substances
        midway between the Forms and sensible things, namely, the objects of
        mathematics, with which they said the mathematical sciences deal.
      </p>
      <p>
        405. The reason for this view is that they posited on the part of the
        intellect a twofold process of abstracting things: one whereby the
        intellect is said to abstract the universal from the particular, and
        according to this mode of abstraction they posited separate Forms, which
        subsist of themselves; and another [whereby the intellect is said to
        abstract] from sensible matter certain forms in whose definition
        sensible matter is not given, for example, the abstraction of circle
        from brass. And according to this mode of abstraction they posited
        separate objects of mathematics, which they said are midway between the
        Forms and sensible substances, because they have something in common
        with both: with the Forms inasmuch as they are separate from sensible
        matter, and with sensible substances inasmuch as many of them are found
        in one class, as many circles and many lines.
      </p>
      <p>
        406. <span style="font-weight: bold">Now the way in which</span> (209).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he shows how it is possible to argue one side of the question,
        saying that it has been stated “in our first discussions,” i.e., in Book
        I (69:C 151), how the Forms are held to be both the causes of sensible
        things and substances which subsist of themselves. Hence, from the
        things which have been said there in presenting the views of Plato,
        arguments can be drawn in support of the affirmative side of the
        question.
      </p>
      <p>
        407.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">But while they involve</span> (210).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he advances reasons for the negative side. He does this, first
        (210), for the purpose of showing that the Forms are not separate from
        sensible things; and, second (211:C 410), for the purpose of showing
        that the objects of mathematics are not separate (“Furthermore, if
        anyone”). Now above in Book I (103:C 208) he gave many arguments against
        those who posited separate Forms; and, therefore, passing over those
        arguments, he gives the line of reasoning which seems most effective. He
        says (210) that while the position of those who posit separate Forms
        contains many difficulties, the position of those which is now given is
        no less absurd than any of the others, i.e., that someone should say
        that there are certain natures in addition to the sensible ones which
        are contained beneath the heavens. For the heavens constitute the limit
        of sensible bodies, as is proved in Book I of
        <i>The Heavens and the World</i>. But those who posited the Forms did
        not place them below the heavens or outside of it, as is stated in Book
        III of the <i>Physics</i>. Hence, in accordance with this he says that
        they posited certain other natures in addition to those which exist in
        the heavens. And they said that these opposite natures are the same as
        these sensible things both in kind and in their intelligible
        constitution, and that they exist in these sensible things; or rather
        they said that those natures are the Forms of these sensible things. For
        example, they said that a separate man constitutes the humanity of this
        particular man who is perceived by the senses, and that a man who is
        perceived by the senses is a man by participating in that separate man.
        Yet they held that these differ in this respect, that those immaterial
        natures are eternal, whereas these sensible natures are corruptible.
      </p>
      <p>
        408. That they hold those natures to be the same as these sensible
        things is clear from the fact that, just as man, horse, and health are
        found among sensible things, in a similar way they posited among these
        natures “a man-inhimself,” i.e., one lacking sensible matter; and they
        did the same with regard to horse and health. Moreover, they claimed
        that nothing else existed in the class of separate substances except
        [the counterpart of] what existed materially in the sensible world. This
        position seems to be similar to that of those who held that the gods are
        of human form, which was the position of the Epicureans, as Tully states
        in <i>The Nature of the Gods</i>. For just as those who held that the
        gods are of human form did nothing else than make men eternal in nature,
        in a similar way those who claimed that there are Forms do nothing else
        than hold that there are eternal sensible things, such as horse, ox, and
        the like.
      </p>
      <p>
        409. But it is altogether absurd that what is naturally corruptible
        should be specifically the same as what is naturally incorruptible; for
        it is rather the opposite that is true, namely, that corruptible and
        incorruptible things differ in kind to the greatest degree, as is said
        below in Book X (895:C 2137) Of this work. Yet it can happen that what
        is naturally corruptible is kept in being perpetually by Divine power.
      </p>
      <p>
        410.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Furthermore, if anyone</span> (211).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he argues against those who claimed that the objects of mathematics
        are midway between the Forms and sensible things. First (211:C 410), he
        argues against those who held that the objects of mathematics are
        intermediate entities and are separate from sensible things; and, second
        (215:C 417), against those who held that the objects of mathematics
        exist but exist in sensible things (“However, there are”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he introduces
        arguments against the first position. Second (214:C 416), he argues in
        support of this position (“Nor again”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He brings up three arguments against the first position. The first
        argument is this: just as there is a mathematical science about the
        line, in a similar way there are certain mathematical sciences about
        other subjects. If, then, there are certain lines in addition to the
        sensible ones with which geometry deals, by the same token there will
        be, in all other classes of things with which the other mathematical
        sciences deal, certain things in addition to those perceived by the
        senses. But he shows that it is impossible to hold this with regard to
        two of the mathematical sciences.
      </p>
      <p>
        411. He does this, first, in the case of astronomy, which is one of the
        mathematical sciences and which has as its subject the heavens and the
        celestial bodies. Hence, according to what has been said, it follows
        that there is another heaven besides the one perceived by the senses,
        and similarly another sun and another moon, and so on for the other
        celestial bodies. But this is incredible, because that other heaven
        would be either mobile or immobile. If it were immobile, this would seem
        to be unreasonable, since we see that it is natural for the heavens to
        be always in motion. Hence the astronomer also makes some study of the
        motions of the heavens. But to say that a heaven should be both separate
        and mobile is impossible, because nothing separate from matter can be
        mobile.
      </p>
      <p>
        412. Then he shows that the same view is unacceptable in the case of
        other mathematical sciences, for example, in that of perspective, which
        considers visible lines, and “in the case of harmonics,” i.e., in that
        of music, which studies the ratios of audible sounds. Now it is
        impossible that there should be intermediate entities between the Forms
        and sensible things; because, if these sensible things—sounds and
        visible lines—were intermediate entities, it would also follow that
        there are intermediate senses. And since senses exist only in an animal,
        it would follow that there are also intermediate animals between the
        Form animal, and corruptible animals; but this is altogether absurd.
      </p>
      <p>413. <span style="font-weight: bold">Again, one might</span> (212).</p>
      <p>
        The second argument [which he uses against the possibility of the
        objects of mathematics being an intermediate class of entities separate
        from sensible things] is as follows. If in those classes of things with
        which the mathematical sciences deal there are three classes of
        things—sensible substances, Forms and intermediate entities, then since
        the intelligible structure of all sensible things and of all Forms seems
        to be the same, it appears to follow that there are intermediate
        entities between any sensible things at all and their Forms. Hence there
        remains the problem as to what classes of things are included in the
        scope of the mathematical sciences. For if a mathematical science such
        as geometry differs from geodesy, which is the science of sensible
        measurements, only in this respect that geodesy deals with sensible
        measurements, whereas geometry deals with intermediate things which are
        not sensible, there will be in addition to all the sciences which
        consider sensible things certain [other] mathematical sciences which
        deal with these intermediate entities. For example, if the science of
        medicine deals with certain sensible bodies, there will be in addition
        to the science of medicine, and any like science, some other science
        which will be intermediate between the science of medicine which deals
        with sensible bodies and the science of medicine which deals with the
        Forms. But this is impossible; for since medicine is about “healthy
        things,” i.e., things which are conducive to health, then it will also
        follow, if there is an intermediate science of medicine, that there will
        be intermediate health-giving things in addition to the health-giving
        things perceived by the senses and absolute health, i.e.,
        health-in-itself, which is the Form of health separate from matter. But
        this is clearly false. Hence it follows that these mathematical sciences
        do not deal with certain things which are intermediate between sensible
        things and the separate Forms.
      </p>
      <p>
        414. <span style="font-weight: bold">Similarly, neither</span> (213).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he gives the third argument [against the possibility of the objects
        of mathematics being an intermediate class]; and in this argument one of
        the points in the foregoing position is destroyed, namely, that there
        would be a science of continuous quantities which are perceptible; and
        thus, if there were another science of continuous quantities, it would
        follow from this that there would be intermediate continuous quantities.
        Hence he says that it is not true that geodesy is a science of
        perceptible continuous quantities, because such continuous quantities
        are corruptible. It would follow, then, that geodesy is concerned with
        corruptible continuous quantities. But it seems that a science is
        destroyed when the things with which it deals are destroyed; for when
        Socrates is not sitting, our present knowledge that he is sitting will
        not be true. Therefore it would follow that geodesy, or geosophics as
        other readings say, is destroyed when sensible continuous quantities are
        destroyed; but this is contrary to the character of science, which is
        necessary and incorruptible.
      </p>
      <p>
        415. Yet this argument can be brought in on the opposite side of the
        question inasmuch as one may say that he intends to prove by this
        argument that there are no sciences of sensible things, so that all
        sciences must be concerned with either the intermediate entities or the
        Forms.
      </p>
      <p>416. <span style="font-weight: bold">Nor again will</span> (214)</p>
      <p>
        Here he argues in support of this position, as follows: it belongs to
        the very notion of science that it should be concerned with what is
        true. But this would not be the case unless it were about things as they
        are. Therefore the things about which there are sciences must be the
        same in themselves as they are shown to be in the sciences. But
        perceptible lines are not such as geometry says they are. He proves this
        on the grounds that geometry demonstrates that a circle touches “the
        rule,” i.e., a straight line, only at a point, as is shown in Book III
        of Euclid’s <i>Elements</i>. But this is found to be true of a circle
        and a line in the case of sensible things. Protagoras used this argument
        when he destroyed the certainties of the sciences against the
        geometricians. Similarly, the movements and revolutions of the heavens
        are not such as the astronomers describe them; for it seems to be
        contrary to nature to explain the movements of the celestial bodies by
        means of eccentrics and epicycles and other different movements which
        the astronomers describe in the heavens. Similarly, neither are the
        quantities of the celestial bodies such as the astronomers describe them
        to be, for they use stars as points even though they are still bodies
        having extension. It seems, then, that geometry does not deal with
        perceptible continuous quantities, and that astronomy does not deal with
        the heaven which we perceive. Hence it remains that these sciences are
        concerned with certain other things, which are intermediate.
      </p>
      <p>
        417. <span style="font-weight: bold">However, there are</span> (215)
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he argues against another position. First, he states the point at
        issue. Second (216:C 418), he brings in arguments germane to his purpose
        (“It is unreasonable”).
      </p>
      <p>
        Accordingly, he says, first (215), that some thinkers posit natures
        midway between the Forms and sensible things, yet they do not say that
        these natures are separate from sensible things but exist in sensible
        things themselves. This is clear regarding the opinion of those who held
        that there are certain self-subsistent dimensions which penetrate all
        sensible bodies, which some thinkers identify with the place of sensible
        bodies, as is stated in Book IV of the <i>Physics</i> and is disproved
        there. Hence he says here that to pursue all the absurd consequences of
        this position is a major undertaking, but that it is now sufficient to
        touch on some points briefly.
      </p>
      <p>
        418. <span style="font-weight: bold">It is unreasonable</span> (216).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he brings four arguments against this position. The first runs as
        follows. It seems to be for the same reason that in addition to sensible
        things the Forms and objects of mathematics are posited, because both
        are held by reason of abstraction on the part of the intellect. If,
        then, the objects of mathematics are held to exist in sensible things,
        it is fitting that not only they but also the Forms themselves should
        exist there. But this is contrary to the opinion of those who posit [the
        existence of] the Forms. For they hold that these are separate, and not
        that they exist anywhere in particular.
      </p>
      <p>
        419.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Furthermore, it would be</span> (217)
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the second argument, which runs thus: if the objects of
        mathematics differ from sensible things yet exist in them, since a body
        is an object of mathematics, it follows that a mathematical body exists
        simultaneously with a sensible body in the same subject. Therefore “two
        solids,” i.e., two bodies, will exist in the same place. This is
        impossible not only for two sensible bodies but also for a sensible body
        and a mathematical one, because each has dimensions, by reason of which
        two bodies are prevented from being in the same place.
      </p>
      <p>
        420.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Furthermore, if anyone</span> (211).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he argues against those who claimed that the objects of mathematics
        are midway between the Forms and sensible things. First (211:C 410), he
        argues against those who held that the objects of mathematics are
        intermediate entities and are separate from sensible things; and, second
        (215:C 417), against those who held that the objects of mathematics
        exist but exist in sensible things (“However, there are”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he introduces
        arguments against the first position. Second (214:C 416), he argues in
        support of this position (“Nor again”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He brings up three arguments against the first position. The first
        argument is this: just as there is a mathematical science about the
        line, in a similar way there are certain mathematical sciences about
        other subjects. If, then, there are certain lines in addition to the
        sensible ones with which geometry deals, by the same token there will
        be, in all other classes of things with which the other mathematical
        sciences deal, certain things in addition to those perceived by the
        senses. But he shows that it is impossible to hold this with regard to
        two of the mathematical sciences.
      </p>
      <p>
        421. He does this, first, in the case of astronomy, which is one of the
        mathematical sciences and which has as its subject the heavens and the
        celestial bodies. Hence, according to what has been said, it follows
        that there is another heaven besides the one perceived by the senses,
        and similarly another sun and another moon, and so on for the other
        celestial bodies. But this is incredible, because that other heaven
        would be either mobile or immobile. If it were immobile, this would seem
        to be unreasonable, since we see that it is natural for the heavens to
        be always in motion. Hence the astronomer also makes some study of the
        motions of the heavens. But to say that a
      </p>
      <p>
        422. Now the Philosopher treats these questions below in Books XII, XIII
        and XIV of this work, where he shows that there are neither separate
        mathematical substances nor Forms. The reasoning which moved those who
        posited the objects of mathematics and the Forms, which are derived from
        an abstraction of the intellect, is given at the beginning of Book XIII.
        For nothing prevents a thing which has some particular attribute from
        being considered by the intellect without its being viewed under this
        aspect and yet be considered truly, just as a white man can be
        considered without white being considered. Thus the intellect can
        consider sensible things not inasmuch as they are mobile and material
        but inasmuch as they are substances or continuous quantities; and this
        is to abstract the thing known from matter and motion. However, so far
        as the thing known is concerned, the intellect does not abstract in such
        a way that it understands continuous quantities and forms to exist
        without matter and motion. For then it would follow either that the
        intellect of the one abstracting is false, or that the things which the
        intellect abstracts are separate in reality.<br /></p

          >Are Genera Principles of Things? And If So, Does This Apply to The
          Most Universal Genera or to Those Nearest to Individuals?</span
        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">
        ARISTOTLE’S TEXT Chapter 3: 998a 20-999a 23
      </p>
      <p>
        220. Concerning the principles of things there is the problem whether
        genera must be regarded as the elements and principles of things, or
        rather the first things of which each thing is composed inasmuch as they
        are intrinsic.
      </p>
      <p>
        221. just as the elements and principles of a word seem to be those
        things of which all words are first composed, but not word in common.
        And just as we say that the elements of diagrams are those things whose
        demonstrations are found in the demonstrations of others, either of all
        or of most of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        222. Furthermore, those who say that the elements of bodies are many,
        and those who say that they are one, call the things of which bodies are
        composed and constituted their principles, as Empedocles says that fire
        and water and those things which are included with these are the
        elements from which existing things derive their being; but he does not
        speak of them as the genera of existing things.
      </p>
      <p>
        223. And again if anyone wished to speculate about the nature of other
        things, in finding out in regard to each (a bed, for example) of what
        parts it is made and how it is put together, he will come to know its
        nature. And according to these arguments genera are not the principles
        of existing things.
      </p>
      <p>
        224. But if we know each thing through definitions, and genera are the
        principles of definitions, genera must be the principles of the things
        defined.
      </p>
      <p>
        225. And if in order to acquire scientific knowledge of existing things
        it is necessary to acquire scientific knowledge of their species,
        according to which they are said to be beings, then genera are the
        principles of species.
      </p>
      <p>
        226. Moreover, some of those who say that the elements of existing
        things are the one or being or the great and small, seem to use these as
        genera.
      </p>
      <p>
        227. But it is not possible to speak of principles in both ways; for the
        meaning of substance is one. Therefore a definition by means of genera
        will differ from one which gives the intrinsic constituents.
      </p>
      <p>
        228. Again, if genera are the principles of things in the fullest sense,
        there is the question whether the first genera must be thought to be
        principles, or those which are lowest and are predicated of individual
        things. For this also raises a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        229. For if universals are the principles of things to a greater degree,
        evidently these must be the highest genera, because it is most properly
        these which are predicated of all existing things. Therefore there will
        be as many principles of existing things as there are first genera.
        Hence being and unity will be principles and substances, for it is these
        especially which are predicated of all existing things.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is impossible, however, that unity or being should be a single genus
        of existing things; for it is necessary both that the differences of
        each genus exist and that each be one. But it is impossible either that
        species be predicated of the differences of their own genera, or that a
        genus be so predicated independently of its species. If, then, unity or
        being is a genus, no difference will be one and a being. But if unity
        and being are not genera, neither will they be principles, supposing
        that genera are principles.
      </p>
      <p>
        230. Further, those things which are intermediate and are taken along
        with differences will be genera down to individuals. But some seem to be
        such, whereas others do not. Again, differences are principles to a
        greater degree than genera; and if they are principles, principles will
        be infinite in number, so to speak. And [this will appear] in another
        way also if one holds that the first genus is a principle.
      </p>
      <p>
        231. But, on the other hand, if unity is a specific principle to a
        greater degree, and unity is indivisible, and everything indivisible is
        such either in quantity or in species, and what is indivisible in
        species is prior, and genera are divisible into species, then it will be
        rather the lowest predicate which is one. For man is not the genus of
        particular men.
      </p>
      <p>
        232. Further, in the case of those things to which prior and subsequent
        apply, it is not possible in their case that there should be something
        which exists apart from them. For example, if the number two is the
        first of numbers, there will not be any number apart from the species of
        numbers; nor, likewise, any figure apart from the species of figures.
        But if the genera of these things do not [exist apart from the species],
        then in the case of other things the teaching will be that there are
        genera apart from the species; for of these things there seem especially
        to be genera. But among individual things one is not prior and another
        subsequent.
      </p>
      <p>
        233. Further, where one thing is better and another worse, that which is
        better is always prior; so that there will be no genus of these things.
        From these considerations, then, it seems that it is the terms
        predicated of individuals, rather than genera, which are principles.
      </p>
      <p>
        234. But again it is not easy to state how one must conceive these to be
        the principles of things..For a principle or cause must be distinct from
        the things of which it is the principle or cause, and must be able to
        exist apart from them. But why should one think that anything such as
        this exists apart from singular things, except that it is predicated
        universally and of all things? But if this is the reason, then the more
        universal things are, the more they must be held to be principles. Hence
        the first genera will be principles of things.

      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p><i>Q. 9: What is the difference between genera and elements?</i></p>
      <p>
        423. Having debated the questions which were raised about substances,
        the Philosopher now treats dialectically the questions which were raised
        about principles. This is divided into two parts. In the first he
        discusses the questions which asked what the principles of things are;
        and in the second (456), the questions which asked what kind of things
        the principles are (“Again, there is the problem”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In the first part of this division he discusses two questions: first,
        whether universals are the principles of things; and second (443),
        whether any principles are separate from matter (“But there is a
        problem”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he discusses two questions, of which the first is
        whether genera are the principles of things. The second (431) asks which
        genera these are, whether the first genera or the others (“Again, if
        genera”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things: first, he raises the
        question; and second (424), he treats it dialectically (“Just as the
        elements”).
      </p>
      <p>
        The first question has to do with the principles of things: whether it
        is necessary to accept or believe that those genera which are predicated
        of many things are the elements and principles of things, or rather that
        those parts of which every single thing is composed must be called the
        elements and principles of things. But he adds two conditions, one of
        which is “inasmuch as they are intrinsic,” which is given in order to
        distinguish these parts from a contrary and a privation. For white is
        said to come from black, or the non-white, although these are not
        intrinsic to white. Hence they are not its elements. The other condition
        is what he calls “the first things,” which is given in order to
        distinguish them from secondary components. For the bodies of animals
        are composed of flesh and nerves, which exist within the animal; yet
        these are not called the elements of animals, because they are not the
        first things of which an animal is composed, but rather fire, air, water
        and earth, from which flesh and nerves derive their being.
      </p>
      <p>
        424. <span style="font-weight: bold">Just as the elements</span> (221).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he treats this question dialectically; and in regard to this he
        does three things. First, he shows that the first things of which
        anything is composed are its principles and elements. Second (224:C
        427), he argues the opposite side of the question (“But if we know”).
        Third (227:C 430), he rejects one answer by which it could be said that
        both of these [i.e., genera and constituent parts] are the principles
        and elements of things (“But it is not”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he gives three arguments. The first of these
        proceeds from natural phenomena, in which he makes his thesis evident by
        two examples. The first example which he gives if that of a word, whose
        principle and element is not said to be the common term word but rather
        the first constituents of which all words are composed, which are called
        letters. He gives as a second example, diagrams, i.e., the demonstrative
        descriptions of geometrical figures. For the elements of these diagrams
        are not said to be the common term diagram but rather those theorems
        whose demonstrations are found in the demonstrations of other
        geometrical theorems, either of all or of most of them, because the
        other demonstrations proceed from the supposition of the first
        demonstrations. Hence the book of Euclid is called The Book of Elements,
        because the first theorems of geometry, from which the other
        demonstrations proceed, are demonstrated therein.
      </p>
      <p>
        425.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Furthermore, those who</span> (222).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the second argument which also employs certain examples
        drawn from nature. He says that those who hold that the elements of
        bodies are either one or many, say that the principles and elements of
        bodies are those things of which bodies are composed and made up as
        intrinsic constituents. Thus Empedocles says~ that the elements of
        natural bodies are fire and water and other things of this kind, which
        along with these he calls the elements of things; and natural bodies are
        constituted of these first things inasmuch as they are intrinsic.
        Moreover, they [i.e., the philosophers of nature] held that in addition
        to these two principles there are four others—air, earth, strife and
        friendship—as was stated in Book I (50:C 104). But neither Empedocles
        nor the other philosophers of nature said that the genera of things are
        the principles and elements of these natural bodies.
      </p>
      <p>
        426. <span style="font-weight: bold">And again if anyone</span> (223).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the third argument, which involves things made by art. He
        says that if someone wished to “speculate about their nature,” i.e.,
        about the definition which indicates the essence of other bodies than
        natural ones, namely, of bodies made by human art, for example, if one
        wished to know a bed, it would be necessary to consider of what parts it
        is made and how they are put together; and in this way he would know the
        nature of a bed. And after this he concludes that genera are not the
        principles of existing things.
      </p>
      <p>427. <span style="font-weight: bold">But if we know</span> (224).</p>
      <p>
        Here he argues the other side of the question. He gives three arguments,
        the first of which is as follows. Each thing is known through its
        definition. Therefore, if a principle of being is the same as a
        principle of knowing, it seems that anything which is a principle of
        definition is also a principle of the thing defined. But genera are
        principles of definitions, because definitions are first composed of
        them. Hence genera are the principles of the things defined.
      </p>
      <p>
        428. <span style="font-weight: bold">And if in order to</span> (225)
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the second argument, which runs thus. Scientific knowledge
        of each thing is acquired by knowing the species from which it gets its
        being, for Socrates can be known only by understanding that he is man.
        But genera are principles of species, because the species of things are
        composed of genera and differences. Therefore genera are the principles
        of existing things.
      </p>
      <p>
        429.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Moreover, some of those</span> (226).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he gives a third argument, which is based on the authority of the
        Platonists, who held that the one and being are the principles of
        things, and also the great and small, which are used as genera.
        Therefore genera are the principles of things.
      </p>
      <p>
        430. <span style="font-weight: bold">But it is not possible</span> (227)
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he excludes one answer which would say that both of these are
        principles. He says that it is impossible to say that both of these are
        “principles,” i.e., both the elements, or the parts of which something
        is composed, and genera. He proves this by the following argument. Of
        each thing there is one definite concept which exposes its substance,
        just as there is also one substance of each thing. But the definitive
        concept which involves genera is not the same as the one which involves
        the parts of which a thing is composed. Hence it cannot be true that
        each definition indicates a thing’s substance. But the definitive
        concept which indicates a thing’s substance cannot be taken from its
        principles. Therefore it is impossible that both genera and the parts of
        which things are composed should be simultaneously and being cannot be
        genera of all the principles of things.
      </p>
      <p>431. <span style="font-weight: bold">Again, if genera</span> (228).</p>
      <p>
        Then he treats the second question dialectically. First, he raises the
        question; and second (432), he brings up arguments relative to this
        question (“For if universals”).
      </p>
      <p>
        Accordingly, he says that if we hold that genera are the principles of
        things in the fullest sense which of these genera should be considered
        to be the principles of things to a greater degree? Must we consider
        those “genera” which are first in number, namely, the most common, or
        also the lowest genera, which are proximately predicated of the
        individual, i.e., the lowest species. For this is open to question, as
        is clear from what follows.
      </p>
      <p>
        432. <span style="font-weight: bold">For if universals</span> (229).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he argues about the question which was proposed; and in regard to
        this he does three things. First, he introduces arguments to show that
        the first genera cannot be principles. Second (231:C 436), he introduces
        arguments to show that the last species should rather be called the
        principles of things (“But, on the other hand”). Third (234:C 441), he
        debates the proposed question (“But again it is”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first (229) he gives three arguments, of which the
        first runs thus: if genera are principles to the extent that they are
        more universal, then those which are most universal, i.e., those which
        are predicated of all things, must be the first genera and the
        principles of things in the highest degree. Hence there will be as many
        principles of things as there are most common genera of this kind. But
        the most common of all genera are unity and being, which are predicated
        of all things. Therefore unity and being will be the principles and
        substances of all things. But this is impossible, because unity and
        being cannot be genera of all things. For, since unity and being are
        most universal, if they were principles of genera, it would follow that
        genera would not be the principles of things. Hence the position which
        maintains that the most common genera are principles is an impossible
        one, because from it there follows the opposite of what was held,
        namely, that genera are not principles.
      </p>
      <p>
        433. That being and unity cannot be genera he proves by this argument:
        since a difference added to a genus constitutes a species, a species
        cannot be predicated of a difference without a genus, or a genus without
        a species. That it is impossible to predicate a species of a difference
        is clear for two reasons. First, because a difference applies to more
        things than a species, as Porphyry says; ‘ and second, because, since a
        difference is given in the definition of a species, a species can be
        predicated essentially of a difference only if a difference is
        understood to be the subject of a species, as number is the subject of
        evenness in whose definition it is given. This, however, is not the
        case; but a difference is rather a formal principle of a species.
        Therefore a species cannot be predicated of a difference except,
        perhaps, in an incidental way. Similarly too neither can a genus, taken
        in itself, be predicated of a difference by essential predication. For a
        genus is not given in the definition of a difference, because a
        difference does not share in a genus, as is stated in Book IV of The
        <i>Topics</i>; nor again is a difference given in the definition of a
        genus. Therefore a genus is not predicated essentially of a difference
        in any way. Yet it is predicated of that which “has a difference,” i.e.,
        of a species, which actually contains a difference. Hence he says that a
        species is not predicated of the proper differences of a genus, nor is a
        genus independently of its species, because a genus is predicated of its
        differences inasmuch as they inhere in a species. But no difference can
        be conceived of which unity and being are not predicated, because any
        difference of any genus is a one and a being, otherwise it could not
        constitute any one species of being. It is impossible, then, that unity
        and being should be genera.
      </p>
      <p>
        434. <span style="font-weight: bold">Further, those things</span> (230)
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he gives the second argument, which runs thus: if genera are called
        principles because they are common and predicated of many things, then
        for a like reason all those things which are principles because they are
        common and predicated of many will have to be genera. But all things
        which are intermediate between the first genera and individuals, namely,
        those which are considered together with some differences, are common
        predicates of many things. Hence they are both principles and genera.
        But this is evidently false. For some of them are genera, as subaltern
        species, whereas others are not, as the lowest species. It is not true,
        then, that the first or common genera are the principles of things.
      </p>
      <p>
        435. Further, if the first genera are principles, because they are the
        principles by which we know species, then differences will be principles
        to a greater degree, because differences are the formal principles of
        species; and form or actuality is chiefly the principle of knowing. But
        it is unfitting that differences should be the principles of things,
        because in that case there would be an infinite number of principles, so
        to speak; for the differences of things are infinite, so to speak; not
        infinite in reality but to us. That they are infinite in number is
        revealed in two ways: in one way if we consider the multitude of
        differences in themselves; in another way if we consider the first genus
        as a first principle, for evidently innumerable differences are
        contained under it. The first genera, then, are not the principles of
        things.
      </p>
      <p>
        436. <span style="font-weight: bold">But on the other hand</span> (231).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he shows that the lowest species are principles to a greater degree
        than genera. He gives three arguments, of which the first runs thus:
        according to the Platonists it is the one which seems to have “the
        nature,” 3 or character, of a principle to the greatest degree. Indeed,
        unity has the character of indivisibility, because a one is merely an
        undivided being. But a thing is indivisible in two ways, namely, in
        quantity and in species: in quantity, as the point and unit, and this is
        a sort of indivisibility opposed to the division of quantity; and in
        species, as what is not divided into many species. But of these two
        types of indivisibility the first and more important one is
        indivisibility in species, just as the species of a thing is prior to
        its quantity. Therefore that which is indivisible in species is more of
        a principle because it is indivisible in quantity. And in the division
        of quantity the genus seems to be more indivisible, because there is one
        genus of many species; but in the division of species one species is
        more indivisible. Hence the last term which is predicated of many, which
        is not a genus of many species, namely, the lowest species, is one to a
        greater degree in species than a genus; for example, man or any other
        lowest species is not the genus of particular men. Therefore a species
        is a principle to a greater degree than a genus.
      </p>
      <p>
        437.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Further, in the case of</span> (232).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he gives the second argument, which is based on a certain position
        of Plato; for at one time Plato held that there is some one thing which
        is predicated of many things without priority and posteriority, and that
        this is a separate unity, as man is separate from all men; and at
        another time he held that there is some one thing which is predicated of
        many things according to priority and posteriority, and that this is not
        a separate unity. This is what Aristotle means when he says “in the case
        of those things to which prior and subsequent apply,” i.e., that when
        one of the things of which a common term is predicated is prior to
        another, it is impossible in such cases that there should be anything
        separate from the many things of which this common term is predicated.
        For example, if numbers stand in such a sequence that two is the first
        species of number, no separate Idea of number will be found to exist
        apart from all species of numbers. And on the same grounds no separate
        figure will be found to exist apart from all species of figures.
      </p>
      <p>
        438. The reason for this can be that a common attribute is held to be
        separate so as to be some first entity in which all other things
        participate. If, then, this first entity is a one applicable to many in
        which all other things participate, it is not necessary to hold that
        there is some separate entity in which all things participate. But all
        genera seem to be things of this kind, because all types of genera are
        found to differ insofar as they are more or less perfect, and thus
        insofar as they are prior and subsequent in nature. Hence, if in those
        cases in which one thing is prior to another it is impossible to regard
        anything common as a separate entity, on the supposition that there is a
        genus apart from species, then “in the case of other things the
        teaching” will [differ], i.e., there will be another doctrine and rule
        concerning them, and the foregoing rule will not apply to them. But
        considering the individuals of one species, it is evident that one of
        these is not prior and another subsequent in nature but only in time.
        And thus according to Plato’s teaching a species is separate. Since,
        then, these common things are principles inasmuch as they are separate,
        it follows that a species is a principle to a greater degree than a
        genus.
      </p>
      <p>
        439.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Further, where one thing</span> (233)
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the third argument, which makes use of the notions “better
        or worse.” For in all those cases where one thing is better than
        another, that which is better is always prior in nature. But there
        cannot be held to be one common genus of those things which exist in
        this way. Hence there cannot be held to be one separate genus in the
        case of those things in which one is better and another worse; and thus
        the conclusion is the same as the above. For this argument is introduced
        to strengthen the preceding one, so to speak, i.e., with a view to
        showing that there is priority and posteriority among the species of any
        genus.
      </p>
      <p>
        440. And from these three arguments he draws the conclusion in which he
        is chiefly interested, namely, that the lowest species, which are
        predicated immediately of individuals, seem to be the principles of
        things to a greater degree than genera.
      </p>
      <p>
        441. <span style="font-weight: bold">But again it is not</span> (234).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he argues the opposite side of the question, as follows: a
        principle and a cause are distinct from the things of which they are the
        principle and cause, and are capable of existing apart from them. And
        this is true, because nothing is its own cause. He is speaking here of
        extrinsic principles and causes, which are causes of a thing in its
        entirety. But the only thing that is held to exist apart from singular
        things is what is commonly and universally predicated of all things.
        Therefore the more universal a thing is, the more separate it is, and
        the more it should be held to be a principle. But the first genera are
        most universal. Therefore the first genera are the principles of things
        in the highest degree.
      </p>
      <p>
        442. Now the solution to these questions is implied in this last
        argument. For according to this argument genera or species are held to
        be universal principles inasmuch as they are held to be separate. But
        the fact that they are not separate and self-subsistent is shown in Book
        VII (1592) of this work. Hence the Commentator also shows, in Book VIII,
        that the principles of things are matter and form, to which genus and
        species bear some likeness. For a genus is derived from matter and
        difference from form, as will be shown in the same book (720). Hence,
        since form is more of a principle than matter, species will consequently
        be principles more than genera. But the objection which is raised
        against this, on the grounds that genera are the principles of knowing a
        species and its definitions, is answered in the same way the objection
        raised about their separateness. For, since a genus is understood
        separately by the mind without understanding its species, it is a
        principle of knowing. And in the same way it would be a principle of
        being, supposing that it had a separate being.<br /></p

      <p>
        235. But there is a problem connected with these things, which is the
        most difficult of all and the most necessary to consider, with which our
        analysis is now concerned.
      </p>
      <p>
        236. For if there is nothing apart from singular things, and singular
        things are infinite in number, how is it possible to acquire scientific
        knowledge of them? For insofar as there is something that is one and the
        same, and insofar as there is something universal [which relates to
        singular things], to that extent we acquire knowledge of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        237. But if this is necessary, and there must be something apart from
        singular things, it will be necessary that genera exist apart from
        singular things, and they will be either the last or the first. But the
        impossibility of this has already appeared from our discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
        238. Further, if there is something apart from the concrete whole (which
        is most disputable), as when something is predicated of matter, if there
        is such a thing, the problem arises whether it must exist apart from all
        concrete wholes, or apart from some and not from others, or apart from
        none.
      </p>
      <p>
        239. If, then, there is nothing apart from singular things, nothing will
        be intelligible, but all things will be sensible, and there will be no
        science of anything, unless one might say that sensory perception is
        science.
      </p>
      <p>
        240. Further, neither will anything be eternal or immobile; for all
        sensible things perish and are subject to motion.
      </p>
      <p>
        241. But if there is nothing eternal, neither can there be generation;
        for there must be something which has come to be and something from
        which it comes to be; and the last of these must be ungenerated, since
        the process of generation must have a limit, and since it is impossible
        for anything to come to be from non-being.
      </p>
      <p>
        242. Further, since generation and motion exist, there must be a
        terminus; for no motion is infinite but every motion has a terminus. And
        that which is incapable of coming to be cannot be generated. But that
        which has come to be must exist as soon as it has come to be.
      </p>
      <p>
        243. Further, if matter exists because it is ungenerated, it is much
        more reasonable that substance should exist, since that is what it
        (matter) eventually comes to be. For if neither the one nor the other
        exists, nothing at all will exist. But if this is impossible, there must
        be something besides the <i>synolon</i>, and this is the form or
        specifying principle.

          >Q. 10: Is there anything separate from sensible things, which is
          their principle?</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        443. Having debated the question whether universals are the principles
        of things, the Philosopher now raises a question about their
        separability, namely, whether there is anything separate from sensible
        things as their principle. In regard to this he considers two questions.
        The first (443) Of these is whether universals are separate from
        singular things. The second (447) is whether there is any formal
        [principle] separate from things which are composed of matter and form
        (“Further, if there is something”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does three things. First, he describes the
        problem. Second (444), he argues one side of the question (“For if there
        is nothing”). Third (445), he argues the other side of the question
        (“But if this is”).
      </p>
      <p>
        Accordingly, this problem arises with regard to a point mentioned in the
        last argument of the preceding question, namely, whether a universal is
        separate from singular things, as the aforesaid argument supposed. He
        describes this problem as “the one with which our analysis is now
        concerned (235),” i.e., the one which immediately preceded the foregoing
        argument. And he speaks of it in this way: first, that “it is connected
        with,” i.e., is a consequence of, the foregoing one, because, as has
        already been stated, the consideration of the preceding question depends
        on this. For if universals are not separate, they are not principles;
        but if they are separate, they are principles. Second, he speaks of this
        problem as the most difficult of all the problems in this science. This
        is shown by the fact that the most eminent philosophers have held
        different opinions about it. For the Platonists held that universals are
        separate, whereas the other philosophers held the contrary. Third, he
        says that this problem is one which it is most necessary to consider,
        because the entire knowledge of substances, both sensible and
        immaterial, depends on it.
      </p>
      <p>
        444.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">For if there is nothing</span> (236).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he advances an argument to show that universals are separate from
        singular things. For singular things are infinite in number, and what is
        infinite cannot be known. Hence all singular things can be known only
        insofar as they are reduced to some kind of unity which is universal.
        Therefore there is science of singular things only inasmuch as
        universals are known. But science is only about things which are true
        and which exist. Therefore universals are things which exist of
        themselves apart from singular things.
      </p>
      <p>445. <span style="font-weight: bold">But if this is</span> (237)</p>
      <p>
        Then he argues the other side of the question in this way: if it is
        necessary that universals be something apart from singular things, it is
        necessary that genera exist apart from singular things, either the first
        genera or also the last, which are immediately prior to singular things.
        But this is impossible, as is clear from the preceding discussion.
        Therefore universals are not separate from singular things.
      </p>
      <p>
        446. The Philosopher solves this problem in Book VII (659:C 1592) Of
        this work, where he shows in many ways that universals are not
        substances which subsist of themselves. Nor is it necessary, as has
        often been said, that a thing should have the same mode of being in
        reality that it has when understood by the intellect of a knower. For
        the intellect knows material things immaterially, and in a similar way
        it knows universally the natures of things which exist as singulars in
        reality, i.e., without considering the principles and accidents of
        individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
        447.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Further, if there is something</span>
        (238).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he raises another question, namely, whether anything is separate
        from things composed of matter and form; and in regard to this he does
        two things. First, he raises the question. Second (239:C 448), he
        proceeds to deal with it (“If, then, there is”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first it should be observed that he first raises the
        question whether a universal is separate from singular things. Now it
        happens to be the case that some singular things are composed of matter
        and form. But not all singular things are so composed, either according
        to the real state of affairs, since separate substances are particular
        because existing and operating of themselves, or even according to the
        opinion of the Platonists, who held that even among separate
        mathematical entities there are particulars inasmuch as they held that
        there are many of them in a single species. And while it is open to
        dispute whether there is anything separate in the case of those things
        which are not composed of matter and form, as the universal is separate
        from the particular, the problem is chiefly whether there is anything
        separate in the case of things which are composed of matter and form.
        Hence he says that the point which causes most difficulty is whether
        there is something “apart from the concrete whole,” i.e., apart from the
        thing composed of matter and form. The reason why a composite thing is
        called a concrete whole he explains by adding “when something is
        predicated of matter.” For Plato held that sensible matter participates
        in separate universals, and that for this reason universals are
        predicated of singular things. These participations in universal forms
        by material sensible things constitute a concrete whole inasmuch as a
        universal form is predicated of matter through some kind of
        participation. Now in regard to these things he raises a question which
        has three parts, namely, whether there is anything that exists apart
        from all things of this kind, or apart from some and not from others, or
        apart from none.
      </p>
      <p>
        448. <span style="font-weight: bold">If, then, there is</span> (239)
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he proceeds to deal with this problem; and concerning it he does
        two things. First, he argues against the position that nothing can be
        held to be separate from things composed of matter and form. Second
        (244:C 454), he argues the other side of the question (“But again if
        anyone holds this”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first (239) he advances two arguments. First, he argues
        from the principle that those things which are composed of matter and
        form are sensible things; and therefore he proposes that those things
        which are composed of matter and form are singulars. However, singular
        things are not intelligible but sensible. Therefore, if there is nothing
        apart from singular things which are composed of matter and form,
        nothing will be intelligible but all beings will be sensible. But there
        is science only of things which are intelligible. Therefore it follows
        that there will be no science of anything, unless one were to say that
        sensory perception and science are the same, as the ancient philosophers
        of nature held, as is stated in Book I of <i>The Soul</i>. But both of
        these conclusions are untenable, namely, that there is no science and
        that science is sensory perception. Therefore the first position is also
        untenable, namely, that nothing exists except singular things which are
        composed of matter and form.
      </p>
      <p>
        449.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Further, neither will anything</span>
        (240).
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, he argues on the grounds that things composed of matter and form
        are mobile. He gives the following argument. All sensible things
        composed of matter and form perish and are subject to motion. Therefore,
        if there is nothing apart from beings of this kind, it will follow that
        nothing is eternal or immobile.
      </p>
      <p>450. <span style="font-weight: bold">But if there is</span> (241).</p>
      <p>
        Here he shows that this conclusion is untenable, namely, that nothing is
        eternal and immobile. He does this, first, with respect to matter; and
        second (242:C 451), with respect to form (“Further, since generation”).
      </p>
      <p>
        Accordingly, he says first (241) that if nothing is eternal, it is
        impossible for anything to be generated. He proves this as follows. In
        every process of generation there must be something which comes to be
        and something from which it comes to be. Therefore, if that from which a
        thing comes to be is itself generated, it must be generated from
        something. Hence there must either be an infinite regress in material
        principles, or the process must stop with some first thing which is a
        first material principle that is ungenerated, unless it might be said,
        perhaps, that it is generated from non-being; but this is impossible.
        Now if the process were to go on to infinity, generation could never be
        completed, because what is infinite cannot be traversed. Therefore it is
        necessary to hold either that there is some material principle which is
        ungenerated, or that it is impossible for any generation to take place.
      </p>
      <p>
        451.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Further, since generation</span> (242).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he proves the same thing with respect to the formal cause; and he
        gives two arguments, the first of which is as follows. Every process of
        generation and motion must have some terminus. He proves this on the
        grounds that no motion is infinite, but that each motion has some
        terminus. This is clear in the case of other motions which are completed
        in their termini. But it seems that a contrary instance is had in the
        case of circular motion, which can be perpetual and infinite, as is
        proved in Book VIII of the <i>Physics</i>. And even though motion is
        assumed to be eternal, so that the entire continuity of circular motion
        is infinite insofar as one circular motion follows another, still each
        circular motion is both complete in its species and finite. That one
        circular motion should follow another is accidental so far as the
        specific nature of circular motion is concerned.
      </p>
      <p>
        452. The things which he said about motion in general he proves
        specially in regard to generation; for no process of generation can be
        infinite, because that thing cannot be generated whose process of
        generation cannot come to an end, since the end of generation is to have
        been made. That its being made is the terminus of generation is clear
        from the fact that what has been generated must exist “as soon as it has
        come to be,” i.e., as soon as its generation is first terminated.
        Therefore, since the form whereby something is, is the terminus of
        generation, it must be impossible to have an infinite regress in the
        case of forms, and there must be some last form of which there is no
        generation. For the end of every generation is a form, as we have said.
        Thus it seems that just as the matter from which a thing is generated
        must itself be ungenerated because it is impossible to have an infinite
        regress, in a similar way there must be some form which is ungenerated
        because it is impossible to have an infinite regress in the case of
        forms.
      </p>
      <p>
        453.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Further, if matter exists</span> (143).
      </p>
      <p>
        He gives the second argument, which runs thus. If there is some first
        matter which is ungenerated, it is much more reasonable that there
        should be some substance, i.e., some form, which is ungenerated, since a
        thing has being through its form, whereas matter is rather the subject
        of generation and transmutation. But if neither of these is ungenerated,
        then absolutely nothing will be ungenerated, since everything which
        exists has the character of matter or form or is composed of both. But
        it is impossible that nothing should be ungenerated, as has been proved
        (24-2:C 452). Therefore it follows that there must be something else
        “besides the <i>synolon</i>,” or concrete whole, i.e., besides the
        singular thing which is composed of matter and form. And by something
        else I mean the form or specifying principle. For matter in itself
        cannot be separated from singular things, because it has being only by
        reason of something else. But this seems to be true rather of form, by
        which things have being.
      </p>
      <p>
        454. <span style="font-weight: bold">But again if anyone</span> (244).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he argues the other side of the question. For if one holds that
        there is some form separate from singular things which are composed of
        matter and form, the problem arises in which cases this must be admitted
        and in which not. For obviously this must not be held to be true in the
        case of all things, especially in that of those made by art. For it is
        impossible that there should be a house apart from this sensible house,
        which is composed of matter and form.
      </p>
      <p>
        455. Now Aristotle solves this problem partly in Book XII (2488) of this
        work, where he shows that there are certain substances separate from
        sensible things and intelligible in themselves; and partly in Book VII
        (1503), where he shows that the forms or specifying principles of
        sensible things are not separate from matter. However, it does not
        follow that no science of sensible things can be had or that science is
        sensory perception. For it is not necessary that things have in
        themselves the same mode of being which they have in the intellect of
        one who knows them. For those things which are material in themselves
        are known in an immaterial way by the intellect, as has also been stated
        above (446). And even though a form is not separate from matter, it is
        not therefore necessary that it should be generated; for it is not forms
        that are generated but composites, as will be shown in Book VII (1417)
        of this work. It is clear, then, in what cases it is necessary to posit
        separate forms and in what not. For the forms of all things which are
        sensible by nature are not separate from matter, whereas the forms of
        things which are intelligible by nature are separate from matter. For
        the separate substances do not have the nature of sensible things, but
        are of a higher nature and belong to another order of existing
        things.<br /></p

      </p>
      <p>
        245. Again, there is the problem whether all things, for example, all
        men, have a single substance.
      </p>
      <p>
        246. But this is absurd; for not all things whose substance is one are
        themselves one, but are many and different. But this too is untenable.
      </p>
      <p>
        247. And at the same time there is the problem how matter becomes each
        of the many things and a concrete whole.
      </p>
      <p>
        248. And again one might also raise this problem about principles. For
        if they are specifically one, there will be nothing that is numerically
        one. Nor again will unity itself and being be one. And how will there be
        science unless there is some unity in all things?
      </p>
      <p>
        249. But, on the other hand, if they are numerically one, each of the
        principles will also be one, and not as in the case of sensible things,
        different for different things; for example, if the syllable ba is taken
        as a species, its principles in every case are specifically the same,
        for they are numerically different. However, if this is not so, but the
        things which are the principles of beings are numerically one, there
        will be nothing else besides the elements. For it makes no difference
        whether we say “numerically one” or “singular,” because it is in this
        way that we say each thing is numerically one. But the universal is what
        exists in these. For example, if the elements of a word were limited in
        number, there would have to be as many letters as there are elements.
        Indeed, no two of them would be the same, nor would more than two.

      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p><i>Q. 11: Are there one or many forms and principles of things?</i></p>
      <p>
        456. Having asked what the principles are, and whether some are separate
        from matter, the Philosopher now asks what the principles are like.
        First (245:C 456), he asks whether the principles are one or many;
        second (287:C 519), whether they exist potentially or actually (“And
        connected with these problems”); and third (290:C 523), whether they are
        universals or singular things (“And there is also the problem”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First (245:C 456), he
        inquires how the principles stand with respect to unity; and second
        (266:C 488), what relationship unity has to the notion of principle
        (“But the most difficult”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does three things. First, he inquires
        specially about the formal principle: whether all things that are
        specifically the same have a single form. Second (248:C 46o), he asks
        the same question of all principles in general (“And again one might”).
        Third (250:C 466), he asks whether corruptible and incorruptible things
        have the same principles or different ones (“Again there is the
        problem”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he introduces the
        problem. Second (246:C 457), he debates it (“But this is absurd”).
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem (245), then, is whether all things that belong to the same
        species, for example, all men, have a single substance or form.
      </p>
      <p>
        457. <span style="font-weight: bold">But this is absurd</span> (246).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he advances arguments on one side of the question, to show that all
        things belonging to one species do not have a single form. He does this
        by means of two arguments, the first of which runs thus. Things that
        belong to one species are many and different. Therefore, if all things
        that belong to one species have a single substance, it follows that
        those which have a single substance are many and different. But this is
        unreasonable.
      </p>
      <p>
        458. <span style="font-weight: bold">And at the same time</span> (247)
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he gives the second argument, which runs thus. That which is one
        and undivided in itself is not combined with something divided in order
        to constitute many things. But it is evident that matter is divided into
        different singular things. Hence, if substance in the sense of form is
        one and the same for all things, it will be impossible to explain how
        each of these singular things is a matter having a substance of the kind
        that is one and undivided, so that as a singular thing it is a concrete
        whole having two parts: a matter and a substantial form which is one and
        undivided.
      </p>
      <p>
        459. Now he does not argue the other side of the question, because the
        very same arguments which were advanced above regarding the separateness
        of universals are applicable in the inquiry which follows it against the
        arguments just given. For if a separate universal exists, it must be
        held that things having the same species have a single substance
        numerically, because a universal is the substance of singular things.
        Now the truth of this question will be established in Book VII (588:C
        1356) of this work, where it is shown that the whatness or essence of a
        thing is not other than the thing itself, except in an accidental way,
        as will be explained in that place.
      </p>
      <p>
        460. <span style="font-weight: bold">And again one might</span> (248).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he raises a difficulty concerning the unity of principles in
        general: whether the principles of things are numerically the same, or
        only specifically the same and numerically distinct. And in regard to
        this he does two things. First, he advances arguments to show that they
        are numerically the same. Second (249:C 464), he argues on the other
        side of the question (“But, on the other hand”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first (248) he gives three arguments; and he introduces
        the problem, saying that the same question which was raised about
        substance can be raised about principles in general, i.e., whether the
        principles of things are numerically the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        461. He introduces the first argument to show that they are numerically
        the same. For things composed of principles merely contain what they
        receive from these principles. Therefore, if principles are not found to
        be one numerically but only specifically, the things composed of these
        principles will not be one numerically but only specifically.
      </p>
      <p>
        462. The second argument runs thus: unity itself or being itself must be
        numerically one. And by unity itself or being itself he means unity or
        being in the abstract. Hence, if the principles of things are not one
        numerically but only specifically, it will follow that neither unity
        itself or being itself will subsist of themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        463. The third argument is this: science is had of things because there
        is found to be a one-in-many, as man in common is found in all men; for
        there is no science of singular things but of the unity [i.e., common
        attribute] found in them. Moreover, all science or cognition of things
        which are composed of principles depends on a knowledge of these
        principles. If, then, principles are not one numerically but only
        specifically, it will follow that there is no science of beings.
      </p>
      <p>
        464.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">But, on the other hand</span> (249).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he argues the opposite side of the question in the following
        fashion. If principles are numerically one so that each of the
        principles considered in itself is one, it will be impossible to say
        that the principles of beings exist in the same way as the principles of
        sensible things. For we see that the principles of different sensible
        things are numerically different but specifically the same, just as the
        things of which they are the principles are numerically different but
        specifically the same. We see, for example, that syllables which are
        numerically distinct but agree in species have as their principles
        letters which are the same specifically though not numerically. And if
        anyone were to say that this is not true of the principles of beings,
        but that the principles of all beings are the same numerically, it would
        follow that nothing exists in the world except the elements, because
        what is numerically one is a singular thing. For what is numerically one
        we call singular, just as we call universal what is in many. But what is
        singular is incapable of being multiplied, and is encountered only as a
        singular. Therefore, if it is held that numerically the same letters are
        the principles of all syllables, it will fd1low that those letters could
        never be multiplied so that there could be two of them or more than two.
        Thus a could not be found in these two different syllables <i>ba</i> or
        <i>da</i>. And the argument is the same in the case of other letters.
        Therefore, by the same reasoning, if the principles of all beings are
        numerically the same, it will follow that there is nothing besides these
        principles. But this seems to be untenable; because when a principle of
        anything exists it will not be a principle unless there is something
        else besides itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        465. Now this question will be solved in Book XII (2464); for it will be
        shown there that the principles which things have, namely, matter and
        form or privation, are not numerically the same for all things but
        analogically or proportionally the same. But those principles which are
        separate, i.e., the intellectual substances, of which the highest is
        God, are each numerically one in themselves. Now that which is one in
        itself and being is God; and from Him is derived the numerical unity
        found in all things. And there is science of these, not because they are
        numerically one in all, but because in our conception there is a one in
        many. Moreover, the argument which is proposed in support of the
        opposite side of the question is true in the case of essential
        principles but not in that of separate ones, which is the class to which
        the agent and final cause belong. For many things can be produced by one
        agent or efficient cause, and can be directed to one end.<br /></p

      </p>
      <p>
        250. Again, there is a problem which has been neglected no less by the
        moderns than by their predecessors: whether the principles of
        corruptible and incorruptible things are the same or different.
      </p>
      <p>
        251. For if they are the same, how is it that some things are
        incorruptible and others corruptible? And what is the cause?
      </p>
      <p>
        252. The followers of Hesiod and all those who were called theologians
        paid attention only to what was plausible to themselves and have
        neglected us. For,’ making the principles of things to be gods or
        generated from the gods, they say that whatever has not tasted nectar
        and ambrosia became mortal.
      </p>
      <p>
        253. And it is clear that they are using these terms in a way known to
        themselves, but what they have said about the application of these
        causes is beyond our understanding. For if it is for the sake of
        pleasure that the gods partake of these things, nectar and ambrosia are
        not the cause of their being. But if they partake of them to preserve
        their being, how will the gods be eternal in requiring food?
      </p>
      <p>
        254. But with regard to those who have philosophized by using fables, it
        is not worth our while to pay any serious attention to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        255. However, from those who make assertions by means of demonstration
        it is necessary to find out, by questioning them, why some of the things
        which are derived from the same principles are eternal in nature and
        others are corrupted. But since these philosophers mention no cause, and
        it is unreasonable that things should be as they say, it is clear that
        the principles and causes of these things will not be the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        256. For the explanation which one will consider to say something most
        to the point is that of Empedocles, who has been subject to the same
        error. For he posits a certain principle, hate, which is the cause of
        corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
        257. Yet even hate would seem to generate everything except the one. For
        all things except God are derived from this. Hence he says: “From which
        have blossomed forth all that was and is [and will be]: trees, and men
        and women, and beasts and flying things, and water-nourished fish, and
        the long-lived gods.” And apart from these things it is evident that, if
        hate did not exist in the world, all things would be one, as he says:
        “For when they have come together, then hate will stand last of all.”
      </p>
      <p>
        258. For this reason too it turns out that God, who is most happy, is
        less wise than other beings. For he does not know all the elements,
        because hate he does not have, and knowledge is of like by like. “For
        one knows earth by earth, water by water, affection by affection, and
        hate by mournful hate.”
      </p>
      <p>
        259. But it is also clear (and this is where our discussion began) that
        hate no more turns out to be the cause of corruption than of being.
      </p>
      <p>
        260. Nor, similarly, is love the cause of existence; for in blending
        things together into a unity it corrupts other things.
      </p>
      <p>
        261. Moreover, he does not speak of the cause of change itself, except
        to say that it was naturally disposed to be so.
      </p>
      <p>
        262. [He says]: “But thus mighty hate was nourished among the members
        and rose to a position of honor when the time was fulfilled, which being
        changeable dissolved the bond.” Hence change is a necessity, but he
        gives no reason for its necessity.
      </p>
      <p>
        263. Yet he alone speaks expressly to this extent. For he does not make
        some beings corruptible and others incorruptible, but makes all things
        corruptible ex. cept the elements. But the problem that has been stated
        is why some things are corruptible and others are not, supposing that
        they come from the same principles. To this extent, then, it has been
        said that the principles of things will not be the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        264. But if the principles are different, one problem is whether they
        will be incorruptible or corruptible. For supposing that they are
        corruptible, it is evident that they must also come from certain things,
        because all things that are corrupted are dissolved into those elements
        from which they come. Hence it follows that there are other principles
        prior to these principles. But this is also unreasonable, whether the
        process stops or goes on to infinity. Further, how will corruptible
        things exist if their principles are destroyed? But if they are
        incorruptible, why will corruptible things come from incorruptible
        principles, and incorruptible things from others? For this is
        unreasonable, and is either impossible or requires a great deal of
        reasoning.
      </p>
      <p>
        265. Further, no one has attempted to say that these things have
        different principles, but [all thinkers] say that all things have the
        same principles. But they admit the first problem, considering it a
        trifling matter.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        466. Having investigated in a general way whether all principles
        belonging to one species are numerically the same, the Philosopher
        inquires here whether the principles of corruptible and incorruptible
        things are numerically the same. In regard to this he does three things.
        First (250:C 466), he raises the question. Second (25I:C 467), he
        introduces an argument to show that the principles of corruptible and
        those of incorruptible things are not the same (“For if they are the
        same”). Third (264:C 483), he introduces arguments to show that they are
        not different (“But if the principles”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He says first (250), then, that there is a problem which has been
        neglected no less by the modern philosophers, who followed Plato, than
        by the ancient philosophers of nature, who also were puzzled whether the
        principles of corruptible and incorruptible things are the same or
        different.
      </p>
      <p>
        467.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">For, if they are the same</span> (251).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he advances an argument to show that the principles of corruptible
        and of incorruptible things are not the same. In regard to this he does
        three things. First (251:C 467), he gives the argument. Second (252:C
        468), he criticizes the solution of the proposed argument which the
        theological poets gave (“The followers of Hesiod”). Third (255:C 472),
        he criticizes the solution which some philosophers of nature gave
        (“However, from those who”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He says first (251), then, that if the principles of corruptible and of
        incorruptible things are held to be the same, since from the same
        principles there follow the same effects, it seems that either all
        things are corruptible or all are incorruptible. Therefore the question
        arises how some things are corruptible and others incorruptible, and
        what the reason is.
      </p>
      <p>
        468.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">The followers of Hesiod</span> (252)
      </p>
      <p>
        He criticizes the solution given by the theological poets. First (252:C
        468), he gives their solution. Second (253:C 470), he argues against it
        (“And it is clear that”). Third (254:C 471), he gives the reason why he
        does not criticize this position with more care (“But with regard to
        those”).
      </p>
      <p>
        Concerning the first (252) it Must be noted that there were among the
        Greeks, or philosophers of nature, certain students of wisdom, such as
        Orpheus, Hesiod and certain others, who were concerned with the gods and
        hid the truth about the gods under a cloak of fables, just as Plato hid
        philosophical truth under mathematics, as Simplicius says in his
        Commentary on the Categories.’ Therefore he says that the followers of
        Hesiod, and all those who were called theologians, paid attention to
        what was convincing to themselves and have neglected us, because the
        truth which they understood was treated by them in such a way that it
        could be known only to themselves. For if the truth is obscured by
        fables, then the truth which underlies these fables can be known only to
        the one who devised them. Therefore the followers of Hesiod called the
        first principles of things gods, and said that those among the gods who
        have not tasted a certain delectable food called nectar or manna became
        mortal, whereas those who had tasted it became immortal.
      </p>
      <p>
        469. But some part of the truth could lie hidden under this fable,
        provided that by nectar or manna is understood the supreme goodness
        itself of the first principle. For all the sweetness of love and
        affection is referred to goodness. But every good is derived from a
        first good. Therefore the meaning of these words could be that some
        things are incorruptible by reason of an intimate participation in the
        highest good, as those which participate perfectly in the divine being.
        But certain things because of their remoteness from the first principle,
        which is the meaning of not to taste manna and nectar, cannot remain
        perpetually the same in number but only in species, as the Philosopher
        says in Book II of <i>Generation</i>. But whether they intended to treat
        this obscurely or something else, cannot be perceived any more fully
        from this statement.
      </p>
      <p>470. <span style="font-weight: bold">And it is clear</span> (253).</p>
      <p>
        He argues against the aforesaid position. He says that the meaning which
        these followers of Hesiod wished to convey by the terms nectar or manna
        was known to them but not to us. Therefore their explanation of the way
        in which these causes are meant to solve this question and preserve
        things from corruption is beyond our understanding. For if these terms
        are understood in their literal sense, they appear to be inadequate,
        because the gods who tasted nectar or manna did so either for the sake
        of pleasure or because these things were necessary for their existence,
        since these are the reasons why men partake of food. Now if they partook
        of them for the sake of pleasure, nectar and manna could not be the
        cause of their existence so as to make them incorruptible, because
        pleasure is something that follows on being. But if they partook of the
        aforesaid nourishment because they needed it to exist, they would not be
        eternal, having repeated need of food. Therefore it seems that gods who
        are first corruptible, as it were, standing as they do in need of food,
        are’made incorruptible by means of food. This also seems to be
        unreasonable, because food does not nourish a thing according to its
        species unless it is corrupted and passes over into the species of the
        one nourished. But nothing that is corruptible can be responsible for
        the incorruptibility of something else.
      </p>
      <p>
        471.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">But with regard to those</span> (254).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he gives his reason for not investigating this opinion with more
        care, He says that it is not worth our while to pay any attention to
        those who have philosophized “by using fables,” i.e., by hiding
        philosophical truth under fables. For if anyone argues against their
        statements insofar as they are taken in a literal sense, these
        statements are ridiculous. But if one wishes to inquire into the truth
        hidden by these fables, it is not evident. Hence it is understood that
        Aristotle, in arguing against Plato and other thinkers of this kind who
        have treated their own doctrines by hiding them under something else,
        does not argue about the truth which is hidden but about those things
        which are outwardly expressed.
      </p>
      <p>
        472.
        <span style="font-weight: bold"
          >However, from those who make assertions</span
        >
        (255).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he argues against the answer given by some of the philosophers of
        nature; and in regard to this he does three things. First (255:C 472),
        he gives the argument. Second (256:C 473), he gives the answer (“For the
        explanation”). Third (257:C 474), he criticizes it (“Yet even hate”).
      </p>
      <p>
        Accordingly, he says, first (255), that, having dismissed those who
        treated the truth by using fables, it is necessary to seek information
        about the aforesaid question from those who have treated the truth in a
        demonstrative way, by asking them why it is that, if all beings are
        derived from the same principles, some beings are eternal by nature and
        others are corrupted. And since these men give no reason why this is so,
        and since it is unreasonable that things should be as they say (that in
        the case of beings having the same principles some should be corruptible
        and others eternal), it seems clearly to follow that corruptible and
        eternal things do not have the same principles or the same causes.
      </p>
      <p>
        473. <span style="font-weight: bold">For the explanation</span> (256).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he gives one solution. He says that the explanation given to the
        aforesaid question which seems to fit it best is the one which
        Empedocles gave, although he was subject to the same error as the
        others, because the explanation which he gave is no more adequate than
        theirs, as is about to be shown. For he maintained that corruptible and
        incorruptible things have certain common principles, but that a special
        principle, hate, causes the corruption of the elements in such a way
        that the coming together of this cause and another principle produces
        corruption in the world.
      </p>
      <p>474. <span style="font-weight: bold">Yet even hate</span> (257).</p>
      <p>
        Here he criticizes Empedocles’ argument, and he does this in three ways.
        First (257:C 474), he does this by showing that the argument which
        Empedocles gave is not in keeping with his position; second (261:C 478),
        by showing that it is not adequate (“Moreover, he does not”); third
        (263:C 481), by showing that it is not to the point (“Yet he alone
        speaks”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does three things. First, he shows that
        Empedocles’ argument does not agree with his other views about hate;
        second (258:C 476), that it does not agree with his view about God
        himself (“For this reason”); and third (26o:C 477), that it does not
        agree with his view about love (“Nor, similarly”).
      </p>
      <p>
        Accordingly, he says, first (257), that Empedocles’ position that hate
        is the cause of corruption is untenable, because according to his
        position hate also seems to be the cause of the generation of all things
        except one. For he held that everything else is composed essentially of
        hate along with the other principles, with the exception of God alone,
        whom he claimed to be composed of the other principles without hate.
        Moreover, he called the heavens God, as was stated above in Book I (49:C
        101), because Xenophanes, after reflecting upon the whole heaven, said
        that the one itself is God. And Empedocles, considering the
        indestructibleness of the heavens, held that the heavens are composed of
        the four elements and love, but not of strife or hatred. But in the case
        of other things he said that all those which are or were or will be,
        come, from hate, such as sprouting trees, and men and women, and beasts
        (which are terrestial animals), and vultures (which are flying and
        long-lived animals), and fish (which are nourished in the water), and
        the long-lived gods. And by the gods he seems to mean either the stars,
        which he held are sometimes corrupted, although after a long period of
        time, or the demons, which the Platonists held to be ethereal animals.
        Or by the gods he also means those beings whom the Epicureans held to be
        of human form, as was stated above (210:C 408). Therefore, from the fact
        that all living things except one are generated from hate, it can be
        said that hate is the cause of generation.
      </p>
      <p>
        475. And in addition to this there is another reason [why hate can be
        said to be the cause of generation]; for according to Empedocles’
        position it is evident that, if hate did not exist in the world, all
        things would be one, since hate is the reason why things are distinct,
        according to Empedocles. Hence he quotes Empedocles’ words to the effect
        that, when all things come together into a unity, for example, when
        chaos comes into being, hate will stand last of all, separating and
        dissolving things. Hence the text of Boethius says: “When it comes
        together, then chaos knows the ultimate discord.” Thus it is clear that,
        since the being of the world consists in the distinction of things, hate
        is the cause of the world’s generation.
      </p>
      <p>476. <span style="font-weight: bold">For this reason</span> (258).</p>
      <p>
        Here he gives a second argument, which pertains to the deity. He says
        that, since Empedocles would hold that hate is not a constituent of the
        divine composition, it follows, according to his arguments, that God,
        who is said by all men to be most happy, and consequently most knowing,
        is less prudent than all other beings who have knowledge. For according
        to Empedodes’ position it follows that God does not know the elements
        because He does not contain hate. Hence He does not know himself. And
        like knows like according to the opinion of Empedodes, who said that by
        earth we know earth, by water water, “and by affection,” i.e., love or
        concord, we know affection, or love or concord. And in a similar way we
        know “hate by hate,” which is sadness, whether unpleasant or evil,
        according to the text of Boethius, who says that “by evil discord we
        know discord.” It is evident, then, that Aristotle thought this
        untenable and contrary to the position that God is most happy because He
        himself would not know some of the things that we know. And since this
        argument seemed to be beside the point, therefore, returning to his
        principal theme, he says (259) that, in returning to the point from
        which the first argument began, it is evident, so far as Empedocles is
        concerned, that hate is no more a cause of corruption than of being.
      </p>
      <p>
        477.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Nor, similarly, is love</span> (260).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the third argument, which pertains to love. He says that
        in like manner love is noe the cause of generation or being, as
        Empedocles claimed, if another position of his is considered. For he
        said that, when all the elements are combined into a unity, the
        corruption of the world will then take place; and thus love corrupts all
        things. Therefore, with respect to the world in general, love is the
        cause of corruption, whereas hate is the cause of generation. But with
        respect to singular things, hate is the cause of corruption and love of
        generation.
      </p>
      <p>
        478. <span style="font-weight: bold">Moreover, he does</span> (261).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he shows that Empedocles’ argument is not adequate. For Empedodes
        said that there exists in the world a certain alternation of hate and
        friendship, in such a way that at one time love unites all things and
        afterwards hate separates them. But as to the reason why this
        alternation takes place, so that at one time hate predominates and at
        another time love, he said nothing more than that it was naturally
        disposed to be so.
      </p>
      <p>
        479. And next he gives Empedocles’ words, which, because they are
        written in Greek verse, are difficult and differ from the common way of
        speaking. These words are (262): “But thus mighty hate was nourished
        among the members and rose to a position of honor when the time was
        fulfilled, which being changeable dissolved the bond.” But the text of
        Boethius runs thus: “But when mighty discord in the members was promoted
        to a place of honor, because it marched forward in a completed year,
        which, when these things have been changed, returns to a full bond.” Now
        in order to understand this it must be noted that he speaks poetically
        of the whole world as though it were a single living thing in whose
        members and parts there is found at first the greatest harmony, which he
        calls love or concord, and afterwards there begins to exist little by
        little a certain dissonance, which he calls discord. And, similarly, in
        the parts of the universe at first there was maximum concord, and
        afterwards hate was nourished little by little until it acquired “the
        place of honor,” i.e., it acquired dominion over the elements. This
        comes about when a completed time is reached or a year is completed, as
        Empedocles held, “which” (hate or discord, or the year), being
        changeable, dissolves “the bond,” i.e., the former union of the
        elements; or the year or hate returns to a full bond, because by a
        certain ability and hidden power it returns to predominate over things.
      </p>
      <p>
        480. After these words of Empedodes, Aristotle, in giving the meaning of
        the word “changeable” which he used, adds the explanation as though
        change were necessary; for he says that Empedocles made the foregoing
        statements as though it were necessary that there should be an
        alternation of hate and love, but he gives no reason for this necessity.
        For in the case of this one living thing it is evident that what causes
        the alternation of hate and love is the motion of the heavens which
        causes generation and corruption in the world. But no such cause can be
        assigned why the whole should be changed in this way by love and hate.
        Hence it is clear that his argument was inadequate.
      </p>
      <p>481. <span style="font-weight: bold">Yet he alone</span> (263).</p>
      <p>
        Here he shows that this argument of Empedocles is not to the point. He
        says that Empedocles seems to say 11 expressly,” i.e., clearly, only
        that he does not hold that some of the things derived from these
        principles are corruptible and others incorruptible, but he holds that
        all things are corruptible with the exception of the elements alone.
        Thus he seems to avoid the foregoing problem inasmuch as the question
        remains why some things are corruptible and some not, if they come from
        the same principles. Hence it is also clear that his argument is not to
        the point, because he neglects the very point that requires explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
        482. But it can be asked how he can say here that Empedocles held all
        things to be corruptible except the elements, since Empedocles has said
        above that the one is God, i.e., what is composed of the other
        principles except hate. It must be noted, however, that Empedocles
        posited two processes of corruption in the world, as is clear from what
        was said above. He posited one with respect to the blending of the whole
        universe, which was brought about by love; and from this process he did
        not make even God immune, because in God he placed love, which caused
        other things to be mixed with God. And he posited another process of
        corruption for singular things, and the principle of this process is
        hate. But he excluded this kind of corruption from God, seeing that he
        did not posit hate in God. In summing up, then, Aristotle concludes that
        this much has been said for the purpose of showing that corruptible and
        incorruptible things do not have the same principles.
      </p>
      <p>
        483. <span style="font-weight: bold">But if the principles</span> (264)
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he argues the other side of the question, with two arguments. The
        first is this: if the principles of corrup4le and incorruptible things
        are not the same, the question arises whether the principles of
        corruptible things are corruptible or incorruptible. If one says that
        they are corruptible, he proves that this is false by two arguments. The
        first runs thus: every corruptible thing is dissolved into the
        principles of which it is composed. If, then, the principles of
        corruptible things are corruptible, it will be necessary to hold also
        that there are other principles from which they are derived. But this is
        untenable, unless an infinite regress is posited. Now it was shown in
        Book II (152:C 299) that it is impossible to have an infinite regress in
        principles in any class of cause. And it would be just as untenable for
        someone to say that this condition applies in the case of corruptible
        principles, since corruption seems to come about as a result of
        something being dissolved into prior principles.
      </p>
      <p>
        484. The second argument runs thus. If the principles of corruptible
        things are corruptible, they must be corrupted, because every
        corruptible thing will be corrupted. But after they have been corrupted
        they cannot be principles, for what is corrupted or has been corrupted
        cannot cause anything. Therefore, since corruptible things are always
        caused in succession, the principles of corruptible things cannot be
        said to be corruptible.
      </p>
      <p>
        485. Again, if it is said that the principles of corruptible things are
        incorruptible, evidently the principles of incorruptible things are
        incorruptible. Therefore the question remains why it is that from
        certain incorruptible principles corruptible effects are produced, and
        from certain others incorruptible effects are produced; for this seems
        to be unreasonable and is either impossible or requires considerable
        explanation.
      </p>
      <p>486. <span style="font-weight: bold">Further, no one</span> (265).</p>
      <p>
        Then relative to his main thesis he gives his second argument, which is
        drawn from the common opinions of all men. For no one has attempted to
        say that corruptible and incorruptible things have different principles,
        but all say that all things have the, same principles. Yet the first
        argument, given in favor of the first part of the question, all pass
        over lightly, as though it were of little importance; but this is to
        acknowledge its truth. Hence the text of Boethius says: “But they
        swallow the first argument as though they considered it a minor matter.”
      </p>
      <p>
        <i
          >Q. 13: Are the principles of corruptible and incorruptible things the
          same?</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        487. Now the solution to this problem is given in Book XII (2553), where
        the Philosopher shows that the first active or motive principles of all
        things are the same but in a certain sequence. For the first principles
        of things are unqualifiedly incorruptible and immobile, whereas the
        second are incorruptible and mobile, i.e., the celestial bodies, which
        cause generation and corruption in the world as a result of their
        motion. Now the intrinsic principles of corruptible and of incorruptible
        things are the same, not numerically but analogically. Still the
        intrinsic principles of corruptible things, which are matter and form,
        are not corruptible in themselves but only in reference to something
        else. For it is in this way that the matter and form of corruptible
        things are corrupted, as is stated in Book I of the
        <i>Physics</i>.<br /></p

      <p>
        266. But the most difficult problem which has to be considered, and the
        one which is most necessary for a knowledge of the truth, is whether
        unity and being are the substance of existing things, and whether each
        of them is nothing else than unity and being. Or whether it is necessary
        to investigate what being and unity themselves are, as though there were
        some other nature which underlies them.
      </p>
      <p>
        267. For some think that reality is of the former sort, and some of the
        latter. For Plato and the Pythagoreans thought that being and unity were
        nothing else [than themselves], and that this is their nature, their
        substance being simply unity and being. But among the other philosophers
        [there are different opinions] about the nature of unity. Empedocles,
        for example, as though reducing it to something better known, says that
        unity is being; for he would seem to say that this is love, since this
        is the cause why unity belongs to all things. Others say that this unity
        and being of which existing things consist and have been made is fire,
        and others say it is air. And those who hold that there are many
        elements say the same thing; for they must also speak of unity and being
        in as many ways as they say there are principles.
      </p>
      <p>
        268. But if anyone holds that unity and being are not substances, it
        will follow that no other universals are such; for these are the most
        universal of all. But if there is no one-in-itself or being-in-itself,
        there will hardly be any other things that exist apart from what are
        called singular things. Further, if unity is not a substance, evidently
        number will not exist as another reality separate from existing things;
        for number is units, and a unit is truly something one. But if there is
        a one-in-itself and being-in-itself, the substance of these must be
        unity itself and being itself. For nothing else is predicated
        universally of all things but these two.
      </p>
      <p>
        269. But, on the other hand, if there is to be a one-in-itself and
        being-in-itself, there is great difficulty in seeing how there will be
        anything else besides these. I mean, how will there be more beings than
        one? For that which differs from being does not exist, Hence according
        to Parmenides’ argument it must follow that all beings are one, and that
        this is being.
      </p>
      <p>
        270. But there is a difficulty in either case; for whether unity itself
        is not a substance, or whether there is a unity itself, it is impossible
        for number to be a substance. Now it has already been stated why this
        follows if unity is not a substance; but if it is, the same difficulty
        will arise with regard to being. For from something outside of being
        something else will be one; for it must be not one. But all beings are
        either one or many, each of which is a one.
      </p>
      <p>
        271. Further, if unity itself is indivisible, according to Zeno’s axiom
        it will be nothing. For that which when added does not make a thing
        greater or when subtracted does not make it smaller, this, he says, does
        not belong to the realm of existing things, as though it were evident
        that whatever has being is a continuous quantity.’ And if it is a
        continuous quantity, it is corporeal; for this in every respect is a
        being. But other quantities, for example, a surface and a line, when
        added in one way will make a thing greater, but in another way they will
        not; and a point and a unit will do so in no way.
      </p>
      <p>
        272. But this philosopher speculates clumsily, and it is possible for a
        thing to be indivisible in such a way that some answer may be made
        against him; for when something of this kind is added it will not make a
        thing greater but more.
      </p>
      <p>
        273. Yet how will continuous quantity come from such a unity or from
        many of them? For this would be like saying that a line is made up of
        points.
      </p>
      <p>
        274. But even if someone were to think that the situation is such that
        number has come, as some say, from unity itself and from something else
        that is not one, none the less it would be necessary to inquire why and
        how the thing which has come to be would sometimes be a number and
        sometimes a continuous quantity, if that not-one were inequality and the
        same nature in either case. For it is not clear how continuous
        quantities would be produced from unity and this principle, or from some
        number and this principle.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p>
        <i>Q. 14a: Are “one” and “being” substances or principles of things?</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        488. Having asked whether the principles of things are the same or
        different, the Philosopher now asks how unity itself could have the
        nature of a principle; and in regard to this he does three things.
        First, he asks whether unity itself is a principle; second (502), he
        asks whether numbers, which arise or follow from unity, are the
        principles of things; and third (515), whether the Forms, which are
        certain separate unities, are the principles of things.
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does three things. First, he raises the
        question. Second (489), he gives the opinions on both sides (“For some
        think”). Third (490), he advances arguments on both sides (“But if
        anyone”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He says, first (266), that of all the different questions which have
        been raised, one is more difficult to consider because of the weight of
        the arguments on both sides, and that this question is also one about
        which it is necessary to know the truth, because our decision about the
        substances of things depends on it. Now this question is whether unity
        and being are the substances of things, not so that either of them must
        be attributed to some other nature which would be informed, as it were,
        by unity and being, but rather so that the unity and being of a thing
        are its substance; or, in an opposite way, whether it is necessary to
        ask what that thing is to which unity and being properly belong, as
        though there were some other nature which is their subject.
      </p>
      <p>489. <span style="font-weight: bold">For some think</span> (267)</p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the opinions on each side of the question. He says that
        some philosophers thought that reality was of one kind, and some of
        another. For Plato and the Pythagoreans did not hold that unity and
        being are the attributes of some nature, but that they constitute the
        nature of things, as though being itself and unity itself were the
        substance of things. But some philosophers, in speaking about the
        natural world, attributed unity and being to certain other natures, as
        Empedocles reduced the one to something better known, which he- said is
        unity and being; and this seems to be love, which is the cause of unity
        in the world. But other philosophers of nature attributed these to
        certain elementary causes, whether they posited one first principle, as
        fire or air, or more than one. For since they would hold that the
        material principles of things are the substances of things, it was
        necessary that each of these should constitute the unity and being of
        things; so that whichever one of these anyone might hold to be a
        principle, he would logically think that through it being and unity
        would be attributed to A things, whether he posited one principle or
        more than one.
      </p>
      <p>490. <span style="font-weight: bold">But if anyone</span> (268).</p>
      <p>
        Here he gives arguments on both sides of the question. First, he gives
        arguments in support of the view of Plato and Pythagoras. Second (269:C
        493), he gives arguments on the other side of the question, in support
        of the view of the philosophers of nature (“But, on the other hand”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first (268), he makes use of elimination as follows. It
        is necessary to hold either that unity and being, separate and existing
        apart, are a substance, or not. Now if it is said that unity and being
        are not a substance, two untenable consequences will follow. The first
        of these is this: unity and being are said to be the most universal of
        all, and therefore, if unity and being are not separate in such a way
        that unity itself or being itself is a certain substance, it will then
        follow that no universal is separate. Thus it will follow that there is
        nothing in the world except singular things, which seems to be
        inappropriate, as has been stated in earlier questions (C 443).
      </p>
      <p>
        491. The other untenable consequence is this. Number is nothing else
        than units, because number is composed of units; for a unit is nothing
        else than unity itself. Therefore, if unity itself is not separate as a
        substance existing of itself, it will follow that number will not be a
        reality separate from those things which are found in matter. This can
        be shown to be inappropriate in view of what has already been stated
        above. Hence it cannot be said that unity and being are not a substance
        which exists by itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        492. Therefore, if the other part of the division is conceded, that
        there is something which is unity itself and being itself, and that this
        exists separately, it must be the substance of all those things of which
        unity and being are predicated. For everything that is separate and is
        predicated of many things is the substance of those things of which it
        is predicated. But nothing else is predicated of all things in as
        universal a way as unity and being. Therefore unity and being will be
        the substance of all things.
      </p>
      <p>
        493.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">But, on the other hand</span> (269).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he argues the other side of the question; and he gives two
        arguments. The second (271:C 496) of use these begins where he says,
        “Further, if unity itself.”
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. First, he gives the argument.
        Second (270:C 494), he shows how the question is made difficult as a
        result of the argument given (“But there is a difficulty in either
        case”).
      </p>
      <p>
        The first (269) argument, then, is as follows: if there is something
        which is itself being and unity as something,existing separately, it
        will be necessary to say that unity is the very same thing as being. But
        that which differs from being is non-being. Therefore it follows,
        according to the argument of Parmenides, that besides the one there is
        only non-being. Thus all things will have to be one, because it could
        not be held that that which differs from the one, which is essentially
        separate, is a being.
      </p>
      <p>
        494.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">But there is a difficulty</span> (270).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he shows how this argument creates a difficulty in the case of the
        position of Plato, who held that number is the substance of things. He
        says that Plato faces a difficulty in either case, whether it is said
        that this separate one is a substance or not. For whichever view is
        held, it seems impossible that number should be the substance of things.
        For if it is held that unity is not a substance, it has already been
        stated (269:C 493) why number cannot be held to be a substance.
      </p>
      <p>
        495. But if unity itself is a substance, the same problem will arise
        with respect to both unity and being. For either there is some other
        unity besides this unity which exists separately of itself, or there is
        not. And if there is no other, a multitude of things will not exist now,
        as Parmenides said. But if there is another unity, then that other
        unity, since it is not unity itself, must have as a material element
        something that is other than unity itself, and, consequently, other than
        being. And that material element from which this second unity comes to
        be, will have not to be a being. Thus a multitude of beings cannot be
        constituted from this unity which exists apart from unity itself,
        because all beings are either one or many, each of which is a one. But
        this one has as its material element something that is neither unity nor
        being.
      </p>
      <p>
        496. <span style="font-weight: bold">Further, if unity</span> (271).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the second argument; and in regard to this he does three
        things. First (271:C 496), he gives the argument. Second (272:C 498), he
        criticizes it (“But this”). Third (273:C 499), he shows that the
        difficulty remains (“Yet how will continuous quantity”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He says first (271), then, that if this separate unity is indivisible,
        there follows from this the other position, which Zeno assumed, that
        nothing exists. For Zeno supposed that that which when added does not
        make a thing greater and when taken away does not make it smaller, is
        nothing in the real order. But he makes this assumption on the grounds
        that continuous quantity is the same as being. For it is evident that
        this is not a continuous quantity—I mean that which when added does not
        make a thing greater and when subtracted does not make it smaller.
        Therefore, if every being were a continuous quantity, it would follow
        that that which when added does not make a thing greater and when
        subtracted does not make it smaller, is non-being.
      </p>
      <p>
        497. And better still, if any particular thing were to bear this out,
        every being would have to be a corporeal continuous quantity. For
        anything added to or subtracted from a body in any one of its
        dimensions, makes the body greater or less. But other continuous
        quantities, such as lines and surfaces, become greater insofar as one
        dimension is added, whereas others do not. For line added to line in
        length causes increase in length but not in width; and surface added to
        surface causes increase in width and in length but not in depth. But a
        point and a unit do not become greater or less in any way. Hence
        according to Zeno’s axiom it would follow that a point and a unit are
        non-beings in an absolute sense, whereas a body is a being in every
        respect, and surfaces and lines are beings in one respect and non-beings
        in another respect.
      </p>
      <p>498. <span style="font-weight: bold">But this</span> (272).</p>
      <p>
        Here he criticizes the argument which has been given. He says that Zeno,
        by proposing such an axiom, speculated “clumsily,” i.e., in an unskilled
        and rude manner, so that according to him there cannot be anything
        indivisible. And for this reason some answer must be given to the
        foregoing argument; and if not to the point at issue, at least to the
        man. Now we say that even though a unity when added to something else
        does not make it larger, it does cause it to be more. And it is
        sufficient for the notion of being that in the case of what is
        continuous it should make a thing larger, and that in the case of what
        is discrete it should make it more.
      </p>
      <p>499. <span style="font-weight: bold">Yet how will</span> (273).</p>
      <p>
        Then he states the difficulty which still faces the Platonists after the
        above solution. And he advances two difficulties. The Ifirst of these is
        that the Platonists held that the one which is indivisible is the cause
        not only of number, which is a plurality, but also of continuous
        quantity. Therefore, if it is granted that when a one is added it makes
        a thing more, as would seem to suffice for the one which is the cause of
        number, how will it be possible for continuous quantity to come from an
        indivisible one of this kind, or from many such ones, as the Platonists
        held? For this would seem to be the same thing as to hold that a line is
        composed of points. For unity is indivisible just as a point is.
      </p>
      <p>
        500. <span style="font-weight: bold">But even if someone</span> (274)
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the second difficulty. He says that if anyone were to
        think that the situation is such that number is the result of the
        indivisible one and of something else which is not one, but participates
        in the one as a kind of inaterial nature, as some say, the question
        would still remain why and how that which comrs from the one as form and
        from another material nature, which is called the not-one, is sometimes
        a number and sometimes a continuous quantity. The difficulty would be
        most acute if that material not-one were inequality, as is implied in
        the continuously extended, and were to be the same reality. For it is
        not clear how numbers come from this inequality as matter and from the
        one as form; nor again is it clear how continuous quantities come from
        some number as form and from this inequality as matter. For the
        Platonists held that number comes from a primary one and a primary two,
        and that from this number and material inequality continuous quantity is
        produced.
      </p>
      <p>
        501. The solution of this problem is treated by Aristotle in the
        following books. For the fact that there is something separate, which is
        itself one and being, he will prove below in Book XII (2553), when he
        establishes the oneness of the first principle which is separate in an
        absolute sense, although it is not the substance of all things which are
        one, as the Platonists thought, but is the cause and principle of the
        unity of all things. And insofar as unity is predicated of other things
        it is used in two ways. In one way it is interchangeable with being, and
        in this way each thing is one by its very essence, as is proved below in
        Book IV (548); and unity in this sense adds nothing to being except
        merely the notion of undividedness. Unity is used in another way insofar
        as it has the character of a first measure, either in an absolute sense
        or with respect to some genus. And this unity if it is both a minimum in
        the absolute sense and indivisible, is the one which is the principle
        and measure of number. But if it is not both a minimum in an absolute
        sense and indivisible, it will not be a unit and measure in an absolute
        sense, as a pound in the case of weights and a half-tone in the case of
        melodies, and a foot in the case of lengths. And nothing prevents
        continuous quantities from being composed of this kind of unity. He will
        establish this in Book X (1940) of this work. But because the Platonists
        thought that the one which is the principle of number and the one which
        is interchangeable with being are the same, they therefore held that the
        one which is the principle of number is the substance of each thing, and
        consequently that number, inasmuch as it is composed of many substantial
        principles, makes up or comprises the substance of composite things. But
        he will treat this question at greater length in Books XIII and XIV of
        this work.<br /></p

      <p>
        275. And connected with these is the question whether numbers and bodies
        and surfaces and points are substances, or not.
      </p>
      <p>
        276. For if they are not, we are in a quandary as to what being is, and
        what the substances of things are. For affections and motions and
        relations and dispositions and their complex conceptions do not seem to
        signify substance; because all are predicated of some subject, and no
        one of them is a particular thing. And those things which seem to
        signify substance most of all, as fire, water, earth [and air], of which
        composite bodies are constituted, their heat and cold and similar
        affections, are not substances. And it is only the body which undergoes
        these that remains as a being and is a substance.
      </p>
      <p>
        277. Yet a body is a substance to a lesser degree than a surface, and
        this than a line, and this in turn than a unit and a point; for a body
        is defined by means of these, and these seem to be capable of existing
        without a body, but that a body should exist without these is
        impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        278. For this reason many of the natural philosophers, including the
        first, thought that substance and being are bodies, and that other
        things are attributes of this kind of thing; and hence too that the
        principles of bodies are the principles of beings. But the later
        philosophers, who were wiser than these, thought that the principles-of
        things are numbers. Therefore, as we have said, if these are not
        substance, there is no substance or being at all; for the accidents of
        these things are not worthy to be called beings.
      </p>
      <p>
        279. But if it is admitted that lengths and points are substances to a
        greater degree than bodies, and we do not see to what sort of bodies
        these belong (because it is impossible for them to exist in sensible
        bodies), there will then be no substance at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        280. Further, all of these seem to be dimensions of bodies, one
        according to width, another according to depth, and another according to
        length.
      </p>
      <p>
        281. And, similarly, any figure whatever already exists in a solid.
        Hence if neither Mercury is in the stone, nor one half of a cube in a
        cube as something segregated, neither will surface exist in a solid; for
        if this were true of anything whatever, it would also be true of that
        which divides a thing in half. And the same argument would apply in the
        case of a line, a point and a unit. If, then, a body is substance in the
        highest degree, and these things are such to a greater degree than it
        is, and these do not exist and are not substances, it escapes our
        understanding as to what being itself is and what the substance of
        beings is.
      </p>
      <p>
        282. For along with what has been said there happen to be certain
        unreasonable views about generation and corruption. For if substance,
        not existing before, exists now, or existing before, does not exist
        afterwards, it seems to suffer these changes through generation and
        corruption. But it is impossible for points and lines and surfaces
        either to come to be or to be destroyed, even though they sometimes
        exist and sometimes do not. For when bodies are joined or divided, at
        one time, when they are joined, they [i.e., the two surfaces]
        simultaneously become one, and at another time, when they are divided,
        two surfaces are produced; because it [i.e., one of the two surfaces in
        question] is not in the bodies which have been joined but has perished.
        And when bodies are divided surfaces exist which did not exist before.
        For the indivisible point is not divided into two, and if things are
        generated and corrupted, they are generated from something.
      </p>
      <p>
        283. And it is similar with regard to the now in time, for this cannot
        be generated and corrupted. Yet it seems always to exist, although it is
        not a substance. It is also clear that this is true of points, lines and
        surfaces, because the argument is the same; for they are all similarly
        either limits or divisions.

          >Q 14b: Are numbers and continuous quantities the substances or
          principles of sensible things?</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        502. Having inquired whether unity and being are the substances of
        sensible things, the Philosopher now asks whether numbers and continuous
        quantities are the substances of sensible things; and in regard to this
        he does three things. First (502), he presents the question. Second
        (503), he argues in support of one side of the question (“For if they
        are not”). Third (507), he argues on the other side (“But if it is
        admitted”).
      </p>
      <p>
        Accordingly he says, first, that “connected with these,” i.e., following
        from the foregoing problem, there is the question whether numbers and
        continuous quantities, i.e., bodies, surfaces, and their extremities,
        such as points, are either substances that are separate from sensible
        things, or are the substances of sensible things themselves, or not. He
        says that this problem is a result of the foregoing one, because in the
        foregoing problem it was asked whether unity is the substance of things.
        Now unity is the principle of number. But number seems to be the
        substance of continuous quantity inasmuch as a point, which is a
        principle of continuous quantity, seems to be merely the number one
        having position, and a line to be the number two having position, and
        the primary kind of surface to be the number three having position, and
        a body the number four having position.
      </p>
      <p>
        503. <span style="font-weight: bold">For if they are not</span> (276).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he advances an argument to show that these are the substances of
        sensible things; and in regard to this he does two things. First (276:C
        503), he introduces an argument to show that these are the substances of
        sensible things. Second (278:C 506), he shows how the early philosophers
        followed out the first arguments (“For this reason”).
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the first he does two things. For, first, he advances an
        argument to show that body is the substance of things; and second (277:C
        504), to show that many other things are substances to an even greater
        degree (“Yet a body”).
      </p>
      <p>
        He says, first (276), that if these things are not substances, we are in
        a quandary as to what being is essentially, and what the substances of
        beings are. For it is evident that affections and motions and relations
        and dispositions or arrangements, and their complex conceptions ‘
        according as they are put into words, do not seem to signify the
        substance of anything; because all things of this kind seem to be
        predicated of a subject as something belonging to the genus of quantity,
        and no one of them seems to signify “this particular thing,” i.e.,
        something that is complete and subsists of itself. This is especially
        evident in regard to the foregoing things, which are not said to be
        complete things but things whose nature consists in a kind of relation.
        But of all things those which especially seem to signify substance are
        fire, earth, and water, of which many bodies are composed. But he omits
        air, because it is less perceptible; and this is the reason why some
        thought air to be nothing. But in these bodies there are found certain
        dispositions, namely, hot and cold and other affections and passible
        qualities of this kind, which are not substances according to what has
        been said. It follows, then, that body alone is substance.
      </p>
      <p>504. <span style="font-weight: bold">Yet a body</span> (277)</p>
      <p>
        Here he proceeds to examine those things which appear to be substance to
        an even greater degree than a body. He says that a body seems to be a
        substance to a lesser degree than a surface, and a surface than a line,
        and a line than a point or a unit. He proves this in two ways, of which
        the first is as follows. That by which a thing is defined seems to be
        its substance, for a definition signifies substance. But a body is
        defined by a surface, a surface by a line, a line by a point, and a
        point by a unit, because they say that a point is a unit having
        position. Therefore surface is the substance of body, and so on for the
        others.
      </p>
      <p>
        505. The second argument runs as follows. Since substance is the primary
        kind of being, whatever is prior seems to be substance to a greater
        degree. But a surface is naturally prior to a body, because a surface
        can exist without a body but not a body without a surface. Therefore a
        surface is substance to a greater degree than a body. The same reasoning
        can be applied to all the others in turn.
      </p>
      <p>506. <span style="font-weight: bold">For this reason</span> (278).</p>
      <p>
        Then he shows how the earlier philosophers followed out the foregoing
        arguments. He says that it was because of the foregoing arguments that
        many of the ancient philosophers, especially the first, thought that
        body alone was being and substance, and that all other things were
        accidents of bodies. Hence when they wanted to study the principles of
        beings, they studied the principles of bodies, as was stated above in
        Book I (36:C 74) with regard to the positions of the ancient natural
        philosophers. But the other philosophers who came later, and were
        reputed to be wiser than the aforesaid philosophers inasmuch as they
        dealt more profoundly with the principles of things, i.e., the
        Pythagoreans and Platonists, were of the opinion that numbers are the
        substances of sensible things inasmuch as numbers are composed of units.
        And the unit seems to be one substance of things. Hence, according to
        the foregoing arguments and opinions of the philosophers, it seems that
        if these things—numbers, lines, surfaces, and bodies—are not the
        substances of things, there will be no being at all. For if these are
        not beings, it is unfitting that their accidents should be called
        beings.
      </p>
      <p>507. <span style="font-weight: bold">But if it is</span> (279).</p>
      <p>
        Then he argues in support of the other side of the question; and he
        gives four arguments, the first of which is as follows. If anyone were
        to admit that lengths and points are substances to a greater degree than
        bodies, then supposing that things of this sort are not substances, it
        also follows that bodies are not substances. Consequently, no substance
        will exist, because the accidents of bodies are not substances, as has
        been stated above (C 503). But points,’lines and surfaces are not
        substances. For these must be the limits of some bodies, because a point
        is the limit of a line, a line the limit of a surface, and a surface the
        limit of a body. But it is not evident to what sort of bodies these
        surfaces, lines and points, which are substances, belong. For it is
        evident that the lines and surfaces of sensible bodies are not
        substances, because they are altered in the same way as the other
        accidents in reference to the same subject. Therefore it follows that
        there will be no substance whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
        508. <span style="font-weight: bold">Further, all of these</span> (280).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the second argument, which is as follows. All of the
        abovementioned things seem to be certain dimensions of bodies, either
        according to width, as a surface, or according to depth, as a solid, or
        according to length, as a line. But the dimensions of a body are not
        substances. Therefore things of this kind are not substances.
      </p>
      <p>509. <span style="font-weight: bold">And, similarly</span> (281).</p>
      <p>
        Here he gives a third argument, which is as follows. Any figure which
        can be educed from a solid body according to some dimension is present
        in that body in the same way, i.e., potentially. But in the case of a
        large piece of stone which has not yet been cut, it is evident that
        “Mercury,” i.e., the figure of Mercury, is not present in it actually
        but only potentially. Therefore, in like manner, “in a cube,” i.e., in a
        body having six square surfaces, one half of the cube, which is another
        figure, is not present actually; but it becomes actual in this way when
        a cube has already been divided into two halves. And since every
        eduction of a new figure in a solid which has been cut is made according
        to some surface which limits a figure, it is also evident that such a
        surface will not be present in a body actually but only potentially. For
        if each surface besides the external one were actually present in a
        solid body, then for the same reason the surface which limits one half
        of the figure would also be actually present in it. But what has been
        said of a surface must also be understood of a line, a point, and a
        unit; for these are actually present in the continuum only insofar as
        they limit the continuum, and it is evident that these are not the
        substance of a body. But the other surfaces and lines cannot be the
        substance of a body, because they are not actually present in it; for a
        substance is actually present in the thing whose substance it is. Hence
        he concludes that of all of these body especially seems to be substance,
        and that surfaces and lines seem to be substance to a great degree than
        bodies. Now if these are not actual beings or substances, it seems to
        escape our comprehension as to what being is and what the substances of
        things are.
      </p>
      <p>510. <span style="font-weight: bold">For along with</span> (282).</p>
      <p>
        Here he gives the fourth argument. First, he states it, and second
        (283:C 513), he clarifies it by using a similar case (“And it is
        similar”).
      </p>
      <p>
        Accordingly, he says, first (282), that along with the other untenable
        consequences mentioned there also happen to be certain unreasonable
        views about generation and corruption on the part of those who hold that
        lines and surfaces are the substances of sensible things. For every
        substance which at first did not exist and later does exist, or which
        first was and afterwards is not, seems to suffer this change by way of
        generation and corruption. This is most evident in the case of all those
        things which are caused by way of motion. But points and lines and
        surfaces sometimes are and sometimes are not. Yet they are not generated
        or corrupted. Neither, then, are they substances.
      </p>
      <p>
        511. He then proves each assumption. The first of these, is that they
        sometimes are and sometimes are not. For it happens that bodies which
        were at first distinct are afterwards united, and that those which were
        at first united are afterwards divided. For when bodies which were
        initially separated are united, one surface is produced for the two of
        them, because the parts of a continuous body are united in having one
        common boundary, which is one surface. But when one body is divided into
        two, two surfaces are produced, because it cannot be said that when two
        bodies are brought together their surfaces remain intact, but that both
        “perish,” i.e., cease to be. In like manner, when bodies are divided
        there begin to exist for the first time two surfaces which previously
        did not exist. For it cannot be said that a surface, which is
        indivisible according to depth, is divided into two surfaces according
        to depth; or that a line, which is indivisible according to width, is
        divided according to width; or that a point, which is indivisible in
        every respect, is divided in any respect whatsoever. Thus it is clear
        that two things cannot be produced from one thing by way of division,
        and that one thing cannot be produced from two of these things by way of
        combination. Hence it follows that points, lines and surfaces sometimes
        begin to be and sometimes cease to be.
      </p>
      <p>
        512. After having proved this, he proves the second assumption, namely,
        that these things are neither generated nor corrupted. For everything
        that is generated is generated from something, and everything that is
        corrupted is dissolved into something as its matter. But it is
        impossible to assign any matter whatever from which these things are
        generated and into which they are dissolved, because they are simple.
        Therefore they are neither generated nor corrupted.
      </p>
      <p>
        513. <span style="font-weight: bold">And it is similar</span> (283).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he makes the foregoing argument clear by using a similar case. For
        the now in time stands to time as a point to a line. But the now in time
        does not seem to be generated and corrupted, because if it were its
        generation and corruption would have to be measured by some particular
        time or instant. Thus the measure of this now either would be another
        now and so on to infinity, or would be time itself. But this is
        impossible. And even though the now is not generated or corrupted, still
        each now always seems to differ, not substantially but existentially,
        because the substance of the now corresponds to the mobile subject. But
        the difference of the now in terms of existence corresponds to the
        variation in motion, as is shown in Book IV of the <i>Physics</i>.
        Therefore the same thing seems to be true of a point in relation to a
        line, and of a line in relation to a surface, and of a surface in
        relation to a body, namely, that they are neither corrupted nor
        generated, although some variation is observable in things of this kind.
        For the same holds true of all of these, because all things of this kind
        are, in like manner, limits if regarded as at the extremities, or
        divisions if they are found in between. Hence, just as the now varies
        existentially as motion flows by, although it remains substantially the
        same because the mobile subject remains the same, so also does the point
        vary. And it does not become different because of the division of a
        line, even though it is not corrupted or generated in an absolute sense.
        The same holds true of the others.
      </p>
      <p>
        514. But the Philosopher will treat this question in Books XIII and XIV.
        And the truth of the matter is that mathematical entities of this kind
        are not the substances of things, but are accidents which accrue to
        substances. But this mistake about continuous quantities is due to the
        fact that no distinction is made between the sort of body which/belongs
        to the genus of substance and the sort which belongs to the genus of
        quantity. For body belongs to the genus of substance according as it is
        composed of matter and form; and dimensions are a natural consequence of
        these in corporeal matter. But dimensions themselves belong to the genus
        of quantity, and are not substances but accidents whose subject is a
        body composed of matter and form. The same thing too was said above
        (500) about those who held that numbers are the substances of things;
        for their mistake came from not distinguishing between the one which is
        the principle of number and that which is interchangeable with being.<br /></p

        284. But in general one will wonder why, in addition to sensible things
        and those which are intermediate, it is necessary to look for certain
        other things which we posit as the specific essences (or Forms) of
        sensible things.
      </p>
      <p>
        285. For if it is because the objects of mathematics differ in one
        respect from the things which are at hand, they do not differ in being
        many things that are specifically the same. Hence the principles of
        sensible things will not be limited in number but only in species;
        unless one were to consider the principles of this particular syllable
        or word, for these are limited in number. And this is likewise true of
        the intermediate entities; for in their case too there are an infinite
        number of things that are specifically the same. Hence, if in addition
        to sensible substances and the objects of mathematics there are not
        certain other things, such as some call the Forms, there will be no
        substance which is one both numerically and specifically. Nor will the
        principles of beings be limited in number, but only in species.
        Therefore, if this is necessary, it will also be necessary on this
        account that there should be Forms. And even if those who speak of the
        Forms do not express themselves clearly, although this is what they
        wanted to say, they must affirm that each of the Forms is a substance,
        and that nothing accidental pertains to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        286. But if we hold that the Forms exist, and that principles are one
        numerically but not specifically, we have stated the untenable
        conclusions that follow from this view.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p><i>Q14c: Are forms substances or principles of things?</i></p>
      <p>
        515. Having inquired whether the objects of mathematics are the
        principles of sensible substances, the Philosopher now inquires whether
        in addition to the objects of mathematics there are certain other
        principles, such as those which we call Forms, which are the substances
        and principles of sensible things. In regard to this he does three
        things. First, he presents the question. Second (516), he argues one
        side of the question (“For if it is because”). Third (518), he argues
        the other side (“But if we hold”).
      </p>
      <p>
        Accordingly, he says, first, that if one assumes that the objects of
        mathematics are not the principles of sensible things and their
        substances, one will next have the problem why, in addition to both
        sensible things and the objects of mathematics (which are an
        intermediate class between sensible things and the Forms), it is
        necessary to posit a third class of entities, namely, the specific
        essences, i.e., the Ideas or separate Forms.
      </p>
      <p>
        516. <span style="font-weight: bold">For if it is because</span> (285)
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he argues one side of the question. The reason why it is necessary
        to posit separate Forms over and above sensible substances and the
        objects of mathematics seems to be that the objects of mathematics
        differ in one respect “from the things at hand,” i.e., from sensible
        things, which exist in the universe; for the objects of mathematics
        abstract from sensible matter. Yet they do not differ but rather agree
        in another respect. For just as we find many sensible things which are
        specifically the same but numerically different, as many men or many
        horses, in a similar way we find many objects of mathematics which are
        specifically the same but numerically different, such as many
        equilateral triangles and many equal lines. And if this is true, it
        follows that, just as the principles of sensible things are not limited
        in number but in species, the same thing is true “of the intermediate
        entities”—the objects of mathematics. For since in the case of sensible
        things there are many individuals of one sensible. species, it is
        evident that the principles of sensible things are not limited in number
        but in species, unless of course we can consider the proper principles
        of a particular individual thing, which are also limited in number and
        are individual. He gives as an example words; for in the case of a word
        expressed in letters it is clear that the letters are its principles,
        yet there are not a limited number of individual letters taken
        numerically, but only a limited number taken specifically, some of which
        are vowels and some consonants. But this limitation is according to
        species and not according to number. For <i>a</i> is not only one but
        many, and the same applies to other letters. But if we take those
        letters which are the principles of a particular syllable, whether
        written or spoken, then they are limited in number. And for the same
        reason, since there are many objects of mathematics which are
        numerically different in one species, the mathematical principles of
        mathematical science could not be limited in number but only in species.
        We might say, for example, that the principles of triangles are three
        sides and three angles; but this limitation is according to species, for
        any of them can be multiplied to infinity. Therefore, if there were
        nothing besides sensible things and the objects of mathematics, it would
        follow that the substance of a Form would be numerically one, and that
        the principles of beings would not be limited in number but only in
        species. Therefore, if it is necessary that they be limited in number
        (otherwise it would happen that the principles of things are infinite in
        number), it follows that there must be Forms in addition to the objects
        of mathematics and sensible things.
      </p>
      <p>
        517. This is what the Platonists wanted to say, because it necessarily
        follows from the things which they held that in the case of the
        substance of sensible things there is a single Form to which nothing
        accidental belongs. For something accidental, such as whiteness or
        blackness, pertains to an individual man, but to this separate man, who
        is a Form, according to the Platonists, there pertains nothing
        accidental but only what belongs to the definition of the species. And
        although they wanted to say this, they did not “express themselves”
        clearly; i.e., they did not clearly distinguish things.
      </p>
      <p>518. <b>But if wehold that</b> (286).</p>
      <p>
        Then he counters with an argument for the other side of the question. He
        says that, if we hold that there are separate Forms and that the
        principles of things are limited not only in species but also in number,
        certain impossible consequences will follow, which are touched on above
        in one of the questions (464).
      </p>
      <p>
        But the Philosopher will deal with this problem in Book XII (2450) and
        Book XIV of this work. And the truth of the matter is that, just as the
        objects of mathematics do not exist apart from sensible things, neither
        do Forms exist apart from the objects of mathematics and from sensible
        substances. And while the efficient and moving principles of things are
        limited in number, the formal principles of things, of which there are
        many individuals in one species, are not limited in number but only in
        species.<br /></p

      <p>
        287. And connected with these problems there is the question whether the
        elements of things exist potentially or in some other way.
      </p>
      <p>
        288. If they exist in some other way, then there will be something else
        prior to [first] principles. For potentiality is prior to that cause,
        but the potential need not exist in that way.
      </p>
      <p>
        289. But if the elements exist potentially, it is possible for nothing
        to exist; for even that which does not yet exist is capable of existing,
        because that which does not exist may come to be. But nothing that is
        incapable of existing may come to be. It is necessary, then, to
        investigate these problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        290. And there is also the problem whether [first] principles are
        universals or singular things, as we maintain.
      </p>
      <p>
        291. For if they are universals, they will not be substances, because a
        common term signifies not a particular thing but what sort of thing; and
        a substance is a particular thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        292. But if it is a particular thing, and is held to be the common
        whatness which is predicated of things, Socrates himself will be many
        animals: [himself] and man and animal; i.e., if each of these signifies
        a particular thing and a one. If, then, the first principles of things
        are universals, these consequences will follow.
      </p>
      <p>
        293. However, if they are not universals but have the nature of singular
        things, they will not be knowable; for all scientific knowledge is
        universal. Hence, if there is to be any scientific knowledge of [first]
        principles, there will have to be different principles which are
        predicated universally and are prior to [first] principles.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center">COMMENTARY</p>
      <p><i>Q 14d: Are principles of substances actual or potential?</i></p>
      <p>
        519. Having inquired what the principles are, the Philosopher now asks
        how they exist. First, he asks whether they exist potentially or
        actually; and second (523), whether they are universals or singulars
        (“And there is also the problem”). In regard to the first he does three
        things. First, he raises the question. Second (520), he argues one side
        (“If they exist”). Third (501), he argues the opposite side (“But if the
        elements”).
      </p>
      <p>
        His first question (287), then, is whether first principles exist
        potentially or “in some other way,” i.e., actually. This problem is
        introduced because of the ancient philosophers of nature, who held that
        there are only material principles, which are in potency. But the
        Platonists, who posited separate Forms as formal principles, claimed
        that they exist actually.
      </p>
      <p>520. <span style="font-weight: bold">If they exist</span> (288).</p>
      <p>
        He proves that principles exist potentially. For if they were to exist
        “in some other way,” i.e., actually, it would follow that there would be
        something prior to principles; for potentiality is prior to actuality.
        This is clear from the fact that one thing is prior to another when the
        sequence of their being cannot be reversed; for if a thing exists, it
        follows that it can be, but it does not necessarily follow that, if a
        thing is possible, it will exist actually. But it is impossible for
        anything to be prior to a first principle. Therefore it is impossible
        for a first principle to exist in any other way than potentially.
      </p>
      <p>
        521. <span style="font-weight: bold">But if the elements</span> (289).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here he argues the other side of the question. If the principles of
        things exist potentially, it follows that no beings exist actually; for
        that which exists potentially does not yet exist actually. He proves
        this on the grounds that that which is coming to be is not a being. For
        that which exists is not coming to be; but only that comes to be which
        exists potentially. Therefore everything that exists potentially is
        nonbeing. Hence if principles exist only potentially, beings will not
        exist. But if principles do not exist, neither will their effects. It
        follows, then, that it is possible for nothing to exist in the order of
        being. And in summing this tip he concludes that according to what has
        been said it is necessary to inquire about the principles of things for
        the reasons given.

        522. This question will be answered in Book IX (1844) of this work,
        where it is shown that actuality is prior to potentiality in an
        unqualified sense, but that in anything moved from potentiality to
        actuality, potentiality is prior to actuality in time. Hence it is
        necessary that the first principle exist actually and not potentially,
        as is shown in Book XII (2500) of this work.

      <p><i>Q 14e: Are principles of substances universal or singular?</i></p>
      <p>523. <b>And here is also the problem</b> (290).</p>
      <p>
        Here he asks whether the principles of things exist as universals or as
        singular things; and in regard to this he does three things. First, he
        presents the question. Second (524), he argues one side (“For if they
        are universals”). Third (527), he argues the other side (“However, if
        they are not universals”). The problem (290), then, is whether
        principles are universals or exist in the manner of singular things.
      </p>
      <p>524. <span style="font-weight: bold">For if they are</span> (291).</p>
      <p>
        Then he proves that principles are not universals, by the following
        argument. No predicate common to many things signifies a particular
        thing, but signifies such and such a thing or of what sort a thing is;
        and it does this not according to accidental quality but according to
        substantial quality, as is stated below in Book V (487:C 987) of this
        work. The reason for this is that a particular thing is said to be such
        insofar as it subsists of itself. But that which subsists of itself
        cannot be something that exists in many, as belongs to the notion of
        common. For that which exists in many will not subsist of itself unless
        it is itself many. But this is contrary to the notion of common, because
        what is common is what is onein-many. Hence it is clear that a
        particular thing does not signify anything common, but signifies a form
        existing in many things.
      </p>
      <p>
        525. Further, he adds the minor premise, namely, that substance
        signifies a particular thing. And this is true of first substances,
        which are said to be substances in the full and proper sense, as is
        stated in the Categories; “ for substances of this kind are things which
        subsist of themselves. Thus it follows that, if principles are
        universals, they are not substances. Hence either there will be no
        principles of substances, or it will be necessary to say that the
        principles of substances are not substances.
      </p>
      <p>
        526. But since it is possible for someone to affirm that some common
        predicate might signify this particular thing, he therefore criticizes
        this when he says “But if it is (292).”
      </p>
      <p>
        He explains the untenable consequence resulting from this. For if a
        common predicate were a particular thing, it would follow that
        everything to which that common predicate is applied would be this
        particular thing which is common. But it is clear that both animal and
        man are predicated of Socrates, and that each of these—animal and man—is
        a common predicate. Hence, if every common predicate were a particular
        thing, it would follow that Socrates would be three particular things;
        for Socrates is Socrates, which is a particular thing; and he is also a
        man, which is a particular thing according to the above; and he is also
        an animal, which is similarly a particular thing. Hence he would be
        three particular things. Further, it would follow that there would be
        three animals; for animal is predicated of itself, of man, and of
        Socrates. Therefore, since this is impossible, it is also impossible for
        a common predicate to be a particular thing. These, then, will be the
        impossible consequences which follow if principles are universals.
      </p>
      <p>
        527.
        <span style="font-weight: bold">However, if they are not</span> (293).
      </p>
      <p>
        He argues the other side of the question. Since all sciences are
        universal, they are not concerned with singulars but with universals.
        Therefore, if some principles were not universals but were singular
        things, they would not be knowable in themselves. Hence, if any science
        were to be had of them, there would have to be certain prior principles,
        which would be universals. It is necessary, then, that first principles
        be universals in order that science may be had of things; because if
        principles remain unknown, other things must remain unknown.
      </p>
      <p>
        528. This question will be answered in Book VII (1584) of this work,
        where it is shown that universals are neither substances nor the
        principles of things. However, it does not follow for this reason that,
        if the principles and substances of things were singulars, there could
        be no science of them, both because immaterial things, even though they
        subsist as singulars, are nevertheless also intelligible, and also
        because there is science of singulars according to their universal
        concepts which are apprehended by the intellect.
