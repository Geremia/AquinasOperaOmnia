              brighter and brighter until full</i

            day (Prov. 4:18).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            In this text the life of the saints is described under three
            aspects: first, its narrowness, when it is called a
            <i>path:</i> “For the gate is narrow and the way is hard, that leads
            to life” (Mt. 7:14); “That path no bird of prey knows, and the
            falcon’s eye has not seen it” (Job 28:7); secondly, its splendor
            when he says, <i>the light of dawn:</i> “For once you were darkness,
            but now you are light in the Lord” (Eph. 5:8). For the just shine
            and, as a result, their life shines. Thirdly, its progress, because
            it is always growing: “Long for the pure spiritual milk, that by it
            you may grow up to salvation” (1 Pet. 2:2); and this even until the
            full <i>day</i> of glory; “When the perfect comes, the imperfect
            will pass away” (1 Cor. 13:10).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            The way of the wicked, on the other hand, is wide, obscure, dark and
            failing: “The way of the wicked is like deep darkness: they do not
            know over what they stumble” (Prov. 4:19); “The gate is wide and the
            way is easy, that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it
            are many” (Mt. 7:13).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            From these words we can gather the subject matter of this letter.
            For the Philippians were on Christ’s narrow way, enduring many
            tribulations for Christ. They were enlightened by faith: “Among whom
            you shine as lights in the world” (Phil. 2:15). Furthermore, they
            were making progress, as is clear from the entire letter. Therefore,
            after the letter to the Ephesians, in which an instruction was given
            on preserving Church unity, it was fitting that those who best
            preserved it should be held up as an example of preserving the unity
            of the Church.<br />

            1 Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in
            Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons: 2
            Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus
            Christ. 3 1 thank my God in all my remembrance of you, 4 always in
            every prayer of mine for you all making my prayer with joy, 5
            thankful for your partnership in the gospel from the first day until
            now. 6 And I am sure that he who began a good work in you will bring
            it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ. 7 It is right for me to
            feel thus about you all, because I hold you in my heart, for you are
            all partakers with me of grace, both in my imprisonment and in the
            defense and confirmation of the gospel.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            This letter is divided into a greeting and a message (1:3). In the
            greeting he does three things: first, the persons who send the
            greeting are described; secondly, the persons greeted (1:1);
            thirdly, the good things he wishes them (1:2). In regard to the
            first he does two things: first, he mentions the persons who send
            the greeting; secondly, their condition (1:1).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            In regard to the first he mentions, first of all, the principal
            person, when he says, <i>Paul,</i> which means “small.” In this he
            indicates his humility: “The least one shall become a clan, and the
            smallest one a mighty nation” (Is. 60:22). Secondly, the co-sender,
            when he says, <i>and Timothy,</i> because he was their preacher: “I
            have no one like him, who will be genuinely anxious for your
            welfare” (<i>infra</i> 2:20).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Then when he says, <i>servants of Christ Jesus,</i> he states their
            condition: “For what we preach is not ourselves, but Jesus Christ as
            Lord, with ourselves as your servants for Jesus’ sake” (2 Cor. 4:5).
            But this seems to conflict with John (15:15): “No longer do I call
            you servants, for the servant does not know what his master is
            doing.” I answer that there are two kinds of servitude,
            corresponding to the two kinds of fear. Fear of punishment causes
            evil servitude, and this is the kind meant in the above text from
            John. But chaste fear causes reverential servitude, which is the
            kind the Apostle has in mind.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            The persons greeted are the saints of the Church in Philippi: first,
            the lesser ones; hence he says,
            <i>to all the saints who are at Philippi,</i> which is a city
            founded by Philip. He calls them <i>saints</i> on account of their
            baptism: “Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into
            Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?” (Rom. 6:3). He includes
            the greater ones when he says,
            <i>with the bishops and deacons.</i> But why does he mention the
            lesser ones before the greater? Because the people are prior to the
            prelate: “Should not shepherds feed the sheep?” (Ez. 34:2). For the
            flocks are to be fed by the shepherds, and not vice versa. But why
            does he not mention the priests? I answer that they are included
            with the bishops, because there are not a number of bishops in a
            city; hence when he puts it in the plural, he means to include
            priests. Yet it is a distinct order, because we read in the gospel
            that after appointing twelve apostles (whose persons the bishops
            manifest), He appointed seventy-two disciples, whose place the
            priests hold. Dionysius also distinguished bishops from priests. But
            in the beginning, although the orders were distinct, there were not
            distinct names for the orders; hence here he includes priests with
            bishops.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Then he mentions the good things he desires for them when he says,
            <i>grace to you and peace.</i> These two goods include everything:
            first, there is Go&amp;s <i>grace</i> remitting sins: “For by grace
            you have been saved through faith” (Eph. 2:8); lastly, there is
            man’s <i>peace:</i> “He makes peace in your borders” (Ps. 147:14).
            Consequently, he wishes them all the good things between the two:
            and this, <i>from God our Father:</i> “Every good endowment and
            every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of
            lights” (Jas. 1: 17), and by the merit of Christ’s humanity; hence
            he says, <i>and from the Lord Jesus Christ:</i> “Grace and truth
            came through Jesus Christ” (Jn. 1: 17); “For he is our peace, who
            has made us both one” (Eph. 2:14).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Then he begins the letter’s message, in which he does two things:
            first, he gives thanks for past benefits; secondly, he urges them to
            continue making progress (1:12). In regard to the first: first, he
            gives thanks for them; secondly, he mentions the subject matter
            (1:5).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            First, therefore, he expresses thanks along with joy and a prayer.
            And so, touching these three things he says,
            <i>I thank my God. To</i> give thanks is to acknowledge a favor
            conferred on oneself: “Give thanks in all circumstances” (1 Thess.
            5:18). <i>In all my remembrance of you,</i> because in regard to
            them nothing occurred to the Apostle that was not worthy of
            thanksgiving; and this is very great: “The memory of the righteous
            is a blessing” (Prov. 10:7). <i>For you all:</i> “Your people shall
            all be righteous; they shall possess the land forever” (Is. 60:21).
            He gives thanks for their blessings, he makes a <i>prayer</i> for
            their protection, and all of this <i>with joy:</i> “Far be it from
            me that I should sin against the Lord by ceasing to pray for you” (1
            Sam. 12:23).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Then when he says,
            <i>for your partnership in the gospel,</i> he touches on the matter
            of the three things mentioned above. First, he mentions the reason
            for his thanksgiving; secondly, for his joy in things to come (1:
            6); thirdly, for his prayer (1: 8).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            He says, therefore, <i>for your partnership,</i> whereby you share
            in the doctrine of the gospel by believing and by fulfilling it in
            work; for this is true partnership: “Do not neglect to do good and
            to share what you have” (Heb. 13:16);
            <i>from the first day until now</i>: “Among thoughtful people stay
            on” (Si. 27:12). And being confident of this very thing, I take joy
            in you because,
            <i>he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion:</i>
            “Cursed is the man who trusts in man” (Jer. 17:5), and in (17:7):
            “Blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord, whose trust is the
            Lord.” And this by God’s power; hence he says,
            <i>he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion:</i>
            “Apart from me you can do nothing” (Jn. 15:5). This is against the
            Pelagians, who say that the principle of every good work is from
            ourselves, but its completion is from God. But this is not true,
            because the principle in us of every good work is to think of it,
            and this itself is from God: “Not that we are sufficient of
            ourselves to claim anything as coming from us; our sufficiency is
            from God” (2 Cor. 3:5). <i>At the day of Jesus Christ,</i> when He
            will reward each person: “Henceforth there is laid up for me the
            crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will
            award to me on that day” (2 Tim. 4:8); “He will sustain you to the
            end, guiltless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ” (1 Cor. 1:8).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            The reason for his joy is given when he says:
            <i>It is right for me to feel thus about you all,</i>
            because it is right that you should rejoice with me in my blessing,
            <i>because I hold you in my heart.</i> As if to say: I have this
            knowledge of you that you are such; therefore, I rejoice so that you
            might rejoice in the things in which I rejoice, which
            <i>is in my imprisonment.</i> For he was imprisoned for Christ at
            that time and he rejoiced in it: “Count it all joy, my brethren,
            when you meet various trials, for you know that the testing of your
            faith produces steadfastness. And let steadfastness have its full
            effect” (Jas. 1:2); “Then they left the presence of the council,
            rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the
            name” (Acts 5:41).
            <i>And in the defense and confirmation of the gospel,</i>
            namely, in preaching boldly against tyrants and heretics, and
            confirming the gospel in the hearts of the faithful: “He departed
            and went from place to place through the region of Galatia and
            Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples” (Acts 18:23). Or another
            way according to a Gloss: <i>in my heart,</i> i.e., in my desire
            that you be partakers of eternal joy: “No one will take your joy
            from you” (Jn. 16:22). And this cannot be snatched from my heart,
            for even though I am imprisoned and intent on confirming and
            defending the gospel, my anxiety for you has not slipped from my
            heart.<br />

            8 For God is my witness, how I yearn for you all with the affection
            of Christ Jesus. 9 And it is my prayer that your love may abound
            more and more, with knowledge and all discernment, 10 so that you
            may approve what is excellent, and may be pure and blameless for the
            day of Christ, 11 filled with the fruits of righteousness which come
            through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God. 12 I want you
            to know, brethren, that what has happened to me has really served to
            advance the gospel, 13 so that it has become known throughout the
            whole praetorian guard and to all the rest that my imprisonment is
            for Christ; 14 and most of the brethren have been made confident in
            the Lord because of my imprisonment, and are much more bold to speak
            the word of God without fear. 15 Some indeed preach Christ from envy
            and rivalry, but others from good will. 16 The latter do it out of
            love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel; 17
            the former proclaim Christ out of partisanship, not sincerely but
            thinking to afflict me in my imprisonment.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Having stated the reason for hope concerning the future, he now
            indicates the matters for which he makes supplication for them.
            First, he mentions his desire, which is shown to be very fervent;
            secondly, the matter of his prayer (1:9).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Since the heart’s desire is known to God alone, he calls on God to
            witness that he prays for them with desire: “Behold, my witness,”
            God, “is in heaven” (Job 16:19).
            <i>How I yearn for you all,</i> i.e., I, living
            <i>with the affection of Christ Jesus.</i> Or, how I long for you to
            be in it; as if to say: How I long after your,salvation and
            participation in the merciful heart of Christ. “Throu6 the tender
            mercy of our God” (Lk. 1:78): As if to say that the power of love
            reaches to the inmost depths of the heart. Or, I long for you to be
            in the heart of Jesus Christ, i.e., that you may love Him
            intimately, and that you may be loved by Him; for man’s life
            consists in this.

            Then when he says, <i>and it is my prayer,</i> he mentions his
            prayer. He asks three things: the first pertains to increasing
            charity within. For the interior affections are perfected by
            charity; therefore, if one lacks charity, he should desire to obtain
            it; if he has it, he should desire that it be made perfect. Hence he
            says, <i>that your love may abound more and more.</i> God is the one
            from whom an increase of charity should be sought, because God is
            the only one who works this in us: “God is able to provide you with
            every blessing in abundance, so that you may always have enough of
            everything and may provide in abundance for every good work” (2 Cor.
            9:8). Hence it is necessary that we pray for it, because “unless
            your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you
            will never enter the kingdom of heaven” (Mt. 5:20).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            The second request regards understanding; hence he says,
            <i>with knowledge.</i> But does knowledge arise from charity? It
            seems so, because it is stated in 1 John (2:27): “But the anointing
            which you received from him abides in you, and you have no need that
            any one should teach you; as his anointing teaches you about
            everything, and is true, and is no lie.” Furthermore, charity is the
            Spirit, of whom it is said in John (16:13): “When the Spirit of
            truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth.” The reason for
            this is that when a person has a habit, if that habit is right, then
            right judgment of things pertaining to that habit follows from it;
            but if it is corrupted, then false judgment follows. Thus, the
            temperate person has good judgment in regard to sex, but an
            intemperate person does not, having a false judgment. Now all things
            that are done by us must be informed with charity. Therefore, a
            person with charity has a correct judgment both in regard to things
            knowable; hence be says, <i>with knowledge,</i> by which one
            recognizes the truth and adheres to the truths of faith; and this is
            the knowledge of holy things mentioned in Wisdom (10:10); and in
            regard to things to be done; hence he says,
            <i>and all discernment</i> (<i>sense</i>), which is the faculty that
            deals with external objects. Its function is to judge correctly and
            quickly about the proper object of sense. As a result, this name has
            been transferred to the internal judgment of reason; hence, those
            who possess correct judgment in regard to what they should do are
            called sensible: “Think,” i.e., sense, “of the Lord with
            uprightness” (Wis. 1: 1): “To fix one’s thought on,” i.e., to sense,
            “her is perfect understanding” (Wis. 6:15). But this discernment
            should be able not only to recognize, but also to distinguish
            between, good and evil, and between good and better; hence he says,
            so <i>that you may approve what is excellent:</i> “Earnestly desire
            the higher gifts” (1 Cor. 12:31) and in (15:1): “Make love your aim,
            and earnestly desire the spiritual gifts;” hence he says,
            <i>what is excellent.</i> The third request concerns behavior.
            First, he mentions immunity from evil, when he says that you may be
            <i>pure.</i> For there are two evils to be avoided: first, internal
            destruction, by which a man is destroyed in himself; and this is
            excluded by sincerity: “the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth”
            (1 Cor. 5:8). The other concerns our neighbor, namely, offenses;
            hence he says, <i>and blameless:</i> “Give no offense to Jews or to
            Greeks or to the church of God, just as I try to please all men in
            everything I do” (1 Cor. 10:32); “We put no obstacle in anyone’s
            way, so that no fault may be found with our ministry” (2 Cor. 6:3).
            <i>For the day of Christ,</i> i.e., to the end of our lives: “He who
            endures to the end will be saved” (Mt. 24:13). As to the effects of
            grace he says, <i>filled with the fruits of righteousness.</i> Good
            works are the fruit: “The return (fruit) you get is sanctification
            and its end, eternal life” (Rom. 6:22). Or,
            <i>the fruits of righteousness,</i> i.e., the reward of justice,
            namely, the crown: “Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of
            righteousness” (2 Tim. 4:8); “For the fruit of good labors is
            renowned” (Wis. 3:15). This is obtained
            <i>through Jesus Christ,</i> because all that we do is good through
            Him. “Apart from me you can do nothing” (Jn. 15:5). Furthermore,
            these things must be done for this end,
            <i>to the glory and praise of God,</i> because God is glorified by
            the works of the saints, since they cause other people to break out
            in praise of God: “Praise God in his sanctuary (saints)” (Ps. 156:
            1); “And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and a glory
            before all the nations of the earth who shall hear of all the good
            that I do for them” (Jer. 33:9).

          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            ‘Men when he says, I <i>want you to know, brethren,</i> he advises
            them in regard to the future. First, he gives examples to be
            followed and to be avoided; secondly, he concludes his moral
            exhortation (ch. 4). In regard to the first he does two things:
            first, he shows what should be imitated; secondly, what should be
            avoided (ch. 3). The first is divided into two parts: first, he
            urges them to imitate him; secondly, to imitate others (ch. 2). The
            first part is divided into three parts: first, he gives his own
            progress as an example; secondly, the joy he has in this progress
            (1:18); thirdly, the fruit of this progress (1:19). The first is
            again divided into two Parts: first, he mentions his progress;
            secondly, the manner (1:13).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            He says, therefore: I have urged you to make progress; and in order
            that you might have my progress as a pattern,
            <i>I want you to know, brethren, that what has happened to me</i>
            outwardly, namely, tribulations, did not change me inwardly, but
            <i>has really served to advance the gospel,</i> because the result
            was that the faith I preached made greater progress: “If we are
            afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; and if we are
            comforted, it is for your comfort, which you experience when you
            patiently endure the same sufferings that we suffer” (2 Cor. 1: 6).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Then he shows his own progress; secondly, that of others (1:14). In
            regard to himself, of course, it was obvious that he suffered for
            Christ with constancy,
            <i
              >so that it has become known... that my imprisonment is for
              Christ.</i
            >
            This redounds to Christ’s glory: “But let none of you suffer as a
            murderer, or a thief, or a wrongdoer, or a mischief-maker; yet if
            one suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but under that
            name let him glorify God” (1 Pet. 4:15).
            <i>Throughout the whole praetorian guard,</i> and in Caesar’s court.
            As for the progress of others, their faith has grown apace:
            <i
              >most of the brethren have been made confident in the Lord because
              of my imprisonment, and are much more bold to speak the word of
              God without fear.</i
            >
            “Like the magistrate of the people, so are his officials” (Si.
            10:2); “The righteous are bold as a lion” (Prov. 28:1). Yet there is
            some diversity among these, because some spoke properly and some
            not. Of those who spoke properly, some did so out of general love,
            and others out of love for the Apostle; of those who spoke
            improperly, some acted out of general malice, and some out of
            personal hatred of the Apostle. Yet it seems to me that the Apostle
            is revealing the two reasons why some preached: first, because of
            envy; consequently, to show their evil intention the Apostle says,
            <i>from envy and rivalry:</i> “For where jealousy and selfish
            ambition exists, there will be disorder and every vile practice”
            (Jas. 3:16); “For while there is jealousy and strife among you, are
            you not of the flesh?” (1 Cor. 3:5); secondly, out of love for
            Christ and the gospel; hence he says,
            <i>but others from good will:</i> “Deal favorably, O Lord, in your
            good will with Sion” (Ps. 50:20). The Apostle continues,
            <i>the latter do it out of love,</i> which causes good will, because
            they preached to make up for my being prevented from teaching. Then
            the Apostle explains what he had said, saying that,
            <i>the former proclaim Christ out of partisanship</i> and not
            according to a right intention. For their depraved intention is
            clear in two ways: first, by preaching publicly they caused a
            disturbance among the Gentiles against the Apostle and thus added to
            the affliction he already had; secondly, because they believed that
            Paul would be disturbed, when he heard that they were usurping the
            task committed to him, thereby adding more affliction to one already
            afflicted.<br />

            18 What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in
            truth, Christ is proclaimed; and in that I rejoice. 19 Yes, and I
            shall rejoice. For I know that through your prayers and the help of
            the Spirit of Jesus Christ this will turn out for my deliverance, 20
            as it is my eager expectation and hope that I shall not be at all
            ashamed, but that with full courage now as always Christ will be
            honored in my body, whether by life or by death. 21 For to me to
            live is Christ, and to die is gain. 22 If it is to be life in the
            flesh, that means fruitful labor for me. Yet which f shall choose I
            cannot tell. 23 1 am hard pressed between the two. My desire is to
            depart and be with Christ, for that is far better. 24 But to remain
            in the flesh is more necessary on your account.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Above, the Apostle described the progress he has made; here he deals
            with the joy bom of this progress: first, the cause of this joy;
            secondly, the joy itself (1:18b).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Sometimes it happens that joy arises from a good cause, and this
            directly and of itself; sometimes from an evil cause, and this
            indirectly and by accident. For when it springs from a good cause,
            one should rejoice both in the effect and in the cause, as in the
            case of giving an alms for the glory of God; but when it springs
            from an evil cause, one should rejoice in the effect but not in the
            cause, as in the redemption by Christ, since it came about from the
            crime committed by Judas and the Jews. The same thing happens in the
            Church when something beneficial results from good preachers with a
            good intention, and from evil preachers with an evil intention;
            nevertheless, one should rejoice in both cases, as has been said. He
            says, therefore:
            <i
              >what then? Only that in every way, whether in pretence or in
              truth, Christ is proclaimed; and in that I rejoice. Yes, and I
              shall rejoice.</i
            >
            One announces Christ <i>in pretense</i> when he does not chiefly aim
            at this but at something else, as profit or glory; “He who is
            estranged seeks pretexts” (Prov. 18:1); but <i>in truth,</i> when it
            is done with a right intention: “Remember now, 0 Lord, I beseech
            thee, how I have walked before thee in faithfulness and with a whole
            heart, and have done what is good in thy sight” (Is. 38:3). But
            either way the results are good for the Church; hence he says,
            <i>Christ is proclaimed, and in that I rejoice,</i>
            because if something other than Christ were proclaimed, there would
            be reason for concern. This happens when false doctrine is taught;
            “The shepherd who teaches for the sake of the truth should be loved;
            the hireling who teaches for gain should be tolerated; but the one
            who teaches what is false must be expelled” (Augustine).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Then he mentions the joy which followed, when he says,
            <i>in that,</i> namely, that my chains are manifested for the sake
            of Christ, I <i>rejoice,</i> at present in the fact that Christ is
            preached: “If you loved me, you would have rejoiced” (Jn. 14:28);
            <i>and I shall rejoice</i> in the future: “They shall obtain joy and
            gladness” (Is. 51:11).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Then when he says,
            <i>for I know that through your prayers..</i>., he mentions the
            fruit resulting from his progress: first, he mentions the fruit;
            secondly, he raises a question (1:22). In regard to the first he
            does three things: first, he mentions the fruit; secondly, his help
            in obtaining it (1:19); thirdly, he assigns the material of the
            fruit (1:20b).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            He says, therefore: I rejoice in these things on account of the
            fruit resulting from them for life everlasting: “Israel is saved by
            the Lord with everlasting salvation” (Is. 45:17), because when we do
            good by helping in the salvation of others, it redounds to our
            salvation. For if it is true that “whoever causes one of these
            little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to
            have a great millstone fastened about his neck and to be drowned in
            the depth of the sea” (Mt. 18:6), how much glory does he deserve who
            gains the salvation of many? Now help depends on three things:
            first, on prayer by others; hence he says,
            <i>through your prayers,</i> by which I hope to be helped by God:
            “Pray for one another that you may be healed. The prayer of a
            righteous man has great power in its effects” (Jas. 5:16). Secondly,
            on God, in whom we place our hope for salvation: [“In your presence
            we have conceived, and have been as it were in labor and have
            brought forth the spirit of salvation”] (Is. 12:18); hence he says,
            <i>and the help of the Spirit of Jews Christ:</i> “The Spirit helps
            us in our weakness” (Rom. 8:26).
            <i>This will turn out for my deliverance.</i> He speaks in a simile;
            for when a person is infirm, be needs to be delivered from his
            infirmity, if he is to be kept alive; and this is to help. But we
            are weak and infirm; therefore, we need the help of the Spirit: “He
            will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I
            have said to you” (Jn. 14:26), by helping us, as it were. Thirdly,
            help depends on our trust in God, because “he who trusts in his
            riches will fair (Prov. 11:28). Therefore, our hope must be in God:
            “Those who trust in the Lord are like Mount Zion, which cannot be
            moved, but abides forever” (Ps. 125:1); hence he says,
            <i>it is my eager expectation and hope.</i>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            But isn’t hope the expectation of future happiness? I answer that
            hope is a movement of the appetite toward an arduous good; and this
            can occur in two ways: sometimes a person hopes to obtain something
            by himself, and then there is hope without expectation; but
            sometimes he hopes to obtain something through someone else, and
            then there is hope with expectation. This is the way we expect, when
            we have the hope of obtaining something through someone else: [“With
            expectation I have waited for the Lord, and he was attentive to me”]
            (Ps. 40: 1); “For in this hope we were saved” (Rom. 8:24).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            But he says I <i>know,</i> and then speaks of
            <i>expectation and hope.</i> Is this hope certain? The Apostle
            answers that it is, saying, I
            <i>shall not be at all ashamed:</i> “None who put their trust in him
            will lack strength” (1 Mach. 2:61); “Hope does not disappoint us”
            (Rom. 5:5); “Whoever trusted in the Lord and was put to shame?” (Si.
            2:10).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            He gives the reason for this and explains it, when he says,
            <i>for to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</i>
            The reason is based on the fact that he is entirely dedicated to the
            service of Christ. As if to say: the reason why this will turn out
            to my salvation is that I am totally at the service of Christ. He
            mentions his confidence when he says that <i>with</i> full
            <i>courage now as always Christ will be honored in my body.</i>
            As if to say: many persecute me, but I put my trust in the Lord: “I
            will trust, and will not be afraid” (Is. 12:2).
            <i>As always,</i> i.e., from the beginning of my conversion: “At
            Damascus he had preached boldly in the name of Jesus” (Acts 9:27);
            <i>so now</i> also: “I hold fast my righteousness, and will not let
            it go” (Job 27:6).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            He shows that his intention is right because
            <i>Christ will be honored.</i> Since He is God, He cannot be honored
            (increased) or diminished in Himself, but in us, i.e., in our
            knowledge. For a person honors Christ when he increases his
            knowledge of Him: “Who can extol him as he is?” (Si. 43:31). And
            this in word and deed, when the greatness of His effects shows His
            greatness. Among these marvelous effects is justification. But as
            long as this lies hidden in a man’s heart, Christ is not honored by
            it, except in that heart, but not in regard to others, until it
            breaks out into external visible actions. Hence be says,
            <i>in my body.</i> Christ is honored in our body in two ways: in one
            way, inasmuch as we dedicate our body to his service by employing
            our bodies in his ministry: “Glorify God in your body” (1 Cor.
            6:20); in another way by risking our body for Christ: “If I deliver
            my body to be burned” (1 Cor. 13:3). The first is accomplished by
            life, the second by death: hence he says, <i>whether by</i> life,
            because the body acts only when living, or by <i>death:</i> “If we
            live, we live to the Lord, and if we die, we die to the Lord” (Rom.
            14:8). This can also refer to spiritual death: “Put to death
            therefore what is earthly in you” (Col. 3:5).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Then he explains how He will be honored by life and death, saying:
            <i>for to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</i>
            Now life produces activity, for that seems to be at the root of
            man’s life which is the principle of his activity. Hence some call
            that by which they are roused to activity, their life; as hunters
            call hunting their life, and friends their friend. So, Christ is our
            life, because the whole principle of our life and activity is
            Christ; hence the Apostle says,
            <i>for to me to live is Christ,</i> because Christ alone moved him,
            <i>and to die is gain.</i> Here the Apostle is speaking precisely.
            For a person regards it a gain when he can improve the imperfect
            life he has; thus a sick person regards a healthy life a gain. Our
            life is Christ: “Your life is hid with Christ in God” (Col. 3:3).
            But here it is imperfect: “While we are at home in the body we are
            away from the Lord” (2 Cor. 5:6). Therefore, when we die in the
            body, our life, namely, Christ, with whom we are then present, is
            perfected in us” [“He gives to his beloved in sleep”] (Ps. 126:2);
            “The time of my departure has come” (2 Tim. 4:6).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Then when he says,
            <i
              >If it is to be life in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for
              me,</i
            >
            he raises a doubt in regard to what has been said: first, he states
            the doubt; secondly, he solves it (1:25). In regard to the first he
            does two things: first, he states the doubt; secondly, he gives a
            reason for both sides (1:23).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            He says, therefore: If
            <i
              >it is to be life in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for
              me;</i
            >
            as if to say: If Christ is glorified in my body as long as I am
            alive, my life in the flesh will bear fruit, i.e., if life brings me
            as its fruit that Christ is honored, life in the flesh is good and
            fruitful: “The return [fruit] you get is sanctification and its end,
            eternal life” (Rom. 6:22). Therefore, if that is the case, I
            <i>cannot tell which I shall choose,</i> whether to die or to live:
            “For we do not know how to pray as we ought” (Rom. 8:26); “The
            reasoning of mortals is worthless, and our designs are likely to
            fail” (Wis. 9:14).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            But why do you hesitate? Because I
            <i>am hard pressed between the two.</i> First, he gives a reason for
            one side; secondly, for the other side. The first reason is that
            there are two impulses in man, the impulse of nature and that of
            grace: of nature, not to die: “Not that we would be unclothed, but
            that we would be further clothed” (2 Cor. 5:5); “And another will
            carry you where you do not wish to go” (Jn. 21:18); and the impulse
            of grace, which charity follows, is to love God and neighbor. This
            impulse to love God moves us to be with God; hence he says,
            <i>my desire is to depart,</i> not absolutely, but
            <i>to be with Christ:</i> “We are of good courage, and we would
            rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord” (2 Cor.
            5:8). This shows the error in the opinion of the Greeks that the
            souls of the saints are not with Christ immediately after death. The
            reason why I desire this is that to
            <i>be with Christ is far better.</i> “Whom have I in heaven but
            thee? And there is nothing upon earth that I desire besides thee”
            (Ps. 73:25); “For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand
            elsewhere” (Ps. 84:10). But love of neighbor moves us to desire his
            betterment; hence he says,
            <i>but to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account,</i>
            i.e., my life is necessary for your benefit: “For if we are beside
            ourselves, it is for God; if we are in our right mind, it is for
            you” (2 Cor. 5:13). Or another way, I
            <i>am hard pressed between the two,</i> i.e., on two sides: there
            arises a desire
            <i
              >to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better. But to
              remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account.</i
            >
            The sense is not changed.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            But this does not seem to be subject to doubt; indeed, the Apostle
            seems to be inclined to the worse side. For the love of God rouses
            the first desire in us, and the love of neighbor the second. But the
            first is a greater and better desire. Therefore [Paul has chosen the
            less perfect]. I answer that the love of God is twofold, namely,
            concupiscible love, by which a man wills to love God and find his
            delight in Him; and this is for the man’s good. The other is the
            love of friendship, by which a man prefers the honor of God, even
            over this delight with which he enjoys God; and this is perfect
            charity. Hence it is stated in Romans (8:38): “For I am sure that
            neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things
            present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth nor
            anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the
            love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.” And then he continues in
            (9:3): “For I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off
            from Christ for the sake of my brethren.” He said this to show that
            be possessed a more perfect charity, as though for the love of God
            and neighbor he was prepared to lose the delight of seeing God.
            Therefore, he shows this as something more perfect.<br />

            not frightened in anything by your opponents. This is a clear omen
            to them of their destruction, but of your salvation, and that from
            God. 29 For it has been granted to you that for the sake of Christ

            Having stated the doubt and the reason for both sides, he then
            resolves it: first, as though choosing one side, he foretells what
            will be the result of his plan to visit them; secondly, he shows
            what is required on their part (1:26). In regard to the first he
            does three things: first, he mentions his coming visit; secondly, he
            shows its fruit; thirdly, he explains this fruit.

            He says, therefore: After saying that to remain in the flesh is

            <i>know that I shall remain,</i> being as it were
            <i>convinced of this</i> in God: “The righteous are bold as a lion”
            (Prov. 28: 1); 1 <i>shall remain and continue,</i> i.e., I shall
            live and continue to live. But on the other hand he was soon killed
            by Nero. I answer that this letter was written in the first year of
            his imprisonment, which was also the first year of Nero’s reign.
            Hence he lived for seven years after this.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            <i>With you all,</i> i.e., for the benefit of all of you: “I do not
            seek my own advantage, but that of many, that they may be saved” (1
            Cor. 10:33). And this, <i>for your progress,</i> i.e., that through
            my exhortation you may progress in the faith and rejoice in my life,
            which you have heard about; but you would rejoice more, if I were
            present: I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual
            gift to strengthen you” (Rom. 1:11).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Then he explains what he had said, saying,
            <i>so that in me you may have ample cause to glory,</i>
            i.e., if it is granted me to come to you again, it will be in order
            that joy may abound in you: “Now to him who by the power at work
            within us is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or
            think, to him be glory in the church” (Eph. 3:20). And this
            <i>in Christ Jesus,</i> because the fact that they rejoiced in him
            was for the sake of Christ: I want some benefit from you in the
            Lord!’ (Philem. 1:20).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Then when be says,
            <i
              >only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of
              Christ,</i
            >
            be shows what is required on their part. He says that the only thing
            required of them is that they live worthy of the gospel of Christ,
            in a manner that conforms to that gospel: ‘Ve exhorted each one of
            you and encouraged you and charged you to lead a life worthy of God,
            who calls you into his own kingdom and glory” (1 Thess. 2:12); “To
            lead a life worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to him” (Col. 1: 10).
            And this is my joy: “No greater joy can I have than this, to hear
            that my children follow the truth” (3 Jn. 4). Now he specifically
            desires from them unity and constancy. There are three kinds of
            unity required of the saints: first, the unity of love; hence he
            says,
            <i>that I may hear,</i> namely,
            <i>that you stand firm in one spirit,</i> through love: “Eager to
            maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace” (Eph. 4:3),
            and in 1 Corinthians (6:17) “He who is united to the Lord becomes
            one spirit with him.” Secondly, the unity of concord; hence he says,
            <i>with one mind,</i> i.e., have one will and one soul: “Now the
            company of those who believed were of one heart and soul” (Acts
            4:32); [“God makes men of one way to dwell in one house”] (Ps.
            67:7). Thirdly, the unity of cooperation; hence he says,
            <i>striving side by side for the faith of the gospel,</i>
            i.e., one helping the other. This is brought about by what is stated
            in 1 Kings (25: 1) “All Israel assembled and mourned for him,”
            namely, Samuel; “A brother helped is like a strong city” (Prov.
            18:19).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Secondly, he expects constancy:
            <i>and not frightened in anything by your opponents.</i>
            First, he urges them to be brave, because their opponents can do
            only as much as God allows: “But not a hair of your head will
            perish” (Lk. 21:18); “Its leaf does not wither” (Ps. 1: 3); “Who are
            you that you are afraid of man who dies, of the son of man who is
            made like grass?” (Is. 51:12). There are three reasons for this: the
            first is taken from the fruit of tribulation. He says, therefore:
            <i>not frightened,</i> because there is fruit for you in that
            persecution which <i>to them,</i> i.e., to the persecutors, is a
            <i>clear omen of their destruction;</i> but to you it is a cause
            <i>of salvation:</i> “Whoever would save his life will lose it, and
            whoever loses his life for my sake will find it” (Mt. 16:25); “He
            who loves his life loses it” (Jn. 12:25); “I will destroy you, O
            Israel; who can help you?” (Hos. 13:9). And this
            <i>from God,</i> from whom <i>it has been granted to you</i> to
            endure tribulation patiently.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            The second reason is that you
            <i>should believe in him:</i> “For by grace you have been saved
            through faith” (Eph. 2:8), which is the great and first gift;
            <i>but also suffer for his sake,</i> which is a greater gift,
            namely, that you should act for Christ as his athlete: “Then they
            left the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted
            worthy to suffer dishonor for the name” (Acts 5:41). This is useful
            and honorable; hence you should act bravely.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            The third reason is taken from his example, because he deals with
            them as people who are the first fruits of the faith. Hence he says,
            <i>engaged in the same conflict which you saw to be mine,</i>
            namely, when among you I was naked and beaten by the Philippians
            because I freed the girl with the spirit of divination (Acts 16);
            <i>and now hear to be mine,</i> who am in prison.<br />

            Above, he offered himself as an example of patience and holiness;
            here he presents others as an example of the same: first, he gives
            the example of Christ; secondly, the examples of his disciples,
            whom, he promises to send to strengthen them (2:19). In regard to

            first, the means by which he leads them; secondly, to what he leads
            them (2:2). In regard to the first he uses four means: first, their
            devotion to Christ; secondly, their love of neighbor; thirdly, their
            society; fourthly, their mercy.

            Spirit is love, joy, peace” (Gal. 5:22); “Behold, how good and
            pleasant it is when brothers dwell in unity” (Ps. 13-3: 1).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            As for that special fellowship which prevails among men who share
            various things, as soldiers share the arms of warfare, he says, if
            <i>any participation in the Spirit</i> between me and you,
            <i>complete my joy.</i> As if to say: I have afforded you much
            consolation; therefore, if you are my companions, afford the same to
            me: “Eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of
            peace”. (Eph. 4:3); “There is a friend who sticks closer than a
            brother” (Prov. 18:24). As to their mercy he says, if
            <i>any affection and sympathy:</i> “Put on then, as God’s chosen
            ones, holy and beloved, compassion, kindness (Col. 3:12).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Then he indicates what he is urging them to do: first, in general,
            when he says, <i>complete my joy.</i> As if to say: I always rejoice
            in you on account of the good things I have seen and heard of you;
            but when these multiply, my joy will grow and finally become
            perfect. Therefore, complete it, by making progress in good.
            Secondly, in particular, when he urges them to mutual love, whose
            unity consists in two things: first, in the affections: “Let us not
            love in word or speech but in deed and in truth” (1 Jn. 3:18),
            bearing on the object of charity; hence he says,
            <i>being of the same mind.</i> For wisdom in the mind is knowledge
            of the loftiest causes, because it pertains to wisdom to judge, and
            no one can do this without knowing the highest cause. Consequently,
            wisdom is concerned with divine things. Therefore,
            <i>being of the same mind.</i> As if to say: Have the same mind in
            regard to the things of faith: “May the God of steadfastness and
            encouragement grant you to live in such harmony with one another, in
            accord with Christ Jesus, that together you may with one voice
            glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ” (Rom. 15:5).
            But this depends on having the same charity; hence he says,
            <i>having the same love:</i> “And above all these put *on love,
            which binds everything together in perfect harmony” (Col. 3:14). As
            for its effect, which consists in two persons consenting to the same
            thing, two things are required. As to the first he says,
            <i>being in full accord,</i> namely, in acting: [“God makes men of
            one way to dwell in one house” (Ps. 67:7)]; “That together you may
            with one voice glorify God” (Rom. 15:6). As to the second he says,
            <i>and of one mind.</i> This differs from the statement
            <i>being of the same mind,</i> as
            <i>being in full accord</i> differs from
            <i>having the same love.</i>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Then he exhorts them to humility: first, he excludes whatever is
            contrary to humility; secondly, he exhorts them to it. The things
            contrary to humility are those which spring from prideone is outward
            contention, because the humble yield to one another: “By insolence
            the heedless make strife” (Prov. 13:10); “For where jealousy and
            selfish ambition exist, there will be disorder and every vile
            practice” (Jas. 3:16). Therefore, he says,
            <i>do nothing from selfishness.</i> The other is vainglory, for a
            proud person desires his own excellence, even in the opinion of
            others: “Let us have no self-conceit, no provoking of one another,
            no envy of one another” (Gal. 5:26); I do not seek my own glory;
            there is One who seeks it and he will be the judge” (in. 8:50).
            Thus, he says here, <i>or conceit. This is</i> followed by the
            admonition,
            <i>but in humility count others better than yourselves.</i>
            For just as it pertains to pride that a man extol himself above
            himself, so to humility that he restrain himself according to his
            limitations.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            But how can a superior person do this? For he either does not know
            that he is superior and virtuous, and then he is not virtuous,
            because be is not prudent; or he does know, and then he cannot
            consider some as superior to himself. I answer that no one is so
            good that there is no defect in him, or so evil that he has no good.
            Therefore, he should not prefer another to himself absolutely, but
            because he can say in his mind: “Perhaps there is some defect in me
            that is not in this other person.” Augustine shows this in the book
            <i>On Virginity,</i> when he recommends that a virgin prefer a
            married woman to herself on the ground that she may be more fervent.
            But suppose that one person is good from every aspect, and another
            evil; nevertheless, you and he bear a double person, namely, yours
            and Christ’s. Therefore, if you cannot prefer him to yourself by
            reason of his person, you can do so by reason of the divine image:
            “Outdo one another in showing honor” (Rom. 12:10).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Thirdly, he urges them to mutual care, saying
            <i
              >let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to
              the interests of others:</i
            >
            “That the members may have the same care for one another” (1 Cor.
            12:25); “Love does not insist on its own way” (1 Cor. 13:5).<br />

            who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with

            a servant, being born in the likeness of men. 8 And being found in
            human form he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even
            death on a cross.

          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            After giving his exhortation, the Apostle urges them to the virtue
            of humility according to Christ’s example. First, he exhorts them to
            follow the example of Christ; secondly, he gives the example (2:6).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            He says, therefore: Be humble, as I have said; hence
            <i>have this mind among yourselves,</i> i.e., acquire by experience
            the mind which you <i>have in Christ Jesus.</i> It should be noted
            that we should have this mind in five ways according to the five
            senses: first, to see His glory, so that being enlightened, we may
            be conformed to Him: “Your eyes will see the king in his beauty”
            (Is. 33:17); “And we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of
            the Lord, are being changed into his likeness from one degree of
            glory to another” (2 Cor. 3:18); secondly, to hear His wisdom, in
            order to become happy: “Happy are these your servants, who
            continually stand before you and hear your wisdom” (1 Kgs. 10:8);
            “As soon as they heard of me they obeyed me” (Ps. 18:44). Thirdly,
            to smell the grace of His meekness, that we may run to Him: “Your
            anointing oils are fragrant... draw me after you” (Cant. 1:3);
            fourthly, to taste the sweetness of His mercy, that we may always be
            in God: “Taste and see that the Lord is good” (Ps. 34:9); fifthly,
            to touch His power, that we may be saved: “If I only touch his
            garment, I shall be made well” (Mt. 9:21).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Then when he says,
            <i>who, though he was in the form of God,</i> etc., he proposes the
            example of Christ. First, he mentions Christ’s majesty; secondly,
            His humility (2:7); thirdly, His exaltation (2:9).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            He mentions Christ’s majesty first, in order that His humility might
            be more easily recommended. In regard to His majesty he proposes two
            things, namely, the truth of His divine nature, and His equality. He
            says, therefore:
            <i>who,</i> namely, Christ,
            <i>though he was in the form of God.</i> For it is through its form
            that a thing is said to be in a specific or generic nature; hence
            the form is called the nature of a thing. Consequently, to be in the
            form of God is to be in the nature of God. By this is understood
            that He is true God: [“That we may be in his true Son, Jesus Christ”
            (1 Jn. 5:20) ]. However, it should not be supposed that the form of
            God is one thing and God himself another, because in simple and
            immaterial things, and especially in God, the form is the same as
            that whose form it is.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            But why does he say, <i>in the form,</i> rather than “in the
            nature”? Because this belongs to the proper names of the Son in
            three ways: for He is called the Son, the Word and the Image. Now
            the Son is the one begotten, and the end of begetting is the form.
            Therefore, to show the perfect Son of God he says,
            <i>in the form,</i> as though having the form of the Father
            perfectly. Similarly, a word is not perfect unless it leads to a
            knowledge of a thing’s nature; and so the Word of God is said to be
            in the form of God, because He has the entire nature of the Father.
            Finally, an image is not perfect, unless it has the form of that of
            which it is the image: “He reflects the glory of God and bears the
            very stamp of his nature” (Heb. 1:3).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            But does He have it perfectly? Yes, because He
            <i>did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped.</i>
            This can be taken two ways: in one way, of His humanity. But this is
            not the way Paul understood it, because it would be heretical; for
            it would be a grasping [robbery] if it referred to his humanity.
            Therefore, it must be explained in another way, namely, of His
            divinity, according to which equality with God is said of Christ. It
            is contrary to reason to say otherwise: because the nature of God
            cannot be received in matter; but the fact that someone existing in
            a certain nature participates in that nature to a greater or lesser
            degree is due to the matter; which is not the case here. Therefore,
            we must say that He
            <i>did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped,</i>
            because He is in the form of God and knows His own nature well. And
            because He knows this, it is stated in John (5:18): “He called God
            his Father, making himself equal with God.” But this is not a
            grasping, as it was when the devil and man wished to be equal to
            Him: “I will make myself like the Most High” (Is. 14:14); “You will
            be like God” (Gen. 3:5), for which Christ came to make satisfaction:
            “What I did not steal must I now restore?” (Ps. 69:4). Then when he
            says,
            <i>but emptied himself,</i> he commends Christ’s humility: first, as
            to the mystery of the incarnation; secondly, as to the mystery of
            the passion (2:8). In regard to the first: first, he mentions His
            humility; secondly, its manner and form (2:7).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            He says, therefore, He <i>emptied himself.</i> But since He was
            filled with the divinity, did He empty Himself of that? No, because
            He remained what He was; and what He was not, He assumed. But this
            must be understood in regard to the assumption of what He had not,
            and not according to the assumption of what He had. For just as He
            descended from heaven, not that He ceased to exist in heaven, but
            because He began to exist in a new way on earth, so He also emptied
            Himself, not by putting off His divine nature, but by assuming a
            human nature.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            How beautiful to say that He <i>emptied himself,</i> for the empty
            is opposed to the full! For the divine nature is sufficiently full,
            because every perfection of goodness is there. But human nature and
            the soul are not full, but capable of fulness, because it was made
            as a slate not written upon. Therefore, human nature is empty. Hence
            he says, He <i>emptied himself,</i> because He assumed a human
            nature.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            First, he touches on the assumption of human nature when he says,
            <i>taking the form of a servant.</i> For by reason of his creation
            man is a servant, and human nature is the form of a servant: “Know
            that the Lord is God! It is he that made us, and we are his” (Ps.
            100:3); “Behold my servant, whom I uphold” (Is. 42:1); “But thou, 0,
            Lord, art a shield about me” (Ps. 3:4). But why is it more fitting
            to say <i>the form of a servant,</i> rather than “Servant” Because
            servant is the name of a hypostasis, which was not assumed, but the
            nature was; for that which is assumed is distinct from the one
            assuming it. Therefore, the Son of God did not assume a man, because
            that would mean that he was other than the Son of God; nevertheless,
            the Son of God became man. Therefore, He took the nature to His own
            person, so that the Son of God and the Son of man would be the same
            in person.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Secondly, he touches on the conformity of His nature to ours when he
            says,
            <i>being born in the likeness of men,</i> namely, according to
            species: “Therefore he had to be made like his brethren in every
            respect” (Heb. 2:17). If you say that it is not fitting to speak of
            a species in the Lord Jesus Christ: it is true in the sense that a
            new species does not arise from His divinity and humanity, as though
            His divinity and humanity agreed in having one common species of
            nature, for it would follow that His divine nature, so to say, would
            have changed.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Thirdly, he mentions the conditions of His human nature when he
            says, <i>and being found in human form.</i> For He assumed all the
            defects and properties associated with the human species, except
            sin; therefore, he says,
            <i>and being found in human form,</i> namely, in His external life,
            because He became hungry as a man and tired and so on: “One who in
            every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sinning” (Heb.
            4:15); “Afterward [He] appeared upon earth and lived among men”
            (Bar. 3:37). Thus, we can refer <i>form</i> to outward activities.
            Or <i>in human form</i> [ <i>in habit</i> ], because He put humanity
            on as a habit. For there are four kinds of habit [ <i>habitus</i> ]
            or ways in which something is “had”: one “had thine changes a person
            without itself being changed, as a fool by wisdom; another is
            changed and also changes the possessor, as food; a third neither
            changes the possessor nor is changed, as a ring worn on the finger;
            another is changed and does not change the possessor, as a dress.
            And by this likeness the human nature in Christ is called a habit or
            “something had”; because it comes to the divine person without
            changing it, but the nature itself was changed for the better,
            because it was filled with grace and truth: “We have beheld his
            glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father” (Jn. 1:14). He
            says, therefore, <i>being born in the likeness of men,</i> but in
            such a way that He is not changed, because in habit He was found as
            a man.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            It should be noted that some have fallen into error on account of
            this phrase,
            <i>being found in human form.</i> Hence he touches on several
            opinions: the first is that Christ’s humanity accrues to Him as an
            accident. This is false, because the person existing in the divine
            nature became a person existing in the human nature; therefore, it
            is present not as an accident, but substantially: not that the
            humanity is united to the Word in His nature, but in His person. By
            this is excluded the error of Photinus, who said that Christ was
            true man but not of the Virgin: however, Paul says,
            <i>he was in the form of God;</i> therefore, He was in the form of
            God before receiving the form of a servant, as a result of which He
            is less than the Father, because He
            <i>did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped.</i>
            Arius’ error is also excluded, for he said Christ was less than the
            Father; but Paul says, He
            <i>did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped.</i>
            And Nestorius’ error, who said that the union should be taken as an
            indwelling, so that God dwells in the Son of man as in a temple, and
            that the Son of man is a person distinct from the Son of God. And
            Rabanus says that the incarnation was an emptying. Now it is evident
            that the Father and the Holy Spirit are involved in every
            indwelling; therefore, they too are emptied. But this is false.
            Furthermore, Paul says,
            <i>He emptied himself;</i> therefore the person emptied and the one
            emptying are the same. But this is the Son, because He emptied
            Himself. Therefore, the union is in the person. Also the error of
            Eutyches, who said that one nature results from the two. Therefore,
            He did not receive the form of a servant, but a different one, which
            is contrary to what the Apostle says. Also the error of Valentinus,
            who said that He took His body from heaven; and the error of
            Appollinaris, who said that He had no soul. If this were so, He
            would not have been
            <i>born in the likeness of man.</i>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Then when he says, He <i>humbled himself,</i> he commends Christ’s
            humility as indicated in His passion: first, he shows Christ’s
            humility; secondly, its manner (2: 8). Therefore He was man, but
            very great, because the same one is God and man; yet He
            <i>humbled himself:</i> “The greater you are, the more you must
            humble yourself” (Si. 3:18); “Learn from me, for I am gentle and
            lowly in heart” (Matt. 11:29).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            The manner and the sign of His humility is obedience, whereas it is
            characteristic of the proud to follow their own will, for a proud
            person seeks greatness. But it pertains to a great thing that it not
            be ruled by something else, but that it rule other things;
            therefore, obedience is contrary to pride.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Hence, in order to show the greatness of Christ’s humility and
            passion, he says that He
            <i>became obedient;</i> because if He had not suffered out of
            obedience, His passion would not be so commendable, for obedience
            gives merit to our sufferings. But how was He made obedient? Not by
            His divine will, because it is a rule; but by His human will, which
            is ruled in all things according to the Father’s will:
            “Nevertheless, not as I will but as thou wilt” (Mt. 26:39). And it
            is fitting that He bring obedience into His passion, because the
            first sin was accomplished by disobedience: “For as by one man’s
            disobedience many were made sinners, so by one man’s obedience many
            will be made righteous” (Rom. 5:19); [“The obedient man shall speak
            of victory” (Prov. 21:28) ]. That this obedience is great and
            commendable is evident from the fact that obedience is great when it
            follows the will of another against one’s own. Now the movement of
            the human will tends toward two things, namely, to life and to
            honor. But Christ did not refuse death: “Christ also died for sins
            once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous” (1 Pet. 3:18).
            Furthermore, He did not flee ignominy; hence he says,
            <i>even death on a cross,</i> which is the most shameful: “Let us
            condemn him to a shameful death7 (Wis. 2:20). Thus, He neither
            refused death nor an ignominous form of death.<br />

            9 Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name

            Above he praised Christ’s humility, here he cites its reward, which
            is exaltation and glory: “Every one who exalts himself will be
            humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted” (Lk. 14.11);
            “God save the lowly” (Job 22:29). Note the threefold exaltation of
            Christ. First, as to the glory of the resurrection (2:9a); secondly,
            as to the manifestation of His divinity (2:9b); thirdly, as to the
            reverence shown by every creature (2:10).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            He says,
            <i>therefore God has highly exalted him,</i> namely, that He should
            rise from the dead and pass from mortality to immortality: “Christ
            being raised from the dead will never die again; death no longer has
            dominion over him” (Rom. 6:9); “The right hand of the Lord does
            valiantly! I shall not die, but I shall live” (Ps. 118:16). He also
            exalted Him by setting Him on His right hand: “He raised him from
            the dead and made him sit at his right hand in the heavenly places,
            far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and above
            every name that is named, not only in this age but also in that
            which is to come” (Eph. 1:20,). But while it is true that others are
            raised to glory and immortality, He is more so, because God
            <i>bestowed on him the name which is above every name.</i>
            Now a name is imposed to signify some thing, and the loftier the
            thing signified by a name, the loftier is the name: hence the name
            of the divinity is highest: “O Lord, our Lord, how majestic is thy
            name in all the earth!” (Ps. 8:1). Therefore, this name, that He
            should be called and should be God, the Father gave Him, i.e., to
            Christ, as to the true God.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            But Photinus says that this is mentioned here as a reward for
            Christ’s humility and that it does not mean He is true God, but
            merely that He received a certain pre-eminence over the creature and
            a likeness of the godhead. This however, is not true, because it was
            stated that
            <i>he was in the form of God.</i> Therefore, one must answer that
            there are two natures and one hypostasis in Christ: for this person
            is God and man. Therefore, this can be explained in two ways: in one
            way, that the Father gave Him this name inasmuch as He is the Son of
            God; and this from all eternity by an eternal engendering, so that
            this giving is no more than His eternal generation: “For as the
            Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have
            life in himself” (Jn. 5:26). In another way it can refer to Christ
            as man; and then the Father gave that man the name of being God not
            by nature, because God’s nature is distinct from the nature of man,
            but to be God by the grace, not of adoption, but of union, by which
            He is at once God and man: “Designated Son of God in power,” He,
            namely, “who was descended from David according to the flesh” (Rom.
            1:4). This second way is Augustine’s explanation in keeping with the
            Apostle’s intention. Similarly, it is stated in Acts (2:36) “Let all
            the house of Israel therefore know assuredly that God has made him
            both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.” The first is
            Ambrose’s.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            But you might object to both explanations and ask why he says,
            <i>he humbled himself and became obedient unto death</i>
            and follows with,
            <i>therefore God has hightly exalted him,</i> since the reward does
            not precede the merit. Therefore, neither the eternal engendering
            nor the incarnation is the reward of Christ’s passion, because they
            precede it. The answer is that in Sacred Scripture a thing is said
            to occur when it is known. Therefore, <i>God bestowed,</i> i.e.,
            made manifest to the world, that He has this name. This was
            manifested in the resurrection, because prior to it the divinity of
            Christ was not that well known. This is supported by the text which
            follows: it implies that He did not give Him a name He did not
            already have, but that all should venerate it. And he mentions two
            types of veneration, namely, subjecting the body and confessing with
            the mouth: <i>and every tongue confess.</i> He says therefore: He
            has given Him a name which is above all names, even as man; hence he
            adds, <i>that at the name of Jesus,</i> which is the name of the
            man, <i>every knee should bow;</i> “To me every knee shall bow,
            every tongue shall swear’ (Is. 45:23).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            But here is where Origen erred, because when he heard that
            <i>every knee should bow</i>, which is a sign of subjection, he
            believed that at some future time every rational creature, whether
            angels or men or devils, would be subjected to Christ by the
            allegiance of charity. But this is contrary to Matthew (25:41):
            “Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the
            devil and his angels.” It should be noted that there are two kinds
            of subjection: one is voluntary and the other involuntary.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            In the future it will come about that all the holy angels will be
            subject to Christ voluntarily; hence he says,
            <i>every knee should bow,</i> where he mentions the sign for the
            thing signified: [“Adore him all his angels” (Ps. 96:8) ]. Likewise,
            holy and just and beatified men will be subject in this way: “All
            the nations thou has made shall come and bow down before thee, 0
            Lord, and shall glorify thy name” (Ps. 86:9); but not the devils and
            the damned, for they will be subject involuntarily: “Even the demons
            believe—and shudder” (Jas. 2:19).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Then when he says, <i>and every tongue confess,</i> he touches on
            the reverence shown by confessing with the mouth:
            <i>Every tongue,</i> namely,
            <i>in heaven and on earth and under the earth.</i> This does not
            refer to a confession of praise from those under the earth, but to a
            forced confession, which is made by recognizing God: “And the glory
            of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together”
            (Is. 40:5); “Let them praise thy great and terrible name! holy is
            he!” (Ps. 99:3). And this confession will recognize
            <i>that Jesus Christ is Lord</i> [ <i>in</i> ]
            <i>the glory of God the Father.</i> He does not say in a similar
            glory, because it is the same glory: “That all may honor the Son,
            even as they honor the Father?” (in. 5:23). It should be noted that
            earlier he had said that, <i>he was in the form of God,</i> but here
            he says <i>in the glory,</i> because it would come to pass that what
            He had from all eternity would be known by all: “Father, glorify
            thou me in thy own presence with the glory which I had with thee
            before the world was made” (Jn. 17:5).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Then when he says, <i>Therefore, my beloved,</i> the exhortation is
            brought to an end. In regard to this he does three things: first, he
            exhorts them to act well; secondly, how to do so (2:14); thirdly,
            with what fruit (2:15). The first part is divided into three: first,
            he recalls their past obedience; secondly, he shows what they should
            do (2:12); thirdly, he gives them confidence in accomplishing this
            (2:13).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            He says, therefore: Since Christ thus humbled Himself and was
            exalted for it, you ought to realize that if you are humbled, you
            shall also be exalted; and you should do this
            <i>as you have always obeyed.</i> He recalls their obedience to show
            its relevance to good works, because every virtue is included under
            obedience. For a man is just inasmuch as he keeps God’s
            commandments: “Do you not know that if you yield yourself to anyone
            as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either
            of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to
            righteousness?” (Rom. 6:16). Furthermore, every good work, no matter
            how good it is of itself, is made better by obedience; [“The
            obedient man shall speak of victories” (Prov. 21:28)]. Finally,
            obedience is one of the greatest of the virtues: for to offer
            something from one’s external things is great; to offer something
            from the body is greater; but the greatest is to offer something
            from your soul and will: and this is done by obedience: “To obey is
            better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams” (1 Sam.
            15:22). If you have acted thus, I urge you to continue doing the
            same.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Then when he says, <i>not only as in my presence,</i> he shows what
            they should do. First, he urges them to act faithfully, because an
            unfaithful servant serves only when the master is looking, because
            he seeks only to please; but a faithful servant always works well.
            Hence he says, <i>not only as in my presence,</i> for then it would
            appear that you are not acting from the instinct of good will: “Not
            in the way of eye-service, as men-pleasers, but as servants of
            Christ, doing the will of God from the heart” (Eph. 6:6). Secondly,
            that they act humbly, when he says,
            <i>with fear and trembling,</i> for the proud man does not fear, but
            the humble does: “Let anyone who thinks that he stands take heed
            lest he fall” (1 Cor. 10:12); “Blessed is the man who fears the Lord
            always” (Prov. 28:14); “Serve the Lord with fear, with trembling
            kiss his feet” (Ps. 2: 11). Thirdly, that they act with an eye
            toward salvation- <i>work out your own salvation:</i> “He who
            endures to the end will be saved” (Mt. 24:13).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Then when he says,
            <i>for God is at work in you, both to will and to work,</i>
            he strengthens their confidence, and he excludes four false
            opinions: the first is the opinion of those who believe that man can
            be saved by his own free will without God’s help. Against this he
            says:
            <i>For God is at work in you, both to will and to work:</i>
            “The Father who dwells in me does his works” (Jn. 14:10); “Apart
            from me you can do nothing” (Jn. 15:5).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            The second are those who deny free will altogether and say that man
            is necessitated by fate or by divine providence. He excludes this
            when he says, <i>in you,</i> because He moves the will from within
            to act well: “Thou has wrought for us all our works” (Is. 26:12).
            The third, like the first, is that of the Pelagians who say that
            choices are in us, but the performing of works in God, because
            willing comes from us, but accomplishing comes from God. He excludes
            this when he says, <i>both to will and to work:</i> “It depends not
            upon man’s will,” i.e., without God’s help, “or exertion, but upon
            God’s mercy” (Rom. 9:16). The fourth is the opinion that God
            accomplishes every good in us and does this through our merits. He
            excludes this when he says [ <i>according to</i> ]
            <i>for his good pleasure,</i> and not our merits, because before we
            get God’s grace there is no good merit in us: “Do good to Zion in
            thy good pleasure” (Ps. 51:18).<br />

            14 Do all things without grumbling or questioning, 15 that you may
            be blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish in the
            midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine as
            lights in the world, 16 holding fast the word of life, so that in
            the day of Christ I may be proud that I did not run in vain or labor
            in vain. 17 Even if I am to be poured as a libation upon the
            sacrificial offering of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you
            all. 18 Likewise you also should be glad and rejoice with me. 19 I
            hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, so that I may be
            cheered by news of you. 20 I have no one like him, who will be
            genuinely anxious for your welfare. 21 They all look after their own
            interests, not those of Jesus Christ. 22 But Timothy’s worth you
            know, how as a son with a father he has served with me in the
            gospel. 23 I hope therefore to send him just as soon as I see how it
            will go with me; 24 and I trust in the Lord that shortly I myself
            shall come also. 25 1 have thought it necessary to send to you
            Epaphroditus my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, and
            your messenger and minister to my need, 26 for he has been longing
            for you all, and has been distressed because you heard that he was
            ill. 27 Indeed he was ill, near to death. But God had mercy on him,
            and not only on him but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon
            sorrow. 28 I am the more eager to send him, therefore, that you may
            rejoice at seeing him again, and that I may be less anxious. 29 So
            receive him in the Lord with all joy; and honor such men, 30 for he
            nearly died for the work of Christ, risking his life to complete
            your service to me.

          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Above, the Apostle exhorted them to do works leading to salvation;
            here he teaches them how. First, he teaches them the way to do these
            works; secondly, he gives the reason (2:15).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            First, he points out two ways to act, namely,
            <i>without grumbling or questioning.</i> For virtuous works are very
            difficult, and offer a fertile field for grumbling: “We must not
            grumble, as some of them did and were destroyed by the Destroyer” (1
            Cor. 10: 10). Furthermore, they should not hesitate about doing
            them: “He who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and
            tossed by the wind” (Jas. 1:6).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            He gives reasons for this: first, on their part, and then on the
            part of the Apostle. On their part he gives three reasons: first, in
            regard to the faithful when he says,
            <i>that you may be blameless:</i> “Walking in all the commandments
            and ordinances of the Lord blameless” (Lk. 1:6). For no one can
            exist without sin, but he can without grumbling; hence he urges them
            to do this. Secondly, in regard to God,
            <i>and innocent children of God.</i> For a son is like his Father.
            But God is innocent; hence we are innocent sons of God, when our
            intention is directed to one object: “A double-minded man is
            unstable in all his ways” (Jas. 1:8); “Be as wise as serpents and
            innocent as doves” (Mt. 10:16). Thirdly, in regard to unbelievers,
            <i>without blemish,</i> i.e., behave well toward unbelievers and
            give no offense <i>in the midst of a crooked,</i> as to evil works,
            <i>and perverse generation,</i> as to unbelief. And this is when
            they cannot be defamed by them: “Give the enemy no occasion to
            revile us” (1 Tim. 5:14). He gives the reason for this when be says,
            <i>among whom you shine as lights in the world,</i>
            because no matter how the world changes, the lights of the world
            remain bright: “You are the light of the world” (Mt. 5:14). They are
            luminous, not in essence, because God alone is light in this way:
            “The life was the light of man” (Jn. 1:4). The same is true of the
            saints: “He was not the light” (Jn. 1:8).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            But they are light inasmuch as they have some of that light which
            was the light of men, i.e., of the Word of God radiating on us.
            Therefore he says,
            <i>holding fast the word of life,</i> i.e., the word of Christ:
            “Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life” (Jn.
            6:69); “Thy word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path” (Ps.
            119:105).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Then he gives a reason on the part of the Apostle:
            <i>so that I may be proud;</i> secondly, he explains the reason,
            because subjects should act well so as to redound to the glory of
            their prelates. For it is their glory, when subjects are well
            behaved: “A wise son makes a glad father” (Prov. 10:1); “You are our
            glory and joy” (1 Thess. 2:20). And this,
            <i>in the day of Christ,</i> namely, when He will lead His faithful
            to Himself. This redounds to his glory for two reasons; because of
            the labor and suffering he endured in preaching. Therefore, he says,
            <i>that I did not run in vain or labor in vain.</i> He calls
            preaching a running because of his agility in traveling from
            Jerusalem to Spain. He says <i>labor,</i> because of the
            contradictions and punishments he suffered; and this not in vain,
            but in much fruit: “His grace toward me was not in vain” (1 Cor. 15:
            10).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            He refers to his suffering when he says, <i>even</i> if
            <i
              >I am to be poured as a libation upon the sacrificial offering of
              your faith.</i
            >
            For in converting others he offers to God a sacrifice of those he
            converts. But sometimes tyrants mingle the blood of the offerers
            with their sacrifices, as in Luke (13:0); hence he says’ I offer God
            the sacrifice of your faith. And if it turn out that I myself am
            immolated, i.e., killed, by reason of offering the sacrifice of your
            conversion, I <i>am glad</i> on my part: “Count it all joy, my
            brethren, when you meet various trials” (Jas. 1:2),
            <i>and rejoice with you all,</i> that you have the faith, even with
            danger to my person with whom you rejoice in this too; hence he
            says,
            <i>likewise you also should be glad and rejoice with me:</i>
            “Rejoice with those who rejoice” (Rom. 12:15).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Then when he says, I
            <i>hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon,</i>
            he proposes his own disciples as an example: first, Timothy and
            then, Epaphroditus. In regard to the first he does three things:
            first, he promises to send Timothy; secondly, he commends him
            (2:20); thirdly, he hints at the time he will send him (2:23).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            He says, therefore, I
            <i>hope in the Lord Jews to send Timothy to you soon.</i>
            Here it should be noted that the Apostle has such trust in God that
            he attributes the slightest things to God: “Not that we are
            sufficient of ourselves to claim anything as coming from us; our
            sufficiency is from God” (2 Cor. 3:5). The text is clear.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Then he praises him: first, on account of his love for them, and
            secondly, because of his devotion to the Apostle. Thus he makes a
            good mediator, because he loves them and he venerates him. He says:
            I am sending Timothy because I <i>have no one like him,</i> i.e., so
            interested in your progress: [“He makes men of one way to dwell in
            one house” (Ps. 67:7)]
            <i
              >who will be genuinely anxious for your welfare. Genuinely
              anxious,</i
            >
            because it is for God alone: “We are as men of sincerity, as
            commissioned by God, in the sight of God we speak in Christ” (2 Cor.
            2:17). The reason why I have no one of the same mind is because
            <i
              >all look after their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ,</i
            >
            i.e., they do not seek things pertaining to the salvation of their
            neighbor and the glory of God, but pertaining to their profit and
            glory and themselves.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            But did Luke and Epaphroditus and the others, who were with the
            Apostle seek the things that were their own? I answer that in the
            company of the Apostle were many who sought this and who deserted
            him: “For Demas, in love with this present world, has deserted me
            and gone to Thessalonica; Crescens has gone to Galatia, Titus to
            Dalmatia. Luke alone is with me” (2 Tim. 4:9). But it is a custom
            that sometimes the Scripture speaks of some as though of all: “From
            the least to the greatest of them, every one is greedy for unjust
            gains and from prophet to priest, every one deals falsely” (Jer.
            6:13). Therefore it is a narrowed use of the word “all.”
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            And if you would know how he has behaved in regard to me, I answer
            that,
            <i
              >Timothy’s worth you know, how as a son with a father he has
              served with me in the gospel,</i
            >
            i.e., as though he were a special son: I sent to you Timothy, my
            beloved and faithful child in the Lord” (1 Cor. 4:17). 1
            <i>hope therefore to send him, so</i> solicitous for you and so dear
            to me.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            But why not at once? Because it is otherwise with Christ and with
            the other saints. In Christ was fulness of grace; hence He always
            had knowledge of all things; but not so the other saints. Hence the
            Apostle foresaw some things about himself and was ignorant of
            others. Thus, he received no revelation that he would be delivered
            from his imprisonment; hence he says,
            <i>just as soon as I see how it will go with me,</i>
            because if I were granted leave, I would come to you in person;
            consequently,
            <i>I trust in the Lord that shortly I myself shall come also.</i>
            But he was not freed from his prison: “Yea, thou dost light my lamp:
            the Lord my God lightens my darkness” (Ps. 18:28). For there is
            always some darkness in the saints.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Then when he says, I <i>have thought it necessary,</i> he proposes
            another disciple as an example, namely, Epaphroditus. First, he
            describes him; secondly, he suggests how he should be received
            (2:29)., In regard to the first he does three things: first, he
            praises him; secondly, he states the reason why he is sending him
            (2:26); thirdly, he explains it (2:27).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            He says, therefore: I
            <i
              >have thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother
              and fellow worker and fellow soldier, and your messenger and
              minister to my need.</i
            >
            He calls him his <i>brother</i> on account of the Father: “You are
            all brethren” (Mt. 23:8); <i>and fellow worker,</i> i.e., in the
            work of preaching: “A brother helped is like a strong city” (Prov.
            18:19); <i>and fellow soldier,</i> because we have suffered
            tribulation together: “Take your share of suffering as a good
            soldier of Christ Jesus” (2 Tim. 2:3); and
            <i>your messenger,</i> i.e., teacher. He was the bishop of the
            Philippians and sent by them to serve the Apostle; hence he says,
            <i>and minister to my need</i>: “I am filled, having received from
            Epaphroditus the things you sent, a fragrant offering, a sacrifice,
            acceptable and pleasing to God” (<i>infra</i> 4:18). But why? To
            satisfy the desire with which
            <i>he has been longing for you all:</i> “For I long to see you”
            (Rom. 1:11), and also to relieve him of his sorrow, because he was
            sad at the sorrow you felt, when you heard that he was sick. He
            explains the reason, saying:
            <i>Indeed he was ill, near to death,</i> i.e., in the opinion of the
            physicians, though not according to God’s providence, but for the
            glory of God; “This illness is not unto death; it is for the glory
            of God” (Jn. 11:4). Thus he continues:
            <i>but God had mercy on him;</i> “Be gracious to me, 0 Lord, for I
            am languishing” (Ps. 6:2); <i>and not</i> only on
            <i>him but on me also,</i> because Paul had suffered the temporal
            and natural sadness of his affliction, as Christ is said to have
            suffered sometimes.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Then he concludes by indicating how he should be received and why.
            He should be received honorably in the Lord, whose minister he is:
            “You received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus” (Gal. 4:14);
            “Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor,
            especially those who labor in preaching and teaching” (1 Tim. 5:17).
            And this because
            <i>he nearly died for the work of Christ,</i> i.e., for God and the
            salvation of the faithful: “Greater love has no man than this, that
            a man lay down his life for his friends” (Jn. 15:13);
            <i>risking his life:</i> “The good shepherd lays down his life for
            the sheep” (Jn. 10:11). And he did this,
            <i>to complete your service to me,</i> which you personally could
            not do.<br />

            1 Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same
            things to you is not irksome to me, and is safe for you. 2 Look out
            for the dogs, look out for the evil-workers, look out for those who
            mutilate the flesh. 3 For we are the true circumcision, who worship
            God in spirit, and glory in Christ Jesus, and put no confidence in
            the flesh. 4 Though I myself have reason for confidence in the flesh
            also. If any other man thinks be has reason for confidence in the
            flesh, I have more: 5 circumcised on the eighth day, of the people
            of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew born of Hebrews; as to
            the law a Pharisee, 6 as to zeal a persecutor of the church, as to
            righteousness under the law blameless. 7 But whatever gain I had, I
            counted as loss for the sake of Christ. 8 Indeed I count everything
            as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my
            Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things, and count
            them as refuse, in order that I may gain Christ 9 and be found in
            him.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Above, he proposed the example they should follow; here he shows
            whose example they should avoid. In regard to this he does, three
            things: first, he mentions whom they should avoid; secondly, the
            examples the saints gave of avoiding (3:3); thirdly, be urges them
            to avoid those whom they considered worthy of imitation. The first
            is divided into three parts: first, he mentions the purpose of his
            doctrine; secondly, why he must write (3:1); thirdly, the reason it
            is necessary (3:2).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            The aim of the admonition is to keep the Gentile believers from the
            ceremonies of the Law, to which certain persons were persuading
            them; hence he says <i>finally,</i> i.e., after my warnings,
            <i>my brethren,</i> namely, in the faith,
            <i>rejoice in the Lord</i> only, and not in the ceremonies of the
            Law: I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my
            salvation” (Hab. 3:18). And this because it
            <i>is not irksome to me to write</i> in my absence
            <i>the same things</i> I said when I was present. For words soon
            pass away, but writings endure: “The wisdom of the scribe depends on
            the opportunity of leisure; and he who has little business may
            become wise” (Si. 38:24); “Beloved, being very eager to write to you
            of our common salvation, I found it necessary to write” (Jude 1:3);
            “But on some points I have written to you very boldly by way of
            reminder” (Rom. 15:15).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            The need for this admonition is that certain seducers are busy;
            therefore, he must be busier in writing to them; hence be says,
            <i>look out for the dogs, look out for the evil-workers.</i>
            He mentions three things about them: first, the unreasoning cruelty
            of their hearts; hence he says
            <i>dogs:</i> “It is the nature of a dog to bark from anger, not from
            reason but from habit” (Gloss). These people do the same: “The dogs
            have a mighty appetite; they never have enough. The shepherds also
            have no understanding; they have all turned to their own way” (Is.
            56:11); “Outside are the dogs and sorcerers” (Rev. 22:15). Secondly,
            the perverse doctrine they sow: <i>evil-workers,</i> because they do
            not labor faithfully in the Lord’s vineyard or sow good seed in the
            soil: “An enemy has done this” (Mt. 13:28); “Do your best to present
            yourself to God as one approved, a workman who has no need to be
            ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth” (2 Tim. 2:15). Thirdly,
            he mentions their error: <i>those who mutilate the flesh</i> [
            <i>concession</i> ] <i>.</i> He uses this word to describe their
            mark, for they preach circumcision, which seeks to rival Christ’s
            grace: “If you receive circumcision, Christ will be of no advantage
            to you” (Gal. 5:2). Hence playing on the word, he says
            <i>concision,</i> as though they had not circumcision, but a cut.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Then when he says,
            <i>for we are the true circumcision,</i> he shows how they should be
            avoided by the saints: first, how they are avoided by others;
            secondly, by himself: (3:4).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            He says, therefore: I say that they are
            <i>those who mutilate the flesh,</i> but
            <i>we who worship God are the true circumcision.</i> For
            circumcision is of two kinds, namely, bodily and spiritual: “For he
            is not a real Jew who is one outwardly, nor is true circumcision
            something external and physical. He is a Jew who is one inwardly,
            and real circumcision is a matter of the heart, spiritual and not
            literal” (Rom. 2:28). For the circumcision of the flesh cuts off
            superfluous flesh; but the circumcision of the spirit is that by
            which the Holy Spirit cuts away superfluous internal concupiscences.
            Therefore, he says:
            <i>We are the true circumcision, who worship God in spirit,</i>
            i.e., who circumcises us inwardly to God. “For God is my witness,
            whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son” (Rom. 1:9); 1
            will sing with the spirit and I will sing with the mind also” (1
            Cor. 14:15). But circumcision is given as a sign of Abraham’s faith,
            to show that his faith, which believed in an offspring to come, was
            true: “The promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring” (Gal.
            3:16). Therefore, circumcision is a sign of Abraham’s faith in
            Christ. Consequently, he is circumcised who by the Holy Spirit is
            renewed inwardly in Christ, who is the truth of the circumcision:
            “In him also you were circumcised with a circumcision made without
            hands” (Col. 2:11). <i>We put no confidence in the flesh,</i> i.e.,
            in the circumcision of the flesh, because, as it is stated in John
            (6:63): “It is the spirit that gives life, the flesh is no avail.”
            The word “flesh” is sometimes taken for fleshly concupiscence,
            sometimes for the care of the flesh, and sometimes for observances
            of the flesh.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Then when he says,
            <i>though I myself have reason for confidence in the flesh also,</i>
            he gives his own example: first, he mentions the prestige he had
            under the Law; secondly, he shows how he scorned it (3:7). In regard
            to the first he does two things: first, he makes a general
            statement; secondly, he explains it part by part (3:5).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            In regard to the first he does two things: first, he shows the
            confidence he could have had in the things of the Law, saying: We
            must not put our confidence in the things of the Law,
            <i>though I myself have reason for confidence in the flesh also,</i>
            i.e., I could have, if I desired, because “Whatever anyone dares to
            boast of—I am speaking as a fool—I also dare to boast of that,” as
            he says in 2 Corinthians (11:21). And I can do this with more
            reason, because I have done more: “I am talking like a madman” (2
            Cor. 11:23). He mentions all these things in order more effectively
            to destroy the observances of the Law. For many scorn things they do
            not know or do not have; and this is not right, but only when a
            person has something and then scorns it and does not glory in it.
            Thus, if the Apostle had no prestige during the time of the Law,
            this could be cited as the reason why he went over to the gospel.
            Therefore, he shows the prestige he had under the Law: first, in
            general, and secondly, according to the life he led:
            <i>as to the Law a Pharisee.</i> As to the first, in three ways:
            first, in regard to the sacrament of his race, because he was
            <i>circumcised on the eighth day:</i> “It shall be a sign of the
            covenant between me and you’ (Gen. 17:11). He says
            <i>on the eighth day</i> because this was the difference between
            proselytes and the descendants of Abraham: the former were not
            circumcised on the eighth day, but as adults, when they were
            converted; but the latter on the eighth day according to the Law:
            “He that is eight days old among you shall be circumcised” (Gen.
            17:12). Thus it was not as a proselyte but as a true Israelite that
            he was circumcised. Secondly, in regard to his race when he says,
            <i>of the people of Israel</i>. For two races descended from
            Abraham: one through Isaac, and the other through Ishmael. From
            Isaac also two races descended: one through Esau and one through
            Jacob. But the one from Esau and the one from Ishmael were not
            included in the inheritance, but only Jacob who is also called
            Israel; hence he says, <i>of the people of Israel:</i> “Are they
            Israelites? So am I” (2 Cor. 11:22).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Then in regard to his tribe, because in the tribe of Israel some
            were descended from bondwomen, i.e., from Bala and Zelpha, and some
            from free women, namely, Lia and Rachel. Among these some persevered
            in the worship of God, namely, the tribes of Levi, Juda and
            Benjamin, but the others turned to idols during the time of
            Jeroboam. Therefore, the <i>tribe of Benjamin</i> was privileged,
            because it continued in the faith and worship of God, and the temple
            was built in it: “The beloved of the Lord, he dwells in safety by
            him; he encompasses him all the day long, and makes his dwelling
            between his shoulders” (Deut. 33:12); “Benjamin is a ravenous wolf,
            in the morning devouring the prey, and at evening dividing the
            spoil” (Gen. 49:27). He prefigured Paul who in his early days
            persecuted the Church. Thirdly, in regard to his name and tongue
            when he says, <i>a Hebrew.</i> Some say that the word “Hebrew” comes
            from Abraham, as Augustine did, but later retracted. But it is taken
            from Heber (Gen. 11:16). That it does not come from Abraham is
            evident, because Abraham himself is called a Hebrew: “Then one who
            had escaped came, and told Abram the Hebrew” (Gen. 14:13). A gloss
            on Genesis (11) says that in the time of Heber the languages of all
            nations were separated, but the primitive language remained in the
            family of Heber and in the worship of the one God and among all the
            Hebrews. He was also born of Hebrew parents; hence he says,
            <i>born of Hebrews.</i>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Then he shows the prestige he had in his manner of life: first of
            all, in regard to his sect when he says, as
            <i>to the law a Pharisee.</i> For there were three sects among the
            Jews, namely, the Pharisees, the Sadducees, and the Essenes. But the
            Pharisees were closer to the truth, because the Sadducees denied the
            resurrection and did not believe in angels or spirits, while the
            Pharisees believed both, as it is stated in Acts (23). For this
            reason the sect of the Pharisees was more commendable. That he was a
            Pharisee is stated in Acts (26:5): “According to the strictest party
            of our religion I have lived as a Pharisee.” Secondly, in regard to
            the zeal which the Jews had, although not according to knowledge, in
            persecuting Christians; hence he says,
            <i>a persecutor of the church.</i> “He who once persecuted us is now
            preaching the faith he once tried to destroy” (Gal. 1:23); “I myself
            was convinced that I ought to do many things in opposing the name of
            Jesus of Nazareth. And I did so in Jerusalem” (Acts 26:9); “I am
            unfit, to be called an Apostle because I persecuted the church of
            God” (1 Cor. 15:9).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Thirdly, in regard to the innocence of his manner of life; hence he
            says,
            <i>as to righteousmss under the Law blameless.</i> This justice
            consists in externals, but the justice of faith is of the heart:
            “God who knows the heart... cleanse their hearts by faith” (Acts
            15:9). As to external justice the Apostle lived innocently; hence he
            says, <i>blameless.</i> He does not say “without sin,” because blame
            is concerned with a sin of scandal against one’s neighbor in matters
            that are external: “And they were both righteous before God, walking
            in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless” (Lk.
            1:6). Therefore, he does not contradict what he says in Ephesians
            (2:3). “Among these we all once lived,” because he did not then have
            the true justice of faith, which makes a man pure, but only the
            justice of the Law.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Then when he says, <i>but whatever gain I had,</i> be shows his
            contempt for the prestige he had under the Law: first, he shows in
            general why he scorned the things of the Law; secondly, in detail
            (3: 8).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            He says, therefore: <i>Whatever gain I had,</i> i.e., prestige,
            namely, to be a Pharisee and so on, I
            <i>counted as loss for the sake of Christ,</i> i.e., I came to
            regard them as hindrances. For the observances of the Law, which
            were effective during the time of the Law, became harmful after
            Christ; hence he says, loss. And the reason for abandoning them was
            Christ; hence he says, <i>for the sake of Christ.</i> He explains
            this: first, that he acted thus in order to know Christ, and
            secondly to obtain Him. In regard to the first he says,
            <i>Indeed I count everything as loss.</i> This is true, if he had
            continued to depend on them. What I did formerly, I now regard a
            loss on account of my desire for a correct understanding of Christ,
            my Lord: “For I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus
            Christ and him crucified” (1 Cor. 2:2).
            <i
              >Because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my
              Lord,</i
            >
            since this transcends all knowledge. For there is nothing better to
            be known than the Word of God m whom are hid all the treasures of
            wisdom and knowledge” (Col. 2:3).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            In regard to the second he says,
            <i>for his sake I have suffered the loss of all things.</i>
            First, he shows that he scorned the observance of the Law in order
            to obtain Christ; secondly, how he could obtain Christ:
            <i>not having a righteousness of my own, based on Law.</i>
            He says, therefore: I
            <i>have suffered the loss of all things</i> by regarding them as
            vile and contemptible, <i>that I may gain Christ,</i> i.e., obtain
            Him and be united to Him by charity.<br />

            Above, he showed that he scorned past gains for the sake of Christ,
            that is, in order to know and win Christ; here he intends to explain
            these things: first, how he desires to gain Christ and be found in
            Him by justice; secondly, by enduring sufferings (3:10). In regard
            to the first, he does two things: first, he shows which justice he
            abandoned; secondly, which one he now seeks (3:9).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            It should be noted that justice is taken sometimes as the special
            virtue through which a man fulfills what is right in matters
            pertaining to life in society, in the sense that it directs a person
            in this matter; for temperance deals with one’s own internal
            passions, but justice deals with another person. In another way
            justice is a general virtue, inasmuch as a man observes the law for
            the common good. This is the sense in which it is used in Scripture
            for the observance of the divine law: “I have done what is just and
            right” i.e., the law (Ps. 119:121), which he obeyed out of love, as
            though moved by his own initiative. In this way it is a virtue, but
            not if he is moved in some other way, such as by an external cause
            or for the sake of gain or because of punishments, where to obey
            might be personally displeasing. According to this there are two
            kinds of justice: one is moral justice; the other is legal justice,
            which makes one obey the law not from love but from fear. Therefore
            he says,
            <i>not having a righteousness of my own, based on law,</i>
            because as Augustine says: “The slight difference between the Law
            and the Gospel is fear and love”; “For you did not receive the
            spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the
            spirit of sonship” (Rom. 8:15).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            But if your righteousness is your own, how is it from the Law? I
            answer that it is indeed mine, because I accomplish such works with
            human power without the inward vesture of sanctifying grace; but it
            is from the Law as from the one teaching. Or, it is mine to presume
            to obey it by myself: “Moses writes that the man who practices the
            righteousness which is based on the law shall live by it” (Rom.
            15:5).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Concerning this justice which he seeks, he states three things,
            namely, the method of acquiring it; its author; and its fruit. The
            method is that it is not obtained except by faith in Christ: “Since
            we are justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord,
            Jesus Christ” (Rom. 5:1); “The righteousness of God through faith in
            Jesus Christ for all who believe” (Rom. 3:22). For the author is God
            and not man: “It is God who justifies” (Rom. 8:33); “And to one who
            does not work but trusts him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is
            reckoned as righteousness” (Rom. 4:5). Therefore he says,
            <i>the righteousness from God that depends on faith:</i>
            “The Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey him” (Acts
            5:32). The fruit is knowledge of Him and the power of His
            resurrection and to be in the company of His saints.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            These things can be explained in two ways according to the two forms
            of knowledge: in one way, in terms of knowledge available in this
            life. In that case one must know three things about Him: first, His
            person, namely, that He is true God and true man; hence he says,
            <i>that I may know him:</i> “Have I been with you so long, and yet
            you do not know me, Philip? He who has seen me has seen the Father”
            (Jn. 14:9). Secondly, the glory of His resurrection; hence he says,
            <i>and the power of his resurrection,</i> i.e., the powerful
            resurrection performed by His own power. Thirdly, how to imitate
            Him, when he says, <i>and may share his sufferings,</i> namely, be
            associated with Him in His passion: “Christ also suffered for you,
            leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps” (1 Pet.
            2:21). In the other way, by practical knowledge, which begins from
            what is later, which is the last thing accomplished but the first
            thing intended. The first thing intended is the knowledge of God
            through His essence, to which faith leads: “They shall all know me,
            from the least of them to the greatest” (Jer. 31:34); therefore, he
            says, <i>that I may know him.</i> Secondly that not only the soul
            will be glorified, but the body also; hence he says,
            <i>and the power of his resurrection,</i> namely, by which we shall
            rise: “If Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain”
            (1 Cor. 15:14). Thirdly, the value of sharing His suffering, because
            we shall know how much it benefits us to be associated with His
            passion: “Cod is faithful, by whom you were called into the
            fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord” (1 Cor. 1:9).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Then when he says,
            <i>becoming like him in his death,</i> he shows how he would like to
            grow and be found in Him by enduring His sufferings: first, he
            mentions the endurance; secondly, its fruit (3:11).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            He says, therefore: let me be found not only having justice but also
            conformed to his death, that I might suffer for justice and truth as
            Christ did: I bear on my body the marks of Jesus” (Gal. 6:17). But
            its fruit is
            <i>that if possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead.</i>
            For one reaches glory by sufferings endured here: “For if we have
            been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be
            united with him in a resurrection like his” (Rom. 6:5); “If we have
            died with him, we shall also live with him” (2 Tim. 2:11); “Fellow
            heirs of God with Christ, provided we suffer with him” (Rom. 8:17).
            He says,
            <i>if possible,</i> because of its difficulty, arduousness and
            labor: “For the gate is narrow and the way is hard, that leads to
            life, and those who find it are few” (Mt. 7:14); “Prepare to meet
            your God, O Israel!” (Amos 4:12). For Christ rose by His own power,
            but man not by his own power, but by the grace of God: “He who
            raised Christ Jesus from the dead will give life to your mortal
            bodies also through his Spirit which dwells in you” (Rom. 8:11). Or
            it can refer to meeting the saints, when they shall meet Christ
            descending from heaven to judge.

          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Then when he says,
            <i>not that I have already obtained this,</i> he shows how his
            desire is deferred: first, he shows what he thinks of himself;
            secondly, he asks them to think the same thing of themselves (3:15).
            The first is divided into two parts: first, he shows how far short
            he is of the perfection intended-, secondly, he explains this
            (3:13). In regard to the first he does two things: first, he shows
            that he has not arrived at perfection; secondly, that he is tending
            toward it (3:12b).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            In tending toward it he seeks two things, namely, to obtain what he
            desires, and to enjoy it; for he would be seeking in vain, if he
            were not to enjoy it and inhere in it; therefore he says,
            <i>not that I have already obtained,</i> namely, the glory I seek: “
            But the righteous live forever... therefore they will receive a
            glorious crown and a beautiful diadem from the hand of the Lord”
            (Wis. 5:16); <i>or am already perfect:</i> “When the perfect comes,
            the imperfect will pass away” (1 Cor. 13:10).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            But this attitude is contrary to the command to be perfect (Mt.
            5:48) and (Gen. 17:1). I answer that perfection is twofold, namely,
            of heaven and of earth. For man’s perfection consists in adhering to
            God through charity, because a thing is perfect to the degree it
            adheres to its perfection. But the soul can adhere to God in two
            ways: in one way, perfectly, so that a person actually refers his
            actions to God and knows Him as He can be known; and this is in
            heaven. But adherence in this life is of two kinds: one is necessary
            for salvation, and all are bound to it, namely, that a person in no
            case place his heart in anything against God, and that he habitually
            refer his whole life to Him. The Lord says of this way: “You shall
            love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul,
            and with all your mind” (Matt. 22:37). The other is of
            supererogation, when a person adheres to God above the common way.
            This is done when he removes his heart from temporal things, the
            better to approach heaven, because the smaller covetousness becomes,
            the more charity grows. Therefore, what is said here refers to the
            perfection of heaven.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            I Then when he says, <i>but I press on,</i> he shows his efforts
            toward it, saying, I <i>press on,</i> namely, after Christ: “He who
            follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of
            life” (Jn. 8:12) and in (10:27): “My sheep hear my voice... and they
            follow me.” And this, <i>to make it my own</i> [
            <i>to comprehend</i> Him]: “So run that you may obtain the prize” (1
            Cor. 9:24).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            But on the other hand God is incomprehensible, because it is said in
            Jeremiah (31:37): “If the heavens above can be measured, and the
            foundations of the earth below can be explored, then I will cast off
            all the descendants of Israel.” I answer that in one sense, to
            comprehend means to enclose, as a house comprehends us; in another
            sense, it means to attain and hold. In the first sense He is
            incomprehensible, because He cannot be enclosed in a created
            intellect, since He is most simple and because you do not know or
            love Him to the degree that He is knowable and loveable, as a person
            who does not know a truth by demonstration but by opinion does not
            know it as perfectly as it can be known. But God knows Himself, as
            far as He is knowable. The reason for this is that a thing is known
            according to the mode of its own being and truth. God, however, is
            infinite light and truth, whereas our light is finite. Hence he
            says,
            <i>but I press on to make it my own,</i> that is, to comprehend Him
            in the second way, i.e., by attaining: I held him, and would not let
            him go” (Cant. 3:4),
            <i>because Christ Jesus has made me his own.</i> This can be taken
            in three ways: for all glory depends on apprehending God, i.e., that
            God be present to our soul. But not all have equal happiness:
            because some see more clearly, just as some will love more ardently
            and will rejoice more. Hence each person will have a definite amount
            according to God’s predestination; therefore, he says,
            <i>because Christ Jesus has made me his own.</i> As if to say: I
            intend to comprehend in such an amount as has been decided by
            Christ. Or, I <i>press on to make it my own,</i> as I am owned
            (apprehended). As if to say: that I may see Him as He sees me: “We
            shall see him as he is” (Jn. 3:2), not through a likeness, but
            through His essence. Or, <i>to make it my own,</i> by seeing Christ
            in glory, in which I am apprehended, i.e., in that glory in which He
            appeared, when I was converted.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Then when he says, <i>brethren, I do not consider.</i>... he
            explains what he had said: first, about his lack of perfection:
            secondly, the consequence (3:13b).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            He says:
            <i>I do not consider that I have made it my own.</i> As if to say: I
            am not so vain as to attribute to myself something I do not yet
            have; but I <i>press on toward the goal.</i> This can be taken in
            three ways: In one way thus: <i>but one thing I do,</i> namely,
            <i>forgetting what lies behind... I press on toward the goal.</i>
            Or, I
            <i>do not consider that I have made it my own,</i> but
            <i>I press on toward</i> one thing, namely,
            <i>for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.</i>
            Or, I
            <i>do not consider that I have made it my own,</i> namely, that
            which is above: “One thing have I asked of the Lord, that will I
            seek after” (Ps. 27:4). Then he shows what he deserted, namely,
            temporal things or past merits, because a man should not count his
            past merits.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Secondly, be shows what his destination is, namely,
            <i>straining forward to what lies ahead,</i> i.e., which pertains to
            faith in Christ or greater merits or heavenly things: “They go from
            strength to strength (Ps. 84:5). He says
            <i>straining forward,</i> because a person who wishes to take
            anything must exert himself as much as he can. But the heart should
            stretch itself by desire: “The desire for wisdom leads to a kingdom”
            (Wis. 6:20). <i>For the prize,</i> which is the reward only of those
            who run: “In a race all the runners compete, but only one receives
            the prize” (1 Cor. 9:24); to this prize destined for me by God,
            namely, <i>of the upward call of God:</i> “Those whom he predestined
            he also called” (Rom. 8:30), and this <i>in Christ Jesus,</i> i.e.,
            by faith in Christ.<br />

            Above he showed how he was wanting in final perfection; now he urges

            that we are not perfect? I answer that some are perfect with the
            perfection of this life, but not with the perfection of the life of
            heaven, namely, when their entire intention will be actually borne
            toward God; but in this life they are perfect habitually when they

            He says, <i>those of us,</i> because the more perfect a person is

            Four renditions of this are found in a Gloss: the first two are more
            literal. One is this: I say that you should think as I do, namely,
            that you are imperfect; yet if you think otherwise, i.e., better of
            yourselves than I do of myself, this very thing has been granted to
            you by divine revelation: and when something loftier is revealed to
            you than to me, I will not contradict but will yield to your
            revelation. Nevertheless, I do not want you to separate from the
            unity of the Church because of this revelation; but in unity, let us
            hold
            <i>true to what we have attained.</i> This unity consists in the
            unity of the truth of faith and the rectitude of good action; and
            both must be preserved: “Mend your ways, heed my appeal, agree with
            one another, live in peace” (2 Cor. 13:1-1). And the same holds for
            a good life and good actions: “Peace and mercy be upon all who walk
            by this rule, upon the Israel of God “Gal. 6:16). Or another way: I
            say that if on account of ignorance or weakness you think otherwise
            than the truth holds, let us admit it humbly and do not defend it
            stubbornly: “Thou hast hidden these things from the wise and
            understanding and revealed them to babes” (Mt. 11:25). Or another
            way: I say that we should be of the same mind, namely, that we have
            not yet made it our own; but if in anything you are now otherwise
            minded than you will be in the future, because “now we see in a
            mirror dimly, but then face to face” (1 Cor. 13:12),
            <i>God will reveal</i> it in the future: “The voice of the Lord
            shakes the wilderness,... and strips the forests bare; and in his
            temple all cry Glory!” (Ps. 29:9). Or another way: Whether you
            understand dimly here, or clearly in the future,
            <i>God will reveal that,</i> because faith is from God.
            <i>Only let us hold true to what we have attained.</i>

            Then when he says, <i>join in imitating me,</i> be urges them to
            imitate him and others, but to avoid the wicked- first, he makes his
            point; secondly, he gives the reason (3:18).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            He says, therefore: Because I regard these things as dung, that I
            may gain Christ,
            <i>brethren, join in imitating me</i> in this: “The sheep hear his
            voice” (Jn. 10:3). 1 am the shepherd; you are my sheep by imitating

            <i>those who so live as you have an example in us.</i> And you can
            tell from my example and doctrine: “Set the believers an example in

            Then when he says, that
            <i>many live as enemies of the cross of Christ,</i> he gives the
            reason for his admonition: first, on the part of those to be
            avoided; secondly, of those to be followed (3:20). But lest this
            admonition seem to proceed from hatred: first, he mentions his
            affection; secondly, he describes the ones to be avoided (3:18b).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            He says, therefore: I say that the ones to follow should be watched,
            because some walk otherwise, namely, from bad to worse: “They walk
            about in darkness” (Ps. 82:5).
            <i>Of whom I have often told you,</i> when I was with
            <i>you, and now tell you even with tears</i> of compassion: “0 that
            my head were waters and my eyes a fountain of tears, that I might
            weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people!”
            (Jer. 9:1). He gives the reason for this when he says,
            <i>enemies of the cross of Christ.</i> First, he describes them from
            their work; secondly, from their intention (3:19). In regard to the
            first: first, he mentions their work; secondly, he shows the results
            of their work (3: 19).

            Their work is to practice enmity against the cross of Christ,
            namely, those who say that no one can be saved without observing the
            ceremonies of the Law, in which they nullify the power of the cross
            of Christ: “For the word of the cross is folly to those who are
            perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God” (1
            Cor. 1: 18). And what will be the result? Certainly to us life
            through the cross of Christ; but to the others the opposite, because
            they incur death. Hence he says,
            <i>their end is destruction,</i> i.e., eternal death.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Then he describes their intention: first, he reveals their
            intention; secondly, the result of that intention (3:19). He says:
            <i>their god is the belly. As</i> if to say: they spread this
            doctrine, namely, that the ceremonies of the Law must be observed,
            for their own gain and glory to satisfy their belly: “For such
            persons do not serve our Lord Christ, but their own belly, and by
            fair and flattering words they deceive the hearts of the
            simpleminded” (Rom.. 16:18); “All the toil of man is for his mouth,
            yet his appetite is not satisfied” (Eccl. 6:7). Hence he says
            <i>god,</i> because it is peculiar to God to be the first principle
            and the ultimate end; hence those who have something as an end have
            it as their God. Furthermore, they seek their own glory against what
            is stated in John (8:50): “Yet I do not seek my own glory; there is
            One who seeks it and he will be the judge.” The result will be
            <i>their shame:</i> “I will change their glory into shame” (Ho.
            4:7). This is the way things will turn out for those whose minds are
            fixed on earthly things, i.e., those whom earthly things please and
            who seek them. They will be ashamed because their state passes; “If
            you live according to the flesh you will die” (Rom. 8:13).

            but the things that are unseen are eternal” (2 Cor. 4:18); and by
            affection, because we love only heavenly things; and by our actions,
            in which there is a representation of heaven: “Just as we have borne
            the image of the man of dust, we shall also bear the image of the
            man of heaven” (1 Cor. 15:49).

            But why is our commonwealth there? Because that is the source from
            which we expect the most help: I lift up my eyes to the bills from
            whence my help comes” (Ps. 121: 1); “For where your treasure is
            there will your heart be also (Mt. 6:21). Hence be says,
            <i>and from it we await a Savior:</i> “Blessed are the eyes that
            look for him” (Is. 30:18); “Be like men who are waiting for their
            master to come home from the marriage feast, so that they may open

            This coming involves three things: first, the general resurrection;
            hence he says,
            <i>who will change our lowly,</i> because it is subject to death,
            <i>body:</i> “Man, who is a maggot, and the son of man, who is a
            worm” (Job 25:6); “What is sown is perishable, what is raised is
            imperishable. It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory. It is
            sown in weakness, it is raised in power” (1 Cor. 15:42). This abject
            body <i>He will change</i> [ <i>reform</i> ], i.e., reduce it to His
            form: “He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will give life to
            your mortal bodies also through his Spirit which dwells in you7'
            (Rom. 8:11).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Secondly, the imitation of the saints; hence he says,
            <i>to be like his glorious body.</i> The body of Christ, of course,
            is glorified by the glory of His divinity; and He merited this by
            His passion. Therefore, whoever shares in the power of the divinity
            by grace and imitates the passion of Christ shall be glorified: “He
            who conquers, I will grant him to sit with me on my throne, as I
            myself conquered and sat clown with my Father on his throne” (Rev.
            3:21); “We shall be like him” (1 Jn. 3:2); “Then the righteous will
            shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father” (Mt. 13:43).
            Thirdly, the power by which He does this: <i>by the power</i> of his
            Godhead, i.e., by the power in Him
            <i>which enables him even to subject all things to himself:</i>
            for all will be subject to Christ; some unto salvation, and some
            unto punishment. Toward the first He will exercise mercy, and toward
            the second justice: “Thou hast given dominion over the works of thy
            hands” (Ps. 8:6); “For God has put all things in subjection under
            his feet” (1 Cor. 15:27); “Whatever the Father does, that the Son
            does likewise” (Jn. 5:19).<br />

            Above, he proposed examples for them to follow; here in a moral
            exhortation he shows how they should conduct themselves: first, how
            they should act in the future; secondly, he commends them on the
            past (4:10). In regard to the first he does two things: first, he
            urges them to persevere in what they already have; secondly, to
            advance to something better (4:4). The first is divided into two
            parts: first, he gives them a general exhortation to persevere;
            secondly, he lays down special ways for definite persons (4:2). In
            regard to the first: first, he reminds them of his own affection;
            secondly, he gives the exhortation (4:lb).

            He certifies his affection in five ways: first, by reason of the
            faith, by showing that he loves them; hence he says,
            <i>my brethren,</i> i.e., through faith: “You are all brethren” (Mt.
            23:8); secondly, by reason of charity; hence he says,
            <i>whom I love:</i> “My beloved” (1 Cor. 10: 14); thirdly, according
            to desire; hence he says, <i>and long for:</i> “God is my witness,
            how I yearn for you all” (supra 1:8). And I say
            <i>long for,</i> because I long for you or because you long for me.
            Fourthly, by joy; hence he says, <i>my</i> joy, and this because you
            are good: “A wise son makes a glad father” (Prov. 10:1); fifthly, by
            reason of future joy; hence he says, <i>and crown;</i> “For what is
            our hope or joy or crown of boasting before our Lord Jesus at his
            coming? Is it not you?” (1 Thess. 2:19).

            Then when he says, <i>stand firm thus in the Lord,</i> he urges them

            or continue as you are: “He who endures to the end will be saved”

            exhortations: first, in regard to concord; secondly, in regard to
            solicitude in helping (4:3). These two women, Euodia and Syntyche,
            ministered to the saints in Philippi, and perhaps there was some
            strife between them. Therefore, he urges them to be at peace: “

            <i>whose names are in the book of life.</i> He says this in order
            not to offend the others whom he did not name. As if to say: It
            makes no difference if I do not write everyone’s name, because they
            are written in a better place: “Rejoice and be glad” (Mt. 5:12).

            According to a Gloss the book of life is the same as the
            predestination of the saints. They are the same reality but the
            ideas are different. It should be noted that in olden times it was a
            custom to write in a register the names of those appointed to some
            duty or dignity, as soldiers and senators, who were enrolled in the
            palace. Now all the predestined saints are chosen by God for
            something great, namely, eternal life; and this appointment is
            called predestination. The record of this appointment is called the
            book of life: and this record is in the divine memory, because
            inasmuch as He appoints, He predestines; inasmuch as He knows it
            unchangeably, it is called foreknowledge. Therefore, this
            foreknowledge about the predestined is called the book of life.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            But is anyone ever erased from this book? I answer that some are
            enrolled absolutely, and others in a qualified sense. For some are
            absolutely predestined by God to obtain eternal life, and they are
            enrolled indelibly. Others are predestined to have eternal life not
            in itself, but in its cause, inasmuch as they are ordained to
            justice for the present; and such persons are said to be erased from
            the book of life when they fall away from justice in this life.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Then when he says, <i>Rejoice in the Lord,</i> he urges them to make
            more progress: first, he prepares their mind to make more progress;
            secondly, he arranges their activity (4:8). In regard to the first
            he prepares their mind in regard to three things: first, in regard
            to spiritual joy; secondly, in regard to spiritual rest (4:6);
            thirdly, in regard to peace (4:7). In regard to the first: first, he
            describes what our joy should be; secondly, he discloses the cause
            of joy (4:5b).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Anyone who desires to make progress must have spiritual joy: “A
            cheerful heart is a good medicine” (Prov. 17:22). The Apostle
            touches on four characteristics of true joy; first, it must be
            right, this happens when it concerns the proper good of man, which
            is not something created, but God: “But for me it is good to be near
            God; I have made the Lord God my refuge” (Ps. 73:28). Therefore, it
            is right, when there is joy in the Lord; hence he says,
            <i>in the Lord:</i> “‘Me joy of the Lord is your strength”
            (Neh.,8:10). Secondly, it is continuous; hence he says,
            <i>always,</i> “Rejoice always” (1 Thess. 5:16). This happens when
            it is not interrupted by sin, for then it is continuous. But
            sometimes it is interrupted by temporal sadness, which signifies the
            imperfection of joy. For when a person rejoices perfectly, his joy
            is not interrupted, because he cares little about things that do not
            last; that is why he says <i>always.</i> Thirdly, it should be
            multiple, for if you rejoice in God, you will rejoice in His
            incarnation: I bring you good news of a great joy, which will come
            to all the people; for to you is born this day in the city of David
            a Savior” (Lk. 2: 10); and in your own activity: “When justice is
            done, it is a joy to the righteous” (Prov. 21:15); and in your
            contemplation: “Companionship with her has no bitterness” (Wis.
            8:16). Again, if you rejoice in your good, you will be prepared to
            rejoice in the good of others; if you rejoice in the present, you
            are prepared to rejoice in the future; hence he says,
            <i>again I will say, rejoice.</i> Fourthly, it should be moderate
            and not flooded with pleasures, as happens in worldly joy; hence he
            says, <i>let all men know your forbearance. As</i> if to say: Your
            joy should be so moderated that it will not degenerate into
            dissoluteness: “The people continued feasting in Jerusalem before
            the sanctuary” (Judith 16:20). He says, <i>let all men know,</i> as
            if to say: Your life should be so moderate in externals, that it
            offends the gaze of no one; for that would hinder your manner of
            life.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Then when he says, <i>the Lord is at hand,</i> he touches on the
            cause of joy. For a man rejoices when his friend is near. But the
            Lord is near with the presence of His majesty: “He is not far from
            each one of us” (Acts 17:27); He is also near in His flesh: “But now
            in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near in
            the blood of Christ” (Eph. 2:13). Again He is near through
            indwelling grace: “Draw near to God and he will draw near to you”
            (Jas. 4:8); and by His clemency in hearing: “The Lord is near to all
            who call upon him” (Ps. 145:18); and by His reward: “Its time is
            close at hand and its days will not be prolonged” (Is. 13:22).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Then when he says, <i>have no anxiety,</i> he shows that our minds
            should be at rest: first, that anxiety is uncalled for; secondly,
            what should take its place in our mind (4:6b).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            It was fitting to add
            <i>have no anxiety [solicitude]</i> after saying that the Lord is at
            hand. <i>As</i> if to say: He will grant everything; hence there is
            no need to be anxious: “Do not be anxious about your life, what you
            shall eat or what you shall drink, nor about your body, what you
            shall. put on” (Mt. 6:25).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            But this seems to be contrary to what is stated in Romans (12:8):
            “He that rules, [do so] with solicitude.” I answer that anxiety or
            solicitude sometimes suggests diligence in seeking what is lacking;
            and this is commendable and opposed to negligence. Sometimes it
            suggests anxiety of spirit with a lack of hope and with the fear of
            not obtaining that about which one is anxious. Such anxiety the Lord
            forbids in Matthew (6:25), because no one should despair, as though
            the Lord will not grant what is necessary. But in place of anxiety
            we should have recourse to God: “Cast all your anxieties on him, for
            he cares about you” (1 Pet. 5:7). And this is done by praying; hence
            he says,
            <i>but in everything let your requests be made known to God.</i>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            It is fitting, after be says
            <i>the Lord is at hand,</i> to speak of petition, for it is
            customary to make petitions of a new lord on his arrival. He
            mentions four things required in every prayer. First, that prayer
            implies the ascent of the mind to God; therefore he says,
            <i>by prayer:</i> “The prayer of the humble pierces the clouds, and
            he will not be consoled until it reaches the Lord; he will not
            desist until the Most High visits him” (Si. 35:17). Secondly, it
            should be accompanied by confidence of obtaining, and this from
            God’s mercy: “We do not present our supplications before thee on the
            ground of our righteousness, but on the grounds of thy great mercy”
            (Dan. 9:18); therefore, he says, <i>and supplication,</i> which is
            an appeal to God’s grace and holiness; hence it is the prayer of a
            person humbling himself: “The poor use entreaties” (Prov. 18:23). We
            do this when we say: “Through your passion and cross...” Thirdly,
            because a person who is ungrateful for past benefits does not
            deserve to receive new ones, he adds,
            <i>with thanksgiving:</i> “Give thanks in all circumstances” (1
            Thess. 5:18). Fourthly, prayer is a petition; so he says,
            <i>let your requests be made known to God:</i> “Ask, and it will be
            given you” (Matt. 7:7). If we reflect, we will notice that all the
            prayers of the Church contain these four marks: first of all, God is
            invoked; secondly, the divine benefits are thankfully acknowledged;
            thirdly, a benefit is requested; and finally, the supplication is
            made: “Through our Lord....”
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            But it should be noted that be says,
            <i>let your requests be made known to God.</i> Does not the Lord
            know them? This is explained in three ways in a Gloss: first,
            <i>let them be made known,</i> i.e., approved in God’s presence and
            counted worthy and holy: “Let my prayer be counted as incense before
            thee” (Ps. 141:2). Or <i>let them be made known</i> to ourselves,
            that is, let us recognize that they always reach God. As if to say:
            “But when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to
            your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret
            will reward you” (Matt. 6:6). Or, <i>let them be made known</i> to
            those who are with God, i.e., the angels, through whose ministry
            they are brought to God, not because He does not know them, but
            because they intercede for us: “The smoke of the incense rose with
            the prayers of the saints from the hand of the angel before God”
            (Rev. 8:4).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Then when he says,
            <i>and the peace of God... will keep your hearts,</i> he asks that
            peace descend on the soul now instructed by the things said above.
            He asks this as though he were entreating. Peace, according to
            Augustine, is the tranquility of order: for the disturbance of order
            is the destruction of peace. This tranquility of order is considered
            from three aspects: first, insofar as it exists in the principle of
            order, namely, in God: “For there is no authority except from God,
            and those that exist have been instituted by God. Therefore he who
            resists the authorities resists what God has appointed” (Rom. 13:1).
            From that profound source in which peace exists it flows first into
            the beatified, in whom there is no disturbance either of guilt or of
            punishment; then it flows into saintly men: the holier he is, the
            less his mind is disturbed: “Great peace have those who love thy law
            (Ps. 119:165). But it is more perfect in the beatified: “Behold, I
            will extend prosperity to her like a river, and the wealth of the
            nations like an overflowing stream” (Is. 66:12). Now because God
            alone can deliver the heart from all disturbance, it is necessary
            that it come from Him; hence he says, <i>of God:</i> and this,
            inasmuch as peace considered in that source
            <i>passes all</i> created <i>understanding,</i> as it is stated in I
            Timothy (6:16): “Who alone dwells in unapproachable light”; “Behold,
            God is great, and we know him not; the number of his years is
            unsearchable” (Job 36:26). As it exists in heaven, it surpasses all
            the knowledge of the angels; but as it exists in the saints on
            earth, it surpasses all the knowledge of those who lack grace: “To
            him who conquers I will give some of the hidden manna, and I will
            give him a white stone” (Rev. 2:17).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            <i>And the peace,</i> therefore, <i>will keep your hearts,</i> i.e.,
            your affections, so that you will never depart from the good in
            anything: “Keep your heart with all vigilance; for from it flow the
            springs of life” (Prov. 4:23); <i>and your minds</i>, so that they
            not deviate from the truth in anything. And this,
            <i>in Christ Jesus,</i> by whose love your affections are kept from
            evil and by whose faith your mind continues in the truth.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Then when he says, <i>finally brethren,</i> he puts order into their
            activity by urging them to do good; first, he mentions the object of
            action, namely, the good which is done; secondly, the mover to
            action; thirdly, the act itself; fourthly, the fruit of the act.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            These four things are mentioned here. For the object of a good act
            is either the object of the intellect or of the affections: the
            object of the intellect is the true; the object of the affections is
            the good. Hence he says,
            <i>finally brethren,</i> i.e., since you are so minded, think of
            <i>whatever is true</i> through faith: “Love truth and peace” (Zech.
            8:19). In regard to an object of the affections, certain
            characteristics must be present of necessity in a good act, and
            others are over and above. Of necessity are three things: first,
            that it be good in itself; hence he says,
            <i>whatever is honorable [chaste]:</i> “But the wisdom from above is
            first pure” (Jas. 3:17); secondly, that it be directed to one’s
            neighbor; hence he says, <i>whatever is just:</i> “Blessed are those
            who hunger and thirst for righteousness [justice], for they shall be
            satisfied” (Matt. 5:6); thirdly, ordained to God; hence he says,
            <i>whatever is pure [holy]:</i> “That we might serve him without
            fear, in holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our
            life” (Lk. 1:74). The characteristics over and above what is
            necessary are twofold: first, that it lead to friendship; secondly,
            that it preserve one’s good reputation. As to the first he says,
            <i>whatever is lovely,</i> i.e., leading to mutual friendship: “Do
            not shrink from visiting a sick man, because for such deeds you will
            be loved” (Si. 7:35); “There is a friend who sticks closer than a
            brother” (Prov. 18:24). As to the second he says,
            <i>whatever is gracious</i> [ <i>of good fame</i> ]. For many things
            can be done with a good conscience, but must be omitted for the sake
            of one’s reputation: “Have regard for your name, since it will
            remain for you longer than a thousand great stores of gold” (Si.
            41:12).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            ‘Me mover to action is twofold: first, the impulse given by a habit
            existing within oneself; secondly, discipline or instruction learned
            from someone else. As to the first he says,
            <i>if there is any excellence,</i> i.e., any habit of virtue in you,
            let it incline you to this: “Rich men furnished with resources,
            living peaceably in their habitations” (Si. 44:6). As to the second
            he says, <i>if there is</i> [ <i>any discipline</i> ]
            <i>anything worthy of praise,</i> i.e., praiseworthy knowledge, in
            you, do good: “Teach me good judgment and knowledge” (Ps. 119:66).
            He explains what that knowledge is when he says,
            <i>think about these things,</i> namely,
            <i>what you have learned</i> from my teaching: “Learn from me; for I
            am gentle and lowly in heart” (Matt. 11:29); “Men you received the
            word of God which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word
            of men but as what it really is, the word of God, which is at work
            in you believers” (1 Thess. 2:13); and
            <i>what you have seen</i> from my example. Thus the mover to action
            and its object are clear.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            But because a discipline is obtained through doctrine, one must
            first acquire it; hence he says,
            <i>think about these things.</i> Then he must assent to it; hence he
            says, <i>what you have learned and received.</i> Furthermore, it is
            acquired by hearing and sight; hence he says,
            <i>what you have heard and seen.</i> But there are two kinds of good
            act: one is internal, and he mentions it when he says,
            <i>think about these things:</i> [“Meditate on these things”] (1
            Tim. 4:15); the other is external: <i>do:</i> “Learn to do good;
            cease to do evil” (Is. 1:16).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            The fruit is God, hence he says,
            <i>the peace of God will be with you.</i> As if to say: If you do
            all these things, God will be with you: “Live in peace, and the God
            of love and peace will be with you” (2 Cor. 13: 11).<br />

            10 I rejoice in the Lord greatly that now at length you have revived
            your concern for me; you were indeed concerned for me, but you bad
            no opportunity. 11 Not that I complain of want; for I have learned,
            in whatever state I am, to be content. 12 I know bow to be abased,
            and I know how to abound; in any and all circumstances I have
            learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and want.
            13 I can do all things in him who strengthens me. 14 Yet it was kind
            of you to share my trouble. 15 And you Philippians yourselves know
            that in the beginning of the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no
            church entered into partnership with me in giving and receiving
            except you only; 16 for even in Thessalonica you sent me help once
            and again. 17 Not that I seek the gift; but I seek the fruit which
            increases to your credit. IS I have received full payment, and more;
            I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent, a
            fragrant offering, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God. 19
            And my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches
            in glory in Christ Jesus. 20 To our God and Father be glory for ever
            and ever. Amen. 21 Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren
            who are with me greet you. 22 All the saints greet you, especially
            those of Caesar’s household. 23 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ
            be with your spirit.

          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Above, the Apostle showed how the faithful should conduct themselves
            in regard to the future; here he commends them for past benefits
            conferred by them. First, he gives the commendation; secondly, he
            ends the epistle with a prayer and a greeting (4:19). In regard to
            the first he does two things: first, he commends them for past
            favors; secondly, he explains the favor more fully (4: 11). The
            first is divided into three parts: first, be expresses the joy he
            experienced from their favor; secondly, he commends their favor
            (4:10); thirdly, he excuses their slowness (4: 10).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            He says; therefore: I urged you to rejoice; but now I
            <i>rejoice,</i> because of what you have done and for the things
            themselves, but I do <i>so in the Lord: I</i> will rejoice in the
            Lord, I will joy in the God of my salvation” (Hab. 3:18). 1
            <i>rejoice, I</i> say, <i>greatly,</i> because of my children.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Then he states the reason for his joy when he says,
            <i
              >that now at length you have revived your concern for me [your
              concern has flourished].</i
            >
            Good works are acts of mercy and they are called flowers, because
            just as the fruit is produced after the flower, so from acts of
            mercy the fruit of eternal life is received: “My blossoms became
            glorious and abundant fruit” (Si. 24:17). Therefore, when a good
            work is interrupted and then resumed, it is said to flower again.
            But they once provided for the Apostle, and now they provided again;
            therefore he says,
            <i
              >you have revived your concern for me. [it has flourished
              again].</i
            >
            He explains this when he says,
            <i>you were indeed concerned for me,</i> i.e., sympathized with me:
            “It is right for me to feel thus about you all” (<i>supra</i> 1:7);
            “You are to be called the king’s friend and you are to take our side
            and keep friendship with us” (1 Mae. 10:20~); or
            <i>you were indeed concerned for me,</i> namely, when you provided
            for me. And you have done this <i>now at length,</i> i.e., although
            it is late, you have done something.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Then when he says, <i>but you had no opportunity,</i> he excuses
            their slowness. As if to say: I do not lay it to negligence but to
            necessity, because you were busy with the tribulations you suffered:
            “Much labor was created for every man (Si. 40:1).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Then when he says, <i>not that I complain of want,</i> he begins to
            comment on the favor they did. First, why it is a reason for joy;
            secondly, he mentions a past favor; thirdly, he commends it (4:18).
            In regard to the first he does three things: first, be excludes a
            supposed reason for joy; secondly, he mentions his own constancy of
            mind (4:11b); thirdly, he approves their kindness (4:14).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            He says, therefore: I do not rejoice in the fact that you relieved
            my want, although it was serious: I have tried you in the furnace of
            affliction [poverty]” (Is. 48:10); yet it depresses only the spirit
            of those who are delighted with riches, or glory in their substance.
            Therefore, the Apostle is not saddened by poverty. The reason for
            this is his constancy of mind, which he mentions first; and secondly
            its cause. First, he mentions his constancy in a particular case;
            secondly, universally in all things (4:12).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            He says, therefore: I do not fear poverty, because I
            <i>have learned in whatever state I am, to be content.</i>
            For nothing so well demonstrates the mind of a perfect wise man as
            knowing how to make use of every state in which he finds himself.
            For just as a good leader in any army is the one who acts as
            circumstances require, and a good tanner is one who makes the best
            leather from each hide; so he is perfect who knows how to make the
            best of his state: if he is in lofty state, he is not lifted up; if
            in the lowest state, he is not dejected. Therefore he says, I
            <i>have learned in whatever state I am, to be content:</i>
            “The Lord God has opened my ear and I was not rebellious, I turned
            not backward” (Is. 50:5). If I have a little, it is enough; if I
            have much, I know how to be moderate.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            He explains himself, saying: I
            <i>know how to be abased.</i> Now, abasement sometimes denotes a
            virtue: “He who humbles himself will be exalted” (Lk. 18:14); and
            sometimes a low condition: “His feet were hurt with fetters, his
            neck was put in a collar of iron” (Ps. 105:18). This is what he
            means when he says, I <i>know how to be abased,</i> i.e., how to
            endure a lowly condition with equanimity, as is becoming. And
            because men are exalted by riches and humbled by poverty, there is
            danger in each of these conditions: because abundance may raise the
            mind against God, and poverty withdraw it; hence it is stated in
            Proverbs (30:8): “Give me neither poverty nor riches.” But the
            Apostle knows how to employ virtue in both; therefore,
            <i>in any and all circumstances,</i> i.e., in all places, affairs,
            states and conditions I have learned the secret: “In all things let
            us conduct ourselves as God’s ministers” (2 Cor. 6:4).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Then when he says, <i>I can do all things,</i> he reveals the cause
            of his constancy saying,
            <i>I can do all things in him who strengthens me. As</i>
            if to say: I would not be able to endure want, unless the hand of
            God supported me: “The hand of the Lord was strong upon me” (Ez.
            3:14); “They who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength, they
            shall mount up with wings like eagles, they shall run and riot be
            weary, they shall walk and not faint” (Is. 40:31).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            But are the things we sent superfluous, since you know how to endure
            want? No, because although I know how to suffer need, you ought not
            withdraw your help: “Contribute to the needs of the saints” (Rom.
            12:13); “You had compassion on the prisoners” (Heb. 10:34).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Secondly, he recalls a past favor;
            <i>and you Philippians yourselves know.</i> For he had received
            nothing from certain ones, such as the Corinthians and
            Thessalonians, because the Corinthians were covetous and became
            annoyed when they ministered to him; and because the Thessalonians
            were given to idleness, he labored, giving them an example of work.
            Yet the Philippians were good, whether he was present or absent;
            hence he says in 2 Corinthians (11: 8): “I robbed other churches by
            accepting support from them in order to serve you.”
            <i>No church entered into partnership with me in giving</i>
            temporal things <i>and receiving</i> spiritual things
            <i>except you only.</i> “If we have sown spiritual good among you,
            is it too much if we reap your material benefits?” (1 Cor. 9:11).
            <i>For even in Thessalonica you sent me help once and again.</i>
            This is the reason why the Pope can take from one church to help
            another; but not without cause.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            <i>Not that I seek the gift.</i> Here it should be noted that when a
            person gives something to someone else, two things should be
            considered: the substance of the gift and the merit of the donor.
            One who takes joy in temporal things rejoices in the substance of
            the gift and looks only for donors; this is a hireling. But one who
            looks at the merit of the donor looks for the fruit of virtue and
            justice; such a one is a shepherd.
            <i>But I seek the fruit which increases to your credit.</i>
            He says, <i>increases,</i> because they gave more than they were
            required: for some gave while he was among them, but others even
            gave while he was in Rome. I
            <i
              >am filled, having received the gifts you sent, a fragrant
              offering, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God.</i
            >
            “A pleasing odor to the Lord” (Lev. 4:31). For the devotion of the
            offerer is a sweet odor to God; and of all offerings an alms is very
            beneficial: “Do not neglect to do good and to share what you have,
            for such sacrifices are pleasing to God” (Heb. 13:16).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Then when he says,
            <i>[may] my God will supply every need of yours,</i> he brings the
            epistle to a close with a prayer: <i>[may] my God.</i> There is one
            God of all men by creation and power; but He is <i>mine,</i> because
            I serve Him in a special way: “For God is my witness whom I serve”
            (Rom. 1:9). May He supply all your needs, because you have supplied
            mine. The Lord can do this because He abounds in riches: “The same
            Lord is Lord of all and bestows his riches upon all who call upon
            him” (Rom. 10: 12); hence he says,
            <i>according to his riches.</i> And this, <i>in glory,</i> because
            in glory all his desires will be satisfied: “As for me, I shall
            behold thy face in righteousness” (Ps. 17:15). [“I shall be
            satisfied when your glory shall appear”] (Ps. 102:5). And this,
            <i>in Christ Jesus,</i> i.e., through Christ: “By which he has
            granted to us his precious and very great promises” (2 Pet. 1:4).
            For all these things, <i>to our God,</i> to the Trinity,
            <i>and to our Father be glory:</i> “To the only God, be honor and
            glory for ever and ever” (1 Tim. 1:17).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Then he gives the greeting when he says,
            <i>greet every saint in Christ Jesus,</i> i.e., those who believe in
            Christ, because they were sanctified by Christ: “So Jesus also
            suffered outside the gate in order to sanctify the people through
            his own blood” (Heb. 13:12);
            <i>especially those of Caesar’s household. This</i> shows that he
            converted many from Caesar’s household: “It has become known
            throughout the whole court and to all the rest” <i>(supra</i> 1:13).
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            But although it is stated in Matthew (11:8) that those in soft
            garments are in the houses of kings, nevertheless to help the good
            and to hinder the wicked, it seems to be lawful for holy men to
            dwell in the courts of kings, but not for the sake of voluptuous
            pleasures and desires. Therefore, he says,
            <i>those of Caesar’s household,</i> in order to arouse their joy and
            faith.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
            Then he writes a greeting in his own hand: The grace of the Lord
            Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
