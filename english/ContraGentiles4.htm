    [Douay, altered:] Lo, these things are said in part of His ways: and seeing
    we have heard scarce a little drop of His word, who shall be able to behold
    the thunder of His greatness?
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    [1] The human intellect, to which it is connatural to derive its knowledge
    from sensible things, is not able through itself to reach the vision of the
    divine substance in itself, which is above all sensible things and, indeed,
    improportionately above all other things. Yet, because man’s perfect good is
    that he somehow know God, lest such a noble creature might seem to be
    created to no purpose, as being unable to reach its own end, there is given
    to man a certain way through which he can rise to the knowledge of God: so
    that, since the perfections of things descend in a certain order from the
    highest summit of things—God—man may progress in the knowledge of God by
    beginning with lower things and gradually ascending. Now, even in bodily
    movements, the way of descending is the same as the way of ascending,
    distinguished by beginning and end.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    [2] There is a twofold account of the descent of perfections from God just
    mentioned. One account looks to the first origin of things: for divine
    Wisdom, to put perfection in things, produced them in such order that the
    universe of creatures should embrace the highest of things and the lowest.
    The other account comes from the things themselves. For, since causes are
    more noble than their effects, the very first caused things are lower than
    the First Cause, which is God, and still stand out above their effects. And
    so it goes until one arrives at the lowest of things. And because in the
    highest summit of things, God, one finds the most perfect unity—and because
    everything, the more it is one, is the more powerful and more worthy—it
    follows that the farther one gets from the first principle, the greater is
    the diversity and variation one finds in things. The process of emanation
    from God must, then, be unified in the principle itself, but multiplied in
    the lower things which are its terms. In this way, according to the
    diversity of things, there appears the diversity of the ways, as though
    these ways began in one principle and terminated in various ends.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    [3] Through these ways our intellect can rise to the knowledge of God. But
    because of the weakness of the intellect we are not able to know perfectly
    even the ways themselves. For the sense, from which our knowledge begins, is
    occupied with external accidents, which are the proper sensibles—for
    example, color, odor, and the like. As a result, through such external
    accidents the intellect can scarcely reach the perfect knowledge of a lower
    nature, even in the case of those natures whose accidents it comprehends
    perfectly through the sense. Much less will the intellect arrive at
    comprehending the natures of those things of which we grasp few accidents by
    sense; and it will do so even less in the case of those things whose
    accidents cannot be grasped by the senses, though they may be perceived
    through certain deficient effects. But, even though the natures of things
    themselves were known to us, we can have only a little knowledge of their
    order, according as divine Providence disposes them in relation to one
    another and directs them to the end, since we do not come to know the plan
    of divine Providence. If, then, we imperfectly know the ways themselves, how
    shall we be able to arrive at a perfect knowledge of the source of these
    ways? And because that source transcends the above-mentioned ways beyond
    proportion, even if we knew the ways themselves perfectly we would yet not
    have within our grasp a perfect knowledge of the source.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    [4] Therefore, since it was a feeble knowledge of God that man could reach
    in the ways mentioned—by a kind of intellectual glimpse, so to say—out of a
    superabundant goodness, therefore, so that man might have a firmer knowledge
    of Him, God revealed certain things about Himself that transcend the human
    intellect. In this revelation, in harmony with man, a certain order is
    preserved, so that little by little he comes from the imperfect to the
    perfect—just as happens in the rest of changeable things. First, therefore,
    these things are so revealed to man as, for all that, not to be understood,
    but only to be believed as heard, for the human intellect in this state in
    which it is connected with things sensible cannot be elevated entirely to
    gaze upon things which exceed every proportion of sense. But, when it shall
    have been freed from the connection with sensibles, then it will be elevated
    to gaze upon the things which are revealed.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    [5] There is, then, in man a threefold knowledge of things divine. Of these,
    the first is that in which man, by the natural light of reason, ascends to a
    knowledge of God through creatures. The second is that by which the divine
    truth—exceeding the human intellect—descends on us in the manner of
    revelation, not, however, as something made clear to be seen, but as
    something spoken in words to be believed. The third is that by which the
    human mind will be elevated to gaze perfectly upon the things revealed.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    [6] It is this threefold cognition which Job suggests in the words set down.
    The words, “Lo, these things are said in part of His ways,” refer to that
    knowledge by which our intellect ascends to a knowledge of God by the ways
    of creatures. And because we know these ways imperfectly, he rightly added:
    “in part.” “For we know in part,” as the Apostle says (1 Cor. 23:9).
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    [7] What is added, however, “and seeing we have heard scarce a little drop
    of His word,” refers to the second knowledge, in that the divine things we
    are to believe are revealed to us in, speech; “faith then,” as Romans
    (10:17) says, “comes by hearing; and hearing by the word of God.” Of this
    John (17:17) also says: “sanctify them in truth. Thy word is truth.” Thus,
    then, since the revealed truth is proposed not about divine things to he
    seen, but to be believed, Job rightly says: “we have heard.” But, since this
    imperfect knowledge flows down from that perfect knowledge wherein the
    divine Truth is seen in itself, while God reveals it to us through the
    ministry of angels who “see the face of the Father” (Mat. 18:10), Job
    rightly names it “a drop.” Hence, Joel (3:18) also says: “In that day the
    mountains shall drop down sweetness.” Since not all the mysteries known in
    the vision of the First Truth by the angels and the other blessed, but a
    certain few are revealed to us, Job adds significantly: “a little.” For
    Sirach (43:35-36) says: “Who shall magnify Him as He is from the beginning?
    There are many things hidden from us that are greater than these: for we
    have seen but a few of His words” And our Lord says to the disciples in John
    (11:12): “I have yet many things to say to you: but you cannot hear them
    now.” The few things also which are revealed to us are set forth in
    similitudes and the obscurities of words—as a result, only the studious
    arrive at any sort of grasp of them at all. Others, however, venerate them
    as things hidden, and unbelievers cannot attack them; hence, the Apostle
    says: “We see now through a glass in a dark manner” (1 Cor. 13:12).
    Significantly, then, does Job add “scarce” to bring out the difficulty.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    [8] But this addition, “Who shall be able to behold the thunder of His
    greatness,” refers to the third kind of knowledge, in which the First Truth
    will be known, not as believed, but as seen; “We shall see Him as He is,” we
    read (1 John 3:2). So Job adds: “to behold.” Nor will one perceive some
    measure of the divine mysteries: the divine majesty itself will be seen and
    all the perfection of goods; hence, the Lord said to Moses: “I will shew you
    all good” (Ex. 33:19). Rightly, then, does Job say “greatness.” Nor will the
    truth be set before man hidden under any veils, but will be entirely
    manifest; hence, our Lord says to His disciples: “The hour cometh when I
    will no more speak to you in proverbs; but will shew you plainly of the
    Father” (John 16:25). Significantly, therefore, does Job speak of “the
    thunder” to suggest the manifestation.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    [9] Now, the words set down fit our purpose. In what has preceded we have
    dealt with divine things according as the natural reason can arrive at the
    knowledge of divine things through creatures. This way is imperfect,
    nevertheless, and in keeping with the reason’s native capacity. That is why
    we can say with Job (26:14): “These things are said in part of His ways.” We
    must now deal with those divine things that have been divinely revealed to
    us to be believed, since they transcend the human intellect.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    [10] And the manner of proceeding in such matters the words set down do
    teach us. For, since we have hardly heard the truth of this kind in sacred
    Scripture as a little drop descending upon us, and since one cannot in the
    state of this life behold the thunder of the greatness, this will be the
    method to follow: What has been passed on to us in the words of sacred
    Scripture may be taken as principles, so to say; thus, the things in those
    writings passed on to us in a hidden fashion we may endeavor to grasp
    mentally in some way or other, defending them from the attacks of the
    infidels. Nonetheless, that no presumption of knowing perfectly may be
    present, points of this kind must be proved from sacred Scripture, but not
    from natural reason. For all that, one must show that such things are not
    opposed to natural reason, in order to defend them from infidel attack. This
    was also the method fixed upon in the beginning of this work.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
    [11] But, since natural reason ascends to a knowledge of God through
    creatures and, conversely, the knowledge of faith descends from God to us by
    a divine revelation—since the way of ascent and descent is still the same-we
    must proceed in the same way in the things above reason which are believed
    as we proceeded in the foregoing with the investigation of God by reason.
    First, to be specific, we must treat of the things about God Himself which
    surpass reason and are proposed for belief: such is the confession of the
    Trinity; second, of course, the things which surpass reason that have been
    done by God, such as the work of the Incarnation and what follows thereon;
    third, however, the things surpassing reason which are looked for in the
    ultimate end of man, such as the resurrection and glorification of bodies,
    the everlasting beatitude of souls, and matters related to these.

        [1] Let us take the beginning of our study from the secret of the divine
        generation, and first set down what one must hold about it according to
        the testimonies of sacred Scripture. Then we may set out the arguments
        against the truth of the faith which unbelief has invented; by achieving
        the solution of these we will be pursuing the purpose of this study.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Sacred Scripture, then, hands on to us the names of “paternity” and
        “sonship” in the divinity, insisting that Jesus Christ is the Son of
        God. One finds this most frequently in the books of the New Testament.
        Thus, Matthew (1: 27): “No one knows the Son but the Father: neither
        doth any one know the Father but the Son.” With this Mark begins his
        Gospel, saying: “The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of
        God.” John the Evangelist also frequently points to this, for he says:
        “The Father loves the Son and He hath given all things into His hand”
        (3:35) and “As the Father raises up the dead, and gives life: so the Son
        also gives life to whom He will” (5:21). Paul the Apostle also
        frequently inserts these words, for he calls himself in Romans (1:1-3)
        “separated unto the gospel of God, which He had promised before by His
        prophets in the holy scriptures concerning His Son”; and says in Hebrews
        (1:1): “God, who, at sundry times and in divers manners, spoke in times
        past to the fathers by the prophets, last of all in these days hath
        spoken to us by His Son.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] This is also. given us, although more rarely, in the books of the
        Old Testament. Thus, Proverbs (30:4) says: “What is His name, and what
        is the name of His Son, if you know?” One reads it also in the Psalms
        (2:7; 88:27): “The Lord said to me: You are My Son”; and again: “He
        shall cry out to Me: You are My Father.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] To be sure, some would like to twist these last two sayings into
        another sense, so as to refer “The Lord hath said to Me: You are My Son”
        to David; and so as to ascribe “He shall cry out to Me: You are My
        Father” to Solomon. Nevertheless, the additions in each instance show
        that this cannot be quite the case. For David cannot be fitted into this
        addition: “This day have I begotten You” (Ps. 2:7); nor into this one:
        “I will give You the Gentiles for your inheritance, and the utmost parts
        of the earth for your possession” (2:8); since David’s kingdom was not
        extended to the utmost parts of the earth, as the history of the Book of
        Kings shows. No more is the saying: “He shall cry out to Me: You are My
        Father” fitting to Solomon, since there follows: “I will make His rule
        to endure for evermore: and His throne as the days of heaven” (Ps.
        88:30). Hence, one is given to understand that because some of the
        things joined to the texts mentioned are suitable to David and Solomon,
        some absolutely unsuitable, what is said of David and Solomon in these
        words is said, as customarily in Scripture, figuratively of that other
        in whom the whole is fulfilled.

        [5] However, since the names of “Father” and “Son” follow on a
        generation, Scripture has not been silent about the very name of “divine
        generation.” For in the Psalm (2:7), as was said, one reads: “This day
        have I begotten You.” And Proverbs (8:24-2.5): “The depths were not as
        yet and I was already conceived: before the hills I was brought forth”;
        or, according to another reading: “Before all the hills did the Lord
        beget me.” And Isaiah (66:9, 8) also says: “Shall not I that make others
        to bring forth... Myself bring forth, saith the Lord? Shall I that give
        generation to others be barren, says the Lord your God?” We grant that
        one can say that this text must be related to the multiplication of the
        children of Israel returning from captivity into their own country,
        because earlier this is said: “Zion has been in labour and has brought
        forth her children.” But this does not defeat our purpose. For, however
        the essence of it be adapted, the essence of it which is given from the
        voice of God remains fixed and stable thus: If He Himself grants
        generation to others, He is not sterile. Nor would it become Him who
        makes others generate truly to generate Himself not truly but by a
        likeness. For a thing must he more nobly in its cause than in that which
        is caused, as was shown. Again, it says in John (1:14): “We saw His
        glory, the glory as it were of the only-begotten of the Father”; and
        later: “The only-begotten Son ho is in the bosom of the Father, He has
        declared him” (1:18). And Paul says: “And again when He brings his
        first-begotten into the world He says: ‘And let all the angels of God
        adore Him’” (Heb. 1:6).

        [1] Consideration must, of course, be given to the fact that the names
        mentioned are used by the divine Scripture in its exposition of the
        creation of things, for in Job (38:28-29) it says: “Who is the father of
        rain? Or who begot the drops of dew? Out of whose womb came the ice; and
        the frost from heaven who engendered it!” Therefore, lest nothing more
        be understood by the words for “paternity,” “sonship,” and “generation”
        than the efficacy of creation, the authority of Scripture added
        something: When it was naming Him “Son” and “begotten”, it was not
        silent about His being God, so that the generation mentioned might be
        understood as something more than creation. For John (1:1) says: “In the
        beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was
        God.” That by the name “Word” one should understand Son is made plain in
        the sequel, for he adds: “The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us,
        and we saw His glory, the glory as it were of the only-begotten of the
        Father” (1:14). And Paul says: “The goodness and kindness of God our
        Savior appeared” (Titus 3:4).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Neither was the writing in the Old Testament silent about this; it
        named Christ God. For a Psalm (44:7-8) says: “Your throne, O God, is for
        ever and ever: the sceptre of your kingdom is a sceptre of uprightness.
        You loved justice, and hated iniquity.”—That this is spoken to Christ is
        clear from what follows: “Therefore God, your God, has anointed You with
        the oil of gladness above your fellows.” And Isaiah (9:6) says: “A Child
        is born to us, and a son is given to us, and the government is upon His
        shoulder: and His name shall be called, Wonderful, Counsellor, God the
        Mighty, the Father of the world to come, the Prince of peace.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Thus, then, are we taught from sacred Scripture that the Son of God,
        begotten of God, is God. And Peter confessed that Jesus Christ is the
        Son of God. He said: “You are Christ, the Son of the living God” (Mat.
        16:16). He Himself, therefore, is both the Only-begotten and God.

        [1] Now, certain men, who perversely presumed to measure the truth of
        this doctrine by their own comprehension of it, conceived on the points
        just mentioned opinions both vain and various.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Some among these took into consideration Scripture’s custom of
        calling those who are justified by divine grace “sons of God,”, as in
        John (1:12): “He gave them power to be made the sons of God, to them
        that believe in His name.” And Romans (8:16) says: “The Spirit Himself
        gives testimony to our spirit, that we are the sons of God.” And 1 John
        (3: 1): “Behold what manner of charity the Father has bestowed upon us,
        that we should be called, and should be the sons of God.” And Scripture
        does not hesitate to call these “begotten of God,” for it says in James
        (1:18): “For of His own will bath He begotten us by the word of truth”;
        and 1 John (3:9) says: “Whosoever is born of God commits not sin: for
        His seed abides in him.” Also, to the same men, which is more marvelous,
        the name of “divinity” is applied. For the Lord said to Moses: “I have
        appointed you the God of Pharaoh” (Ex. 7:1); and the Psalmist says: “I
        have said: You are gods and all of you the sons of the most High” (Ps.
        81:6); and, as our Lmd ms: “He called them gods, to whom the word of God
        was spoken” (John 10:35).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] After this fashion, therefore, they formed the opinion that Jesus
        Christ was pure man, that He had had a beginning from the Virgin Mary,
        that by the merit of His blessed life He had received the honor of
        divinity above all others; and they thought that He was, like other men,
        a son of God by the spirit of adoption, begotten of God by grace, and by
        a kind of likens to God called God in Scripture not by nature, but by
        partaking in the divine goodness, just as it says of the saints in 2
        Peter (1:4): “That by these you may be made partakers of the divine
        nature: flying the corruption of that concupiscence which is in the
        world.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Such was the position they were trying to establish by the authority
        of sacred Scripture.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] For our Lord says in Matthew (28:18): “All power is given to Me in
        heaven and in earth.” But, if He were God before all times, He would not
        have received power in time.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Again, Romans (1:34) says of the Son: “Who was made to Him,” to God,
        namely, “of the seed of David according to the flesh”; and says that He
        was “predestinated the Son of God in power.” But what was predestinated
        and was made seems not to be eternal.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] The Apostle also says (Phil. 2:8): “He humbled Himself, becoming
        obedient unto death, even to the death of the cross. For which cause God
        also bath exalted Him, and bath given Him a name which is above all
        names.” From this it appears clear that by the merit of His obedience
        and passion He was given divine honor and was exalted above all things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] Peter also says: “Therefore let all the house of Israel know most
        certainly, that God bath made both Lord and Christ, this same Jesus,
        whom you crucified” (Acts 2:36). Therefore, it seems that He was made
        God in time, not born before time.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] They also bring in to shore up their opinion whatever Scripture says
        which seems to imply a defect in Christ: that He was carried in a
        woman’s womb, that He progressed in age, that He suffered hunger, was
        wearied with fatigue, and was subject to death; that He advanced in
        wisdom, confessed He did not know the day of judgment; that He was
        stricken with the fear of death; and other things of this sort which
        could not be in agreement with a God existing by His nature. Hence their
        conclusion: that by merit Christ acquired divine honor through grace and
        that He was not by nature divine.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] Now, this position was first invented by certain ancient heretics,
        Cerinthus and Ebion. later, Paul of Samosata renewed it; and later it
        was strengthened by Photinus, so that those who dogmatize thus are
        called Photinian.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] However, those who diligently examine the words of sacred Scripture
        do not find in them the meaning which these men have by their own
        opinion constructed. For, when Solomon says: “The depths were not as
        yet, and I was already conceived,” (Prov. 8:24), he makes it clear
        enough that this generation existed before all bodily things. Hence, it
        follows that the Son begotten by God received no beginning of being from
        Mary. To be sure, they endeavored to debase these and other like
        testimonies by their perverse exposition. These, they said, should be
        understood after the manner of predestination: that before the
        foundation of the world it was arranged that a Son of God should be born
        of the Virgin Mary, not that the Son of God had been before the world.
        But they are refuted by this: Not only in predestination, but in reality
        as well, He had been before Mary. For after the words of Solomon just
        quoted this is added: “When He balanced the foundations of the earth: I
        was with Him forming all things” (Prov. 8:29-30); but if He had been
        present in predestination only, He would have been able to do nothing.
        One gets this also from the words of John the Evangelist, for, when he
        had first set down: “In the beginning was the Word” (by which name the
        Son is understood as was shown) to keep anyone from taking this as
        predestination, he adds: “All things were made by Him: and without Him
        was made nothing” (1:1, 3); and this could not be true if He had not
        really existed before the world. Again, the Son of God says in John
        (3:13): “No man has ascended to heave except He who descended fro
        heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven”; again in John (6:38): “I came
        down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of Him who sent
        me.” Clearly, therefore, he was before He descended from heaven.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [12] There is more. According to the position described above, a man by
        the merit of his life advanced to being God. The Apostle shows, on the
        contrary, that when He was God He became man. For he says: ‘Who being in
        the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: but
        emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the
        likeness of men, and in habit found as a man” (Phil. 2:6). Therefore,
        the position described is in conflict with apostolic teaching.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [13] Furthermore, among all the rest of those who had the grace of God,
        Moses had it in abundance; it says of him in Exodus (33:11): “The Lord
        spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend.” If,
        therefore, Jesus Christ is not said to be a son of God except by the
        grace of adoption, like other saints, on the same grounds Moses should
        be called son and Christ, even though Christ was endowed with more
        abundant grace: among the other saints, also, one is endowed with
        greater grace than another, but all are called sons of God on the same
        ground. But Moses is not called son on the same ground that Christ is so
        called, for the Apostle distinguishes Christ from Moses as the Son from
        the servant. He says in Hebrews (3:5-6): “Moses indeed was faithful in
        all His house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were
        to be said: But Christ as the Son in His own house.” Manifestly, then,
        Christ is not called the Son of God by the grace of adoption, as other
        saints are.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [14] One can gather a similar understanding from several other places in
        Scripture, in which Christ is named in some singular way and prior to
        others as the Son of God. Sometimes singularly and without others He is
        named “Son”: as the voice of the Father thundered at the baptism: “This
        is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased” (Mat. 3:17). Sometimes He
        is named “Only-begotten” as in John: “We saw His glory, the glory as it
        were of the only-begotten of the Father”; and again: “The only-begotten
        Son who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him” (1:14, 18).
        If He were to be called son in some common fashion like others, He could
        not be called the Only-begotten. Sometimes, also, He is named
        “First-begotten” to show an overflowing of sonship from Him to others:
        as in Romans (8:29): ‘Whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be made
        conformable to the image of His Son; that He might be the first-born
        amongst many brethren7; and Galatians (4:4-5) says: “God sent His Son
        that we might receive the adoption of sons. On another ground,
        therefore, is He a Son, through likeness to whose sonship others are
        called sons.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [15] In sacred Scripture, moreover, certain works are properly
        attributed to God, and in such wise that they cannot be assigned to
        another: such are the sanctification of souls and the remission of sins;
        for it is said in Leviticus (20:8): “I am the Lord that sanctify you”;
        and in Isaiah (45:25): “I am He that blot out your iniquities for My own
        sake.” Yet Scripture attributes each of these to Christ, for we read in
        Hebrews (2:11; 13:12): “Both he that sanctifies, and they who are
        sanctified, are all of one”; and again: “Jesus also, that He might
        sanctify the people by His own blood, suffered without the gate.” Our
        Lord Himself insisted that He had the “power to forgive sins,” and
        confirmed this by a miracle as is told in Matthew (9:16). This is also
        what the angel foretold of Him when he said: “He shall save His people
        from their sins” (Mat. 1:21). Christ, therefore, who both sanctifies and
        forgives sins, is not called God as they are called gods who are
        sanctified, and whose sins are forgiven, but as one who has the power
        and the nature of divinity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [16] The Scriptural testimonies by which they tried to show that Christ
        was not God by nature are useless for establishing their proposition.
        For it is our confession that in Christ the Son of God, after the
        mystery of the Incarnation, there were two natures; namely, human and
        divine. And so, things are said of Him which are proper to God by reason
        of the divine nature, and things are also said which seem to involve
        deficiency by reason of the human nature, as will be more fully
        explained later. But now, for the present consideration of the divine
        generation, let it suffice to have pointed out in accord with the
        Scriptures that Christ the Son of God is also called God, not only as a
        pure man is by the grace of adoption, but by reason Of the nature of
        divinity.

        [1] Since, of course, the fixed mental conception of all who think
        rightly about God is this: There can be but one God—certain men,
        conceiving from the Scriptures that Christ is truly and naturally God
        and the Son of God, have confessed that the one God is Christ the Son of
        God and God the Father; and that God, nevertheless, is not called Son in
        His nature or from eternity, but that He then received the name of
        sonship when He was born of the Virgin Mary in the mystery of the
        Incarnation. Thus, all the things which Christ bore in the flesh they
        used to attribute to God the Father: for example, that He was the son of
        the Virgin, conceived and born of her, that He suffered, died and rose
        again, and all else which the Scriptures say of Christ in the flesh.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] They attempted to strengthen their position by Scriptural
        authorities. For it says in Exodus (i.e., Deut. 6:41): “Hear, O Israel,
        the Lord our God is one Lord”; and in Deuteronomy (32:39): “I alone am
        and there is no other God besides Me”; and John (14:10, 9, 11): “The
        Father who abides in Me, He doth the works”; and again: “He that sees
        Me, sees the Father also... I am in the Father and the Father in Me.”
        From all these they used to conceive that God the Father was being
        called the very Son incarnate of the Virgin.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] This was, of course, the opinion of the Sabellians, who were also
        called Patripassionists because they confess that the Father suffered,
        holding that the Father Himself was Christ.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Now, the latter position differs from the one just de scribed with
        respect to Christ’s divinity (for the latter confesses that Christ is
        true and natural God which the first denied); nevertheless, with respect
        to generation and sonship, each of the two opinions conforms with the
        other: for, as the first holds that there was no sonship and generation
        by which Christ is said to be Son before Mary, so the latter also
        maintains. Therefore, neither of these positions relates the generation
        and sonship to the divine nature, but to the human nature only. The
        second position has this special feature: that when one says “Son of
        God” one designates not a subsisting person but a kind of additional
        property of a pre-existing person, for the Father Himself, in that He
        assumed flesh from the Virgin, received the name of Son; it is not as
        though the Son is a subsisting Person distinct from the Person of the
        Father.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] The authority of Scripture makes the falsity of this position quite
        manifest. For Scripture does not call Christ merely the Virgin’s son,
        but also the Son of God. We made this clear before. But it cannot be
        that one be his own son, for, since a son is begotten by a father, and
        he who begets gives being to the begotten, it would follow that he who
        gives is identified with him who receives being-and this is entirely
        impossible. Therefore, God the Father is not Himself the Son, but the
        Son is other than He, and the Father is other than the Son.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Then, too, our Lord says: “I came down from heaven, not to do My own
        will, but the will of Him that sent Me”; and: “Glorify Me, O Father with
        Yourself” (John 6:38; 17:5). From all, of these and similar sayings the
        Son is shown to be other than the Father.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Of course, it can be said within this position that Christ is called
        the Son of God the Father in His human nature only; namely, because God
        the Father Himself created and sanctified the human nature which He
        assumed. Thus, then, the same one is in His divinity called His own
        Father in His humanity. Thus, there is also no objection to saying that
        the same one in His humanity is distinct from Himself in His divinity.
        But in this fashion it will follow that Christ is called a son of God as
        are other men, whether by reason of creation, or by reason of
        sanctification. It has, however, already been shown that Christ is
        called the Son of God for another reason than other holy men are. It
        cannot, therefore, be understood that the Father Himself is Christ and
        His very own son.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] There is more. Where there is one subsisting supposit, it does not
        receive a plural predication. But Christ speaks of Himself and the
        Father in the plural; He says: “I and the Father are one (John 10:30).
        The Son, therefore, is not the Father Himself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] Furthermore, if it is by the mystery of the Incarnation alone that
        the Son is distinguished from the Father, there was no distinction
        whatever before the Incarnation. In the sacred Scripture, however, the
        Son is found to have been distinct from the Father even before the
        Incarnation. For it says in John (1:1): “In the beginning was the Word,
        and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” So, the Word who was
        with God had some distinction from Him. This is our usual manner of
        speaking: one is said “to be with” another. In the same way in Proverbs
        (8:30) the Begotten says: “I was with Him forming all things.” Here,
        again, an association and some distinction is designated. It says also
        in Hosea (1:7): “I will have mercy on the house of Judah, and I will
        save them by the Lord their God,” where God the Father is speaking of
        saving the people in God the Son, as of a person distinct from Himself,
        who is held worthy of the name of God. We read, also, in Genesis (1:26):
        “Let us make man to our image and likeness”; and in this the plurality
        and distinction of those who make man is expressly designated. Yet
        Scripture teaches that man was made by God alone. Thus, there was a
        plurality and distinction of God the Father and God the Son even before
        the Incarnation of Christ. Therefore, the Father Himself is not called
        the Son by reason of the mystery of the Incarnation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] Furthermore, true sonship relates to the supposit of the one called
        son, for it is not a man’s hand or foot which receives the name of
        sonship properly speaking, but the man himself whose parts they are. But
        the names of “paternity” and of “sonship” require a distinction in those
        to whom they are applied, just as “begetting” and “begotten” do.
        Necessarily, then, if one is truly called son he must be distinguished
        in supposit from his father. But Christ is truly the Son of God, for we
        read in 1 John (5:20): “That we may be in His true Son, Jesus Christ.”
        Necessarily, then, Christ is distinct in supposit from the Father.
        Therefore, the Father Himself is not the Son. Furthermore, after the
        mystery of the Incarnation the Father proclaims of the Son: “This is My
        beloved Son” (Mat. 3:17). Such a designation is a reference to a
        supposit. Christ is, therefore, as a supposit other than the Father.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] The points by which Sabellius attempts to strengthen his position
        do not prove what he intends to prove. We will make this clear more
        fully later on. For, by reason of the truth that “God is one,” or that
        “the Father is in the Son and the Son in the Father,” one does not bold
        that the Father and the Son are one in supposit; there can be a unity of
        two who are distinct in supposit.

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Now, sacred doctrine does not agree that the Son of God took His
        beginning from Mary, as Photinus used to say, nor that He who was God
        from eternity and is the Father began to be the Son by taking flesh, as
        Sabellius had said. And so, there were others who developed this opinion
        about the divine generation of which Scripture treats: that the Son of
        God existed before the mystery of the Incarnation and even before the
        foundation of the world; and, because that Son of God is other than God
        the Father, they judged He was not of the same nature with God the
        Father, for they could not understand and did not wish to believe that
        any two who are distinct as persons have one essence and nature. And
        because in the faith’s teaching only the nature of God the Father is
        believed to be eternal, they believed that the nature of the Son did not
        exist from eternity, although the Son was before other creatures. And
        since whatever is not eternal is made from nothing and created by God,
        they used to preach that the Son of God was made from nothing and was a
        creature. But, since the authority of Scripture forced them to name the
        Son also, as was brought out in the foregoing they used to say that He
        was one with God the Father—not to be sure, by nature, but by a kind of
        union of consent, and by a participation in the divine likeness above
        all other creatures. Now, the highest creatures whom we call angels are
        named “gods” and “sons of God” in Scripture, as in Job (58:4, 7): “Where
        were you when the morning stars praised Me together, and all the sons of
        God made a joyful melody?” and in a Psalm (81:1): “God has stood in the
        congregation of gods: Accordingly, this one should be called Son of God
        and God more than the others, to show that He is more noble than any
        other creature in that through Him God the Father established all the
        rest of creation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] They used to try to strengthen this position by the testimonies of
        sacred Scripture.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] For the Son says, speaking to the Father in John (17:3): “This is
        eternal life: that they may know You, the only true God.” The Father
        alone, therefore, is true God. Since, therefore, the Son is not the
        Father, the Son cannot be true God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] The Apostle also says: “Keep the commandment without spot,
        blameless, unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, which in His times
        He shall shew who is the Blessed and only Mighty, the King of kings, and
        Lord of lords; who only has immortality, and inhabits light
        inaccessible” (1 Tim. 6:14-16). These words make a distinction between
        the Father who shows and Christ who is shown. Therefore, only the Father
        who shows is the King of kings and Lord of lords; He alone is immortal
        and dwells in inaccessible light. Therefore, the Father alone is true
        God. Therefore, the Son is not.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Furthermore, our Lord says: “The Father is greater than I” (John
        14:z8); and the Apostle says: “When all things shall be subdued unto
        Him, then the Son also Himself shall be subject unto Him,” namely, to
        the Father, “that put all things under Him” (1 Cor. 15:28). But if the
        nature of the Father and Son were one, their greatness and majesty would
        also be one. For then the Son would not be less than the Father, or
        subject to the Father. It follows, then, from Scripture that the Son is
        not of the same nature as the Father, so they believed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] The nature of the Father, furthermore, suffers no need. But one
        finds need in the Son, for it is shown from Scripture that He receives
        from the Father—and he who receives is in need. For Matthew (13:27)
        says: “All things are delivered to Me by My Father”; and John (3:35):
        “The Father loves the Son: and He has given all things into His hand.”
        The Son, therefore, seems not to be of the same nature with the Father.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] He is in need, moreover, who is taught and is helped. But the Son is
        taught and is helped by the Father. For John (5:19-20; 14:15) says: “The
        Son cannot do any thing of Himself, but what He sees the Father doing”;
        and later: “The Father loves the Son, and shows Him all that he is
        doing”; and the Son says to the disciples: “What I have heard of My
        Father, I have made known to you.” Therefore, the Son appears not to be
        of the same nature as the Father.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] There is more. To receive a command, to obey, to be sent seem proper
        to an inferior. But these we read about the Son. For the Son says in
        John (14:31): “As the Father has given Me commandment, so do I”; and the
        Apostle: “Becoming obedient unto death” (Phil. 2:8). And John (1436): “I
        shall ask the Father, and He will give you another paraclete!” And the
        Apostle also says: “When the fulness of the time was come God sent His
        Son” (Gal. 4:4). Therefore, the Son is less than the Father and is
        subject to Him.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] Furthermore, the Son is glorified by the Father, as He Himself says
        in John (13:28): “Father, glorify your name”; and thereafter: “A voice,
        therefore, came from heaven: I have both glorified it, and will glorify
        it again.” The Apostle also says that God “raised up Jesus Christ from
        the dead” (Rom. 8:11). And Peter says that He “was exalted by the right
        hand of God” (Acts 2:33). And from these it seems that the Son is
        inferior to the Father.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10]] In the Father’s nature, furthermore, there can be no failure. But
        one finds a failure in power in the Son, for He says in Matthew (20:23):
        “To sit on My right or left hand is not Mine to give to you, but to them
        for whom it is pre pared by My Father.” There is a failure also in
        knowledge; for He Himself says: “That day or hour no man knows, neither
        the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but the Father” (Mark 13:22). There
        is also a failure in stability of love, since Scripture asserts that
        there was sadness in the Son and anger and other changes of this sort.
        Therefore, the Son does not appear to be of the same nature as the
        Father.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] It is, furthermore, found expressly in Scripture that the Son of
        God is a creature. For Sirach (24:12, 14) says: “The creator of all
        things said to Me: and He that made Me rested in My tabernacle”; and
        again: “From the beginning, and before the world, was I created.”
        Therefore, the Son is a creature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [12] What is more, the Son is numbered among creatures. For it says in
        the person of Wisdom: “I came out of the mouth of the most High, the
        firstborn before all creatures” (Sirach 24:5). And the Apostle says of
        the Son that He is “the firstborn of every creature” (Col. 1:15). The
        Son, then, seems to belong to the order of creatures as one who holds
        the first rank therein.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [13] The Son, moreover, says in John (17:22), praying for the disciples
        to the Father: “The glory which You hast given Me, I have given to them;
        that they may be one, as We also are one.” Therefore, the Father and Son
        are one as He wished the disciples to be one. But He did not wish the
        disciples to be essentially one. Therefore, the Father and Son are not
        essentially one. Thus it follows that He is a creature and subject to
        the Father.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [14] Now, this is the position of Arius and Eunomius. And it seems to
        have arisen from the sayings of the Platonists, who used to hold that
        there was a supreme God, the Father and Creator of all things, and from
        Him there emanated a certain “Mind” in which were the forms of all
        things, and it was superior to all things; and they named this the
        “paternal intellect”; after this they put the soul of the world, and
        then the other creatures. Therefore, what is said in sacred Scripture of
        the Son of God they used to understand of the mind just mentioned; and
        the more so because sacred Scripture names the Son of God “the Wisdom of
        God” and “the Word of God.” And with this opinion the position of
        Avicenna agrees; he holds that above the soul of the first heaven there
        is a first intelligence moving the first heaven, and further beyond this
        he placed God at the summit.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [15] In this way, then, the Arians were inclined to think that the Son
        of God was a kind of creature, pre-eminent over all other creatures, the
        medium by which God had created all things; they were all the more so
        inclined by the fact that certain philosophers also held that things
        proceeded from their first source in an order, resulting in the creation
        of all things through one first creature.

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] That this opinion is manifestly repugnant to divine Scripture anyone
        can see who considers diligently what sacred Scripture says.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] For, when divine Scripture names Christ the Son of God and angels
        the sons of God it does so for different reasons. Hence, the Apostle
        says: “To which of the angels has He said at any time, ‘You are My Son,
        today have I begotten You” (Heb. 1:5). And it was to Christ that this
        was said, he asserts. But, according to the aforesaid position, angels
        are called sons for the same reason as Christ, for the name of sonship
        is fitting to each according to a kind of sublimity of nature in which
        they were created by God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Neither is this objection met if Christ is of a nature more
        excellent than other angels. For, even among the angels diverse orders
        are discovered, which became clear above, and for all that, to all of
        them the same notion of sonship is suitable. Therefore, Christ is not
        called the Son of God in the way the position described maintains.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Again, since by reason of creation the name of divine sonship is
        suitable to many-for it belongs to all the angels and saints—if Christ
        also were called Son on the same ground, He would not be “only-begotten;
        although by reason of the excellence of His nature over all others He
        could be called “firstborn.” However, Scripture asserts that He is
        only-begotten: “We saw His glory, the glory as it were of the
        only-begotten of the Father” (John 1:14). It is not, therefore, by
        reason of creation that He is called the Son of God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Moreover, the name of sonship properly and truly follows on the
        generation of living things in which the begotten proceeds from the
        substance of the one begetting; otherwise, the name of sonship is taken
        not in truth but in similitude, as when we call either students or
        others who are in our charge our sons. If, then, Christ were not called
        Son except by reason of creation, since that which is created by God is
        not derived from the substance of God, Christ could not be called Son
        truly. But He is called the true Son in 1 John (5:20): “that we may be;
        he says, “in His true Son, Jesus Christ.” Therefore, He is not called
        the Son of God as created by God in an excellence of nature, however
        great, but as one begotten of God’s substance.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] What is more, if Christ is called Son by reason of creation, He will
        not be truly God. For nothing created can be called God unless by some
        similitude to God. But this same Jesus Christ is true God, for, when
        John had said: “that we may be in His true Son,” he added: “This is the
        true God and life eternal.” Therefore, Christ is not called the Son of
        God by reason of creation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Furthermore, the Apostle says: “Of whom is Christ, according to the
        flesh, who is over all things, God blessed forever. Amen” (Rom. 9:5);
        and in Titus (2:13): “Looking for the blessed hope and coming of the
        glory of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ.” And Jeremiah
        (23:5-6) says: “I will raise up to David a just branch”; and adds below:
        “and this is the name that they shall call Him: The Lord our just one.”
        There in Hebrew the name is the <i>tetragrammaton</i>, which certainly
        is said of God alone. From these sayings it is clear that the Son of God
        is true God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] Moreover, if Christ be the true Son, of necessity it follows that He
        is true God. For, that cannot truly be called son which is begotten of
        another, even if the thing be born of the substance of the one begetting
        unless it comes forth in species like the one begetting; the son of a
        man must be a man. If, therefore, Christ be the true Son of God, He must
        be true God. Therefore, He is not anything created.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] Again, no creature receives the complete fullness of divine
        goodness, because, as was made clear above, perfections proceed from God
        to creatures in a kind of descent. But Christ has in Himself the
        complete fullness of the divine goodness, for the Apostle says: “In Him
        dwells all the fulness of the Godhead” (Col. 2:9). Therefore, Christ is
        not a creature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] Grant, furthermore, that the intellect of an angel has a more
        perfect knowledge than the intellect of man; it is still in great want
        from the divine intellect. But the intellect of Christ is not in want of
        knowledge from the divine intellect, for the Apostle says that in Christ
        “are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge” (Col. 2:3).
        Therefore, Christ the Son of God is not a creature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] Furthermore, whatever God has in Himself is His essence, as was
        shown in Book I. But, all things the Father has are the Son’s. For the
        Son Himself says: “All things whatsoever the Father has are Mine” (John
        16:15); and in John (17:10), speaking to the Father, he says: “All My
        things are Yours, and Yours are Mine.” The essence and nature, then, of
        the Father and Son is the very same. Therefore, the Son is not. a
        creature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [12] What is more, the Apostle says that the Son, before He emptied
        himself taking the form of a servant, was “in the form of God” (Phil.
        2:6-7). By the form of God, however, nothing is understood but the
        divine nature, just as by the form of the servant human nature is
        understood. The Son, then, is in the divine nature. Therefore, He is not
        a creature.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [13] Furthermore, nothing created can be equal to God. The Son, however,
        is equal to the Father. For John (5:18) says: “The Jews sought the more
        to kill Him, because He did not only break the Sabbath, but also said
        God was His Father, making Himself equal to God.” And this is the
        narrative of the Evangelist whose “testimony is true” (John 19:13;
        21:74): that Christ said He was the Son of God and the equal of God, and
        that for these things the Jews were persecuting Him. Nor is there doubt
        for any Christian that what Christ said of Himself is true, when the
        Apostle also says that He “thought it not robbery to be equal with God”
        (Phil. 2:6). The Son, therefore, is equal to the Father. He is not,
        then, a creature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [14] Moreover, in the Psalms (88:7; 82:1) we read that there is no
        likeness of anyone to God even among the angels who are called the sons
        of God. “Who,” it says, “among the sons of God shall be like God?” And
        elsewhere: “O God, who shall be like to You?” This should be understood
        of perfect likeness; which is clear from the things treated in Book I.
        But Christ showed his perfect likeness to the Father even in living, for
        John (5:26) says: “As the Father has life in Himself, so He has given to
        the Son also to have life in Himself.” Therefore, Christ is not to be
        counted among the created sons of God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [15] Furthermore, no created substance represents God in His substance,
        for, whatever be the perfection of any creature whatever that appears,
        it is less than that which God is; hence, there is no creature through
        whom we can know what-He-is about God. But the Son does represent the
        Father, for of Him the Apostle says that He “is the image of the
        invisible God” (Col. 1:15). And lest He be judged a deficient image, one
        not representing the essence of God, one through which what-He-is could
        not be known of God (thus is man called the “image of God” in 1 Cor.
        11:7); He is shown to be the perfect image, representing the very
        substance of God, when the Apostle says: “Who being the brightness of
        His glory, and the figure of His substance” (Heb. 1:3). Therefore, the
        Son is not a creature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [16] There is more. Nothing which is in a genus is the universal cause
        of those things which are in that genus. So, the universal cause of men
        is not a man for nothing is the cause of itself, but the sun which is
        outside the human genus is the universal cause of human generation, and
        beyond it God is. But, the Son is the universal cause of creatures, for
        John (1:3) says: “All things were made by Him”; and in Proverbs (8:30)
        the begotten Wisdom says: “I was with Him forming all things”; and the
        Apostle says: “In Him were all things created in heaven and on earth”
        (Col. 1:16). Therefore, He Himself is not in the genus of creatures.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [17] Similarly, it is clear from what was shown in Book II that the
        incorporeal substances that we call angels cannot be made except by
        creation, and it was also shown that no substance can create but God
        alone. But the Son of God, Jesus Christ, is the cause of the angels,
        bringing them into being, for the Apostle says: “whether thrones, or
        dominations, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by
        Him and in Him” (Col. 1:16)., Therefore, the Son Himself, is not a
        creature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [18] Furthermore, since the proper action of anything at all follows its
        very nature, a thing’s proper action is fitting to nothing to which the
        nature of that thing is not fitting; thus, what does not have the human
        species does not have the human action. Now, the proper actions of God
        belong to the Son: to create (as already shown), to contain and conserve
        all things in being; and to wipe away sins. That these are proper to God
        is clear from the foregoing. But of the Son it is said that “by Him all
        things consist” (Col. 1: 3-7); and that He upholds “all things by the
        word of His power, making purgation of sins” (Heb. 1:3). The Son of God,
        then, is of the divine nature, and is not a creature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [19] But because an Arian might say that the Son does these things not
        as a principal agent, but as an instrument of the principal agent which
        acts not by its own power but by the power of the principal agent, our
        Lord excluded this argument, saying in John (5:19): “what things soever
        the Father doth, these the Son also doth in like manner.” Then, just as
        the Father operates of Himself and by His proper power, so also does the
        Son.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [20] A still further conclusion from this saying is that virtue and
        power are identified in the Son and the Father. For He says that the Son
        works not only like the Father but the same things “in like manner.” But
        the same operation cannot be performed by two agents unless in
        dissimilarity: as the same thing done by a principal agent and its
        instrument; or, if in similarity, it must be that the agents come
        together in one power. Now, this power is sometimes collected from
        diverse powers in diverse agents, as when many men draw up a boat, for
        they all draw it up in the same way, and because the power of each is
        imperfect and insufficient for that effect, from the diverse powers is
        collected one power of them all which is sufficient for drawing up the
        boat. But, one cannot say this in the case of the Father and the Son,
        for the power of the Father is not imperfect but infinite, as was shown
        in Book I. There must, then, be numerical identity in the power of the
        Father and the Son. And since power follows nature, there must be
        numerical identity in the nature and essence of the Father and the Son.
        This also can be concluded from the things that were said earlier. For,
        if in the Son there is the divine nature (as has been shown in many
        ways), and if the divine nature cannot be multiplied as was shown in
        Book I, it follows necessarily that there is numerical identity of
        nature and essence in the Father and the Son.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [21] Again, our beatitude is ultimately in God alone, in whom alone also
        the hope of man must be placed, to whom alone also the honor of
        adoration must be given, as was shown in Book III. But our beatitude is
        in the Son of God. For He says in John (17:3): “This is eternal life:
        that they may know You,” namely, the Father, “and Jesus Christ whom You
        hast sent.” And 1 John (5:20) says of the Son that He is “true God and
        life eternal,” Now, it is certain that by the name “life eternal” the
        sacred Scripture signifies ultimate beatitude. Isaiah also says of the
        Son, as the Apostle brings out: “‘there shall be a root of Jesse, and He
        that shall rise up to rule the Gentiles, in Him the Gentiles shall hope”
        (Rom. 15:12; Isa. 11:10). It is said also in a Psalm (71:11): “And all
        the kings of the earth shall adore Him; all nations shall serve Him.”
        And John (5:23): “That all men may honour the Son, as they honour the
        Father.” And again a Psalm (96:7) says: “Adore Him, all you His angels.”
        That this is said of the Son the Apostle sets forth in Hebrews (1:6).
        Manifestly, therefore, the Son of God is true God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [22] The arguments are also valid for establishing this point which were
        previously used against Photinus to show that Christ is not made God but
        true God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [23] Taught, therefore, by those mentioned and very similar testimonies
        of sacred Scripture, the Catholic Church maintains that Christ is the
        true and natural Son of God, eternal, equal to the Father, true God,
        identical in essence and nature with the Father, begotten, not created,
        and not made.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [24] Wherefore it is clear that only in the Catholic Church does faith
        truly confess generation in God, when it relates the very generation of
        the Son to this: the Son has received the divine nature from the Father.
        But others who are heretics relate this generation to some extraneous
        nature: Photinus and Sabellius to human nature, indeed; Arius, however,
        to some created nature more worthy than all other creatures.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Arius also differs from Sabellius and Photinus in this: the former
        asserts that such generation was before the world was; the latter two
        deny that it was before the birth from the Virgin.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Sabellius nevertheless differs from Photinus in this: Sabellius
        confesses that Christ is true and natural God, but Photinus does not;
        neither does Arius. Photinus holds that He is pure man; Arius, that He
        is a kind of mixture of a certain very excellent creature both divine
        and human. The latter two, however, confess that the Person of the
        Father is other than the Person of the Son; this Sabellius denies.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [25] Therefore, the Catholic faith, keeping to the middle road, holds
        with Arius and Pbotinus against Sabellius that the Person of the Father
        is other than the Person of the Son, that the Son is begotten, but the
        Father entirely unbegotten; but with Sabellius against Photinus and
        Arius that Christ is true and natural God, the same in nature as the
        Father, although not the same in person. And from this, also, an
        indication of the Catholic truth can be gathered. For, as the
        Philosopher says, [ <i>Prior Analytics</i> II, 2] even falsehoods give
        witness, for falsehoods stand apart not only from the truth but from one
        another.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Since, however, truth cannot be truth’s contrary, it is obvious that
        the points of Scriptural truth introduced by the Arians to confirm their
        error cannot be helpful to their teaching. For, since it was shown from
        divine Scripture that the essence and divine nature of the Father and
        Son are numerically identical, and according to this each is called true
        God, it must be that the Father and Son cannot be two gods, but one God.
        For, if there were many gods, a necessary consequence would be the
        partition in each of the essence of divinity, just as in two men the
        humanity differs in number from one to the other; and the more so
        because the divine nature is not one thing and God Himself another. This
        was shown above. From this it follows necessarily that, since there
        exists one divine nature in the Father and the Son, the Father and the
        Son are one God. Therefore, although we confess that the Father is God
        and the Son God, we are not withdrawing from the teaching which sets
        down that there is one only God, which we established both by reasonings
        and by authorities in Book I. Hence, although there is one only true
        God, we confess that this is predicated of the Father and of the Son.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] When our Lord, therefore, speaking to the Father, says “that they
        may know You the only true God,” it is not so to be understood that the
        Father alone is true God, as though the Son is not true God (the
        contrary is proved clearly by Scriptural testimony); but it must be
        understood that the one sole true deity belongs to the Father, in such
        wise, nonetheless, that the Son is not excluded therefrom. Hence, it is
        significant that our Lord does not say: “that they may know the one only
        true God,” as though He alone be God, but said: “that they may know
        You,” and added “the only true God” to show that the Father, whose Son
        He insisted He was, is the God in whom one finds that only true
        divinity. And because a true son must be of the same nature as his
        father, it follows that the only true divinity belongs to the Son,
        rather than that the Son is excluded from it. Wherefore John, also, at
        the end of his first canonical Epistle (5:20)—expounding, as it were,
        these words of our Lord—attributes to the true Son each of the things
        which our Lord here says of the Father; namely, that He is true God and
        that in Him is eternal life. John says (5:20): “That we may know the
        true God, and may be in His true Son. He is the true God and life
        eternal.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        If the Son had nevertheless confessed that the Father alone is true God,
        one would not for this reason need to understand that the Son is
        excluded from true divinity. For, since the Father and Son are one God,
        as was shown, whatever is said of the Father by reason of divinity is
        the same as if it were said of the Son, and conversely. For, by reason
        of the fact that our Lord says: “No one knows the Son but the Father:
        neither does any one know the Father but the Son” (Mat. 11:27), it is
        not understood that the Father is excluded from knowledge of Himself, or
        that the Son is.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] It is also clear from this that the true divinity of the Son is not
        excluded by the words of the Apostle: “Which in His times He shall show
        who is the Blessed and only Mighty, the King of kings, and Lord of
        lords.” In these words the Father is not named, but that which is common
        to the Father and the Son. That the Son is the King of kings and Lord of
        lords is manifestly shown in the Apocalypse (19:13), which says: “He was
        clothed with a garment sprinkled with blood; and His name is called THE
        WORD OF GOD”; and adds below: “And He has on His garment and on His
        thigh written: KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS” (19:i6). Nor is the Son
        excluded from that which is added: “Who only has immortality,” since He
        also bestows immortality on those who believe in Him. Thus, John (11:
        26) says: “Who believes in Me shall not die for ever.” But what is
        added,” “Whom no man has seen, nor can see,” certainly is also suitable
        to the Son, since our Lord says: “No one knows the Son but the Father”
        (Mat. 11:27). To this it is not an objection that He appeared visibly,
        for this was according to the flesh. However, He is invisible in His
        deity just as the Father is; wherefore the Apostle says in the same
        Epistle (1 Tim. 3:16): “Evidently great is the mystery of godliness,
        which was manifested in the flesh.” Nor are we forced to understand
        these sayings of the Father alone because it is said that there must be
        one who shows and another who is shown. The Son also shows Himself, for
        He says: “He that loves Me shall be loved of My Father: and I will love
        him, and will manifest Myself to him” (John 14:21.). Accordingly, we
        also say to Him: “Shew us your face, and we shall be saved” (Ps. 79:4).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] But how the saying of our Lord, “The Father is greater than I” must
        be understood we are taught by the”Apostle. Since “greater” is referred
        to ‘lesser,” one must understand that this is said of the Son so far as
        He is lessened. Now, the Apostle shows that He is lessened by taking on
        the servile form—in such wise, however, that in the divine form He
        exists the equal of God the Father, for he says: “Who being in the form
        of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: but emptied
        Himself, taking the form of a servant” (Phil. 2:6-7). Nor is it wondrous
        if for this reason the Father be said to be greater than He, since He
        was even made lesser than the angels; the Apostle says: “We see Jesus,
        who was made a little lesser than the angels, for the suffering of
        death, crowned with glory and honour” (Heb. 2:9).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        From this it is also clear that in the same way the Son is said to be
        “subject to the Father”; namely, in His human nature. This is to be
        gathered from the very context of the expression. For the Apostle had
        already said: “For by a man came death, and by a man the resurrection of
        the dead”; and afterwards he had subjoined: “Everyone shall rise in his
        own order: the firstfruits Christ, then they that are of Christ”; and
        later he added: “Afterwards the end, when He shall have de, livered up
        the kingdom to God and the Father”; and when he has shown what sort of
        kingdom this is, namely, that things must be subject to it, he
        consequently subjoins: “When all things shall be subdued unto Him, then
        the Son also Himself shall be subject unto Him that put all things under
        Him” (1 Cor. 15:23-28). The very context of the expression, therefore,
        shows that this ought to be understood of Christ so far as He is man,
        for thus did He die and rise again. Now, in His divinity, since
        “whatever He does the Father does,” as was shown, He Himself also
        subjects all things to Himself; wherefore the Apostle says: “We look for
        the Savior, our Lord Jesus Christ, who will reform the body of our
        lowliness, made like to the body of His glory, according to the
        operation whereby also He is able to subdue all things unto Himself”
        (Phil. 3:20-21).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] From the fact that the Father is said in the Scriptures “to give!”
        to the Son—from which it follows that He “receives”—one cannot show any
        indigence in Him.” But this is required by His being the Son, for He
        could not be called Son if He were not begotten by the Father. For
        everything which is generated receives from the generator the nature of
        the generator. Therefore, by this giving of the Father to the Son is
        understood nothing but the generation of the Son in which the Father
        gave the Son His nature. This very thing can be understood from that
        which is given. For our Lord says: “That which My Father has given Me is
        greater than all” (John 10:29). But that which is greater than all is
        the divine nature, in which the Son is equal to the Father. And this our
        Lord’s very words show, for He had said before that no man should pluck
        His sheep from His hand (John 10:28-30). For proof of this He introduces
        the word stated; namely, that which is given to Him by the Father is
        greater than all, and that “out of the hand of My Father”—as He
        adds—nothing can be plucked.” From this it follows that neither can it
        be plucked from the hand of the Son. But this would not follow unless
        through that which is given to Him by the Father He were equal to the
        Father. And so, to explain this more clearly, He adds: “I and the Father
        are one.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Similarly, the Apostle also says that God “has given Him a name which is
        above all names: that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of
        those that are in heaven, on earth, and under the earth” (Phil. 2:9-10).
        But the name higher than all names which every creature venerates is
        none other than the name of divinity. By this giving, therefore, the
        generation itself is understood in which the Father gave the Son true
        divinity. The same thing is shown by His saying that “all things are
        delivered to Me by My Father” (Mat. 11:27). But all things would not be
        given to Him unless “all the fullness of the Godhead” (Col. 2:9) which
        is in the Father were in the Son.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Thus, by asserting that the Father has given to Him He therefore
        confesses that He is the true Son-against Sabellius. Yet, from the
        greatness of that which is given He confesses that He is equal to the
        Father—so Arius is confounded. Clearly, therefore, such gift-giving does
        not indicate indigence in the Son. He was not the Son before He was
        given to Himself, since His generation is the very gift-giving. Nor does
        the fullness of the given allow that He can be in need to whom this gift
        was clearly made.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Nor is this an obstacle to what has been said: that one reads in
        Scripture that the Father has given to the Son at a point in time; our
        Lord after the Resurrection, for example, says to the disciples: “All
        power has been given to Me in heaven and in earth” (Mat. 28:18); and the
        Apostle speaks of the cause for which God “exalted” Christ and “gave Him
        a name which is above all names” (Phil. 2:8-9), that is, He had become
        “obedient unto death,” as though He has not had this name from eternity.
        For it is usual of Scripture to say that some things are or are made
        when they begin to be known. Now, the fact that the Son has from
        eternity received all power and the divine name was made known to the
        world after the Resurrection by the preaching of the disciples. And
        this, too, the words of our Lord reveal. For our Lord says: “Glorify Me,
        O Father, with Thyself, with the glory which I had, before the world
        was” (John 17:5). For He asks that His glory which eternally He has
        received from the Father as God be declared to be in Him now made man.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] Now, from this it is manifest how the Son is taught, although He is
        not ignorant. For it was shown in Book II that in God to understand and
        to be are identical. Wherefore, communication of the divine nature is
        also the communication of understanding. Now, the communication of
        understanding can be called “showing” or “speech” or “teaching.” By
        reason of the fact, then, that the Son received the divine nature in His
        birth from the Father, it is said that He has “heard something from the
        Father,” or that the Father “has shown Him something,” or one reads
        something else like this in the Scriptures; but not that first the Son
        was ignorant or did not know and afterward the Father taught Him. For
        the Apostle confesses: “Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God”
        (1 Cor. 1:24). Now, it is not possible that wisdom be ignorant, nor that
        power be feeble.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] The saying also, then, “the Son cannot do anything of Himself,’”
        does not point to any Weakness of action in the Son. But, because for
        God to act is not other than to be, and His action is not other than His
        essence, as was proved above, so one says that the Son cannot act from
        Himself but only from the Father, just as He is not able to be from
        Himself but only from the Father. For, if He were from Himself, He would
        no longer be the Son. Therefore, just as the Son cannot not be the Son,
        so neither can He act of Himself. However, because the Son receives the
        same nature as the Father and, consequently, the same power, although
        the Son neither is of Himself nor operates of Himself, He nevertheless
        is through Himself and operates through Himself, since just as He is
        through His own nature received from the Father, so He operates through
        His own nature received from the Father. Hence, after our Lord had said:
        “the Son cannot do anything of Himself,” to show that, although the Son
        does not operate of Himself, He does operate through Himself, He adds:
        “Whatever He does”—namely, the Father—“these the Son does likewise.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] From the foregoing it also is clear how “the Father commands the
        Son” or “the Son obeys the Father” or “the Son prays to the Father” or
        “is sent by the Father.” For, all these things are suitable to the Son
        inasmuch as He is subject to the Father. And this is only according to
        the humanity He has assumed, as was shown. The Father, therefore,
        commands the Son as subject to Him in His human nature. The very words
        of our Lord make this clear. For, when our Lord says “that the world may
        know that I love the Father: and as the Father has given Me commandment,
        so do I,” (John 24:31), what the commandment is is shown by what is
        added: “Arise, let us go hence.” He said this approaching His passion.
        But the commandment to suffer clearly pertains to the Son only in His
        human nature. In the same way, where He says: “If you keep My
        commandments, you shall abide in My love; as I also have kept My
        Father’s commandments, and do abide in His love,” (John 15:10), these
        precepts clearly pertain to the Son as He is loved by the Father as man;
        just as He loved His disciples as men.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        That the Father’s commandments to the Son must be understood as
        pertaining to the human nature assumed by the Son is shown by the
        Apostle. He calls the Son obedient to the Father in the things which
        belong to His human nature, for he says: “He humbled himself, becoming
        obedient unto death, even to the death of the cross” (Phil. 2:8). The
        Apostle also shows that praying belongs to the Son in His human nature,
        for he says: “Who in the days of His flesh, with a strong cry and tears,
        offering up prayers and supplications to Him that was able to save Him
        from death, was heard for His reverence” (Heb. 5:7). The way in which He
        “was sent” by the Father is also shown by the Apostle. “God sent His
        Son, made of a woman” (Gal. 4:4). He is, therefore, said to be sent in
        that He was made of a woman, and certainly this belongs to Him in the
        flesh He has assumed. Clearly, then, in none of these can it be shown
        that the Son is subject to the Father except in His human nature. For
        all that, one should recognize that the Son is said to be sent by the
        Father invisibly and as divine, without prejudice to His equality to the
        Father, as will he shown below when we deal with the sending of the Holy
        Spirit.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] It is clear, and in the same way, that from the fact that “the Son
        is glorified by the Father” or “raised up” or “exalted” one cannot show
        that the Son is less than the Father except in His human nature. For,
        the Son needs no glory as one who receives new glory, since He professes
        that He had it “before the world was” (John 17:5). But His glory, hidden
        under the weakness of the flesh, necessarily had to be manifested by the
        glorification of the flesh, and the working of miracles, in the faith of
        peoples believing. Hence, of His glory being hidden, Isaiah (53:3) says:
        “His look was as it were hidden and despised, whereupon we esteemed him
        not.” And the way in which Christ was raised up is like the way He s ere
        and died, that is, in the flesh. For it says in 1 Peter (4:1): “Christ
        having suffered in the flesh, be you also armed with the same thought.”
        To be exalted also became Him in the way in which He was humiliated, for
        the Apostle says: “He humbled Himself, becoming obedient unto death....
        For which cause God also has exalted Him” (Phil. 2:8-9).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [12] Thus, then, the fact that the Father glorifies, raises up, and
        exalts the Son does not show that the Son is less than the Father,
        except in His human nature. For, in the divine nature by which He is
        equal to the Father, the power of the Father and the Son is the same and
        their operation is the same. Hence, the Son Himself exalts Himself by
        His own power, as the Psalmist says: “Be Thou. exalted, O Lord, in your
        own strength” (Ps. 70:14). He Himself raises Himself up, because He says
        of Himself: “I have power to lay down My life, and I have power to take
        it up again!” (John 10:18). He also glorifies not Himself alone, but the
        Father as well, for in John (17:1) He says: “Glorify your Son, that your
        Son may glorify You.” This is not because the Father is hidden by the
        veil of flesh He has assumed, but by the invisibility of His nature. In
        this way the Son also is hidden according to the divine nature, for
        common to both Father and Son is the saying of Isaiah (45:35): “Verily
        You are a bidden God, the God of Israel, the savior.” The Son, of
        course, glorifies the Father, not by giving Him glory, but by
        manifesting Him to the world; for He Himself says in the same place: “I
        have manifested your name to men” (John 17:6).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [13] One must not, however, believe that in the Son of God there is any
        failure of power, since He Himself says: “All power is given to Me in
        heaven and in earth” (Mat. 28:18). Hence, His own saying, “To sit on My
        right or left hand is not Mine to give to you, but to those for whom it
        is prepared by My Father” (cf. Mat. 20:23), does not show that the Son
        lacks the power of distribution over the seats of heaven, since by
        seating of this kind one understands participation in eternal life, and
        that its bestowal belongs to Him He shows when He says: “My sheep hear
        My voice: and I know them, and they follow Me. And I give them life
        everlasting” (John 10: 27). One reads also: “The Father has given all
        judgment to the Son” (John 5:22); and it does belong to judgment that
        some are to be established in heavenly glory according to their merits.
        Hence, we read that the Son of Man “shall set the sheep on His right
        hand, but the goats on His left” (Mat. 25:33). It does, then, belong to
        the Son’s power to set someone on His. right hand or His left. This is
        true if each of these acts refers to differing participation in glory,
        or if the one refers to glory and the other to punishment. Therefore,
        one must take the meaning of the sentence proposed (Mat. 20: 23) from
        what went before it Now, this is what went before it (Mat. 20:20-21):
        The mother of the sons of Zebedee had approached Jesus to ask Him that
        one of her sons should sit at His right hand and the other at His left.
        She seems to have been stimulated to this request by a certain
        confidence in her close blood relationship to the man, Christ. Our Lord,
        then, in His answer did not say that it did not belong to His power to
        give what was asked, but that it did not belong to Him to give it to
        those for whom it was asked. For He did not say: “To sit on My right
        hand or My left is not Mine to give anyone.” Indeed, He shows rather
        that it is His to give to “those for whom it is prepared” by His Father.
        For to give this was not proper to Him as the Son of the Virgin, but as
        the Son of God. Accordingly, this favor was not His to give to some just
        because they belonged to Him in so far as He was the Virgin’s Son, that
        is, in close blood relationship. It was His to give to those who
        belonged to Him as the Son of God; namely, to those for whom it had been
        prepared by the Father through eternal predestination. But, that this
        very preparation is included in the power of the Son, our Lord Himself
        indicates, saying: “In My Father’s house there are many mansions. If
        not, I would have told you: because I go to prepare a place for you”
        (John 14:2). The many mansions are the different grades of participation
        in beatitude, which in predestination God has eternally prepared. When,
        therefore, our Lord says: “If not,” that is, if there were a deficiency
        of mansions prepared for the men who are to enter into beatitude, and
        adds: “I would have told you: because I go to prepare a place for you,”
        He is showing that preparation of this sort belongs to His power.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [14] Nor, again, can it be understood that the Son is ignorant of the
        hour of His coming, since in Him “are hid all the treasures of wisdom
        and knowledge” (Col. 7:3), as the Apostle says, and since He knows
        perfectly that which is greater; namely, the Father (Mat. 11:27). But
        one must understand here that the Son, set as a man among men,
        considered Himself as ignoring something so long as He did not reveal it
        to His disciples. For it is usual in Scripture to say that God knows
        something if He makes someone know it; so we find in Genesis (22:12):
        “Now I know that you feart God,” that is, “now I have made men begin to
        know it.” Thus, conversely, the Son is said not to know that which He
        does not make us know.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [15] Sorrow, of course, and fear, and other things of this sort
        manifestly belong to Christ so far as He is man. Hence, one cannot
        apprehend in this fact any lessening of the divinity of the Son.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [16] Consider, now, the saying that wisdom “is created.” First of all,
        one can understand it not of the Wisdom which is the Son of God, but of
        the wisdom which God bestowed on creatures. For one reads in Sirach
        (1:9-10): “He created her,” namely, wisdom, “in the Holy Spirit.... and
        He poured her out upon all His works.” One can also refer this to the
        created nature assumed by the Son. Then the meaning is: “From the
        beginning, and before the world, was I created” (Sirach 24:14); that is,
        “I was foreseen in union with a creature.” Or it may be that Wisdom is
        named (cf. Prov. 8:24-25), since both “created” and “begotten” suggest
        to us the mode of divine generation. For in generation the begotten
        receives the nature of him who begets, and this is a mark of perfection.
        But, in the generations which take place among us, he who begets is
        himself changed, and this is a mark of imperfection. In creation, on the
        other hand, the creator is not changed, but the created does not receive
        the nature of the creator. Therefore, the Son is called “created” and
        “begotten” at the very same time, that from creation one may gather the
        immutability of the Father, and from generation the unity of nature in
        the Father and the Son. It was thus that the Synod expounded the meaning
        of this sort of Scriptural expression. Hilary makes this clear [
        <i>De synodis</i>, 17-18].
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [17] However, that the Son is called the “first-born of every creature”
        is not because the Son is in the order of creatures, but because the Son
        both is from the Father and receives from the Father, from whom
        creatures both are and receive. But the Son receives from the Father the
        very same nature; creatures do not. Hence, the Son is not called merely
        “first begotten,” but “only-begotten” as well (John 1:18), by reason of
        His unique manner of receiving from the Father.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [18] Now, our Lord says to the Father about the disciples: “that they
        may be one, as We also are one” (John 17:22). This only shows that the
        Father and Son are one in the way in which the disciples should be one,
        namely, through love. Nevertheless, this mode of union does not exclude
        unity of essence; rather, it points to it, for John (3:35) says. “The
        Father loves the Son: and He has given all things into His hand.” By
        this is the fullness of divinity shown to be in the Son, as was said.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [19] Thus, then, it is clear that the testimonies of the Scriptures
        which the Arians were taking for themselves are not hostile to the truth
        which the Catholic faith maintains.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From these considerations, of course, it appears that the points
        from Scripture which both Photinus and Sabellius used to bring up in
        support of their opinions cannot confirm their errors.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] For what our Lord says after the resurrection, “All power has been
        given to Me in heaven and in earth” (Mat. 2-8: 18), is not said for this
        reason: that at that time He had newly received this power; but for this
        reason: that the power which the Son of God had eternally received
        had—because of the victory He had had over death by resurrection—begun
        to appear in the same Son made man.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Now, as to the Apostle’s word concerning the Son, “Who was made to
        Him of the seed of David” (Rom. 1:3), one sees clearly how it should be
        understood from the addition: “according to the flesh.” For he did not
        say that the Son of God had been made simply, but that He had been made
        of the seed of David, according to the flesh,” by the assumption of
        human nature as John (1:14) puts it: “The Word was made flesh.” Hence,
        also, the following phrase—“Who was predestinated the Son of God in
        power”—clearly refers to the Son in His human nature. For, that a human
        nature he united to the Son of God, that thus a man could be called the
        Son of God, was not a matter of human merit. It was by the grace of
        God’s predestination.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] In a, similar fashion, what the Apostle says in Philippians, “God
        exalted Christ through the merit of His passion,” must be referred to
        the human nature; the humility of the passion was in this human nature.
        Hence, also, what follows—“He has given Him a name which is above all
        names”— must be referred to this: the name belonging to the Son in His
        eternal birth had to be manifested in the peoples’ faith as belonging to
        the incarnate Son.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] In this way it also is plain that what Peter says, “God has made
        both Lord and Christ, this same Jesus,” (Acts 2:36), must be referred to
        the Son in His human nature; in which He began to have temporally what
        He had in the nature of divinity eternally.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] The point which Sabellius introduces on the unity of the
        Deity—“Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God is one Lord” and “See that I
        alone am, and there is no other God besides Me”—is not hostile to the
        teaching of the Catholic faith, which holds that the Father and the Son
        are not two gods, but one God, as we said before.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] In the same way, the sayings, “ne Father who abides in Me, He doth
        the works,” and “I am in the Father and the Father in Me,” do not show a
        unity of person, as Sabellius chose to understand, but that unity of
        essence which Arius denied. For, if there were one person of the Father
        and the Son, one could not say suitably that the Father is in the Son
        and the Son in the Father, since properly the same supposit is not said
        to be in its very self; this is said only with reference to its parts.
        For, seeing that parts are in a whole, and that what is proper to parts
        can be attributed to a whole, sometimes a whole is said to he in itself.
        But this manner of speech does not suit speech about divinity, in which
        there can be no parts, as was shown in Book I. It remains true, then,
        that, when the Father is said to be in the Son and the Son in the
        Father, the Father and Son are not identical in supposit. One can see
        from this that the essence of the Father and the Son is one. For, once
        this is given, it is very clear in what way the Father is in the Son and
        the Son in the Father. For, since the Father is His essence, because in
        God essence is not other than what has essence, as we showed in Book I,
        it follows that in anything in which the essence of the Father is the
        Father is; and by the same reasoning in anything in which the essence of
        the Son is the Son is. Hence, since the essence of the Father is in the
        Son and the essence of the Son in the Father, because the essence of
        each of the two is one essence (as the Catholic faith teaches), it
        clearly follows that the Father is in the Son and the Son in the Father.
        Thus, the selfsame saying (John 14:11) confutes the error of Sabellius
        as well as that of Arius.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] When all things are carefully considered, it is clear and manifest
        that sacred Scripture proposes this for belief about the divine
        generation: that the Father and Son, although distinguished as persons,
        are nevertheless one God and have one essence or nature. But one finds
        this far removed from the nature of creatures: that any two be
        distinguished in supposit, yet one in their essence; so, human reason,
        proceeding from the properties of things, experiences difficulties in a
        great variety of ways in this secret of divine generation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2.] Since the generation known to us is a certain mutation to which
        corruption is opposed, it seems hard to put generation in God, who is
        immutable, incorruptible, and eternal, as is clear from the foregoing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] If generation, moreover, is a change, whatever is generated must be
        changeable. But what is changed goes from potency to act, for “change is
        the act of the potential as such.” If, therefore, the Son of God is
        begotten, He is not eternal, it seems, as one going from potency to act;
        nor is He true God, since He is not pure act, but something which has
        potentiality.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] The begotten, furthermore, receives its nature from the generator.
        If, then, the Son is begotten by the Father, it follows that He has
        received the nature which He has from the Father. But it is not possible
        that He has received from the Father a nature numerically other than the
        Father has, but the same in species, as happens in univocal generations,
        when man generates man, or fire, fire. For we showed above the
        impossibility of a numerical plurality of deities. It seems equally
        impossible that He has received nature numerically the same as the
        Father has. For, if He receives a part of it, it follows that the divine
        nature is divisible; but, if the whole is transfused into the Son, it
        ceases to be in the Father; and so, in generation, the Father is
        corrupted. Nor, again, can it be said that by a kind of exuberance the
        divine nature flows from the Father to the Son, as the water of a spring
        flows into a stream and the spring is not emptied, for the divine nature
        cannot be divided, just as it cannot be increased. It seems, therefore,
        to remain that the Son has received from the Father a nature which is
        neither in number nor in species the same as the Father’s, but of
        another genus altogether. This is what happens in equivocal generation
        when animals born of putrefaction are generated by the power of the sun,
        but do not belong to its species. It follows, then, that the Son of God
        is neither a true Son, since the Father’s species is not His; nor true
        God, since He does not receive the divine nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] If the Son, again, receives a nature from God the Father, the
        recipient in Him must be other than the nature received, for nothing
        receives itself. The Son, then, is not His own essence or nature.
        Therefore, He is not true God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Moreover, let the Son be not other than the divine essence; let the
        divine essence be something subsistent, as was proved in Book I;
        clearly, the Father, also, is the divine essence. The conclusion appears
        to be that the Father and Son coincide in the very same subsisting
        thing. Now, “the subsistent thing in intellectual natures is called a
        person.” It follows, then, that if the Son is Himself the divine essence
        the Father and the Son coincide in person. But if the Son is not the
        very divine essence He is not true God. For we proved this about God in
        Book I. It seems, therefore, either that the Son was not true God, as
        Arius used to say, or that personally He is not other than the Father,
        as Sabellius asserted.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Furthermore, that in a thing which is the principle of its
        individuation cannot possibly be in a second thing distinguished as a
        supposit from the first. For what is in many is not a principle of
        individuation. But the essence of God is that by which God is
        individuated, for the essence of God is not a form in matter so that God
        could be individuated by matter. There is, therefore, nothing in God the
        Father by which He might be individuated except His essence. Therefore,
        His essence cannot be in any other supposit. His essence, therefore, is
        not in the Son, and so the Son is not true God, following Arius; or the
        Son is not other in supposit than the Father, and so the Person of each
        is the same, following Sabellius.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] Again, if the Father and Son are two supposits or two Persons, yet
        are one in essence, there must be in them something other than the
        essence by which they are distinguished, for a common essence is
        ascribed to each and what is common cannot be a distinguishing
        principle. Therefore, that which distinguishes the Father from the Son
        must be other than the divine essence. The Person of the Son, then, is a
        composite of two, and so is the Person of the Father a composite of two:
        the common essence and the distinguishing principle. Therefore, each of
        the two is a composite and neither of the two is true God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] But one may say that they are distinguished by a relation only,
        inasmuch as one is the Father, the other the Son. What is predicated
        relatively, however, seems not to predicate a something in that of which
        it is said, but rather a to something. Thus, by such predication no
        composition is brought in. But this answer appears not adequate for
        avoiding the awkward results just mentioned.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] For there can be no relation without something absolute. In
        whatever is relative there must be understood that which is said of
        itself (<i>ad se</i>) and, additionally, that which is said referring to
        another (<i>ad aliud</i>). Thus is something said absolutely of
        “servant” and, additionally, something is said referring “to the
        master.” Therefore, that relation by which the Father and the Son are
        distinguished must have something absolute on which it is founded. Now,
        then, either that absolute is one only, or there are two absolutes. If
        it is one only, a twofold relation cannot be founded upon it, unless, of
        course, it be a relation of identity which can produce no distinction-as
        when one says that the same is the same as the same. Therefore, if the
        relation be such that it calls for a distinction, there must be a prior
        understanding of a distinction of absolutes. Accordingly, it does not
        seem possible that the Persons of the Father and the Son are
        distinguished by relations only.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] One ought, along the same line, to say that the relation which
        distinguishes the Son from the Father either is a thing or is in the
        intellect alone. Let it, then, be a thing, and it seems not to be that
        thing which is the divine essence, since the divine essence is common to
        the Father and the Son. Therefore, in the Son there will be something
        which is not His essence. Thus, He is not true God, for we showed in
        Book I that there is nothing in God which is not His essence. But let
        that relation be in the intellect only, and it cannot, then, distinguish
        the Son from the Father personally, for things which are personally
        distinguished must be really distinguished.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [12] Again, every relative depends on its correlative. But what depends
        on another is not true God. If, then, the persons of the Father and the
        Son are distinguished by relations, neither of them is true God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [13] If the Father, moreover, is God and the Son is God, this name “God”
        ought to be predicated substantially of the Father and the Son, since
        divinity cannot be an accident.” But a substantial predicate is truly
        that of which it is predicated. For, when one says “Man is animal,” what
        is truly man is animal; in the same way, when one says “Socrates is
        man,” what is truly Socrates is man. And from this there seems to follow
        the impossibility of discovering a plurality on the part of the subjects
        when there is unity on the part of the substantial predicate: Socrates
        and Plato are not one man, although they are one in humanity. Nor are
        man and ass one animal, although they are one in animal. Therefore, if
        the Father and the Son are two Persons, it seems impossible that they
        are one God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [14] Opposed predicates, furthermore, show a plurality in that of which
        they are predicated. But opposites are predicated of God the Father and
        of God the Son. The Father is God unbegotten and generating, but the Son
        is God begotten. Therefore, it does not seem possible that the Father
        and Son are one God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [15] These, then, and others like these are the arguments by which some
        whose will it is to measure divine mysteries by their own reason strive
        to attack divine generation. But, because truth is strong in itself and
        is overcome by no attack, it must be our intention to show that the
        truth of faith cannot he overcome by reason.

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] As starting point for this intention, one must take this: Following
        a diversity of natures, one finds a diverse manner of emanation in
        things, and, the higher a nature is, the more intimate to the nature is
        that which flows from it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] For, in all things, inanimate bodies have the lowest place. There
        can be no emanations in these except by the action of some one upon
        another one. For this is the way in which fire is generated by fire,
        when an extraneous body is changed by the fire and is brought to the
        quality and species of fire.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Among animate bodies the next place is held by the plants, and in
        these the emanation does proceed somewhat from what is within: to the
        extent, namely, that the internal humor of the plant is converted into
        seed and that the seed committed to the soil grows into a plant. Here,
        then, one has already found the first grade of life, for living things
        are those which move themselves to action, but those which can move only
        things external to them are entirely devoid of life. And in plants this
        is the mark of life: that which is within, them moves toward some form.
        The life of plants is nevertheless imperfect; this is because, although
        the emanation in plants proceeds from what is within, what comes forth
        little by little in the emanation is, at the end, found to be entirely
        external. For the humor first emerging from the tree becomes a blossom,
        and at length a fruit distinct from the tree’s bark, yet still fastened
        to it. But, when the fruit is perfected, it is separated from the tree
        altogether; it falls to the ground and its seeding power produces
        another plant. If one also considers this carefully, he will see that
        originally this emanation comes from what is external, for the internal
        humor of the tree is taken through the roots from the soil from which
        the plant receives nourishment.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Beyond the life of plants one finds a higher grade of life: that of
        the sensitive soul. Its emanation may have an external beginning, but
        has an internal termination, and, the more fully the emanation proceeds,
        the more it reaches what is within. For the exterior sensible impresses
        its form on the exterior senses; from these it proceeds to the
        imagination and, further, to the storehouse of the memory. Nevertheless,
        in each step of this emanation the principle and the term refer to
        different things; no sensitive power reflects upon itself. This grade of
        life, then, is higher than the life of plants—higher to the extent that
        its operation takes place within the principles which are within; it is,
        nevertheless, not an entirely perfect life, since the emanation is
        always from some first to some second.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] That, then, is the supreme and perfect grade of life which is in the
        intellect, for the intellect reflects upon itself and the intellect can
        understand itself. But even in the intellectual life one finds diverse
        grades. For the human intellect, although it can know itself, does
        indeed take the first beginning of its knowledge from without, because
        it cannot understand without a phantasm, as is clear from the things
        said before. There is, therefore, a more perfect intellectual life in
        the angels. In them the intellect does not proceed to self-knowledge
        from anything exterior, but knows itself through itself. Nonetheless, it
        is not the ultimate perfection to which their life belongs. The reason
        is this: Although the intention understood is entirely intrinsic to
        them, the very intention understood is not their substance, for in them
        understanding is not identified with being (as is clear from the
        foregoing). Therefore, the ultimate perfection of life belongs to God,
        in whom understanding is not other than being, as has been shown;
        accordingly, the intention understood in God must be the divine essence
        itself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Now, I mean by the “intention understood” what the intellect
        conceives in itself of the thing understood. To be sure, in us this is
        neither the thing which is understood nor is it the very substance of
        the intellect. But it is a certain likeness of the thing understood
        conceived in the intellect, and which the exterior words signify. So,
        the intention itself is named the “interior word” which is signified by
        the exterior word. Indeed, that the intention aforesaid is not within us
        the thing understood is clear from this: It is one thing to understand a
        thing, and another to understand the intention itself, yet the intellect
        does so when it reflects on its own work; accordingly, some sciences are
        about things, and others are about intentions understood. Now, that the
        intention understood is not the very intellect within us is clear from
        this: The act of being of the intention understood consists in its very
        being understood; the being of our intellect does not so consist; its
        being is not its act of understanding.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Since in God, therefore, being and understanding are identical, the
        intention understood in Him is His very intellect. And because
        understanding in Him is the thing understood (for by understanding
        Himself He understands all other things, as was shown in Book I), it
        follows that in God, because He understands Himself, the intellect, the
        thing understood, and the intention understood are all identical.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] From these considerations, then, we can somehow conceive how divine
        generation is to be taken. For, it is clearly impossible that divine
        generation is to be taken as one finds generation in inanimate things
        wherein the generating thing impresses its species on an exterior
        matter. For, as the faith sets down, the Son begotten by the Father must
        have true deity and be true God. But deity is not a form inhering in
        matter, nor is God a form existing out of matter, as was proved in Book
        I. In the same way, divine generation cannot be taken in the mode of the
        generation one finds in plants, and even in animals which have nutritive
        and generative powers in common with plants. For something which was in
        the plant or the animal is separated from it for the generation of one
        like it in species, and this, at the term of generation, is entirely
        outside the generator. But, since God is indivisible, nothing can be
        separated from Him. The very Son begotten by the Father is not outside
        the Father, but in Him (which is clear from the authorities cited
        above). Neither can one understand divine generation in the manner of
        emanation found in the sensitive soul. For, God does not receive from
        something exterior so as to able to influence some second thing, He
        would not then be the primary agent. Nor are the operations of the
        sensitive soul completed without bodily instruments. But, God is
        manifestly incorporeal. We are, therefore, left to understand the divine
        generation according to an intellectual emanation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] This should be made clear in the following way. It is manifest, on
        the basis of Book I, that God understands Himself. Now, whatever is
        understood should, as understood, be in him who understands, for the
        significance of the very act of understanding is this: the grasping of
        that which is understood by an intellect; hence, even our intellect
        understanding itself is within itself, not only as identified with
        itself by its essence, but also as grasped by itself in the act of
        understanding. God, therefore, must be in Himself as the thing
        understood in him who understands. But, the thing understood is in him
        who understands the intention understood and the word. There is,
        therefore, in God understanding Himself the Word of God, as it were, God
        understood; so the intellect’s word of the stone is the stone
        understood. And to this point is the saying in John (1:1): “The Word was
        with God.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] The divine intellect, of course, since it does not pass from
        potency to act, but is always actually existent (which was proved in
        Book I), must necessarily have always understood itself. And from its
        understanding of itself it follows that the Word of that intellect is in
        it; this has been shown. Therefore, His Word necessarily always existed
        in God. His Word, then, is co-eternal with God, and is not acquired by
        Him in time, as our intellect acquires in time its interiorly conceived
        word which is the intention understood. Hence is the saying in John
        (1:1): “In the beginning was the Word.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] Now, since the divine intellect is not only always in act, but is
        itself pure act, as we proved in Book I, the substance of the divine
        intellect must be its very act of understanding, and this is the act of
        the intellect. But the being of the Word interiorly conceived, or
        intention understood, is the very act of being understood. Therefore,
        the being of the divine Word is identical with that of the divine
        intellect and, consequently, with that of God, who is His own intellect.
        The being of God, of course, is His essence or nature, which is the same
        as God Himself, as was shown in Book I. The Word of God, therefore, is
        the divine being and His essence, and is true God Himself. Of course,
        such is not the case with the word of the human intellect. For, when our
        intellect understands itself, the being of the intellect is one being,
        and that of its act of understanding another, for the substance of the
        intellect was in potency to understanding before it actually understood.
        Consequently, the being of the intention understood is one being and
        that of the intellect itself is another being, since the being of the
        intention understood is the very being understood. Necessarily, then, in
        a man understanding himself, the word interiorly conceived is not a true
        man having the natural being of man, but is only man understood, a kind
        of likeness, as it were, of the true man which the intellect grasps. But
        the Word of God, precisely because He is God understood, is true God,
        having the divine being naturally, because the natural being of God is
        not one being and that of His understanding another, as was said. This
        is why it says in John (1:1): “God was the Word.” The fact that this is
        said absolutely shows that the Word of God must be understood to be true
        God. For the word of man could not be called “man” simply and
        absolutely, but relatively: namely, “man understood”; hence, this would
        be false: “ man is a word”; but this can be true: “man understood is a
        word.” When, therefore, this is said: “God was the Word,” this is shown:
        The divine Word is not merely an intention understood, as our word is,
        but it is also a thing existing and subsisting in nature. For God is a
        true subsistent thing, since His is substantial being in the highest
        degree.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [12] But the nature of God is not in the Word of God thus: it is one in
        species and differs in number. The way in which the Word has the nature
        of God is the way in which God’s act of understanding is His very being,
        as was said. Now, the act of understanding is the divine being itself.
        The Word, therefore, has the divine essence itself; has it with an
        identity not only of species but of number.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        A nature, again, which is one in species, is not divided into a
        numerical many except by reason of matter. But the divine nature is
        entirely immaterial. It is, therefore, impossible that the divine nature
        be specifically one and numerically different. The Word of God,
        therefore, has a nature in common with God and has it with numerical
        identity. For this reason the Word of God and the God whose Word He is
        are not two gods, but one God. For the fact that among us two who have
        human nature are two men hinges on the fact that human nature is
        numerically divided in those two. But we showed in Book II that things
        which are divided in creatures are in God simply one being; thus, in
        creatures the essence is one thing and the act of being another; and in
        some creatures even what subsists in the essence is one thing, and its
        essence or nature another; for this man is neither his humanity nor his
        act of being. But God is both His essence and His act of being.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [13] And although in God these are most truly one, there is still in God
        whatever belongs to the notion of a subsistent, or of essence, or of
        being itself: for it is suitable to Him that He should not be in
        something, in that He is subsistent; that He be what He is, in that He
        is essence; and that He be in act, by reason of His act of being.
        Therefore, since in God the one understanding, the act of understanding,
        and the intention understood are the same as His own Word, there must
        most truly be in God that which belongs to the notion of the one
        understanding, that which belongs to the notion of the act of
        understanding, and that which belongs to the notion of the intention
        understood, or word. But in the essence of interior word which is the
        intention understood there is this: that it proceeds from the one
        understanding in accord with his act of understanding, since it is, so
        to say, the intellectual term of the operation. For, in the act of
        understanding, the intellect conceives and forms the intention or the
        essence understood, and this is the interior word. From God, therefore,
        in His very act of understanding must His Word proceed. The Word of God
        is, therefore, compared to God understanding (whose Word He is) as to
        Him from whom He is, for this is essential to a word. Therefore,
        although in God the one understanding, the act of understanding and the
        intention understood, or Word, are by essence one, and although for this
        reason each is necessarily God, there remains the distinction of
        relation alone, in so far as the Word is related to the one who
        conceives as to Him from whom He is. This is why the Evangelist, seeing
        that he had said: “God was the Word,” to keep one from understanding
        that all distinction between the Word and God speaking or conceiving the
        Word was taken away, added this: “This was in the beginning with God”;
        as though to say: “This Word, whom I have called God, is in a way
        distinct from God speaking, and so it can be said that He was with God.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [14] Of course, the word interiorly conceived is a kind of account and
        likeness of the thing understood. Now, a likeness of one thing existing
        in another is essentially an exemplar if it stands to the other as
        principle, or it is essentially an image if it is related to that whose
        likeness it is as to a principle. Now, in our intellect one sees an
        example of each of these situations. For, since the likeness of the
        artefact existing in the mind of the artist is the principle of the
        operation which constitutes the artefact, the likeness is related to the
        artefact as an exemplar to that exemplified; but the likeness of a
        natural thing conceived in our intellect is related to the thing whose
        likeness it is as to its beginning, for our act of understanding takes
        its beginning from the senses which are changed by natural things.
        Since, of course, God understands both Himself and other things, as was
        shown in Book I, His act of understanding is the principle of things
        understood by Him, since they are caused by His intellect and will; but
        His act of understanding is referred to the intelligible which He
        Himself is as to a beginning, for this intelligible is identified with
        the intellect understanding, whose emanation, so to say, is the Word
        conceived. Therefore, the Word of God must be referred to the other
        things understood by God as exemplar, and must be referred to God
        Himself whose Word He is as image. Hence, one reads of the Word of God
        in Colossians (1:15) that He is “the image of the invisible God.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [15] Now, there is a difference between intellect and sense, for sense
        grasps a thing in its exterior accidents, which are color, taste,
        quantity and others of this kind, but intellect enters into what is
        interior to the thing. And, since every knowledge is perfected by the
        likeness between the knower and the known, there must be in the sense a
        likeness of the thing in its sensible accidents, but in the intellect
        there must be a likeness of the thing understood in its essence.
        Therefore, the word conceived in the intellect is the image or the
        exemplar of the substance of the thing understood. Since, then, the Word
        of God is the image of God (as we have shown), it is necessarily the
        image of God in His essence. Hence, we have what the Apostle says, that
        He is “the figure of the substance of God” (Heb. 1:3).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [16] However, things have images of two kinds. For there is an image
        which does not share the nature with that whose image it is: whether it
        be its image in respect to the exterior accidents (a bronze statue is
        the image of a man, yet is not, for all that, a man); or if it be an
        image in respect of the thing’s substance, for the essence of man in the
        intellect is not a man. The reason, as the Philosopher says, is that “it
        is not the stone which is present in the soul, but the species of the
        stone.” But the image of a thing which has the same nature with that
        whose image it is is like the son of a king: in him the image of his
        father appears and he is the same in nature as his father. Now, it was
        shown that the Word of God is the image of the speaker in respect of His
        very essence and that the Word has the very nature in common with the
        speaker. The conclusion, therefore, is that the Word of God is not only
        the image, but also the Son. For so to be one’s image as to be of the
        same nature with him is not discovered in one who cannot be called a
        son-so long as we are speaking of living things. For that which proceeds
        from a living thing in the likeness of species is called son. Hence, we
        read in a Psalm (2:7): “The Lord bath said to Me: You are My Son.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [17] Consideration must, furthermore, be given to this: Since in any
        nature the procession of the son from the father is natural, from the
        fact that the Word of God is called the Son of God He must proceed
        naturally from the Father. This is in agreement with the things said
        above, as one can perceive from what takes place in our intellect. For
        our intellect knows some things naturally; thus the first principles of
        the intelligibles, whose intelligible conceptions—called interior
        words—naturally exist in the intellect and proceed from it. There are
        also certain intelligibles which our intellect does not know naturally;
        rather, it arrives at the knowledge of these by reasoning. The
        conceptions of these last do not exist in our intellect naturally, but
        are sought after by study. Manifestly, however, God understands Himself
        naturally just as He is naturally. For His act of understanding is His
        being (as was proved in Book I). Therefore, the Word of God
        understanding Himself naturally proceeds from Him. And, since the Word
        of God is of the same nature as God speaking and His likeness, this
        follows: This natural proceeding is unto a likeness of Him from whom He
        does proceed with identity of nature. But, this is the essential of true
        generation in living things: that which is generated proceeds from him
        who generates as his likeness, and as identified with him in nature.
        Therefore, the Word of God is truly begotten by God speaking the Word;
        and His proceeding can be called “generation” or “birth.” This is why
        the Psalmist says: “This day have I begotten You” (Ps. 7:7); that is, in
        eternity which always is present and in which essentially there is
        neither past nor future. In this way the falsity of what the Arians
        maintained is clear, that the Father generated the Son by His will. For
        things which are by will are not natural things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [18] One must also consider that what is generated, so long as it
        remains in the generator, is said to be “conceived.” But the Word of God
        is begotten by God in such wise that it does not withdraw from Him, but
        abides in Him. (This is clear from the above.) Rightly, therefore, the
        Word of God can be called “conceived” by God. Hence, the Wisdom of God
        says in Proverbs (8:24): “The depths were not as yet, and I was already
        conceived.” But there is a difference between the conception of the Word
        of God and the material conception discovered by us in animals. For the
        offspring, so long as it is conceived and is inclosed in the womb, does
        not have its final perfection so as to subsist of itself in a place
        distinct from the one generating; hence, in the corporeal generation of
        animals, the conception of the offspring begotten is necessarily one
        thing and the delivery another; in the latter the offspring begotten is
        even spatially separated from the generator when it proceeds from the
        womb. Now, the Word of God existing in God Himself speaking the Word is
        perfect, subsists in Himself, and is distinct from God speaking: for one
        does not look for a local distinction there, but they are distinguished
        only by a relation as was said. Therefore, in the generation of the Word
        of God conception and delivery are identified. Therefore, after this
        saying from the mouth of Wisdom, “I was already conceived,” there is
        shortly added: “Before the hills I was brought forth” (Prov. 8:24-25).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        However, since in corporeal things conception and bearing involve
        motion, in these things there must be a certain succession: the term of
        conception is the being of the conceived in the one conceiving, the term
        of bearing is the being of the one born apart from the parent. Thus, in
        corporeal things, that which is conceived is necessarily not yet in
        being and that which is brought forth is in the bearing not distinct
        from the parent. Now, the conception and birth of an intelligible word
        involves neither motion nor succession. Hence, at once it is conceived
        and it is; at once it is bom and is distinct; just as that which is
        illuminated, at the moment of being illuminated, is illuminated because
        in illumination there is no succession. Since one discovers this
        situation in our intelligible word, by so much the more is it proper to
        the Word of God—not only because the intelligible conception is also
        birth, but because each of the two exists in eternity in which there can
        be neither before nor after. Accordingly, after the saying of Wisdom:
        “Before the hills I was brought forth,” to keep us from thinking that
        while He was being brought forth He was not, this is added: “While He
        was preparing the heavens I was present” (Prov. 8:27). In this
        way-although in the fleshly generation of animals first a thing is
        conceived, then it is brought forth, and finally it acquires a presence
        to the parent at once associated with and distinct from the parent—we
        can understand that in divine generation all these are simultaneous. For
        the Word of God is at once conceived, brought forth, and present. And
        since what is born proceeds from a womb, just as the generation of the
        Word of God to convey His perfect distinction from the generator is
        called birth, it is called for a like reason “generation from the womb”;
        so we read in a Psalm (109:3): “From the womb before the day star I
        begot You.” Nevertheless, since the distinction of the Word from the
        speaker is not the kind which prevents the Word from being in the
        speaker (as the things said make clear)—just as the distinctness of the
        Word is conveyed by calling Him “brought forth” or “begotten from the
        womb”—so, to show that this kind of distinction does not keep the Word
        from being in the speaker, John (1:8) says that He is “in the bosom of
        the Father.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [19] One should, of course, note carefully that the fleshly generation
        of animals is perfected by an active power and by a passive power; and
        it is from the active power that one is named “father,” and from the
        passive power that one is named “mother.” Hence, in what is required for
        the generation of offspring, some things belong to the father, some
        things belong to the mother: to give the nature and species to the
        offspring belong to the father, and to conceive and bring forth belong
        to the mother as patient and recipient. Since, however, the procession
        of the Word has been said to be in this: that God understands Himself;
        and the divine act of understanding is not through a passive power, but,
        so to say, an active one; because the divine intellect is not in potency
        but is only actual; in the generation of the Word of God the notion of
        mother does not enter, but only that of father. Hence, the things which
        belong distinctly to the father or to the mother in fleshly generation,
        in the generation of the Word are all attributed to the Father by sacred
        Scripture; for the Father is said not only “to give life to the Son”
        (cf. John 5:26), but also “to conceive” and to “bring forth.”

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] However, since what is said of the divine Wisdom has been brought to
        bear on the generation of the Word, one should in consequence show that
        by the divine Wisdom—from whose person the words adduced came forth—the
        Word of God can be understood.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] And in order to arrive at a knowledge of divine things from things
        human, this must be considered: One calls wisdom in a man a kind of
        habit by which our mind is perfected in knowledge of the highest
        matters, and the divine are of this kind. But, when in accord with the
        habit of wisdom a conception of divinity is formed in our intellect,
        that same conception of the intellect which is its interior word usually
        receives the name of wisdom. This follows that manner of speaking in
        which acts and effects are named by the names of the habits from which
        they proceed, for what is done justly is sometimes called justice, and
        what is done courageously is called courage, and, generally speaking,
        what is done virtuously is called virtue. And in this manner, that which
        is wisely thought out is called someone’s wisdom.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Now, that there is wisdom in God must certainly be said by reason of
        the fact that God knows Himself; but, since He does not know Himself by
        any species except His own essence—in fact, His very act of
        understanding is His essence—the wisdom of God cannot be a habit, but is
        God’s very essence. But from what has been said, this is clear: The Son
        of God is the Word and conception of God understanding Himself. It
        follows, then, that the same Word of God, as wisely conceived by the
        divine mind, is properly said to be “conceived or begotten Wisdom”; and
        so the Apostle calls Christ: “the Wisdom of God” (1 Cor. 1:24).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] But the very word of wisdom conceived in the mind is a kind of
        manifestation of the wisdom of the one who understands, just as in our
        case all habits are manifested by their acts. Since, then, the divine
        Wisdom is called light (for it consists in the pure act of cognition,
        and the manifestation of light is the brightness proceeding therefrom)
        the Word of divine Wisdom is named “the brightness of light.” Thus the
        Apostle speaks of the Son of God: “Who being the brightness of His
        glory” (Heb. 1:3). Hence, also, the Son ascribes to Himself the
        manifestation of the Father. He says in John (17:6): “Father, I have
        manifested your name to men.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] But note: Although the Son who is the Word of God is properly called
        “conceived Wisdom,” the name of “wisdom” must, nonetheless, when taken
        absolutely, be common to the Father and the Son; since the wisdom
        resplendent by the Word is the Father’s essence, as was said; but the
        Father’s essence is common to Him and to the Son.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] However, since God by understanding Himself understands all else, as
        Book I showed, but understands Himself by a single simple inward look,
        since His act of understanding is His act of being, necessarily the Word
        of God is unique. Since, of course, in divinity the generation of the
        Son is not other than the conception of the Word. it follows that there
        is one sole generation in divinity and that a unique Son is alone,
        begotten by the Father. Hence, John says: “We saw Him, as it were the
        only-begotten of the Father”; and again: “The only-begotten Son who is
        in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him” (1:14, 18).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] For all that, it seems to follow from the foregoing both that the
        divine Word has another word and the divine Son another son. For it was
        shown that the Word of God is true God. Whatever, therefore, belongs to
        God must belong also to the Word of God. But God necessarily understands
        Himself. Therefore, the Word of God also understands Himself. If, then,
        one says that because He understands Himself there is in God a Word
        begotten by Him, it seems to follow that in the Word so far as He
        understands Himself one must allow another word. And thus there will be
        a word of the Word and a son of the Son. And that word, if he be God,
        will again understand himself and will have another word. In this way,
        the divine generation will proceed to infinity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Now, the solution of this difficulty can be gathered from the
        foregoing. For, when it was shown that the Word of God is God, it was
        nevertheless shown that He is not a god other than that God whose Word
        He is, but a God entirely one. In this alone is He distinct from Him: He
        is the Word proceeding from Him. But, just as the Word is not another
        god, so neither is He another intellect; consequently, not another act
        of understanding; hence, not another word. Neither does it follow from
        this that there is a word of the Word Himself because the Word
        understands Himself. For, in this alone is the Word distinguished from
        the speaker (as we said): that it is from Him. Everything else,
        therefore, must be attributed commonly to God speaking, who is the
        Father, and to the Word, who is the Son, precisely because the Word also
        is God. But this alone: that the Word is from Him must be ascribed
        properly to the Father; and this alone: being from God speaking must be
        attributed properly to the Son.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] From this it is also clear that the Son is not impotent, although He
        cannot generate a Son, whereas the Father does generate a Son. For the
        very same power is the Father’s and the Son’s as is the very same
        divinity. And, since generation in divinity is the intelligible Word’s
        conception, namely, in that God understands Himself, it must be that the
        power to generate in God is like the power to understand Himself. And,
        since the act of understanding Himself is in God one and simple, the
        power of understanding Himself, which is not other than His act, must be
        only one power. Therefore, it is from the same power that the Word is
        conceived and that the speaker conceives the Word. Hence, it is from the
        same power that the Father generates and that the Son is generated.
        Therefore, the Father has no power which the Son does not have, but the
        Father has the generative power to beget, the Son has it to be begotten;
        that these are different only in relation is clear from what has been
        said.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] However, since the Apostle says that the Son of God has a word from
        which it seems to follow that there is a son of the Son and a word of
        the Word, one must weigh the fashion in which the words of the Apostle
        as he says this are to be understood. He says in Hebrews (1:2-3): “In
        these days He has spoken to us by His Son,” and, later: “Who being the
        brightness of His glory and the figure of His substance, and upholding
        all things by the word of His power,” etc. Now, our understanding of
        this must be taken from the things already said, for it was said that
        the conception of wisdom, which is a word, deserves the name of wisdom
        for itself. Now, if one-goes further, it is apparent that even the
        exterior effect which comes from the conception of wisdom can be called
        wisdom in the way in which an effect takes for itself the name of its
        cause. One’s wisdom is not only that which he thinks out wisely, but
        also that which be does wisely. Thus it happens that even the unfolding
        of divine wisdom by His work in things created is called God’s wisdom;
        for example, Sirach (1:9-10): “He created her” (wisdom) “in the Holy
        Spirit”; and later: “And He poured her out upon all His works.” Thus,
        also, then, what is effected by the Word gets the name of word. Even in
        our case the expression of the interior word by the voice is called a
        word, as though it were the “word’s word,” because it tends to manifest
        the interior word. Thus, then, not only is the conception of the divine
        intellect called a Word, which is the Son, but even the unfolding of the
        divinely conceived in exterior works is named the word of the Word. And
        thus must one understand that the Son upholds all things “by the word of
        His power,” and thus what one reads in the Psalmist: “Fire, hail, snow,
        ice, stormy winds which fulfill His word” (Ps. 148:8); and that is this:
        by the powers of creatures the effects of the divine conception are
        unfolded in things,

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] However, since God by understanding Himself understands all other
        things—as was said—the Word conceived in God by His understanding of
        Himself must also be the Word of all things. Nevertheless, He is not in
        the very same way the Word of God and of other things. For He is God’s
        Word as proceeding from Him; and He is the Word of other things, but not
        as proceeding from them. For God does not gather knowledge from things;
        rather, by His knowledge He produces things in being, as was shown
        above. Therefore, the Word of God must for all the things which are made
        be the perfect existing intelligibility. But how He can be the
        intelligibility Of things taken singly is manifest from the points
        treated in Book I. There it was shown that God has a proper knowledge of
        all things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Whoever, of course, makes anything by understanding does his work
        through the account of the things made which be has in himself, for the
        house which is material is made by the builder according to the account
        of the house which he has in his mind. Now, it was shown above that God
        produced, things in being not by a natural necessity, but as an
        intellectual and voluntary agent. Therefore, God made all things by His
        Word, which is the intelligibility of things made by Him. Hence, we read
        in John (1:3): “All things were made by Him.” In agreement with this,
        Moses, describing the origin of the universe, uses such a manner of
        speech for the single works: “God said: Be light made and light was
        made... God said: Let there be a firmament made” (Gen. 1:1-3), and so of
        the rest, All of which the Psalmist includes, saying: “He spoke and they
        were made (Ps. 148:5), for to speak is to produce a word. Thus,
        therefore, one must understand that God spoke and they were made because
        He produced the Word by which He produced things in being as by their
        perfect intelligibility.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] But, since there is identity between the cause of the conservation
        of things and of their production as all things were made by the Word,
        so by the Word of God all things are conserved in being. Hence, the
        Psalmist says: “By the Word of the Lord the heavens were established,”
        (Ps. 32:6), and the Apostle speaks of the Son “upholding all things by
        the word of His power” (Heb. 1:3). How this is to be taken was explained
        above.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] One nevertheless ought to know that the Word of God differs from an
        account in the mind of an artist in this: The Word of God is subsistent
        God; the account of the artefact in the mind of the artist is not a
        subsistent thing, but only an intelligible form. But, if a form is not
        subsistent, it does not properly belong to it to act, for action belongs
        to a finished and subsistent thing; but the latter acts by the form, for
        form is the principle by which an agent acts. Therefore, the plan of the
        house in the mind of the architect does not build the house; the
        architect builds it according to the plan. However, the Word of God,
        which is a plan of things made by God, does—since He is subsistent—act,
        there is not merely an action through Him. For this reason, the Wisdom
        of God says: I was with Him forming all things” (Prov. 8:30); and in
        John (5:17) our Lord says: “My Father works, and I work.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] Consideration should also be given to this: A thing made by an
        understanding pre-exists in the plan understood even before it is in
        itself, for the house exists in the understanding of the architect
        before it is brought to actuality. Now, the Word of God is the knowledge
        of all those things which are made by God—as was shown. Necessarily,
        then, all those things which are made by God have pre-existed in the
        Word of God even before they are in their own proper nature. Now, what
        is in something is in it in the way proper to that in which it is; it is
        not in that thing in its own proper manner, for the building in the mind
        of the architect exists intelligibly and immaterially. Things must,
        therefore, be understood to have pre-existed in the Word of God in the
        manner of the Word Himself. The manner of the Word Himself is this: He
        is one, simple, immaterial, and not only living but even life, since He
        is His own being. Necessarily, then, the things made by God have
        pre-existed in the Word of God from eternity, immaterially, without any
        composition. Moreover, they can be nothing else in Him but the Word
        Himself who is life. For this reason, we read: “that which was made in
        Him,” that is, in the Word, “was life” (John 1:3-4).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] Now, just as an intellectual agent, because of the account he has
        in himself, produces things in being, so also a teacher, because of the
        account he has in himself, causes science in another, since the science
        of the learner is drawn from the science of the teacher, as a kind of
        image of the latter. God is not only the cause by His intellect of all
        things which naturally subsist, but even every intellectual cognition is
        derived from the divine intellect, as is clear from the foregoing.”
        Necessarily, then, it is by the Word of God, which is the knowledge of
        the divine intellect, that every intellectual cognition is caused.
        Accordingly, we read in John (1:4): “The life was the light of men,”
        that is, because the Word Himself who is life and in whom all things are
        life does, as a kind of light, make the truth manifest to the minds of
        men. Nor is it a failure of the Word that not all men arrive at a
        knowledge of the truth, but that some exist in darkness. This comes,
        rather, from a failure of men who are not converted to the Word and
        cannot fully grasp Him. Hence, there still remains darkness among men
        greater or less, as men are more or less converted to the Word and
        cleave to Him. Hence, John, to exclude every defect from the clarifying
        power of the Word when he had said that the “life was the light of men,”
        adds that it “shines in the darkness and the darkness did not comprehend
        it” (1:5). The darkness is not because the Word does not shine, but
        because some do not grasp the light of the Word, just as with the light
        of the bodily sun diffused through the world there is darkness for him
        whose eyes are closed or weak.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [12] Such, then, are the points on divine generation and the power of
        the only-begotten Son which—taught by holy Scripture—we can in some way
        comprehend.

          >SOLUTION OF THE ARGUMENTS AGAINST DIVINE GENERATION PREVIOUSLY
          INTRODUCED</span
        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] The truth, of course, excludes every falsehood and dissolves every
        doubt therefore it is now time to dispose of the arguments which
        appeared to offer difficulty about divine generation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] From what we have said it is already clear that we assert an
        intelligible generation in God, and not such as that we find in material
        things wherein the generation is a kind ?of change which is the opposite
        of corruption. For not even in our intellect is the word conceived with
        some change, nor does it have an opposing corruption. It is to this
        conception that the generation of the Son of God is similar, as is now
        clear.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] In like manner, too, the word conceived by our intellect does not
        proceed from potency to act except in so far as the intellect proceeds
        from potency to act. For all that, the word does not arise in our
        intellect except as it exists in act; rather, simultaneously with its
        existence in act, there is a word conceived therein. But the divine
        intellect is never in potency, but is actual only, as was shown above.
        Therefore, the generation of the Word Himself is not like the process
        from potency to act rather, it is like the origin of act from act, as is
        brilliance from light and an understanding understood from an
        understanding in act. Hence, clearly also, generation does not prevent
        the Son of God from being true God, nor from being Himself eternal.
        Rather, He is indeed necessarily coeternal with God whose Word He is,
        for an intellect in act is never without its word.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] And since the Son of God’s generation is not material, but
        intelligible, it is now stupid to doubt whether the Father gave His
        nature wholly or partially. For, manifestly, if God understands Himself,
        the whole fullness of Himself must be contained in His Word.
        Nevertheless, the substance given to the Son does not cease to be in the
        Father, for not even in our case does the proper nature cease to be in
        the thing which is understood. ne word of our intellect owes it to the
        very thing understood that it contains intelligibly that very same
        nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Since, again, divine generation is not material, clearly there need
        not be in the Son of God something which receives and something else
        which is the nature received. For this necessarily happens in material
        generations in that the matter of the generated -receives the form of
        the one generating. But, in an intelligible generation, such is not the
        case. For it is not thus that a word arises within an intellect: one
        part of it is previously understood as receiving, and one part as
        flowing from the intellect; but in its entirety the word has its origin
        from the intellect, as even in our case one word in its entirety has its
        origin from others—a conclusion, for example, from principles. Where one
        thing in its entirety rises from another there is no marking off a
        receiver from the thing received, but the entire thing which arises is
        from him from whom it rises.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] In this same way it is clear that the truth of divine generation is
        not ruled out by this: in God there can be no distinction of a plurality
        of subsistents. The divine essence, subsistent though it be, cannot for
        all that be separated from the relation which must be understood to be
        in God, because the conceived Word of the divine mind is from God
        Himself speaking. For the Word, too, is the divine essence, as was
        shown, and God speaking—from whom the Word is—is the divine essence; not
        a first and a second, but an essence numerically the same. But relations
        like this are not accidents in God; they are subsistent things; for
        nothing can happen to God, as was proved above. There are, therefore,
        many things subsisting if one looks to the relations; there is but one
        subsistent thing, of course, if one looks to the essence. And on this
        account we speak of one subsisting God, because He is one subsisting
        essence; and we speak of a plurality of Persons, because of the
        distinction of subsisting relations. For the distinction of persons,
        even in things human, is not worked out in accordance with the specific
        essence, but in accordance with things adjoined to the specific nature.
        Now, in all the persons of men there is unity in the specific nature;
        there is, nevertheless, a plurality of persons simply because men are
        distinguished in these things which are adjoined to the nature. In
        divinity, therefore, one must not speak of one Person by reason of the
        unity of the subsisting essence, but of many Persons by reason of the
        relations.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] From this, of course, it clearly does not follow that what serves as
        principle of individuation is in some other, because the divine essence
        is not in another god, nor is the paternity in the Son.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] Although, of course, the two Persons—namely, that of the Father and
        that Of the Son—are differentiated not by essence, but by a relation,
        the relation is not, for all that, other than the essence in reality,
        since a relation in God cannot be an accident. Neither will this be
        looked on as impossible if one earnestly considers the points
        established in Book I. There it was shown that in God are the
        perfections of all beings, not in any composition, but in the unity of a
        simple essence, for the diversity of perfections which a created thing
        acquires by many forms is God’s in His one and simple essence. For a man
        lives by one form, is wise by another, and is just by another; and all
        of these belong to God by His essence. Therefore, just as wisdom and
        justice in a man are accidents indeed, but in God the same as the divine
        essence, so a relation (say, that of paternity or of sonship), although
        it be an accident in men, in God is the divine essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] It is not, of course, said that the divine wisdom is His essence
        whereas in us wisdom adds something to the essence, because the divine
        wisdom is, as it were, something lesser than our wisdom; it is said
        because His essence exceeds our essence, so that a thing which exceeds
        our essence (namely, to know and to be just) is possessed by God in His
        essence perfectly. Therefore, whatever is fitting to us which is
        distinguished in accord with essence and with wisdom must be ascribed to
        God by reason of His essence at one and the same time. And a like
        proportion must be observed in other cases. Now, since the divine
        essence is the very relation of paternity or of sonship, whatever is the
        property of paternity must belong to God, although paternity be His very
        essence. However, this is the property of paternity: to be distinguished
        from sonship. For one is said to be a father to a son as to another. And
        this is, essential to a father: to be the father of a son. Therefore,
        although God the Father is the divine essence, and in the same way God
        the Son is, from His being the Father He is distinguished from the Son,
        even though they be one in that each of the two is the divine essence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] From this it is also evident that a relation in divinity is not
        without an absolute. But a comparison to an absolute in God is other
        than a comparison to an absolute in created things. For in created
        things a relation is compared to an absolute as an accident to a
        subject; not in God, of course—there the comparison is by way of
        identity, just as it is also in other. things which are said about God.
        An identical subject, of course, cannot have opposed relations in
        itself: the same man, for example, being his father and his son. But the
        divine essence, by reason of its all round perfection, is identified
        with its wisdom and its justice and other things of this kind, which in
        our case are contained in differing genera. And in the same way nothing
        stops the one essence from being identified with paternity and sonship,
        and the Father and the Son from being one God, although the Father is
        not the Son; for it is by an identical essence that God has by nature
        being and His very own intelligible Word.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] From what has been said it can be made clear that the relations in
        God are in reality, and not in understanding alone. For every relation
        which follows on the proper operation of any thing—whether potency, or
        quantity, or anything of this kind—really exists in that thing;
        otherwise, it would be in the thing by understanding alone, as is
        apparent in the instance of knowledge and the knowable. For the relation
        of knowledge to the knowable follows on the action of the knower; not,
        of course, on the action of the knowable. The knowable maintains itself
        as it is in itself, both when it is understood and when it is not
        understood. Accordingly, the relation is in the knower really, but it is
        in the knowable consequently upon understanding only, since one says
        that the knowable is understood relatively to the knowledge because the
        knowledge is related to the knowable. A like situation appears in the
        case of right and left. For there is in animals a distinction of the
        powers from which the relation of right and left arises, on which
        account such a relation truly and really exists in the animal. Hence, no
        matter how the animal is turned around, the relation always maintains
        itself in the same way, for the right part is never called the left.
        Inanimate things, to be sure, which lack the powers just mentioned, have
        no relation of this kind really existing in them, but one names them in
        the relation of right or of left from this: the animals in some way
        present themselves to the inanimate. Hence, the same column is called
        now right, now left, inasmuch as the animal is compared to it in a
        different situation. Of course, the relation of the Word to God who
        speaks and whose Word He is in the divinity is based on the fact that
        God understands Himself. This operation is, indeed, in God, or, rather,
        is God Himself, as was shown above. One concludes that the relations
        aforesaid are in God truly and really and not solely according to our
        understanding.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [12] Although, of course, one holds that there is a relation in God, it
        does not, for all that, follow that there is in God something which has
        a dependent being, for in us the relations have a dependent being
        because their being is other than the being of the substance. Hence,
        they have a proper mode of being in their proper essence, just as
        happens in the case of the other accidents. In view of the fact that all
        accidents are forms of a sort superadded to the substance and caused by
        the principles of the substance, it must be that their being is
        superadded to the being of the substance and dependent on that being.
        And by as much as the being of each and every one of them is prior or
        posterior, by that much the accidental form in its proper essence will
        be more like a substance or more perfect. For this reason even a
        relation really accruing to a substance has a being which is last in
        order and quite imperfect: last in order, that is, because not only is
        the being of the substance prerequisite, but also the being of other
        accidents, out of which the relation is caused (thus to be one in
        quantity causes equality, and one in quality similarity); quite
        imperfect in turn, because the proper essence of the relation consists
        in its being toward-another-hence, its proper being, which it adds to
        the substance, depends not only on the being of the substance, but on
        the being of some exterior thing as well. This situation, of course, has
        no place in divinity, since there is in God no other being than that of
        substance, for whatever is in God is substance. Just as the being of
        wisdom in God, therefore, is not being by depending on substance (since
        the being of wisdom is the being of substance), so the being of relation
        is not being by depending either on substance or on another exterior
        thing (since the being of relation is also the being of substance). From
        the fact, then, that one puts a relation in God it does not follow that
        there is in Him some dependent being, but only that there is in Him some
        aspect in which aspect the essence of relation consists. just so from
        the fact that one puts wisdom in God it does not follow that there is
        something accidental in Him, but only that there is a certain perfection
        in which the essence of wisdom consists.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [13] Thus clearly, also, from the imperfection in created relations it
        does not follow that the divine persons—distinguished by relations—are
        imperfect, but it does follow that the distinction of the divine persons
        is minimal.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [14] Clearly, also, from the points made, although God is substantially
        predicated of the Father and the Son, it does not for all that follow
        that, if the Father and the Son are a kind of plurality, they are a
        plurality of gods. For they are many by reason of the distinction of
        subsistent relations, yet one God, nevertheless, by reason of the unity
        of subsistent essence. This does not happen among men, of course—that
        is, that some plurality is one man—since the essence of humanity is not
        numerically one in each of the plurality, nor is the essence of humanity
        subsistent; that is, humanity is not a man.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [15] From the fact that in God there is unity of essence and distinction
        of relations it becomes manifest that nothing stops one’s finding
        opposites in the one God, at least those opposites which follow the
        distinction of relation: begetting and begotten, for instance, which are
        opposed relatively, and begotten and unbegotten which are opposed as
        affirmation and negation. For wherever there is a distinction one must
        find the opposition of negation and affirmation. Things which differ in
        no affirmation or negation are entirely undifferentiated, for the first
        would have to be in every respect one with the second, and thus they
        would be thoroughly identified, and in no way distinct.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Now, divine Scriptures’ authority not only tells us about the Father
        and the Son in divinity, but together with these two also numbers the
        Holy Spirit. For our Lord says: “Going, therefore, teach ye all nations:
        baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
        Holy Spirit” (Mat. 2.8:1g). And 1 John (5:7) says: “there are three who
        give testimony in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost.”
        Sometimes, also, the procession of this Holy Spirit is mentioned by
        Scripture. We read in John (15:26): “When the Paraclete comes, whom I
        will send you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from
        the Father, He shall give testimony of Me.”

          >ARGUMENTS WHICH MADE SOME THINK THE HOLY SPIRIT A CREATURE</span
        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Now, in the opinion of some, the Holy Spirit is a creature exalted
        over other creatures. They used the testimony of sacred Scripture for
        this assertion.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Amos (4:13) says, if we take the Septuagint literally: “Behold He
        who forms the mountains and creates the spirit and declares His word to
        man.” And Zechariah (12:1): “Thus says the Lord who stretches forth the
        heavens, and lays the foundations of the earth, and creates the spirit
        of man in it.” It seems, then, that the Holy Spirit is a creature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Moreover, our Lord says, speaking of the Holy Spirit: “He shall not
        speak of Himself, but what things soever He shall hear, He shall speak”
        (John 16:23), and from this it appears that He speaks not with the
        authority of a further power, but to one who commands He is in a service
        of obedience, for to speak what one hears is proper to a servant.
        Therefore.’the Holy Spirit seems to he a creature subject to God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Again, “to be sent” appears proper to an inferior, since there is in
        the sender an implication of authority. The Holy Spirit, of course, is
        sent by the Father and the Son, for our Lord says: “The Paraclete, the
        Holy Ghost~ whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all
        things”; and: “Men the Paraclete cometh, whom I will send you from the
        Father” (John 14:26; 25:26). The Holy Spirit, therefore, appears to be
        less than the Father and the Son.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Moreover, divine Scripture, associating the Son with the Father in
        matters of divinity, makes no mention of the Holy Spirit. This is clear
        from Matthew (11:27), when our Lord says: “No one knows the Son but the
        Father: neither doth any one know the Father but the Son,” making no
        mention of the Holy Spirit. And John (17:3) says: “This is eternal life:
        that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom You
        sent.” There, again, no mention is made of the Holy Spirit. The Apostle
        also says: “Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and from the
        Lord Jesus Christ” (Rom. 2:7); and: “To us there is but one God, the
        Father, of whom are all things, and we unto Him; and one Lord Jesus
        Christ by whom are all things and we by Him” (1 Cor. 8:6); and in these
        places also there is nothing said about the Holy Spirit. It seems,
        therefore, that the Holy Spirit is not God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] There is more. Whatever is moved is created, for it was shown in
        Book I that God is immobile. But to the Holy Spirit motion is attributed
        by divine Scripture. One reads in Genesis (1:2): “And the Spirit of God
        was moved over the waters”; and in Joel (2:28): “I will pour out My
        spirit upon all flesh.” It seems, therefore, that the Holy Spirit is a
        creature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Moreover, everything that can be increased or divided is mutable and
        created. These seem to be attributed to the Holy Spirit in sacred
        Scripture. For the Lord said to Moses: “Gather unto Me seventy men of
        the ancients of Israel; and I will take of your spirit, and will give to
        them” (Num. 11:16-17). And 2 Samuel (2:9-10) says that Elishah begged of
        Elijah: “I beseech you that in me may be your double spirit”; and Elijah
        answered: “If you see me when I am taken from you, you shall have what
        you asked.” The Holy Spirit, therefore, appears to be mutable and not to
        be God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] Again, no sorrow can come upon God, since sorrow is passion of a
        sort and God is not subject to passion. But passion does come upon the
        Holy Spirit; as the Apostle reveals: “Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God”
        (Eph. 4:30); and Isaiah (63:10) says: “They provoked to wrath and
        afflicted His Holy Spirit.” The Holy Spirit, therefore, seems not to be
        God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] What is more, it is not suitable for God to entreat, but to be
        entreated. But to entreat is suitable to the Holy Spirit; we read in
        Romans (8:2.6): “The Spirit Himself asks for us with unspeakable
        groanings.” Therefore, the Holy Spirit appears not to be God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] Moreover, no one makes a thing a gift appropriately unless he has
        dominion over it. But God the Father gives the Holy Spirit, and so does
        God the Son. For our Lord says: “Your Father from heaven will give the
        good Spirit to them that ask Him” (Luke 11:13); and Peter speaks of “the
        Holy Spirit whom God has given to all that obey Him” (Acts 5:32).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] For these reasons it seems, then, that the Holy Spirit is not God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Once again, if the Holy Spirit is truly God, He ought to have the
        divine nature. Thus, when the Holy Spirit “proceeds from the Father” (as
        John 15:26 has it), necessarily He receives the divine nature from the
        Father. Of course, what receives its nature from a thing which produces
        it is generated by that thing. For it is proper to one begotten to be
        produced unto a similarity in species to its principle. Therefore, the
        Holy Spirit will be begotten and, consequently, the Son. And this is
        repugnant to sound faith.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [13] If the Holy Spirit, furthermore, receives the divine nature from
        the Father and not as one begotten, the divine nature must be
        communicated in two ways: by way of generation in which the Son
        proceeds, and in that way in which the Holy Spirit proceeds. But one
        nature seems not to have two fitting modes of communication if one
        examines natures universally. It seems, therefore, that the Holy Spirit,
        since He does not receive the divine nature by generation, does not
        receive it in any way at all. He thus appears not to be true God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [14] Now, this was the position of Arius, who said that the Son and the
        Holy Spirit were creatures: the Son, to be sure, greater than the Holy
        Spirit, and the Holy Spirit the servant of the Son; just so, he said
        that the Son was lesser than the Father. Arius was followed in respect
        of the Holy Spirit by Macedonius, “who rightly held that the Father and
        the Son were of one and the same substance, but was unwilling to believe
        this of the Holy Spirit. He said that the Holy Spirit was a creature.”
        Hence, some call the Macedonians Semi-Arians, because they are in
        partial agreement with the Arians, and in partial disagreement with the
        same group.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">THAT THE HOLY SPIRIT IS TRUE GOD</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] One shows, of course, by clear testimonies from Scripture that the
        Holy Spirit is true God. For to none but God is a temple consecrated,
        and so the Psalmist speaks of “God in His holy temple” (Ps. 10:5). Yet
        there is a temple assigned to the Holy Spirit, for the Apostle says: “Or
        know you not that your members are the temple of the Holy Spirit?” The
        Holy Spirit, therefore, is God. This is especially clear since our
        members, which the Apostle calls the temple of the Holy Spirit, are the
        members of Christ. For just above he had set down: “Know you not that
        your bodies are the members of Christ?” (1 Cor. 6:19, 15). It obviously
        would be awkward (since Christ is true God, as is clear from the
        foregoing) to have the members of Christ a temple of the Holy Spirit if
        the Holy Spirit were not God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Again, holy men do not give the cult of adoration except to the true
        God, for Deuteronomy (6:13) says: “You shall fear the Lord your God, and
        shall serve Him only.” But holy men serve the Holy Spirit, as the
        Apostle says: “We are the circumcision who serve the Spirit of God”
        (Phil. 3:3). And although some books have “who serve in the spirit of
        the Lord,” the Greek books and some Of the more ancient Latin ones have:
        “who serve the Spirit of God.” And from the Greek itself, this clearly
        must be understood as the cult of adoration which is due to God alone.
        Therefore, the Holy Spirit is true God to whom adoration is due.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Further, to sanctify men is the proper work of God, for Leviticus
        (22:32) says: “I am the Lord who sanctify you.” It is, of course, the
        Holy Spirit who sanctifies, as the Apostle says: “You are washed, you
        are sanctified, you are justified in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
        and the Spirit of our God” (1 Cor. 6:11). And in 2 Thessalonians (2:12)
        one reads: “God has chosen you first fruits unto salvation, in
        sanctification of the Spirit and faith of the truth.” Necessarily,
        therefore, the Holy Spirit is God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] And further, just as the life of corporeal nature is from the soul,
        so the life of justice of the soul itself is from God; and so our Lord
        says: “As the living Father has sent Me, and I live by the Father, so He
        that eats Me, the same also shall live by Me” (John 6:58). Of course,
        this kind of life is from the Holy Spirit, and so our Lord adds in the
        same place: “It is the Spirit that gives life” (John 6:54); and the
        Apostle says: “If by the Spirit you mortify the deeds of the flesh, you
        shall live” (Rom. 8:13). Therefore, the Holy Spirit is of the divine
        nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Our Lord, furthermore, when arguing His divinity against the Jews
        who could not bear the fact that He made Himself equal to God, asserts
        that there is in Him a power of raising to life. He says in John (5:21):
        “As the Father raises up the dead and gives life, so the Son also gives
        life to whom He will.” The power of raising to life, of course, belongs
        to the Holy Spirit; as the Apostle says: “If the Spirit of Him that
        raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you; He that raised up Jesus
        Christ from the dead shall quicken also your mortal bodies, because of
        His Spirit that dwells in you” (Rom. 8:11). Therefore, the Holy Spirit
        is of the divine nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Again, creation is the work of God alone, as was shown above. But
        creation belongs to the Holy Spirit; as the Psalmist says: “Send forth
        your Spirit, and they shall be created” (Ps. io3:30); and Job (33:4)
        says: “The Spirit of God made me”; and Sirach (1:9) says of God: “He
        created her,” meaning wisdom, “in the Holy Spirit.” Therefore, the Holy
        Spirit is of the divine nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] The Apostle says, further: “The Spirit searches all things, yea, the
        deep things of God. For what man knows the things of a man but the
        spirit of a man that is in him? So the things also that are of God no
        man knows, but the Spirit of God” (1 Cor. 2:10-11). But to comprehend
        all the deep things of God is not the act of a creature. And this is
        clear from our Lord’s words: “No one knows the Son but the Father,
        neither doth any one know the Father but the Son” (Mat. 11:27). And
        Isaiah (24:16) says in the person of God: “My secret to Myself.”
        Therefore, the Holy Spirit is not a creature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] What is more, in the comparison by the Apostle just given, the Holy
        Spirit is to God as the spirit of man is to man. Now, the spirit of man
        is intrinsic to man and is not extraneous to him in nature, but is of
        his nature. Therefore, the Holy Spirit as well is not by nature
        extraneous to God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] If one further compares the just quoted words of the Apostle with
        those of the Prophet Isaiah, he will see clearly that the Holy Spirit is
        God. For Isaiah (64:4) says: “The eye has not seen, O God, besides You,
        what things You hast prepared for them that wait for You.” And the
        Apostle, indeed, when he had introduced these words (1 Cor. 7:9) adds
        the words just mentioned, to wit, that “the Spirit searches the deep
        things of God” (1 Cor. 2:9-10). Manifestly, therefore, the Holy Spirit
        knows those deep things of God “which He has prepared for those that
        wait for Him.” Therefore, if none sees these besides God, as Isaiah
        says, clearly the Holy Spirit is God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] Isaiah, once again (6:8-9), says: “I heard the voice of God saying:
        Whom shall I send? And I said: Lo, here am I, send me. And He said: Go,
        and you shall say to His people: Hearing, hear, and understand not.”
        Now, Paul ascribes these words to the Holy Spirit; and thus we are told
        that Paul said to the Jews: “Well, did the Holy Spirit speak... by
        Isaiah the Prophet, saying: Go to this people and say to them: With the
        ear you shall hear and shall not understand” (Acts 28:2526). Manifestly,
        therefore, the Holy Spirit is God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] It is further apparent from sacred Scripture that it is God who
        speaks by the Prophets. For from the mouth of God, Numbers (12:6) says:
        “If there be among you a prophet of the Lord, I will appear to him in a
        vision, or I will speak to him in a dream.” And a Psalm (84:9) says: “I
        will hear what the Lord God will speak in me.” But it is plain to see
        that the Holy Spirit has spoken in the Prophets. One reads in Acts
        (1:16): “The Scripture must needs be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit
        spoke before by the mouth of David.” And in Matthew our Lord says: “How
        do the scribes say that Christ is the son of David. For David himself
        says by the Holy Spirit: The Lord said to my Lord: Sit you at My right
        hand.” And in 2 Peter (1:71) we read: “For prophecy came not by the will
        of man at any time, but the holy men of God spoke, inspired by the Holy
        Spirit.” Therefore, one plainly gathers from the Scriptures that the
        Holy Spirit is God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [ 12] Again, that the revelation of mysteries is a proper work of God is
        shown in Scripture, for in Daniel (2:28) it says: “There is a God in
        heaven that reveals mysteries.” But the revelation of mysteries is seen
        to be a work of the Holy Spirit, for we read in 1 Corinthians (2:10;
        14:2): “To us God has revealed them, by his Spirit”; and: “By the Spirit
        He speaks mysteries.” The Holy Spirit, therefore, is God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [13] What is more, to teach within is a proper work of God, for the
        Psalmist says of God: “He who teaches man knowledge” (93:16); and Daniel
        (2:21): “He gives wisdom to the wise, and knowledge to them that have
        understanding.” ]out that such is the proper work of the Holy Spirit is
        plain, for our Lord speaks in John (14:26): of “the Paraclete, the Holy
        Spirit whom the Father will send in My name: He will teach you all
        things.” The Holy Spirit, therefore, is of the divine nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [14] Furthermore, those who are identical in operation must be identical
        in nature. But the operation of the Son and the Holy Spirit is
        identical. For Christ speaks in the saints, as the Apostle shows in the
        words of 2 Corinthians (13:3): “Do you seek a proof of Christ that
        speaks in me?” This also plainly appears to be a work of the Holy
        Spirit, for we read in Matthew (10:20): “It is not you that speak, but
        the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you.” There is, then, an
        identical nature in the Son and the Holy Spirit and, consequently, the
        Father, since it has been shown that the Father and Son are one nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [15] Moreover, to dwell in the minds of the saints is the proper work of
        God, and so the Apostle says: “You are the temple of the living God; as
        God says: I will dwell in you” (2 Cor. 6:16). But the Apostle attributes
        the same thing to the Holy Spirit, for he says: “Know you not that you
        are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?” (1
        Cor. 3:16). Therefore, the Holy Spirit is God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [16] Once again, to be everywhere is proper to God, who says in Jeremiah
        (23:24): “I fill heaven and earth.” This belongs to the Holy Spirit, for
        we read in Wisdom (1:7): “The Spirit of the Lord bath filled the whole
        world,” and the Psalmist says: “Whither shall I go from your Spirit? Or
        whither shall I flee from your face? If I ascend into heaven, You are
        there,” and so forth (Ps. 138:7-8). Our Lord also says to the disciples:
        “You shall receive the power of the Holy Spirit coming upon you, and you
        shall be witnesses unto Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and Samaria,
        and even to the uttermost parts of the earth” (Acts 1:8), from which it
        is clear that the Holy Spirit is everywhere; He dwells in those existing
        in every place. The Holy Spirit, therefore, is God. [17] There is more.
        Scripture expressly names the Holy Spirit God, for Peter says: “Ananias,
        why did Satan tempt your heart, that you should lie to the Holy Spirit?”
        Later on, he adds: “You hast not lied to men, but to God” (Acts 5:3-4).
        The Holy Spirit, therefore, is God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [18] We read again, in 1 Corinthians (14:2, 21): “He that speaks in a
        tongue speaks not unto men, but unto God; for no one hears. Yet by the
        Spirit He speaks mysteries,” from which he gives one to understand that
        the Holy Spirit was speaking in those who spoke with different tongues.
        Later on, of course, he says: “In the Law it is written: In other
        tongues and other lips I will speak to this people; and neither so will
        they hear me, says the Lord.” Therefore, the Holy Spirit who speaks
        mysteries with diverse lips and tongues is God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [19] Furthermore, after a bit, this is added: “If all prophesy, and
        there come in one that believes not, or an unlearned person, he is
        convinced of all, he is judged of all. The secrets of his heart are made
        manifest; and so, falling down on his face, he will adore God, affirming
        that God is among you indeed” (1 Cor. 14:24-2-5). Clearly, of course,
        from what he had previously set down, “the Spirit speaks mysteries,” the
        manifestation of the secrets of the heart is from the Holy Spirit. And
        this is a proper mark of divinity, for we read in Jeremiah (17:9-10):
        “The heart of man is perverse... and inscrutable, who can know it? I am
        the Lord who search the heart and prove the reins: And so from this
        indication even an unbeliever (cf. 1 Cor. 14:24) is said to consider
        carefully that He who speaks these secrets of hearts is God. Therefore,
        the Holy Spirit is God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [20] Again, a bit later, the Apostle says: “The spirits of the prophets
        are subject to the prophets. For God is not the God of dissension, but
        of peace” (1 Cor. 14:32-33). Of course, the graces of the Prophets which
        he named “the spirits of the prophets” are from the Holy Spirit.
        Therefore, he shows that the Holy Spirit who distributes graces of this
        kind in such wise that from them follows not dissension but peace is God
        by these words: “God is not the God of dissension, but of peace.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [21] Furthermore, to adopt as sons can be the work of no other than God.
        For no spiritual creature is called son of God by nature, but by the
        grace of adoption. Hence, the Apostle attributes this work to the Son of
        God who is true God: “God sent His Son that we might receive the
        adoption of sons” (Gal. 4:4-5). But the Holy Spirit is the cause of the
        adoption, as the Apostle says: “You have received the spirit of adoption
        of sons, whereby we cry: Abba (Father)” (Rom. 8:15). Therefore, the Holy
        Spirit is not a creature, but God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [22] Again, if the Holy Spirit is not God, He must be a creature.
        Plainly enough, He is not a bodily creature, And neither is He a
        spiritual creature, for no creature is infused into a spiritual
        creature, since a creature is not participable, but rather
        participating. The Holy Spirit, of course, is infused into the minds of
        the saints, as it were participated by them, for we read that Christ was
        full of Him (Luke 4:1) and even the Apostles (Acts 7:4). The Holy
        Spirit, therefore, is not a creature but God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [23] But, if one says that the aforesaid works which are God’s are not
        attributed to the Holy Spirit in principalship as to God, but in
        ministry as it were to a creature, he says what is expressly false. And
        this is clear from the words of the Apostle: “There are diversities of
        operations, but the same God, who works all in all.” Afterwards, when
        the Apostle had enumerated the different gifts of God, he adds: “All
        these things one and the same Spirit works, dividing to every one
        according as He will” (1 Cor. 12:6, 11). Therein clearly he has set
        forth that the Holy Spirit is God: not only by saying that the Holy
        Spirit performs the works which he said before that God performs, but
        also by proclaiming that the Holy Spirit performs them according to a
        decision of His will. Manifestly, therefore, the Holy Spirit is God.

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] But, since some assert that the Holy Spirit is not a subsistent
        person, but, rather, the divinity of the Father and the Son (so some
        Macedonians are held to have said); or even an accidental perfection of
        the mind bestowed on us by God—wisdom, for instance, or charity or
        something of this sort (and these are participated by us as certain
        created accidents); one must on the contrary show that the Holy Spirit
        is nothing of this kind.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] For accidental forms have no proper operations; instead, one has
        them in accord with the decision of his will, for the wise man uses
        wisdom when he wills. But the Holy Spirit operates in accord with the
        decision of His will. This has been showm One must not, therefore, think
        of the Holy Spirit as an accidental perfection of the mind.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] The Holy Spirit, again, so we are taught by Scripture, is the cause
        of all the perfections of the human mind. For the Apostle says: “The
        charity of God is poured forth in our hearts, by the Holy Spirit, who is
        given to us” (Rom. 5:5)” and: “To one indeed, by the Spirit, is given
        the word of wisdom, and to another, the word of knowledge, according to
        the same Spirit” (1 Cor. 12:8), and so of the rest. The Holy Spirit,
        therefore, must not be thought of as an accidental perfection of the
        human mind, since He is, of all perfections of this kind, the existing
        cause.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Of course, that in the name of the Holy Spirit the essence Of the
        Father and Son is designated so as to be personally distinguished from
        neither of them conflicts with what divine Scripture hands on to us
        about the Holy Spirit. It says that the Holy Spirit “proceeds from the
        Father” and that He receives from the Son (John 15:26; 16:14). And this
        cannot be understood of the divine essence, since the divine essence
        neither proceeds from the Father nor receives from the Son. One must,
        then, say that the Holy Spirit is a subsisting Person.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Again, sacred Scripture manifestly speaks of the Holy Spirit as of a
        subsisting divine person, for it says: “As they were ministering to the
        Lord, and fasting, the Holy Spirit said to them: “Separate Me Saul and
        Barnabas, for the work whereunto I have taken them”; and later: “So
        they, being sent by the Holy Spirit, went” (Acts 13:2). And in Acts
        (15:28) the Apostles say: “It has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to
        us, to lay no further burden upon you,” and so forth; and these things
        would not be said of the Holy Spirit if He were not a subsistent person.
        The Holy Spirit is, therefore, a subsistent person.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Furthermore, since the Father and Son are subsisting persons and of
        the divine nature, the Holy Spirit would not be numbered along with them
        unless He also were a person subsisting in the divine nature. He is
        numbered with them, of course. This is clear from Matthew (28:19), where
        our Lord says to the disciples: “Go, therefore, teach all nations;
        baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
        Holy Spirit”; and from 2 Corinthians (13:13): “The grace of our Lord
        Jesus Christ, and the charity of God, and the communication of the Holy
        Spirit be with you all”; and from 1 John (5:7): “There are three who
        give testimony in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit.”
        From this it shows clearly that He is not only a subsistent person like
        the Father and the Son, but has unity of essence with them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] One could, of course, calumniate against the foregoing, saying that
        the “Spirit of God” is one thing and the “Holy Spirit” another. To be
        sure, in certain of the authorities set down, the “Spirit of God” is
        named, and in certain others “the Holy Spirit,” but the identity of the
        “Spirit of God” and “the Holy Spirit” is clearly shown from the words of
        the Apostle, when he had premised: “God has revealed them, by His
        Spirit,” by way of confirmation he says: “the Spirit searches all
        things, yes, the deep things of God”; and finally he concludes: “so the
        things also that are of God no man knows, but the Spirit of God” (1 Cor.
        2:10-11). From this there is manifestly apparent the identity of the
        Holy Spirit and the Spirit of Gold.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] The same point is apparent from this: our Lord says in Matthew
        (10:20): “It is not you that speak but the Spirit of your Father that
        speaks in you.” But in place of these words Mark says (13:11): “It is
        not you that speak, but the Holy Spirit.” Manifestly, the Holy Spirit is
        the same as the Spirit of God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] Since from the authorities set down it is clear in so many ways that
        the Holy Spirit is not a creature, but true God, it is accordingly
        manifest that we are not compelled to say that one must understand the
        Holy Spirit filling and dwelling in the-minds of the saints in the same
        way that one understands the devil to be filling and dwelling in some
        minds. One finds in John (13:27): “After the morsel, Satan entered into
        him”; and in Acts (5:3) Peter says—so some books have it: “Ananias, why
        has Satan tempted your heart?” For, since the devil is a creature, as
        was manifested in the foregoing, he fills no one by a participation in
        himself, and he cannot dwell in a mind through his substance; rather, he
        is said to fill some men by the effect of his wickedness. Hence, Paul
        says to a certain one: “O full of all guile and of all deceit” (Acts
        13:10). The Holy Spirit, of course, since He is God, dwells in a mind by
        His substance and makes men good by participation in Himself. For He is
        His own goodness, since He is God. And this can be true of no creature.
        Neither does this, for all that, change the fact that by the effect of
        His power He fills the minds of the holy.

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Taught by holy Scripture, therefore, we maintain this firmly about
        the Holy Spirit: that He is true God, subsistent, personally distinct
        from the Father and the Son. But one ought to consider how a truth of
        this kind must be grasped somehow, in order to defend it from the
        attacks of unbelievers.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] To get at the evidence one must first premise that in every
        intellectual nature a will must be discovered. For an intellect is made
        to be in act by an intelligible form so far as it is understanding, as a
        natural thing is made to be in act in its natural being by its proper
        form. But a natural thing, through the form by which it is perfected in
        its species, has an inclination to its proper operations and to its
        proper end, which it achieves by operations, “for as everything is so
        does it operate,” and it tends to what is fitting for itself. Hence,
        also, from an intelligible form there must follow in one who understands
        an inclination to his proper operations and his proper end. Of course,
        this inclination in an intellectual nature is the will, which is the
        principle of operations in us, those by which he who understands
        operates for an end. For end and the good are the will’s object. One
        must, therefore, discover a will in everyone who understands.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Although several acts seem to belong to the will, to desire, to
        delight in, to hate, and others of this kind, nevertheless for all of
        these love is found to be the one principle and the common root. This
        can be gathered from the following points. The will, as was said, is
        related to intellectual things as natural inclination to natural things
        (this is also called natural appetite). But natural inclination arises
        thus: The natural thing has an affinity and correspondence from its form
        (which we have called the principle of the inclination) with that to
        which it is moved. The heavy has such a relation with the lower place.
        Hence, also, every inclination of the will arises from this: by an
        intelligible form a thing is apprehended as suitable or affective. To be
        affected toward something—so far as it is of this kind—is to love that
        thing. Therefore, every inclination of will and even of sensible
        appetite has its origin from love. For from the fact that we love
        something we desire that thing if it be absent; we rejoice, of course,
        if it be present; and we are sad when we are kept from it; and we hate
        those things which keep us from the beloved, and grow angry against
        them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Thus, then, what is loved is not only in the intellect of the lover,
        but in his will as well; but in one way and another. It is in the
        intellect by reason of the likeness of its species; it is in the will of
        the lover, however, as the term of a movement is in its proportioned
        motive principle by reason of the suitability and proportion which the
        term has for that principle. just so, in a certain way, there is in fire
        the upper place by reason of that lightness which gives it proportion
        and suitability to such a place, but the fire which is generated is in
        the fire which generates by reason of the likeness of its form.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Since, then, it has now been shown that in every intellectual nature
        there is will, and that God, of course, is intelligent was shown in Book
        I, there must, then, be will in Him; the will of God, to be sure, is not
        something which accrues to His essence, just as His intellect is not, as
        was shown above, but the will of God is His very substance. And since
        the intellect of God, as well, is His very substance, it follows that
        the one thing in God is intellect and will. However, the manner in which
        what in other things are many things in God are one thing can be
        manifest from the points made in Book I.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] And because it was shown in Book I that the operation of God is His
        very essence, and that the essence of God is His will, it follows that
        will is not in God by way of potency, or of habit, but by way of act. It
        was shown, of course, that every act of will is rooted in love. Hence,
        in God there must be love.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] And because, as was shown in Book I, the proper object of the divine
        will is His goodness, necessarily it is first and principally His
        goodness and Himself that God loves. But, since it has been shown that
        the beloved must somehow be in the will of the lover, and that God
        Himself loves Himself, it needs must be that God Himself is in His will
        as the beloved in the lover. But the beloved is in the lover so far as
        it is loved—an act of love, of course, is a kind of act of will—but the
        act of will of God is His being, just as His will is His being.
        Therefore, the being of God in His will by way of love is not an
        accidental one—as it is in us—but is essential being. And so it must be
        that God, when He is considered existing in His own will, is truly and
        substantially God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] But a thing’s being in the will as a beloved in a lover bears a
        certain order to the conception by which the intellect conceives the
        thing, and to the thing itself whose intellectual conception is called a
        word. For it would not be loved unless it were somehow known; neither is
        the beloved’s knowledge alone loved, but the beloved as good in itself.
        Necessarily, therefore, does the love by which God is in the divine will
        as a beloved in a lover proceed both from the Word of God and from the
        God whose Word He is.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] Now, since it has been shown that the beloved is not in the lover by
        a likeness of species, as the thing understood is present in the one
        understanding, whereas whatever proceeds from another as one generated
        does proceed by a likeness of species from the generator, this follows:
        A thing’s proceeding in order to be in the will as the beloved is in the
        lover is not a proceeding by way of generation, just as a thing’s
        proceeding in order to be in the intellect does have the essentials of
        generation, as was shown above. Therefore, God proceeding by way of love
        does not proceed as begotten. And He, therefore, cannot be called Son.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] But, because the beloved in the will exists as inclining, and
        somehow inwardly impelling the lover toward the very thing beloved, and
        an impulse of a living thing from within belongs to a spirit, this is
        suitable: that God proceeding by way of love be called His “spirit; as
        it were a kind of existing spiration.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] Hence it is that the Apostle attributes to the Spirit and to Love a
        kind of impulse; for he says in Romans (8:14): “Whoever are led by the
        Spirit of God, they are the sons of God,” and: “The charity of Christ
        presses us” (2 Cor. 5:14).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [12] However, since every intellectual motion is named from its term,
        and the love aforesaid is that by which God Himself is loved, quite
        fittingly is God proceeding by way of love called “Holy Spirit”; for the
        things assigned to God have customarily been called “holy.”

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] For it was shown in the foregoing that the goodness of God is His
        reason for willing that other things be, and that by His will He
        produces things in being. The love, then, by which He loves His own
        goodness is the cause of the creation of things: whence, even certain
        ancient philosophers held that “the love of the gods” is the cause of
        all things as is plain in <i>Metaphysics</i> I [4]; and Dionysius says
        that “the divine love did not allow itself to be without seed” [
        <i>De div. nom.</i> 4]. But it was held in the preceding that the Holy
        Spirit proceeds by way of the love by which God loves Himself.
        Therefore, the Holy Spirit is the principle of the creation of things.
        And this is signified in the word of the Psalmist: “Send forth your
        Spirit, and they shall be created” (Ps. 103:30).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] It is also from the fact that the Holy Spirit proceeds by way of
        love-and love has a kind of driving and moving force—that the movement
        which is from God in things seems properly to be attributed to the Holy
        Spirit. Of course, the first existing mutation in things from God is
        understood to be this: He produced the different species out of formless
        created matter. Hence, this work is what sacred Scripture attributes to
        the Holy Spirit. For we read in Genesis (1:2): “The Spirit of God moved
        over the waters.” For by “waters” Augustine wants one to understand
        prime matter over which the Spirit of the Lord is said to be borne, not
        as though He Himself is moved, but because He is the principle of the
        movement.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Again, the government of things by God is understood to be according
        to a kind of motion, in that God directs and moves all things to their
        proper ends. If, then, drive and motion belong to the Holy Spirit by
        reason of love, the government and propagation of things is fittingly
        attributed to the Holy Spirit. Hence Job (33:4) says: “The Spirit of God
        made me”; and the Psalmist: “Thy good spirit shall lead me into the
        right land” (Ps. 142:10).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] And because a master’s proper act is to govern subjects, dominion is
        fittingly attributed to the Holy Spirit, for the Apostle says: “Now the
        Lord is a Spirit” (2 Cor. 3:17); and the Creed of our faith says: “I
        believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Life also is especially manifested in motion, for we say that
        self-moving things live and in general we say this of everything which
        puts itself into operation. If, then, by reason of love, drive and
        motion are suited to the Holy Spirit, life is also suitably attributed
        to Him. For John (6:64) says: “It is the Spirit who gives life”; and
        Ezekiel (37:5): “I will send Spirit into you, and you shall live”; and
        in the Creed of our faith we profess to believe in the Holy Spirit, “the
        giver of life.” This also harmonizes with the name “Spirit,” for even
        the bodily life of animals is due to a vital spirit diffused from the
        principle of life into the rest of the members.

          >ON THE EFFECTS ATTRIBUTED TO THE HOLY SPIRIT IN SCRIPTURE REGARDING
          THE RATIONAL CREATURE, SO FAR AS GOD’S GIFTS TO US ARE CONCERNED</span
        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Looking to the effects which He properly produces in the rational
        nature, we must also give consideration to this fact: When we are
        somehow made like a divine perfection, perfection of this kind is said
        to be given us by God; so wisdom is said to be a gift from God to us
        when we are somehow made like the divine wisdom. Since, then, the Holy
        Spirit proceeds by way of the love by which God loves Himself, as was
        shown, from the fact that in loving God we are made like to this love,
        the Holy Spirit is said to be given to us by God. Hence the Apostle
        says: “The charity of God is poured forth in our hearts, by the Holy
        Spirit, who, is given to us” (Rom. 5:5).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] One should realize, for all that, that what is in us from God is
        related to God as to an efficient and as to an exemplar cause. We say as
        to an efficient cause inasmuch as something is accomplished in us by the
        divine operative power. We say as to an exemplar cause so far as we are,
        thanks to that in us which is from God, imitating God. Since, then, the
        power of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit is identical
        just as the essence is, necessarily whatever God effects in us must be,
        as from an efficient cause, simultaneously from the Father and the Son
        and the, Holy Spirit. Nevertheless, the “word of wisdom” (cf. Dan. 1:20)
        by which we know God, and which God sends into us, is properly
        representative of the Son. And in like fashion the love by which we love
        God is properly representative of the Holy Spirit. And thus the charity
        which is in us, although it is an effect of the Father, the Son, and the
        Holy Spirit, is nonetheless for a special sort of reason said to be in
        us through the Holy Spirit.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] However the divine effects not only begin to be by the divine
        operation, by it they are also maintained in being (as is clear from the
        foregoing). And nothing operates where it is not, for the agent and that
        acted upon must be simultaneously in act, just as the mover and the
        moved. Necessarily, then, wherever there is an effect of God, there God
        Himself is efficient. Hence, since the charity by which we love God is
        in us by the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit Himself must also be in us, so
        long as the charity is in us. And so the Apostle says: “Know you not
        that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in
        you?” (1 Cor. 3:16). Therefore, since we are made lovers of God by the
        Holy Spirit, and every beloved is in the lover as such, by the Holy
        Spirit necessarily the Father and the Son dwell in us also. And so our
        Lord says: “We will come to him”—He means to one who loves God—“and will
        make our abode with him” (John 14:23). And in 1 John. (3:7.4) we read:
        “In this we know that He abides in us, by the Spirit which He has given
        us.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Moreover, God manifestly loves in the greatest degree those whom He
        has made lovers of Himself through the Holy Spirit, for He would not
        confer so great a good save by loving us. Hence, we read in Proverbs
        (8:17) from the Person of God: “I love those who love Me”; “not as
        though we had loved God, but because He has first loved us,” as we read
        in 1 John (4:10). Of course, every beloved is in a lover. Therefore, by
        the Holy Spirit not only is God in us, but we also are in God. Hence, we
        read in 1 John (4:16, 13): “He who abides in charity abides in God, and
        God in him;” and: “In this we know that we abide in Him and He in us:
        because He has given us of His Spirit.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Of course, this is the proper mark of friendship: that one reveal
        his secrets to his friend. For, since charity unites affections and
        makes, as it were, one heart of two, one seems not to have dismissed
        from his heart that which he reveals to a friend; and so our Lord says
        to His disciples: “I will not now call you servants but friends: because
        all things whatsoever I have heard of My Father I have made known to
        you” (John 15:15). Therefore, since by the Holy Spirit we are
        established as friends of God, fittingly enough it is by the Holy Spirit
        that men are said to receive the revelation of the divine mysteries.
        Hence, the Apostle says: “It is written that eye has not seen, nor ear
        heard, neither has it entered into the heart of man, what things God has
        prepared for them that love Him. But to us God has revealed them, by His
        Spirit” (1 Cor. 2:9-10).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] It is from the things a man knows that his speech is.formed;
        fittingly, therefore, a man speaks the mysteries through the Holy
        Spirit. Hence, the words of 1 Corinthians (14:2): “By the Spirit He
        speaks mysteries”; and Matthew (10:20): “It is not you that speak, but
        the Spirit of your Father that speaks in you.” And of prophets, 2 Peter
        (1:21) says that “the holy men of God spoke, inspired by the Holy
        Spirit.” Hence, also, in the Creed of our faith we say of the Holy
        Spirit: “Who spoke through the prophets.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Now, it is not only proper to love that one reveal his secrets to a
        friend by reason of their unity in affection, but the same unity
        requires that what he has he have in common with the friend. For, “since
        a man has a friend as another self,” he must help the friend as he does
        himself, making his own possessions common with the friend, and so one
        takes this as the property of friendship “to will and to do the good for
        a friend.” This agrees with 1 John (3:17): “He who has the substance of
        this world, and sees his brother in need, and shuts up his bowels from
        him: how does the charity of God abide in him?” But such is especially
        the case with God whose will is efficacious on its effect. Therefore, it
        is fitting that all the gifts of God are said to be gifts from the Holy
        Spirit; thus, in 1 Corinthians (12:8, 11): “To one, indeed, by the
        Spirit is given the word of wisdom, to another, the word of knowledge,
        according to the same Spirit”; and later on, having mentioned many, it
        says: “One and the same Spirit works, dividing to every one according as
        He will.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] This, too, is manifest: just as, to get a body to the place of fire,
        it must be likened to fire by acquiring that lightness according to
        which fire is moved by its own motion; so also, to get a man to the
        beatitude of divine enjoyment which is proper to God in His own nature,
        these are necessary: first, that by spiritual perfections he be likened
        to God; then, that he operate with these perfections; and thus, lastly,
        achieve that beatitude we mentioned. Of course, the spiritual gifts are
        given to us by the Holy Spirit, as was shown. And thus by the Holy
        Spirit we are configured to God and through Him we are made ready for
        good operation. And by the same Spirit the road to beatitude is opened
        to us. The Apostle implies all three of these when he says: “He who
        confirms us... is God who also has sealed us, and given the pledge of
        the Spirit in our hearts” (2 Cor. 1:21, 22). And in Ephesians (1:13,
        14): ‘You were signed with the Holy Spirit of promise, who is the pledge
        of our inheritance: For the “signing” seems to belong to the likeness of
        configuration; the “confirming” to man’s readiness for perfect
        operation; the “pledge,” of course, to the hope by which we are ordered
        to the heavenly inheritance, and this is perfect beatitude.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] Further, since out of the good will which one has to another it
        comes about that he adopt that other as his son—and so the inheritance
        belongs to that other as adopted—it is fitting that the adoption of the
        sons of God is attributed to the Holy Spirit, in the words of Romans
        (8:15): “You have received the Spirit of adoption of sons, whereby we
        cry: Abba (Father).”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] Of course, by the fact that one is established as the friend of
        another, every offense is removed, because friendship and offense are
        contraries. Thus, we read in Proverbs (10:12): “Charity covers all
        sins.” Therefore, since we are established as friends of God by the Holy
        Spirit, it is by Him that God remits our sins, and so our Lord says to
        His disciples (John 20:22-23): “Receive the Holy Spirit. Whose sins you
        shall forgive, they are forgiven.” Therefore, also, in Matthew (12:31)
        blasphemers against the Holy Spirit are denied the remission of sins, as
        though they do not have that by which a man achieves the remission of
        his sins.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] Hence, also, it is by the Holy Spirit that we are said to be
        renewed, and cleansed or washed; as the Psalmist has it: “Send forth
        your Spirit, and they shall be created, and You shall renew the face of
        the earth” (Ps. 103:30); and Ephesians (4:23): “Be renewed in the Spirit
        of your mind”; and Isaiah (4:4): “If the Lord shall wash away the filth
        of the sons of Zion and cleanse away the blood of her daughters in the
        midst by the Spirit of judgment and the Spirit of burning.”

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Now that we have considered the things which are said to be done in
        us by God through the Holy Spirit, we ought to consider how through the
        Holy Spirit we are moved to God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] First, indeed, this appears to be especially proper to friendship:
        really to converse with the friend. Now, the conversation of man with
        God is by contemplation of Him, just as the Apostle used to say: “Our
        conversation is in heaven” (Phil. 3:20). Since, therefore, the Holy
        Spirit makes us lovers of God, we are in consequence established by the
        Holy Spirit as contemplators of God. Hence, the Apostle says: “But we
        all beholding the glory of the Lord with open face, are transformed into
        the same image from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord” (2
        Cor. 3:18).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] It is also a property of friendship that one take delight in a
        friend’s presence, rejoice in his words and deeds, and find in him
        security against all anxieties; and so it is especially in our sorrows
        that we hasten to our friends for consolation. Since, then, the Holy
        Spirit constitutes us God’s friends, and makes Him dwell in us, and us
        dwell in Him (as was shown), it follows that through the Holy Spirit we
        have joy in God and security against all the world’s adversities and
        assaults. And so we read in the Psalmist: “Restore unto me the joy of
        your salvation and strengthen me with your lordly Spirit” (Ps. 50:14);
        and in Romans (14:17): “The kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but
        justice, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit”; and in Acts (9:31):
        “The church had peace and was edified, walking in the fear of the Lord,
        and was filled with the consolation of the Holy Spirit.” For this
        reason, too, our Lord calls the Holy Spirit the Paraclete, that is,
        Comforter, in John (14:26): “But the Paraclete, the Holy Spirit,” and so
        forth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Similarly, too, it is proper to friendship to consent to a friend in
        what he wills. Of course, the will of God is set forth for us by His
        precepts. Therefore, it belongs to the love by which we love God that we
        fulfill His commandments, as the Word in John (14:15) says: “If you love
        Me, keep My commandments.” Hence, since we are established as God’s
        lovers by the Holy Spirit, by Him, too, we are in a way driven to
        fulfill the precepts of God, as the Apostle’s word goes: “Whosoever are
        led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God” (Rom. 8:14).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] For all that, one must bear in mind that the sons of God are driven
        not as slaves, but as free men. For, since he is free who is for his own
        sake, we do that freely which we do of our very selves. But this is what
        we do of our will, but what we do against our will we do not freely but
        as slaves: be the violence absolute, as when “the whole principle is
        extrinsic, with the sufferer contributing nothing—for instance, a man is
        pushed into motion, or be the violence mixed with the voluntary—for
        instance, when one wishes to do or to suffer what is less contrary to
        his will to avoid what is more contrary to it. But the Holy Spirit so
        inclines us to act that He makes us act voluntarily, in that He makes us
        lovers of God. Therefore, the sons of God are impelled by the Holy
        Spirit freely out of love, not slavishly out of fear. Hence, the Apostle
        says: “You have not received the spirit of bondage again in fear, but
        the Spirit of adoption of sons” (Rom. 8:15).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] The will, of course, is ordered to that which is truly good. But if,
        by reason of passion or of bad habit or disposition, a man be turned
        away from that which is truly good, he acts slavishly, in that he is
        diverted by some extraneous thing, if consideration be given the will’s
        natural order itself. But if one considers the act of the will as
        inclined to an apparent good, one acts freely when he follows passion or
        a corrupt habit he acts slavishly, of course, if while his will remains
        such he—for fear of a law to the contrary—refrains from that which he
        wills. Therefore, since the Holy Spirit inclines the will by love toward
        the true good, to which the will is naturally ordered, He removes both
        that servitude in which the slave of passion infected by sin acts
        against the order of the will, and that servitude in which, against the
        movement of his will, a man acts according to the law; its slave, so to
        say, not its friend. This is why the Apostle says: “Where the Spirit of
        the Lord is, there is liberty” (2 Cor. 3:17); and: “If you are led by
        the Spirit, you are not under the law” (Gal. 5: 18).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Hence it is that the Holy Spirit is said to mortify the deeds of the
        flesh, inasmuch as a passion of the flesh does not turn us away from the
        true good, and to this the Holy Spirit orders us by love; hence, we read
        in Romans (8:13): “If by the Spirit you mortify the deeds of the flesh,
        you shall live.”

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] One must now answer the arguments previously given, those in which
        the conclusion seemed to be that the Holy Spirit is a creature, and not
        God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] In this matter our first consideration must be that the name
        “spirit” seems to be taken from the respiration of animals, in which
        with some change air is taken in and expelled. And so the name “spirit”
        is extended to every impulse and movement of every single airy body;
        thus, the wind is called a “spirit” in the words of the Psalmist: “Fire,
        hail, snow, ice, stormy winds which fulfill His word” (Ps. 148:8). Thus,
        also, the fine vapor diffused through the members for their movements is
        called “spirit.” Again, because air is invisible, the name “spirit” was
        carried further to all invisible and motive powers and substances. And
        on this account the sensible soul, the rational soul, the angels, and
        God are called “spirits”—and properly God proceeding by way of love,
        because love implies a kind of moving force. Accordingly, one
        understands the saying of Amos, “creating a spirit,” as referring to the
        wind; so our translation more expressly says, and this is also
        harmonious with what goes before: “forming mountains.” But what
        Zechariah says about God “creating” or “forming the spirit of man in
        him” one understands of the human soul. Hence, the conclusion cannot be
        that the Holy Spirit is a creature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] In the same way, of course, one cannot from our Lord’s saying about
        the Holy Spirit, “He shall not speak of Himself; but what things soever
        He shall hear, He shall speak,” conclude that the Holy Spirit is a
        creature. For it was shown that the Holy Spirit is God. Hence, He must
        have His essence from another, just as we said about the Son of God
        above. And thus, since in God the knowledge and the power and the
        operation of God are His essence, in the Son and in the Holy Spirit all
        the knowledge and power and operation are from another. But the Son’s is
        from the Father only; that of the Holy Spirit is from the Father and
        from the Son. Therefore, since one of the operations of the Holy Spirit
        is His speaking in saintly men, as wag sbown, it is on this score said
        that “He shall not speak of Himself,” since He does not operate of
        Himself. “To bear,” of course, in His case is to receive knowledge, as
        He does essence, from the Father and the Son; and this because we
        receive knowledge by bearing, for it is customary in Scripture to deal
        with things divine in the fashion of things human. Nor need one be
        disturbed by His saying: “He shall hear,” speaking of future time, so to
        say. For the Holy Spirit receives eternally, and the verbs of any tense
        can be applied to the eternal, because eternity embraces the whole of
        time.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Following the same points, it is also clear that the sending of the
        Holy Spirit by the Father and the Son does Hot justify concluding that
        He is a creature. For it was said above that in this the Son of God is
        said to have been sent: that He appeared to men in visible flesh. Thus,
        He was in a new kind of fashion in the world, a fashion in which
        previously He had not been—namely, visibly; and for all that He had
        always been in it invisibly as God. The Son’s doing so, of course, was
        His from the Father, and so in this He is said to have been sent by the
        Father. Thus, of course, the Holy Spirit visibly appeared: “as a dove”
        (Mat. 3:1.6) above Christ at His baptism, or “in tongues of fire” (Acts
        2:3) above the Apostles. And, granted He did not become a dove or a fire
        as the Son became man, He nevertheless did appear in certain signs of
        His own in visible appearances Of this kind; thus, He also.in a new kind
        of fashion—namely, visibly—was in the world. And this presence was His
        from the Father and the Son; wherefore, He, too, is called sent by the
        Father and the Son. Yet this indicates not His being the lesser, but His
        proceeding.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Nevertheless, there is another way in which both the Son and the
        Holy Spirit are said to be invisibly sent. For from what has been said
        it is plain that the Son proceeds from the Father by way of the
        knowledge by which God knows Himself, and that the Holy Spirit proceeds
        from the Father and the Son by way of the love by which God loves
        Himself. Hence, as was said,” when by the Holy Spirit one is made a
        lover of God, the Holy Spirit is dwelling within that one, and thus in a
        new kind of way He is in a man: to wit, dwelling in the man according to
        a new proper effect. And that the Holy Spirit produce this effect in man
        is His from the Father and the Son; and on this account He is said to be
        sent invisibly by the Father and the Son. And reasoning equally, in a
        human mind the Son is said to be invisibly sent when a man is in such
        wise established in the divine knowledge that the love of God comes
        forth in the man. Hence, clearly, neither does that fashion of being
        sent indicate in the Son or in the Holy Spirit His being the lesser, but
        His proceeding from another.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Similarly, also, the Holy Spirit is not excluded from the Divinity
        by the occasional connumeration of the Father and the Son without
        mention of the Holy Spirit, just as the Son is not excluded from the
        Divinity by occasional mention of the Father without the Son. In this
        way Scripture tacitly suggests that whatever relating to Divinity is
        said of one of the Three must be understood of all, because they are one
        God. Nor is it possible to understand God the Father without a Word and
        a Love, nor is the converse possible. For this reason, in one of the
        Three all Three are understood. Hence, mention occasionally is made of
        the Son on a point common to the Three; such is the case in Matthew
        (11:27): “Neither does any one know the Father, but the Son,” although
        both the Father and the Holy Spirit know the Father. In the same way, we
        read about the Holy Spirit in 1 Corinthians (2:11): “The things... of
        God no one knows, but the Spirit of God,” whereas it is certain that
        from this cognition of Divinity neither the Father nor the Son is
        excluded.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Clearly, also, one cannot show that the Holy Spirit is a creature
        because one finds sacred Scripture saying things about Him which pertain
        to motion. They must be taken metaphorically. For sometimes, also,
        sacred Scripture attributes motion to God; for example, Genesis (3:8;
        18:21): “When they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in paradise;
        and later: “I will go down and see whether they have done according to
        the cry that is come to Me.” Therefore, the saying, “the Spirit of God
        was borne over the waters,” must be understood to be said as the will is
        said to be borne on the willed, or the love on the beloved. This, also,
        by the way, some choose not to understand of the Holy Spirit, but of the
        air which has its natural place above the water, and so it was to
        indicate its manifold mutation that Scripture said it “was moved over
        the waters.” This further saying, “I will pour out My Spirit upon all
        flesh,” must be understood as said of the way in which the Holy Spirit
        is sent to men by the Father and the Son. This was mentioned. Of course,
        in the word, “poured out,” the abundance of the effect of the Holy
        Spirit is grasped: He will not be stopped at one but will move on to
        many, and from these also somehow to others; this is clear when things
        are poured out corporeally.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] In like manner, the saying, “I will take of your Spirit, and will
        give to them,” must not be referred to the essence or person of the Holy
        Spirit, since He is indivisible. The reference is to His effects, by
        which He dwells in us, and these can be increased or diminished in a
        man: not with the result, for all that, that what is subtracted from one
        is bestowed on another remaining numerically identical (this happens in
        bodily things), but so that a like thing may increase in one which
        decreases in another. Nor does this demand that to increase the effect
        in one it must be subtracted from another, for a spiritual thing can be
        possessed by many simultaneously without any loss. Hence, concerned with
        spiritual gifts, one must not understand that something was withdrawn
        from Moses to be conferred on others; the reference is rather to his act
        or office, for what the Holy Spirit had previously done through Moses
        alone He later effected through many.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Thus, also, Elishah did not beg that the essence or person of the Holy
        Spirit be increased by duplication, but that the twofold effect of the
        Holy Spirit which had been in Elijah—namely, prophecy and the working of
        miracles—be also in himself. To be sure, there is no awkwardness in
        one’s participating in the Holy Spirit more abundantly than another, be
        it by the double or by any other ratio whatever, for the measure in each
        participant is finite. For all that, Elishah would not have had the
        presumption to ask that in a spiritual effect he should be greater than
        his master.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] Again, it is plainly the custom of sacred Scripture to pass over
        into God a likeness to the passions of the human spirit; we read in the
        Psalms (105:40-41): “And the Lord was exceedingly angry with His
        people.” God is said to be angered by similarity in the effect, for He
        punishes, which is what the angered do; so this is added below: “And He
        delivered them into the hands of the nations.” Thus, the Holy Spirit is
        said to be ‘made sorrowful,” for He leaves sinners as those who are made
        sorrowful leave those who make them sorrowful.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] It is also the usual manner of speech in sacred Scripture to
        attribute to God what He does in man; hence, Genesis (22:12): “Now I
        know that you fear God”—that is, “now I have made you know.” And in this
        way the Holy Spirit is said to petition, for He makes others petition;
        He makes the love of God be in our hearts; out of this we desire to
        enjoy Him, and in our desiring we petition.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] Of course, since the Holy Spirit proceeds by way of the love by
        which God loves Himself, and by that same love and for His own goodness
        God loves Himself and other things, manifestly that love pertains to the
        Holy Spirit, the love by which God loves us. So, also, does the love by
        which we love God, for He makes us lovers of God. This has been
        explained. It is in regard to each of these loves that “to be bestowed”
        is fitting to the Holy Spirit. It is fitting by reason of the love by
        which God loves us in that manner of speech wherein each is said “to
        give his love” to someone when he begins to love him. Although there is
        no one whom God begins to love in time, if one considers the divine will
        by which He loves us, there is, nevertheless, an effect of His love
        caused in time in the one whom He draws to Himself. It is fitting to the
        Holy Spirit by reason of the love by which we love God, for the Holy
        Spirit makes this love in us. Hence, in accord with this love, He dwells
        in us—clearly from what has been said—and so we possess Him as one whose
        resources we enjoy. Now, this is in the Holy Spirit from the Father and
        the Son: that by the love which He causes in us He be in us and be
        possessed by us. Fittingly, therefore, He is said “to be bestowed” upon
        us by the Father and the Son. Nor does this show Him to be one lesser
        than the Father and the Son, but to be one who has His origin from them.
        He is said also to be given us even by Himself in that He causes in us
        the love by which He dwells in us together with the Father and the Son.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [12] Although the Holy Spirit is, of course, true God and has the true
        divine nature from the Father and the Son, He need not, for all that, be
        a son. For son is said of one because he is begotten. Hence, if a thing
        should receive its nature from another not by begetting, but in any
        other way whatever, it would lack the essential of sonship. If, for
        example, a man had the power divinely conceded to him to make a man out
        of some part of his own body, in some exterior fashion as one makes
        artefacts, the man produced would not be called the son of the
        producing, for he would not proceed from him by birth. But the
        procession of the Holy Spirit does not have the essentials of birth (as
        was shown above). Hence, the Holy Spirit, although He has the divine
        nature from the Father and the Son, cannot, for all that, be called
        Their son.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [13] But that in the divine nature alone nature be communicated in
        several ways is reasonable. For in God alone is His operation His being.
        Hence, since in Him, as in any intellectual nature, there is an act of
        understanding and an act of will, that which proceeds in Him by way of
        understanding as Word, or by way of love and will as Love, must have the
        divine being and be God. And thus, not only the Son but the Holy Spirit
        is true God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [14] Let these, then, be our points about the divinity of the Holy
        Spirit. But other difficulties about His procession ought to he
        considered in the light of what has been said about the nativity of the
        Son.

        [1] We find some who make this mistake about the procession of the Holy
        Spirit: they say the Holy Spirit does not proceed from the Son. For this
        reason we must show that the Holy Spirit does proceed from the Son.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] It is manifest in sacred Scripture that the Holy Spirit is the
        Spirit of the Son, for Romans (8:9) says: “If any man have not the
        Spirit of Christ, he is none of His.” But that one might not be able to
        say that the Spirit that proceeds from the Father is one, and the Son’s
        Spirit another, it is shown from the words of the same Apostle that the
        Holy Spirit of the Father and of the Son is identified. For the words
        just cited, “If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of
        His,” the Apostle added after he had said: “If so be that the Spirit of
        God dwell in us,” and so forth. But one cannot say that the Holy Spirit
        is the Spirit of Christ merely because He had Him as man, according to
        the words of Luke (4:1): “Jesus being full of the Holy Spirit, returned
        from the Jordan.” For one reads in Galatians (4:6): “Because you are
        sons, God has sent the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying: Abba
        (Father).” The Holy Spirit, therefore, makes us the sons of God
        precisely because He is the Spirit of the Son of God. But we are made
        the adoptive sons of God by assimilation to the natural Son of God, as
        Romans (8:29) has it: “Whom He foreknew, He also predestined to be made
        conformable to the image of His Son, that He might be the firstborn
        amongst many brethren.” Thus, then, is the Holy Spirit the Spirit of
        Christ: so far as He is God’s natural Son. But there is no relation in
        accord with which the Holy Spirit can be called the Spirit of the Son of
        God except a relation of origin, for this is the only distinction we
        find in divinity. Therefore, one must say that the Holy Spirit is the
        Son’s Spirit by proceeding from Him.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] The Holy Spirit, again, is sent by the Son; consider John (15:26):
        “When the Paraclete cometh, whom I will send you from the Father.” But
        whoever sends has an authority over the one sent. One must, then, say
        that the Son has an authority in regard to the Holy Spirit: not, of
        course, that of being master or being greater, but in accord with origin
        only. In this wise, then, the Holy Spirit is from the Son. Now, let one
        say that the Son is sent by the Holy Spirit as well, because we read in
        Luke (4:18-21) that our Lord said Isaiah’s words (61:1) were fulfilled
        in Him: “The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, He has sent Me to preach the
        gospel to the poor.” But consideration must be given this: the Son is
        sent by the Holy Spirit in accord with the assumed nature. But the Holy
        Spirit has not assumed a created nature, so that in accord with it He
        can be called sent by the Son, or so as to give the Son authority in His
        regard. Therefore, this remains: it is considered as an eternal person
        that the Son has authority over the Holy Spirit.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] There is more. In John (16:14-15), the Son says of the Holy Spirit:
        “He shall glorify Me because He shall receive of Mine.” Of course, this
        cannot be said: He receives what is the Son’s, but does not receive from
        the Son; by saying, for instance, that He receives the Son’s divine
        essence from the Father. Hence, our Lord adds: “All things whatsoever
        the Father has are mine. Therefore, I said that He shall receive of
        Mine.” For, if all things which are the Father’s are the Son’s as well,
        the Father’s authority as principle of the Holy Spirit must be the Son’s
        as well. Therefore, just as the Holy Spirit receives what is the
        Father’s from the Father, so He receives what is the Son’s from the Son.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Here one can also introduce the testimonies of the Doctors of the
        Church, the Greeks included. Athanasius says: “The Holy Spirit is from
        the Father and the Son-not made, not created, not begotten, but
        proceeding.” Cyril, too, in his epistle received by the Council of
        Chalcedon, says: “The Spirit of the truth is named and is the Spirit of
        the Truth and flows from Him just as, indeed, from God the Father.”
        Didymus also says in his book <i>On the Holy Spirit</i>: “The Son is
        nothing else than what is given to Him by the Father, and the substance
        of the Holy Spirit is no other than that given Him by the Son.” Of
        course, it is ridiculous that some concede that the Holy Spirit “is from
        the Son” or “flows from the Son” but does not “proceed from. Him.” For
        the verb “to proceed,” among all those which refer to origin, turns up
        most commonly; for, if anything is in any way at all from something, we
        say it proceeds from that thing. And since divinity is better designated
        by what is common than by what is special, in the origin of the divine
        persons the verb proceeding is the most suitable. And so, if one
        concedes that the Holy Spirit “is from the Son” or “flows from the Son,”
        it follows that “He proceeds from the Son.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] There is this, too, in the determination of the Fifth Council: “In
        all matters we follow the holy Fathers and Doctors of the Church:
        Athanasius, Hilary, Basil, Gregory the theologian, and Gregory of Nyssa,
        Ambrose, Augustine, Theophilus, John of Constantinople, Cyril, Leo,
        Proclus; and we accept what they have set down on the correct belief and
        the condemnation of heretics.” But it is manifest from many testimonies
        of Augustine, especially his On the Trinity and his Exposition of John,
        that the Holy Spirit is from the Son. It must, then, be conceded that
        the Holy Spirit is from the Son just as He is from the Father.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] This is also clarified by straight reasoning. For among things, with
        the material distinction gone (and in the divine Persons such can have
        no place), one discovers no differentiation except by some opposition.
        For things which have no opposition to one another can be simultaneously
        in something identical; thus, no distinction can be caused by them. Take
        white and triangular. Although they are diverse, they can, because they
        are not opposed, be in an identical thing. But one must set down,
        according to the documents of the Catholic faith, that the Holy Spirit
        is distinct from the Son; otherwise, there would not be a Trinity, but a
        duality of Persons. Therefore, a distinction of this kind must take
        place through some opposition. But it is not the opposition of
        affirmation and negation. for such is the distinction of being from
        non-being. Nor is it the opposition of privation and habit, for such is
        the distinction of the perfect from the imperfect. Neither is it the
        opposition of contrariety, for such is the distinction of diversity of
        form. For contrariety as philosophers teach, is a “difference following
        on form.” And this difference is not suited to the divine Persons, since
        their form is one, just as their essence is. Hence, the Apostle says,
        speaking of the Son, “being in the form of God” (Phil. 2:6), the form,
        namely, of the Father.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Therefore, the conclusion remains that one divine Person is not
        distinguished from another except by the opposition of relation: thus,
        the Son is distinguished from the Father consequently to the relative
        opposition of father and son. It is because in the divine Persons there
        can be no relative opposition except, consequently, on origin. For a
        relative opposition is founded on quantity—say the double or the half;
        or on action and passion—say master and servant, mover and moved, father
        and son. Further, among the relative oppositions founded on quantity,
        some are founded on diversity of quantity—say the double and the half,
        the greater and the lesser, some on unity itself—say identity, which
        means one in substance, and equality, which means one in quantity, and
        similarity, which means one in quality. The divine Persons, therefore,
        cannot be distinguished by relations founded on diversity of quantity,
        because this would take away the equality of the three Persons. Nor,
        again, by the relations which are founded on unity, because relations of
        this kind cause no distinction; rather, in them one finds more of what
        pertains to agreement, although some of them may presuppose a
        distinction. In all relations founded on action and passion, however,
        there is always one of the two which is a subject and unequal in power
        to the other; here, exception is made only for the relations of origin,
        and in such there is no lesser indicated, because one finds there
        something producing that which is similar and equal to itself in nature
        and power. The conclusion, therefore, must be that the divine Persons
        cannot be distinguished except by relative opposition in origin.
        Therefore, if the Holy Spirit is distinguished from the Son, He is
        necessarily from the Son, for we do not say that the Son is from the
        Holy Spirit, since the Holy Spirit is, rather, said to be of the Son and
        given by the Son.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] Again, the Son is from the Father and so is the Holy Spirit.
        Therefore, the Father must be related both to the Son and the Holy
        Spirit as a principle to that which is from the principle. He is related
        to the Son by reason of paternity, but not to the Holy Spirit; for then
        the Holy Spirit would be the Son, because paternity is not said except
        of a son. There must, then, be another relation in the Father by which
        He is related to the Holy Spirit; and spiration is its name. In the same
        way, since there is in the Son a relation by which He is related to the
        Father, the name of which is sonship, there must also be in the Holy
        Spirit another relation by which He is related to the Father, and this
        is called procession. And thus, in accord with the origin of the Son
        from the Father, there are two relations, one in the originator, the
        other in the originated: to wit, paternity and sonship; and there are
        two others in reference to the Holy Spirit: namely, spiration and
        procession. Therefore, paternity and spiration do not constitute two
        Persons, but pertain to the one Person of the Father, for they have no
        opposition to one another. Therefore, neither would sonship and
        procession constitute two persons, but would pertain to one, unless they
        had an opposition to one another. But there is no opposition to assign
        save that by way of origin. Hence, there must be an opposition of origin
        between the Son and the Holy Spirit so that the one is from the other.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] What is more, when things come together by something common to them,
        they must, if they are to be distinguished, be distinguished by
        differences which belong per se and not accidentally to that common
        thing. Thus, man and horse meet in animal, and are distinguished from
        one another not by black and white, which are related accidentally to
        animal, but by rational and irrational, which are per se pertinent to
        animal. This is because animal is what has soul [ <i>animam</i> ], and
        this must be distinguished by having this or that kind of soul—say,
        rational or irrational. Now, manifestly, the Son and the Holy Spirit
        agree in their being from another, since each is from the Father. And in
        this the Father suitably differs from each, in that He can have no
        birth-origin [ <i>innascibilis</i> ]. Therefore, if the Holy Spirit be
        distinguished from the Son, this must take place by differences which
        per se divide this being from another. And such, indeed, can only be
        differences of the same genus—namely, pertaining to origin—so that one
        of them is from the other. One concludes, then, that the distinction of
        the Holy Spirit from the Son requires that He be from the Son.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] Let one say, further, that the Holy Spirit is distinguished from
        the Son not because He is from the Son, but by reason of their differing
        origin from the Father. The difficulty really returns to the same point,
        for, if the Holy Spirit is other than the Son, the origin or procession
        of each must be other. But two origins cannot be distinguished except by
        term, or by principle, or by subject. Thus, the origin of a horse
        differs from the origin of a cow by way of term, in that these two
        origins have their terms in natures diverse in species. There is
        difference by way of principle if we suppose that some animals in the
        same species are generated by the active power of the sun alone, and
        some others along with this power by the active power of the seed. There
        is difference by way of subject when the generation of this horse
        differs from that as the nature of the species is received in diverse
        matters. But this distinction on the part of subject can have no place
        in the divine Persons, since they are entirely immaterial. In the same
        way, also, on the part of the term, granting one may speak so, there can
        be no distinction of processions. For the divine nature, one and the
        same, which the Son receives by His birth, the Holy Spirit receives by
        His proceeding. It remains, therefore, that the distinction of each
        origin can be only on the part of the principle. Manifestly, of course,
        the principle of the origin of the Son is the Father alone. If,
        therefore, the principle of the procession of the Holy Spirit is the
        Father alone, the procession of the Holy Spirit will not be other than
        the generation of the Son; thus, neither will the Holy Spirit be
        distinct from the Son. Therefore, that there may be otherness in
        processions and otherness in those proceeding, one of necessity says
        that the Holy Spirit is not from the Father alone, but from the Father
        and the Son.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] But, again, if one says that the processions differ in principle,
        in that the Father produces the Son by way of intellect as Word, and the
        Holy Spirit by way of will as Love, it will be necessary to say that in
        accord with a difference of intellect and will in God the Father the two
        processions and the two proceeding are to be distinguished. Will and
        intellect in God the Father are not distinguished really, but only
        rationally, as was shown in Book I. It follows, then, that the two
        processions and the two proceeding differ only rationally. Now, things
        which differ only rationally are predicated of each other: it will be
        truly said that the divine intellect is the divine will, and conversely.
        Therefore, it will be true to say that the Holy Spirit is the Son, and
        conversely. This is the Sabellian impiety. Therefore, it does not
        suffice for the distinction of the Holy Spirit and the Son to say that
        the Son proceeds by way of intellect and the Holy Spirit by way of will,
        unless along with this one says the Holy Spirit is from the Son.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [12] There is more. From the very fact of saying that the Holy Spirit
        proceeds by way of will and the Son by way of intellect it follows that
        the Holy Spirit is from the Son. For love proceeds from a word: we are
        able to love nothing but that which a word of the heart conceives.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [13] Again, if one considers the diverse species of things, a certain
        order appears in them: the living are above the nonliving; animals are
        above plants; and man is above the other animals. And in each of these,
        different grades are discovered according to different species; hence,
        even Plato said that the species of things are numbers, which are varied
        in species by the addition and subtraction of unity. Hence, in
        immaterial substances there can be no distinction except that of order.
        But in the divine Persons who are entirely immaterial there can be no
        other order than that of origin. Therefore, there are not two Persons
        proceeding from one, unless one of those proceeds from a second. And
        thus, necessarily, the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [14] Moreover, the Father and the Son, unity of essence considered, do
        not differ save in this: He is the Father and He is the Son. So,
        anything other than this is common to the Father and the Son. But to be
        the principle of the Holy Spirit is not included in the notion of
        paternity and of sonship, for it is one relation by which the Father is
        Father, and another by which He is the principle of the Holy Spirit, as
        was said above. Therefore, to be the principle of the Holy Spirit is
        common to the Father and the Son.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [15] Furthermore, whenever one thing is not opposed to the essential
        intelligibility of another, there is no impossibility—unless, perhaps,
        accidentally—about their coming together. But to be the principle of the
        Holy Spirit is not contrary to the intelligibility of the Son: not in so
        far as He is God, because the Father is the principle of the Holy
        Spirit; nor in so far as He is Son, because the procession of the Holy
        Spirit is other than that of the Son. It is, of course, not repugnant to
        have what is from a principle according to one procession he the
        principle of another procession. It follows, then, that it is not
        impossible for the Son to be the principle of the Holy Spirit. But that
        which is not impossible can be. “In divinity being and possibility do
        not differ.” Therefore, the Son is the principle of the Holy Spirit.

        [1] There are some, pertinacious in their willful resistance to the
        truth, who make some points to the contrary which are hardly worth an
        answer. They say that our Lord, speaking of the procession of the Holy
        Spirit, says that He proceeds from the Father, without mentioning the
        Son. So one reads in John (15:26): “When the Paraclete cometh, whom I
        will send you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from
        the Father.” Hence, since nothing must be held about God which is not
        given in Scripture, it must not be said that the Holy Spirit proceeds
        from the Son.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] But this is entirely frivolous. For, by reason of unity of essence,
        what is said in the Scriptures about one Person ought to be understood
        of another, unless it is repugnant to His propriety as a Person, and
        this even if some exclusive phrase is added. For, although it says in
        Matthew (12:27): “No one knows the Son, but the Father,” neither the Son
        nor the Holy Spirit is, for all that, excluded from knowledge of the
        Son. Hence, even if it is said in the Gospel that the Holy Spirit does
        not proceed from any but the Father, this would not exclude His
        proceeding from the Son. For this is not repugnant to the propriety of
        the Son, as was shown. Neither is there cause to marvel if our Lord said
        that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father, saying nothing about
        Himself, His custom is to refer everything to His Father from whom He
        has whatever He has. Thus, He says in John (7:16): “My doctrine is not
        Mine, but His that sent Me.” Many things of this kind are discovered in
        the words of our Lord which establish in the Father the authority of the
        principle. And, for all that, in the passage just mentioned our Lord was
        not altogether silent about His being the principle of the Holy Spirit.
        He called Him “the Spirit of Truth,” and He had previously called
        Himself “the Truth” (John 24:6).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] They further object that in certain councils one finds it prohibited
        under penalty of anathema to add anything to the Creed ordered by the
        council. In this, they say, there is no mention of the procession of the
        Holy Spirit from the Son. And so they hold the Latins guilty of anathema
        because they have added this to the Creed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] But such arguments are inefficacious. For the declaration of the
        Synod of Chalcedon says that the Fathers gathered at Constantinople
        corroborated the doctrine of the Synod of Nicea. This they did, “not as
        though to imply that the doctrine was something less, but to declare by
        Scriptural testimonies the understanding of the Holy Spirit Of their
        predecessors against those who attempted to reject that understanding.”
        One must say, similarly, that the procession of the Holy Spirit from the
        Son is implicitly contained in the Creed of Constantinople, for the
        latter says that “He proceeds from the Father,” and what is understood
        of the Father must be understood of the Son, as was said. And the
        authority of the Roman Pontiff sufficed for this addition; by this
        authority, too, all the ancient councils were confirmed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] They maintain, also, that the Holy Spirit, since He is simple,
        cannot be from two; and that the Holy Spirit, if He proceeds perfectly
        from the Father, does not proceed from the Son; and other arguments of
        this sort. These are easy to solve, even if one is but little skilled in
        theological matters. For the Father and the Son are a single principle
        of the Holy Spirit by reason of the unity of divine power, and by one
        production they produce the Holy Spirit; thus, also, the three Persons
        are one principle of creatures and by one action they produce creatures.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From what has been said, then, one must hold that in the divine
        nature three Persons subsist: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit;
        and that these three are one God, distinguished from one another by
        relations only. For the Father is distinguished from the Son by the
        relations of paternity and innascibility; the Son from the Father by the
        relation of sonship; the Father and the Son from the Holy Spirit by
        spiration, so to say; and the Holy Spirit from the Father and the Son by
        the procession of love, by this He proceeds from each of Them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Beside these three Persons, no fourth in the divine nature can be
        asserted. For the divine Persons, since they agree in essence, cannot be
        distinguished except by relation of origin, as is clear. These relations
        of origin one must understand not as a procession which inclines to what
        is without—for what proceeds thus is not co-essential with its
        principle—one must understand them as proceeding within. Of course, a
        thing which proceeds and remains its own principle is found only in the
        operation of the intellect and will, as was made clear. Hence, the
        divine Persons cannot be multiplied save by the requirements of the
        procession of the intellect and will in God. It is, of course, not
        possible that there be in God more than one proceeding within His
        understanding, because His act of understanding is one, simple, and
        perfect, for in, understanding Himself He understands all things else.
        And thus, there can be in God but one proceeding of the Word. In like
        manner, too, must the proceeding of Love be one only, for the divine
        will act is one and simple-by loving Himself He loves all things else.
        Therefore, it is not possible that in God there be more than two Persons
        proceeding: one by way of intellect, as Word—namely the Son; the other
        by way of Love, as the Holy Spirit. There is also one Person who does
        not proceed-namely, the Father. Therefore, in the Trinity there can be
        only three Persons.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Again, let the divine Persons be distinguished by proceeding. But
        the mode of a person in proceeding can be but threefold: namely, to be
        altogether not proceeding, which is the Father’s mode; to be proceeding
        from one who does not proceed, which is the Son’s; to be proceeding from
        one who Proceeds, which is the Holy Spirit’s. Therefore, it is
        impossible to assert more than three Persons.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] We grant, of course, that in other living things relations of origin
        can be multiplied—for example, in human nature there can be many fathers
        and many sons—but in the divine nature this is altogether impossible.
        For sonship, since in one nature it is of one species, cannot be
        multiplied except by matter or by subject; this is also the case with
        other forms. Hence, since in God there is neither matter nor subject,
        and since the relations are themselves subsistent (which is clear from
        what was said above) it is impossible that there be a plurality of
        sonships of God. The same reasoning holds for the other Persons. Thus,
        in God there are only three Persons.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Of course, an objector may say that in the Son who is perfect God
        there is infinite intellective power, and thus He can produce a word; in
        like fashion, since there is in the Holy Spirit infinite goodness which
        is the principle of communication, He will be able to communicate the
        divine nature to another person. But such a one ought to consider that
        the Son is God, as begotten not as begetting; and so the intellective
        power is in Him as proceeding in the way of the Word, and not in Him as
        producing the Word. Similarly, since the Holy Spirit is God as
        proceeding, there is infinite goodness in Him as the Person receiving,
        and not in Him as communicating the infinite goodness to another. For
        the Persons are not distinguished from one another except by relations,
        as is clear from the things said above. Therefore, all the fullness of
        divinity is the Son, numerically identical with that in the Father, but
        with the relation of birth, as it is in the Father with the relation of
        active generation. Hence, if the relation of the Father be attributed to
        the Son, all distinction is removed. And the same reasoning holds for
        the Holy Spirit.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Now, this divine Trinity has a likeness in the human mind which we
        can consider. For the mind itself, because it understands itself,
        conceives within itself a word. And this is nothing but the intelligible
        intention of the mind, which is called the mind understood and exists
        within the mind. When this mind further loves itself, it produces its
        very self in the will as beloved. Of course, it does not proceed further
        within itself, but the cycle is concluded when by love it returns to the
        very substance from which the proceeding began by the intention
        understood. The proceeding extends to external effects when from love of
        itself it proceeds to make something. Thus, three things are discovered
        in the mind: the mind itself, the source of the proceeding, existing in
        its nature; and mind conceived in the intellect; and mind beloved in the
        will. For all that~ these three are not one nature, for the mind’s act
        of understanding is not its being; and its will act is neither its
        being, nor its act of understanding. For this reason, also, the mind
        understood and the mind beloved are not persons, since they are not
        subsisting. Even the mind itself existing in its nature is not a person,
        for it is not the whole which subsists, but a part of the subsistent;
        namely, of the man.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Therefore, in our mind one finds a likeness of the divine Trinity in
        regard to proceeding, “and this multiplies the Trinity.” For from the
        exposition this is clear: there is in the divine nature God unbcgotten,
        who is the source of the whole divine proceeding, namely the Father;
        there is God begotten by way of a word conceived in the intellect,
        namely the Son; there is God by way of love proceeding, namely the Holy
        Spirit. Of course, no further proceeding is discovered within the divine
        nature, but only a proceeding to exterior effects. In this, of course,
        the mind fails in representing the divine Trinity: the Father and the
        Son and the Holy Spirit are one in nature, and in each of these the
        person is perfect, simply because the act of understanding and the act
        of will are the divine being itself, as was shown. For this reason one
        considers the divine likeness in man just as one considers the likeness
        of Hercules in stone: with regard to the representation of form, not
        with regard to the agreement of nature. And so one says that in the mind
        of man there is the “image of God” according to the Word: “Let us make
        man to our image and likeness” (Gen. 1:26).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] One also finds in other things a likeness of the divine Trinity, so
        far as anything in its substance is one, formed in a kind of species,
        ordered in some fashion. just as is clear from the things said, the
        conception of the intellect in intelligible being is like the species
        formation in natural being, love, of course, is like the inclination or
        order in a thing of nature. And so the species of things in nature from
        afar represent the Son; their order, of course, the Holy Spirit.
        Accordingly, by reason of the remote and obscure representation in
        irrational things, one speaks of the “vestige” of the Trinity in them,
        not of the “image”; so we read in Job (11:7): “Would you comprehend the
        steps of God?” and so forth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] And this is enough to say about the divine Trinity for the present.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Since, of course, when divine generation was dealt with above, it
        was said of the Son of God, our Lord Jesus Christ, that some things
        belong to Him in His divine nature, and some in that human nature by the
        assumption of which in time the eternal Son chose to be incarnate, it
        now remains to speak of the mystery of the Incarnation itself. Indeed,
        among divine works, this most especially exceeds the reason: for nothing
        can be thought of which is more marvelous than this divine
        accomplishment: that the true God, the Son of God, should become true
        man. And because among them all it is most marvelous, it follows that
        toward faith in this particular marvel all other miracles are ordered,
        since “that which is greatest in any genus seems to be the cause of the
        others.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] This marvelous incarnation of God, of course, which divine authority
        hands down, we confess. For it says in John (2:14): “The Word was made
        flesh, and dwelt among us.” And the Apostle Paul says: “Who being in the
        form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: But emptied
        Himself, taking the form of a servant being made in the likeness of men,
        and in habit found as a man” (Phil. 2:6-7).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] This is also shown clearly by the words of our Lord Jesus Christ
        Himself, since at times He says lowly and human things of Himself, such
        as: “The Father is greater than I” (John 14:28) and “My soul is
        sorrowful even unto death” (Matt 26:38), which become Him in His assumed
        humanity, but at times He says sublime and divine things, such as: “I
        and the Father are one” (John 10: 30) and “whatever the Father has is
        Mine (John 16:15), which certainly belong to Him in His divine nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Even the things which we read about what our Lord did show this.
        That He feared, that He was grieved, that He thirsted, that He died:
        these belong to the human nature. That by His own power He healed the
        sick, that He raised the dead, that He effectively commanded the
        elements of the world, that He drove out devils, that He forgave sins,
        that when He chose He rose from the dead: these reveal the divine power
        in Him.

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] There are, of course, those who have debased Scripture and have
        conceived a perverse understanding of the divinity and humanity of our
        Lord Jesus Christ.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] For there have been some, like Ebion and Cerinthus, and, later, Paul
        of Samosata and Photinus, who confess in Christ a human nature only. But
        divinity was in Him, not by nature, but by a kind of outstanding
        participation of divine glory which He had merited by His deeds. Hence,
        they fabricate, as was said above.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] But—to pass over the other things said against this position
        above—this position destroys the Incarnation’s mystery.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] For, according to this position, God would not have assumed flesh to
        become man; rather, an earthly man would have become God. Thus, the
        saying of John (1:14) would not be true: “The Word was made flesh”; on
        the contrary, flesh would have been made the Word.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] In the same way, also, emptying Himself and descent would not fit
        the Son of God; rather, glorification and ascent would fit the man.
        Thus, there would be no truth in the Apostle’s saying: “Who being in the
        form of God emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant” (Phil. 2:6-7,
        9), but only in the exaltation of the man to divine glory about which he
        adds later: “For which cause God also has exalted Him.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Neither would there be truth in our Lord’s word: “I came down from
        heaven,” but only in His saying: “I ascend to My Father,” in spite of
        the Scripture which joins these two, for our Lord says: “No one has
        ascended into heaven, except him who descended from heaven, the Son of
        man who is in heaven” (John 6:38; 20:17; 3:13); and, again: “He who
        descended is the same who ascended above all the heavens” (Eph. 4: 10).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Thus, also, it would not become the Son to have been sent by the
        Father, nor to have gone out from the Father to come into the world, but
        only to go to the Father, although He Himself, for all that, unites the
        two, saying: “I go to Him that sent Me?” and “I came forth from the
        Father, and am come into the world: again I leave the world, and I go to
        the Father” (John 16:5, 28). In each of these cases both the humanity
        and the divinity is established.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] There also have been others who denied the truth of the Incarnation
        and introduced a kind of fictional incarnation. The Manicheans said that
        God’s Son assumed not a real, but a phantasy, body; thus, He could not
        be a true man, but only an apparent one. Consequently, the things He did
        as man—such as being born, eating, drinking, walking, suffering, and
        being buried—were done not in truth but in a kind of false appearance.
        Thus, clearly, they reduce the whole mystery of the Incarnation to a
        fiction.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] First, of course, this position wipes out the authority of
        Scripture. Since the likeness of flesh is not flesh, the likeness of
        walking not walking, and so of the rest, Scripture lies in saying: “The
        Word was made flesh” (John 1:14)—if it was but phantasy flesh. It also
        lies when it says that Jesus Christ walked, ate, died, and was buried—if
        these things took place only in an apparent phantasy. But, if even in a
        moderate way the authority of Scripture be decried, there will no longer
        be anything fixed in our faith which depends on sacred Scripture, as in
        John’s words (20:31): “These are written, that you may believe.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Someone can say, of course, that the truth is certainly not lacking
        to sacred Scripture when it deals with an appearance as though it were a
        fact, because the likenesses of things are equivocally and figuratively
        called by the names of the things themselves; a man in a picture, for
        example, is called a man equivocally. Sacred Scripture itself is
        accustomed to this manner of speech; thus the Apostle: “And the rock was
        Christ” (1 Cor. 10:4). Of course, many bodily things are found to be
        said of God in Scripture by reason of mere metaphor: so He is named
        lamb, or lion, or something of the sort.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] However, although the likenesses of things may at times take the
        names of things by equivocation, it is nonetheless unsuitable to sacred
        Scripture to set down the whole story of one event under such an
        equivocation, and so to do it that from other Scriptural passages the
        plain truth cannot be had. For from this would follow not men’s
        instruction, but their deception instead, whereas the Apostle says: “For
        what things soever were written, were written for our learning” (Rom.
        15:4); and in 2 Timothy (3:16): “All scripture, inspired of God, is
        profitable to teach and to instruct.” Moreover, the entire Gospel story
        would be but poetry and fable if it narrated the apparent similarities
        of things as the things themselves; whereas 2 Peter (1:16) says: “For we
        have not by following artificial fables made known to you the power of
        the Lord, Jesus Christ.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] But, when the Scriptural narrative is of things which had
        appearance, but not existence, the very manner of the narration makes us
        understand this. For Genesis (18:2, 27, 25) says: “And when he”
        (Abraham) “had lifted up his eyes, there appeared to him three men.”
        This gives us to understand that they were men by appearance. And so in
        them he adored God and acknowledged Divinity, and he said: “I will speak
        to my Lord whereas I am but dust and ashes”; and again: “This is not
        beseeming You, You who judge all the earth.” However, the fact that
        Isaiah and Ezekiel and other Prophets have described some things which
        were seen in imagination produces no error, for they do not set these
        things down in the narration of history, but in the description of
        prophecy. And they nonetheless add something which designates
        apparition: thus, Isaiah (6:1): “I saw the Lord sitting,” and so forth;
        Ezekiel (1:3-4; 8:3): “The hand of the Lord was there upon him. And I
        saw,” and so forth: “The likeness of a hand was put forth and took me
        and brought me in the vision of God into Jerusalem.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Even the fact that Scripture sometimes speaks of things divine
        through a comparison cannot produce error, and this both for this
        reason—the likenesses are taken from things so lowly it is manifest that
        the passage deals with similitude and not with the existence of things;
        and for this reason—some things are found said properly in Scripture
        through which the truth is expressly clarified, and this truth in other
        places is hidden under similitudes. This, indeed, does not take place in
        this case, for there is no Scriptural authority touching what is read of
        Christ’s humanity which precludes the truth of what is said.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Perhaps one may say that we are given so to understand by the words
        of the Apostle: “God sending His own Son, in the likeness of sinful
        flesh” (Rom. 8:3). Or by this in Philippians (2:7): “Made in the
        likeness of men, and in habit found as a man.” But here the meaning is
        excluded by what is added, for it does not merely say “in the likeness
        of flesh,” but adds “sinful,” because Christ had, indeed, true flesh,
        but not “sinful flesh”, for there was no sin in Him. But His was similar
        to “sinful flesh,” for His was the,,captive of suffering, and such did
        the flesh of man become through sin. In the same way, a fictional
        understanding is excluded from the saying, “Made in the likeness of
        men,” by the addition: “taking the form of a servant.” It is clear that
        “form” is put here in place of nature rather than of likeness because he
        had said: “Who being in the form of God” (Phil. 7:6). There, for nature,
        “form” is put, for the words do not assert that Christ was God by some
        mere similarity. Further exclusion of fictional understanding is in the
        addition: “Becoming obedient even unto death” (Phil. 2:8). Likeness is
        not, therefore, taken for the likeness of an appearance, but for natural
        likeness of the species; as all men are said to he alike in species.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] But sacred Scripture more expressly excludes the suspicion of
        apparition. For we read in Matthew (14:26-27) that the disciples, seeing
        Jesus “walking upon the sea, were troubled, saying: It is an apparition.
        And they cried out for fear.” This very suspicion of theirs our Lord
        consequently took away; and so the addition: “And immediately Jesus
        spoke to them saying: Be of good heart; it is I, fear not.” However one
        takes it, this appears irrational: that it should escape the disciples’
        notice that He had assumed but a phantasy body, since He had chosen them
        to give testimony of the truth about Him from what they “had seen and
        heard” (Acts 4:20); or, if it did not escape their notice, then the
        thought of an apparition should not have stricken them with fear.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] But again, more expressly, the suspicion of a phantasy body was
        removed from the minds of the disciples by our Lord after the
        resurrection. For we read in Luke (24:37-39) that the disciples, “being
        troubled and frightened, supposed that they saw a spirit,” namely, when
        they saw Jesus. “And He said to them: Why are you troubled and why do
        thoughts arise in your hearts? See My hands and feet, that it is I
        Myself. Handle and see: for a spirit has not flesh and bones, as you see
        Me to have.” For in vain did He offer Himself to be touched, if he had
        had none but a phantasy body.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] Again, the Apostles show themselves suitable witnesses of Christ,
        for Peter says: “Him,” namely, Jesus, “God raised up the third day, and
        gave Him to be made manifest. Not to all the people, but to witnesses
        preordained by God, even to us, who did eat and drink with Him after He
        arose again from the dead” (Acts 10:40-41). And John the Apostle, at the
        beginning of his Epistle, says: “That which we have heard, which we have
        seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have
        handled of the word of life: we witness” (1 John 1:1-2). But there can
        be no efficacy in witness to the truth based on things done, not in real
        existence, but in appearance only. If, therefore, the body of Christ was
        a phantasy and He did not truly eat and drink, and if He was not truly
        seen and handled, but in phantasy only, no fitness is found in the
        testimony of the Apostles about Christ. And thus, “vain is their
        preaching, and our faith is vain,” as Paul says (1 Cor. 15:14).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] But, again, if Christ had no true body, He did not truly die.
        Therefore, neither is He truly risen. Therefore, the Apostles are false
        witnesses of Christ when they preach to the world that He has risen.
        Hence, the Apostle says in the same place: “We are found false witnesses
        of God: because we have given testimony against God, that He has raised
        up Christ; whom He has not raised up” (1 Cor. 15:15).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [12] What is more, falsity is not a suitable way to the truth. As Sirach
        (34:4) has it: “What truth can come from that which is false?” But
        Christ’s coming into the world was for the manifestation of truth. He
        Himself says: ‘Tor this was I born, and for this came I into the world;
        that I should give testimony to the truth” (John 18:37). There was not
        then, any falsity in Christ. But there would have been if what He says
        of Himself had been about mere appearance, for the “false is that which
        is not as it seems.” Therefore, everything said of Christ was in accord
        with real existence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [13] Moreover, we read in Romans (5:9) that “we are justified by His
        blood” and in the Apocalypse (5:9): “You have redeemed us, O Lord, in
        your blood.” Therefore, if Christ did not have true blood, He did not
        truly shed it for us. Therefore, we are neither truly justified nor
        truly redeemed. Therefore, there is no usefulness to being in Christ.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [14] Again, if there is nothing but apparition to be understood of
        Christ’s coming into the world, nothing new took place in Christ’s
        coming. For, in the Old Testament, God appeared to Moses and the
        Prophets under multiple figures, as even the writings of the New
        Testament witness. Yet this position wipes out the whole teaching of the
        New Testament. Therefore, it was not a phantasy body, but a true one,
        which the Son of God assumed.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        11] The opinions of Valentine, of course, were close to these in regard
        to the mystery of the Incarnation. For he said that Christ did not have
        an earthly body, but brought one from heaven; that He received nothing
        from the Virgin Mother, but passed through her as through an aqueduct.
        The occasion of his error he seems to have found in some words of sacred
        Scripture. For we read in John (3:13, 31): “No man has ascended into
        heaven, but He that descended from heaven, the Son of man who is in
        heaven... He that comes from above, is above all”; and in John (6:38)
        our Lord says: “I came down from heaven not to do My own will but the
        will of Him that sent Me.” And 1 Corinthians (15:47) has: “The first man
        was of the earth, earthly; the second man, from heaven, heavenly.” All
        of these they want to have so understood that one believes that Christ
        came down from heaven even in the body.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] But this position of Valentine and that of the Manicheans just
        mentioned proceed from one false root: they believed that all these
        earthly things were created by the devil. And so, since “the Son of God
        appeared that He might destroy the works of the devil,” as 1 John (3:8)
        says, it was unsuitable for Him to assume a body from a creature of the
        devil, since Paul also says: “What fellowship has light with darkness?
        What concord has Christ with Belial?” (Il Cor. 6:14-15).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        13] And since things which come from the same root produce similar
        fruits, this position lapses into the same discordant falsity as the
        previous one. For in every single species there are determined essential
        principles (matter, I mean, and form) from which comes the essential
        constitution of the species in things composed of matter and form. But
        just as human flesh and bone and the like are the proper matter of man,
        so fire, air, earth, and water and the like, such as we sense, are the
        matter of flesh and bone and parts of this kind. Therefore, if the body
        of Christ was not earthly, it was not true flesh and true bone, but in
        appearance only. And thus, also, He was not a true, but an apparent man,
        whereas, as was noted, He Himself nonetheless says: “A spirit has not
        flesh and bones, as you see Me to have (Luke 24:39).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] A heavenly body, moreover, is in its nature incorruptible and
        inalterable, and cannot be moved outside of its own place. Of course, it
        was not seemly that the Son of God should diminish the dignity of the
        nature He assumed, but that He exalt it. Therefore, He did not carry a
        celestial or incorruptible body below; rather, He assumed an earthly
        body, capable of suffering, and rendered it incorruptible and heavenly.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Again, the Apostle says about the Son of God that He “was made of
        the seed of David according to the flesh” (Rom. 1:3). But the body of
        David was earthly. Therefore, too, was the body of Christ.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] The Apostle further says that “God sent His Son, made of a woman”
        (Gal. 4:4). And Matthew (1:16) says: “Jacob begot Joseph the husband of
        Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.” But He would not be
        called made of her, or born of her, if He had only passed through her as
        a channel, assuming nothing from her. Therefore, He assumed His body
        from her.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Furthermore, Mary could not be called the Mother of Jesus, which the
        Evangelist (Mat. 1:18) witnesses, unless He had received something from
        her.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] Again, the Apostle says: “Both He that sanctifies,” namely, Christ,
        “and they who are sanctified,” namely, Christ’s faithful, “are all of
        one. For which cause He is not ashamed to call them brethren saying: I
        will declare your name to My brethren”; and farther on: “Therefore,
        because the children are partakers of the flesh and blood, He also
        Himself in like manner has been partaker of the same” (Heb. 2:11-12,
        14). But if Christ had a heavenly body only, clearly, since we have an
        earthly body, we are not one with Him, and, consequently, we cannot be
        called His brothers. Neither did He Himself partake of flesh and blood,
        for we know that flesh and blood are composed of the lower elements, and
        are not of the celestial nature. Plainly, therefore, the position
        aforesaid is contrary to the Apostolic teaching.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] The points on which they rely are clearly frivolous. For Christ did
        not descend from heaven according to soul or to body, but inasmuch as He
        was God. And this can be gathered from the very words of our Lord. For,
        when He was saying: “No man has ascended into heaven, but He that
        descended from heaven,” he added: “the Son of Man who is in heaven”
        (John 3:13); in which He is pointing out that He has so descended from
        heaven that He has not, for all that, ceased to be in heaven. But this
        is proper to deity: so to be on earth as to fill the heaven also, as
        Jeremiah (23:24) has it: “I fill heaven and earth.” Therefore, the Son
        of God does not have to descend from heaven by a local motion, for what
        is moved locally so approaches one place as to withdraw from another.
        Therefore, the Son of God is said to have descended in that He joined an
        earthly substance to Himself: just as the Apostle calls Him ‘emptied” in
        that He took the fonn of a servant, in such wise, nonetheless, that He
        did not lose the nature of divinity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] However, that which they assume for the root of this position the
        foregoing shows to be false, for it was made plain in Book II that
        bodily things are not from the devil, but are made by God.

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Even more irrational than these were the errors of Apollinaris about
        the mystery of the Incarnation. Nonetheless, he agrees with those
        mentioned in one thing: Christ’s body was not assumed from the Virgin,
        but (and this is a greater impiety) he says that something of the Word
        was changed into the flesh of Christ The occasion of his error he finds
        in John (1:24): “The Word was made flesh.” He thought this must be
        understood as though the Word Himself were changed into flesh, as the
        other text in John (2:9) is understood: “When the steward tasted the
        water made wine.” For this latter is said because the water was changed
        into wine.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] The impossibility in this error is easy to grasp from the things
        shown above. For it was shown that God is entirely immutable, but
        whatever is changed into another is manifestly mutable. Since, then, the
        Word of God is true God, as was shown, it is impossible that the Word of
        God be changed into flesh.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] The Word of God, again, since He is God, is simple, for it was shown
        above that there is no composition in God. Therefore, if something of
        the Word of God is changed into flesh, the whole Word must be changed.
        But what is changed into another ceases to be what it was before; just
        as the water changed into wine is no longer water, but wine. Therefore,
        after the Incarnation, according to the position described the Word will
        simply not be. And this is evidently impossible: both because the Word
        is eternal, as in John (1:1): “In the beginning was the Word”; as well
        as because after the Incarnation Christ is said to be the Word of God,
        as in the Apocalypse (19:13): “He was clothed with a garment sprinkled
        with blood; and His name is called THE WORD OF GOD.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] There is more. Things which do not share matter and are not in one
        genus cannot possibly undergo conversion into one another. For from a
        line whiteness is not made: they are of different genera; nor can an
        elementary body be converted into one of the celestial bodies, or into
        some incorporeal substance, nor conversely, since they have no matter in
        common. But the Word of God, since He is God, has neither genus nor
        matter in common with anything else whatsoever, for God is not in a
        genus and has no matter. It is, therefore, impossible that the Word was
        converted into flesh or into anything else whatever.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Furthermore, it is essential to flesh, to bone, to other parts of
        this sort that they be of determined matter. Therefore, if the Word of
        God be converted into flesh, as the position described holds, it will
        follow that there was not in Christ true flesh or anything else of the
        sort. And thus, also, He will not be true man, but an apparent one only;
        and so for the other points which we made against Valentine previously.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Plainly, then, the saying of John, “The Word was made flesh,” must
        not be understood as though the Word had been changed into flesh, but
        that He assumed flesh so as to dwell with men and appear visible to
        them. Hence there is added: “And dwelt among us, and we saw His glory,”
        and so forth; just as Baruch (3:38) also says of God: “He was seen upon
        earth, and conversed with men.”

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] It is, however, not only about the body of Christ but also about His
        soul that one finds some bad opinions.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] For Arius held that in Christ there was no soul, but that He assumed
        only flesh, and that divinity stood to this as soul. And he seems to
        have been led to this position by a certain necessity. For he wanted to
        maintain that the Son of God was a creature and less than the Father,
        and so for his proof he picked up those Scriptural passages which show
        human infirmity in Christ. And to keep anyone from refuting him by
        saying that the passages he picked referred to Christ not in His divine,
        but in His human, nature, he evilly removed the soul from Christ to this
        purpose: since some things are not harmonious with a human body, that He
        wondered, for example, that He feared, that He prayed—all such must
        necessarily imply the inferiority of the Son of God Himself. Of course,
        he picked up for the assertion of his position the words of John just
        mentioned, “The Word was made flesh,” and from this he wanted to gather
        that the Word only assumed flesh, not a soul. And in this position even
        Apollinaris followed him.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] But it is clear from what has been said that this position is
        impossible. For it was shown Ames that God cannot be the form of a body.
        Since, therefore, the Word of God is God, as was shown, it is impossible
        that the Word of God be the form of a body, so as to be able to stand as
        a soul to flesh.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] This argument, of course, is useful against Apollinaris, who
        confessed the Word of God to be true God; and granted Arius would deny
        this last, the argument just given goes against him, also. For it is not
        God alone who cannot be the form of a body, neither can any of the
        supercelestial spirits among whom Arius held the Son of God supreme.
        Exception might be made for the position of Origen, who held that human
        souls were of the very same species and nature as the supercelestial
        spirits. The falsity of this opinion was explained above.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Take away, moreover, what is of the essence of man, and no true man
        can be. Clearly, of course, the soul is chiefly of the essence of man,
        since it is his form. Therefore, if Christ had no soul He was not true
        man, whereas the Apostle does call Him man: “There is one mediator of
        God and men, the man Christ Jesus” (1 Tim. 2:5).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] It is on the soul, furthermore, that not only man’s essence, but
        that of his single parts, depends; and so, with the soul gone, the eye,
        the flesh, and the bone of a dead man are equivocally named, “like a
        painted or a stone eye.” Therefore, if in Christ there was no soul, of
        necessity there was neither true flesh in Him nor any of the other parts
        of man, whereas our Lord says that He has these in Himself: “A spirit
        has not flesh and bones, as you see Me to have (Luke 24:39).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Further, what is generated from another cannot be called his son
        unless he comes forth in the same species; the maggot is not called the
        son of the animal from which it is generated. But, if Christ had no
        soul, He was not of the same species as other men, for things which
        differ in form cannot be identical in species. Therefore, one will not
        be able to say that Christ is the Son of the Virgin Mary or that she is
        His Mother. Nonetheless, Scripture asserts this in the Gospels (Mat.
        1:18; Luke 7:7).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] There is mo re. The Gospel expressly says that Christ had a soul;
        Matthew (26:38) for instance: “My soul is sorrowful even unto death,”
        and John (17:2.7): “Now is My soul troubled.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] And lest they say perhaps that the very Son of God is called soul
        because in their position He stands to the flesh as soul, one must take
        our Lord’s own saying: “I have power to lay My soul down: and I have
        power to take it up again” (John 10:18). From this one understands that
        there is another than the soul in Christ, which had the power of laying
        the soul down and taking it up again. It was, of course, not in the
        power of the body to be united to the Son of God or be separated from
        Him, since this, too, exceeds the power of nature. One must, then,
        understand that in Christ the soul was one thing and the divinity of the
        Son of God another, to whom such power justly is attributed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] Another reason: Sorrow, anger and the like are passions of the
        sensitive soul; the Philosopher makes this plain.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] But, since one can say that the human things in the Gospels are
        said of Christ metaphorically, just as the sacred Scriptures speak of
        God in many places, one must take something which is understood properly
        of necessity. For, just as other bodily things which the Evangelists
        relate of Christ are understood properly and not metaphorically, so it
        must not be understood of Christ metaphorically that He ate and that He
        hungered. Only he who has a sensitive soul hungers, since hunger is the
        appetite for food. Necessarily, then, Christ had a sensitive soul.

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Won over, however, by this Gospel testimony, Apollinaris confessed
        that there was a sensitive soul in Christ; nonetheless, it was without
        mind and intellect, so that the Word of God was in that soul in place of
        intellect and mind.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2.] But even this is not sufficient to avoid the awkward consequences
        described, for man gets his human species from his having a human mind
        and reason. Therefore, if Christ did not have these, He was not true
        man, nor was He of the same species with us. For a soul which lacks
        reason belongs to a species other than that of the soul which has
        reason. For, according to the Philosopher [ <i>Metaphysics</i> VIII, 3],
        in definitions and species any essential difference which is added or
        subtracted varies the species, just as unity does in numbers. But
        rational is the specific difference. Therefore, if in Christ there was a
        sensitive soul without reason, it was not of the same species with our
        soul, which does have reason. Neither, then, was Christ Himself of the
        same species with us.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Again, among the sensible souls themselves which lack reason there
        exists diversity by reason of species. This appears from consideration
        of the irrational animals which differ from one another in species;
        nonetheless, each of them has its species according to its proper soul.
        Thus, then, the sensitive soul lacking reason is, so to say, one genus
        including within itself many species. But nothing is in a genus which is
        not in one of its species. If, then, the soul of Christ was in the genus
        of sensitive soul lacking reason, it must have been included in one of
        its species; for example, it was in the species of lion soul, or some
        other beast. And this is entirely absurd.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] The body, moreover, is compared to the soul as matter to form, and
        as instrument to principal agent. But the matter must be proportionate
        to the form, and the instrument to the principal agent. Therefore,
        consequent on the diversity of souls, there must be a diversity of
        bodies. And this is sensibly evident, for in diverse animals one finds
        diverse dispositions of the members, in which they concord with the
        diverse dispositions of the souls. Therefore, if in Christ there was not
        a soul such as our soul is, neither would He have had members like the
        human members.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] There is more. Since, according to Apollinaris, the Word of God is
        true God. wonder cannot be seemly in Him, for we wonder at those things
        whose cause we ignore. But, in the same way, wonder cannot be fitting
        for the sensitive soul, since solicitude for the knowledge of causes
        does not belong to the sensitive soul. But there was wonder in Christ;
        so one proves from the Gospels. It says in Matthew (8:10) that Jesus
        heard the words of the centurion and “marveled.” One must, then, in
        addition to the divinity of the Word and His sensitive soul put in
        Christ that which can make wonder seemly in Him; namely, a human mind.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Manifestly, therefore, from the aforesaid there was in Christ a
        human body and a true human soul. Thus, therefore, John’s saying (1:14),
        ‘The Word was made flesh,” is not thus to be understood, as though the
        Word has been converted into flesh; or as though the Word has assumed
        the flesh only; or with a sensitive soul without a mind; but after
        Scripture’s usual manner the part is put for the whole, so that one
        says: “The Word was made man.” “Soul” is sometimes used in place of man
        in Scripture; Exodus (1:5) says: “And all the souls that came out of
        Jacob’s thigh were seventy”; in the same way, also, “flesh” is used for
        the whole man; Isaiah (40:5) says: “All flesh together shall see that
        the mouth of the Lord has spoken.” Thus, then, “flesh” is here used for
        the whole man, also, to express the weakness of the human nature which
        the Word of God assumed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] But, if Christ had human flesh and a human soul, as was shown, it is
        plain that there was no soul of Christ before His body’s conception. For
        it was shown that human souls do not pre-exist their proper bodies.
        Hence is clear the falsity of that tenet of Origen, who said that in the
        beginning, before all bodily creatures, the soul of Christ was created
        with all other spiritual creatures and assumed by the Word of God, and
        that finally, toward the end of the ages, for men’s salvation it was
        endowed with flesh.

        without a human soul, as Arius and Apollinaris held. Since, then, these

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Now, then, Theodore of Mopsueste and Nestorius, his follower,
        offered one sort of opinion on the aforesaid union. They said that the
        human soul and the true human body came together in Christ by a natural
        union to constitute one man of the same species and nature with other
        men, and that in this man God dwelt as in His temple, namely, by grace,
        just as in other holy men. Hence, it says in John (2:19, 21), that He
        said to the Jews: “Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it
        up”; and later the Evangelist by way of exposition adds: “But he spoke
        of the temple of His body”; and the Apostle says: “In Him it has well
        pleased the Father, that all fullness should dwell” (Col. 1:19). And out
        of these arose further a certain affective union between that man and
        God, when that man cleaved to God with his own good will, and God lifted
        up that man with His will, in the words of John (8:29): “He that sent me
        is with me, and He has not left me alone: for I do always the things
        that please Him.” Let one thus understand that the union of that man to
        God is such as was the union of which the Apostle said: “He who is
        joined to God is one spirit” (1 Cor. 6:17). And just as, from the latter
        union, names which properly befit God are transferred to men so that
        they are called “gods,” and “sons of God,” and “lords,” and “holy ones,”
        and “christs”—as is clear from a diversity of places in Scripture; so
        also the divine names befit that man so that, by reason of God’s
        indwelling and the affective union, he is called God, and the Son of
        God, and Holy, and Christ. Nonetheless, because there was in that man a
        greater fullness of grace than in other holy men, he was before all the
        rest the temple of God, he was united to God, more closely in affection,
        and it was by a singular kind of privilege that he shared the divine
        names. And because of this outstanding grace he was established in a
        share of the divine dignity and honor—namely, that he be co-adored with
        God. So, then, consequently on the things just said there must be one
        Person of the Word of God, and another person of that man who is
        co-adored with the Word of God. And if one Person of each of the two be
        mentioned, this will be by reason of the affective union aforesaid; so
        that man and the Word of God may be called one Person, as is said of man
        and woman that “now they are not two, but one flesh” (Mat. 19:6).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Now, such a union does not bring it about that what is said of the first
        can be said of the second (for not everything which becomes the man is
        true of the woman, or conversely); therefore in the union of the Word
        and that man they think this must be observed: The things proper to that
        man and pertinent to the human nature cannot be said becomingly of God’s
        Word, or of God. just so it becomes that man that he was born of a
        virgin, that he suffered, died, was buried, and this kind of thing; and
        all of these, they assert, ought not be said of God, or of the Word of
        God. But, since there are certain names which, although they are chiefly
        befitting to God, are nonetheless communicated to men in a
        fashion—“christ,” for instance, “lord,” “holy,” and even “son of
        God”—nothing according to them keeps one from the use of such names in
        predication of the things just mentioned. For, according to them, we say
        fittingly that Christ, or the “Lord of glory,” or the “Saint of saints,”
        or “God’s son” was born of a virgin, suffered, died and was buried.
        Hence, too, the Blessed Virgin must not be named the mother of God, or
        of the Word of God, but the mother of Christ, they say.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] But let one earnestly consider the matter and he will see that the
        position described excludes the truth of the Incarnation. For, in that
        position, the Word of God was united to that man only through an
        indwelling by grace, on which a union of wills follows. But the
        indwelling of God’s Word in a man is not for God’s Word to be made
        flesh. For the Word of God and God Himself have been dwelling in all the
        holy men since the world was founded; as the Apostle says: “You are the
        temple of the living God; as God says: I will dwell in them” (2 Cor. 6:
        16). And this indwelling, for all that, cannot be called incarnation;
        otherwise, God would have repeatedly been made flesh since the beginning
        of the world. Nor does it suffice for the notion of incarnation if the
        Word of God or God dwelt in that man with a fuller grace, for “greater
        and less do not diversify the species of union.” Since the Christian
        religion is based on faith in the Incarnation, it is now quite evident
        that the position described removes the basis of the Christian religion.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] In addition is the very manner of speech of Scripture, which makes
        the falsity of the position described plain. For the indwelling of the
        Word of God in holy men is usually designated by Scripture in these
        ways: “The Lord spoke to Moses”; ‘ne word of the Lord came to Jeremiah”
        (or to some other Prophet); “The word of the Lord came to the hand of
        Haggai the Prophet.” But one never reads the Word of the Lord was made
        Moses, or Jeremiah, or one of the others. Yet thus uniquely was the
        union of God’s Word to the flesh of Christ marked by the Evangelist:
        “The Word was made flesh,” as was explained before. Clearly, then, it
        was not by indwelling alone that God’s Word was in the man, Christ, if
        we follow Scripture.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Again, whatever was made is what it was made; thus, what was made
        man is man, and what was made white is white. But God’s Word was made
        man, as is gathered from the foregoing. So God’s Word is man. It is, of
        course, impossible when two things differ in person, or hypostasis or
        supposit that one he predicated of the other, for, when we say “Man is
        animal,” that which is animal man is. And when we say “Man is white,”
        the signification is that man himself is white, although whiteness is
        other than the essence of humanity. Accordingly, there is no way to say
        Socrates is Plato or anyone of the singulars of his own or another
        species. So, if “the Word was made flesh,” that is, “man,” as the
        Evangelist witnesses (John 1:14). it is impossible that there be two
        persons, or hypostases, or supposits of the Word of God and of that man.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Demonstrative pronouns, moreover, refer to the person, or
        hypostasis, or supposit. For no one says “I run” when another is
        running, except figuratively, perhaps, when another is running in his
        place. But the man called Jesus says about Himself: “Before Abraham was
        made, I am”,and “I and the Father are one” (John 8:59; 10:30), and
        several other things which clearly pertain to the divinity of the Word.
        Therefore, the person and hypostasis of the man speaking is plainly the
        very person of the Word of God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] There is more. From our exposition one sees that the body of Christ
        did not descend from heaven as in Valentine’s error, nor did His soul
        according to Origen’s. What is left is this: one can say pertinently of
        the Word of God that He descended, not by some local motion, but by
        reason of the union to a lower nature. This was said above. But that
        man, speaking in His own person, says that He descended from heaven in
        John (6:51): “I am the living bread which came down from heaven.”
        Necessarily, then, the person and hypostasis of that man must be the
        person of the Word of God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] Again, to ascend into heaven plainly belongs to Christ the man who
        “was raised up while the disciples looked on,” as Acts (1:9) says. But
        to descend from heaven is proper to the Word of God. But the Apostle
        says: “He that descended is the same also that ascended above all the
        heavens” (Eph. 4:10). The very person and hypostasis of that man is,
        accordingly, the person and hypostasis of the Word of God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] Moreover, that whose origin is in the world, which had no being
        before the world, does not properly “come into the world.” But the man
        Christ in the flesh had His origin in the world, since He had a true,
        human, earthly body, as was shown. In His soul, as well, He had no being
        before He was in the world, for He had a true human soul in whose nature
        there is no being before it is united to the body. So, then, it does not
        belong to that man’s humanity to “come into the world.” He Himself says,
        of course, that He came into the world: “I came forth from the Father,”
        He says, “and I came into the world” (John 16:28). Plainly, then, what
        belongs to the Word of God is truly said of that man. For, that it
        belongs to the Word of God to come into the world John the Evangelist
        clearly shows (1:10-11): “He was in the world, and the world was made by
        Him, and the world knew Him not; He came unto His own.” So, the person
        and hypostasis of the man speaking is the person and hypostasis of the
        Word of God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] Again, the Apostle says: “When He comes into the world He says:
        Sacrifice and oblation You did not want: but a body You fitted for Me”
        (Heb. 10:5). But He who enters the world is the Word of God, as was
        shown. It is, then, to God’s very Word that a body is fitted; namely, so
        as to be His own body. And one could not say this if the hypostasis of
        God’s Word were not identified with that of the man. Therefore, the
        hypostasis of the Word of God and of that man are the very same.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] Every change or passion, furthermore, proper to ones body can be
        ascribed to him whose body it is, So, if the body of Peter is wounded,
        scourged, or dies, it can be said that Peter is wounded, scourged, or
        dies. But the body of that man is the body of the Word of God, as was
        just proved. Therefore, every suffering that took place in the body of
        that man can be ascribed to the Word of God. So it is right to say that
        the Word of God—and God—suffered, was crucified, died, and was buried.
        And this they used to deny.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [12] The Apostle also says: “It became Him, for whom are all things, and
        by whom are all things, who, had brought many children into glory, to
        perfect the author of their salvation, by His passion” (Heb. 2:10). Thus
        one holds: He for whom all things are, through whom all things are, He
        who leads men to glory, and who is the Author of human salvation
        suffered and died. But these four are God’s in a singular way; they are
        attributed to no other. For we read in Proverbs (16:4): “The Lord has
        made all things for Himself”; in John (1:3) of the Word of God: “All
        things were made by Him”; in the Psalmist: “The Lord will give grace and
        glory”; and elsewhere: “The salvation of the just is from the Lord” (Ps.
        83:12; 36:39). It is, then, plainly right to say that “God, God’s Word,
        suffered and died.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [13] There is more. Granted someone may be called a lord by sharing in
        lordship: no man at all, no creature in fact, can be called “Lord of
        glory,” for God alone by His nature possesses the glory of the future
        beatitude. But others do so by the gift of grace, and so the Psalmist
        says: “The Lord of hosts, He is the King of glory” (Ps. 2-3:8-10). But
        the Apostle says the Lord of glory was crucified (1 Cor. 2:8). Then
        truly it can be said: God was crucified.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [14] The Word of God, furthermore, is called God’s Son by nature, this
        was made plain above. But a man through the indwelling is called God’s
        son by the grace of adoption. But in the position now opposed, one must
        accept in our Lord Jesus Christ each of these modes of sonship, for the
        indwelling Word is the Son of God by nature; the man in whom He dwells
        is a son of God by the grace of adoption. Hence, that man cannot be
        called “the very own” or “only-begotten Son of God”; the Word of God
        alone in His own proper birth is uniquely begotten of the Father. But
        Scripture attributes the passion and death to God’s very own and
        only-begotten Son, for the Apostle says: “He has spared not even His own
        Son, but delivered Him up for us all” (Rom. 8:32); and John (3:16) says:
        “God so loved the world as to give His only~-begotten Son, that
        whosoever believes in Him may not perish, but may have life
        everlasting.” And that He spoke of “giving” Him over to death is clear
        from this: John had previously used the very same words about the
        crucified Son of Man when he said: “As Moses lifted up the serpent in
        the desert, so must the Son of man be lifted up, that whosoever believes
        in Him” (John 3:14), and the rest. And the Apostle makes the death of
        Christ an indication of the divine love for the world by saying: “God
        commends His charity towards us; because when as yet we were sinners,
        according to the time, Christ died for us” (Rom. 5:8-9). Rightly, then,
        does one say that the Word of God, that God, suffered and died.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [15] Again, one is said to be the son of a mother because his body is
        taken from her, although his soul is not taken from her, but has an
        exterior source. But the body of that man was taken from the Virgin
        Mother. Now, it was proved that the body of that man is the body of the
        natural Son of God, that is, of the Word of God. So it becomes us to say
        that the Blessed Virgin is “the Mother of the Word of God,” and even “of
        God”. Of course, the divinity of the Word is not taken from His Mother,
        for a son need not take the whole of his substance from his mother, but
        his body only.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [16] The Apostle says further that “God sent His Son, made of a woman”
        (Gal. 4:4). These words show us how to understand the sending of the Son
        of God: He is called sent thither, where He was made of a woman. This
        could not, of course, be true if the Son of God had not been before He
        was made of a woman, for that which is sent into another is understood
        to be previously to its being in that other to which it is sent. But
        that man, the Nestorian adoptive son, had no being before he was born of
        the woman. The Apostle’s word, “God sent His Son,” cannot, therefore, be
        understood of the adoptive son, but must be understood of the natural
        Son, that is, of God the Word of God. But if one is made of a woman, he
        is called the woman’s son. Therefore, God the Word of God is the Son of
        a woman.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [17] Perhaps we will be told not to understand the word of the Apostle
        thus: that the Son of God was sent to be made of a woman; but to
        understand it thus: that God’s Son, made of a woman and under the Law,
        was sent “that He might redeem them who were under the Law” (Gal. 4:5).
        And in this reading “his son” need not be understood of the natural Son,
        but of that man who was the son by adoption. But the very words of the
        Apostle exclude this meaning. For no one can release from the Law save
        him who exists above the Law, the author of the Law. But the Law was
        established by God. Only God, then, can take away servitude to the Law.
        But the Apostle attributes this to the Son of God of whom he speaks. So,
        the Son of God of whom he speaks is the natural Son. Therefore, it is
        true to say: The natural Son of God, that is, God the Word of God, is
        made of a woman.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [18] The very same point is clarified by Scripture’s attribution of the
        redemption of the human race to God Himself, thus the Psalmist: “You
        have redeemed me, O Lord, the God of truth” (Ps. 30:6).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [19] Furthermore, the adoption of God’s sons is made by the Holy Spirit,
        according to Romans (8:15): “You have received the spirit of adoption of
        sons.” But the Holy Spirit is a gift, not of man, but of God. And so,
        the adoption of sons is not caused by man, but by God. But it is caused
        by the Son of God sent by God and made of a woman. This is clear from
        the Apostle’s addition: “That we might receive the adoption of sons”
        (Gal. 4:5). One ought, then, to understand the Apostle’s expression of
        God’s natural Son. It is, accordingly, God the Word of God who “was made
        of a woman”; that is, of the Virgin Mother.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [20] And, again, John says: “The Word was made flesh.” But He has no
        flesh, except from a woman. The Word, then, is made of a woman; that is,
        of the Virgin Mother. Therefore, the Virgin is the Mother of God the
        Word.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2]] The Apostle further says that Christ is from the fathers’s
        “according to the flesh, Who is over all things, God blessed for ever”
        (Rom. 9:5). But he is not from the fathers save through the Virgin. God,
        then, who is above all things, is from the Virgin in the flesh. The
        Virgin, then, is the Mother of God in the flesh.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [22] The Apostle, once more, says of Christ Jesus that, “being in the
        form of God, emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant, being made
        in the likeness of men” (Phil. 2:6-7). Now, clearly, if, following
        Nestorius, we divide Christ into two—into that man who is the adoptive
        son, and into God’s natural Son who is the Word of God—this text cannot
        be understood of that man. For that man, if he be pure man, was not
        first in the form of God, so as to be made later in the likeness of man;
        rather conversely: the existing man was made to share in divinity; in
        this he was not emptied, but exalted. The text must, then, be understood
        of the Word of God who first was eternally in the form of God, that is,
        in the nature of God, and later emptied Himself, made in the likeness of
        man.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        But that emptying cannot be understood solely by the indwelling of the
        Word of God in the man Jesus Christ. For, since the beginning of the
        world, the Word of God has dwelt in all the saints by grace. It is not,
        for all that, emptied, since God communicates His goodness to creatures
        so that nothing is subtracted from Him. Rather, He is somehow exalted,
        in that the goodness of the creatures manifests His sublimity, and so
        much the more so as the creatures have been better. Hence, if the Word
        of God has dwelt more fully in the man Christ than in the other saints,
        then even less in this case than in others is the emptying harmonious
        with the Word.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Plainly, then, the union of the Word with the human nature must not be
        understood in accordance merely with the indwelling of the Word of God
        in that man (as Nestorius held), but in accordance with this fact: The
        Word of God truly was made man. In this wise only, then, will there be
        place for “emptying”: namely, let the Word of God be called “emptied,”
        that is, made small, not by the loss of His own greatness, but by the
        assumption of human smallness; just so would it be if the soul were to
        pre-exist the body, and were said to be made the corporeal substance
        which man is: not by a change of its own nature, but by the assumption
        of corporeal nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [23] There is more. Manifestly, the Holy Spirit dwelt in the man Christ,
        for Luke (4:11) says: “Jesus, being full of the Holy Spirit, returned
        from the Jordan.” If, then, our understanding of the Incarnation of the
        Word is this alone—the Word of God dwelt most fully in that man—we will
        have to say that the Holy Spirit was incarnate also. And this is
        altogether foreign to the teaching of the faith.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [24] This is also clear: The Word of God dwells in the holy angels, and
        by sharing the Word they are filled with understanding. But the Apostle
        says: “Nowhere doth He take hold of the angels: but of the seed of
        Abraham he takes hold” (Heb. 2:16). Clearly, then, the assumption of
        human nature by the Word is not merely to be taken as indwelling.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [25] If, furthermore, as in the Nestorian position, Christ be separated
        into two differing in hypostasis—that is, into the Word of God and that
        man—the Word of God cannot possibly be called “Christ.” This is clear,
        for one thing, from Scripture’s manner of speaking: Scripture before the
        Incarnation never names God, or the Word of God, Christ. It is clear, as
        well, from the very account of the name. For one says “Christ” only as
        though to say “anointed.” But one understands anointed with the “oil of
        gladness” (Heb. 1:9; Ps. 44:8), that is, “with the Holy Spirit (Acts
        10:38), as Peter explains. Yet, one cannot say that the Word of God is
        anointed with the Holy Spirit, for the Holy Spirit would thus be greater
        than the Son, as the sanctifier is greater than the sanctified. It will
        be necessary, then, to understand the name “Christ” only of that man.
        Therefore, this word of the Apostle, “Let this mind be in you, which was
        also in Christ Jesus” (Phil. 2:5-6), must be referred to that man. Yet
        he adds: “Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be
        equal with Cod.” Truly, then, one speaks of that man in the form, that
        is, the nature of God, and equal to God. Yet, granted men are called
        “gods” or “sons of God” by God’s indwelling, one never calls them “equal
        to God.” Clearly, then, the man Christ is not called God merely by
        reason of the indwelling.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [26] Granted, again, that the name of God is used for holy men by reason
        of the indwelling of grace, nonetheless works which are God’s alone—the
        creation of heaven and earth, for example, or something of the sort—are
        never ascribed to any saint by reason of the indwelling of grace. But to
        Christ the man the creation of all things is attributed. We read in
        Hebrews (3:1-4): “Consider the apostle and high priest of our confession
        Jesus Christ who is faithful to Him that made Him, as also was Moses in
        all His house.” This must be understood of that man and not of God’s
        Word; both because it was shown that in the Nestorian position God’s
        Word cannot be called Christ, as well as because God’s Word is not made,
        but begotten. The Apostle, of course, adds: “This man was counted worthy
        of greater glory than Moses, by so much as He that built the house bath
        greater honor than the house.” Now, the man Christ built the house. This
        the Apostle proves subsequently when he adds: “For every house is built
        by some man: but He that created all things is God.” Thus, then, the
        Apostle proves that the man Christ built the house of God from the fact
        that God created all things. But this would be no proof at all if Christ
        were not the God who creates all things. And so to that man the creation
        of the worlds is ascribed, a thing which is God’s very own work. The man
        Christ, then, is God Himself by hypostasis and not merely by reason of
        indwelling.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [27] Further, it is clear that the man Christ, speaking of Himself, says
        many divine and supernatural things: so this in John (6:40): “I will
        raise him up in the last day”; and again: “I give them life everlasting”
        (10:28). This would be the height of pride if that man speaking were not
        by hypostasis Cod Himself, but merely had God indwelling. But pride is
        not suited to the man Christ, who says of Himself: “Learn of me, because
        I am meek, and humble of heart” (Mat. 11:29). There is, then, identity
        in person between that man and God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [28] There is more. just as we read in Scripture that the man is
        “exalted”—as in Acts (2:33): “Exalted therefore by the right hand of
        God,” and the rest, so also we read that God is “emptied” in Philippians
        (2:7): “He emptied himself,” and the rest. Thus, just as sublime things
        can be said of that man by reason of the union-that He is God, that He
        raises the dead, and others of this sort—so of God can lowly things be
        said: that He was born of the Virgin, suffered, died, and was buried.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [29] Then, too, both relative verbs and pronouns bring out identity of
        supposit. The Apostle says, speaking of the Son of God: “In Him were all
        things created in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible; then,
        later, he adds: “And He is the head of the body, the Church, who is the
        beginning, the firstborn from the dead” (Col. 1:16, 18). Now, clearly,
        the text, “In Him were all things created,” refers to the Word of God;
        whereas the text, “first-born from the dead,” belongs to the man Christ.
        Therefore, God’s Word and the man Christ are one supposit and,
        consequently, one Person; and whatever is said of that man must he said
        of the Word of God, and conversely.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [30] Again, the Apostle says: “There is one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom
        are A things” (1 Cor. 8:6). But Jesus, the name of that man through whom
        all things are, clearly befits the Word of God. Thus, then, the Word of
        God and that man are one Lord; and these are not two lords, or two sons,
        as Nestorius held. From this it follows further that there is one person
        of the Word of God and the man.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [31] Let one consider the matter earnestly and he sees that this
        Nestorian opinion on the Incarnation differs very little from that of
        Photinus. For each held that the man was called God only by reason of
        the indwelling grace. Photinus, of course, said that the man merited the
        name and glory of divinity by suffering and good works; and Nestorius
        confessed that from the beginning of his conception he had this name and
        glory by reason of the fullness of God’s dwelling within him. Of course,
        on the eternal generation of the Word they differed greatly: Nestorius
        confessed it, but Photinus denied it completely.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">AGAINST THE ERROR OF EUTYCHES</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Since the mystery of the Incarnation—as has been shown in many
        ways—must be understood thus: there is one and the same person of the
        Word of God and the man, a certain difficulty remains in the
        consideration of this truth. For necessarily its personality follows the
        divine nature. The case seems to be the same for human nature, for
        everything which subsists in an intellectual or a rational nature
        fulfills the account of person. Hence, it does not seem possible that
        there be one Person and two natures, divine and human.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Now, for the solution of this difficulty various men have proposed
        various positions. Eutyches, for instance, to preserve the unity of
        person in Christ against Nestorius, says there is one nature, also. He
        says that, although before the union there were two distinct natures,
        the divine and human, they came together, nevertheless, in the union
        into one nature. And so he said that the person of Christ “is from two
        natures,” but does not “subsist in two natures.” For this he was
        condemned by the Council of Chalcedon.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] The falsity of this position, of course, appears in many ways. For
        we showed above that there was in Christ Jesus a body, a rational soul,
        and divinity. And, clearly, the body of Christ even after the union was
        not the very divinity of the Word; for the body of Christ even after the
        union could be touched, could be seen with bodily eyes, and had
        distinctly outlined members. All of these are foreign to the divinity of
        the Word, as the foregoing make clear. And in like fashion the soul of
        Christ after the union was other than the divinity of the Word, because
        after the union the soul of Christ was affected by the passions of
        sadness, of sorrow, and of anger. These, too, are entirely
        disproportionate to the divinity of the Word, as the foregoing shows.
        But a human soul and a human body constitute a human nature. Thus, then,
        even after the union, the human nature in Christ was other than the
        divinity of the Word which is the divine nature. Therefore, in Christ,
        even after the union, there are two natures.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Again. It is by its nature that something is called a natural thing.
        One calls it a natural thing because it has a form, as one does with an
        artificial thing; one does not call a house a house before it has the
        form of its architecture, nor a horse a horse before it has the form of
        its nature. The form of a natural thing is, then, its nature. But one
        must say that in Christ there are two forms, even after the union. For
        the Apostle says of Christ Jesus, when he was “in the form of God, He
        took the form of a servant” (Phil. 2:6-7). Of course, one cannot say
        that the form of God is the same as the form of the servant. For nothing
        receives what it already has, and so, if the form of God and of the
        servant are the same, He would not—since He already had the form of
        God—have received the form of servant. Neither, again, can one say that
        the form of God in Christ is corrupted by the union, because thus after
        the union Christ would not be God. Nor, again, can one say that the form
        of the servant was corrupted in the union, because thus He would not
        have received the form of the servant. But neither can one say that the
        form of the servant is mixed thoroughly with the form of God, for things
        mixed thoroughly do not retain their integrity; rather, each is in part
        corrupted, and so the Apostle would not say that He had received the
        form of the servant, but something of the servant. Hence, One ought to
        say respecting the words of the Apostle that in Christ even after the
        union there were two forms; therefore, two natures.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] The name “nature,” moreover, in its first imposition had as meaning
        the very generation of things being born. Thence it was carried over to
        meaning the principle of this kind of generation, and then to signifying
        the principle of motion intrinsic to the moveable thing. And because
        this kind of principle is matter or form, nature is further called the
        form or matter of a thing which has in itself a principle of motion. And
        since form and matter constitute the essence of the natural thing, the
        name was extended to meaning the essence of everything whatsoever which
        exists in nature. As a result of this, the nature of a thing is called
        “the essence signified by the definition.”O In this last fashion nature
        is in question here, for thus we say that there is in Christ human
        nature and divine.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Now, then, if, as Eutyches held, the human nature and the divine
        were two before the union, but from those in the union one nature was
        breathed together, this should take place in one of the ways in which it
        is natural that one comes to be from many.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Now, one way in which one comes from many is the way of order alone;
        so from many homes a city comes to be, or from many soldiers an army.
        Another way is that of order and composition; so a house comes to be
        when they join together its parts and its walls. But neither of these
        two ways fits the constitution of one nature from a plurality. For
        things whose form is order or juxtaposition are not natural things. The
        result is that their unity cannot be called a unity of nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] In a third way, one comes from many by mixture, as from the four
        elements one gets a mixed body. And this way, too, does not fit the
        present consideration. The first reason is this: Mixture is only of
        things which have matter in common and by nature act and react
        reciprocally. Such cannot~ indeed, be the case here, for it was shown in
        Book I that God is entirely immaterial and subject to no action. The
        second reason is this: When one thing greatly exceeds another there can
        be no mixture, for, if a man puts a drop of wine into a thousand
        measures of water, he is not mixing, but spoiling, the wine. For the
        same reason we do not say that wood thrown into a furnace is mixed with
        the fire, but—by reason of the superior power of the fire—consumed by
        the fire. The divine nature, of course, exceeds the human by infinity,
        since the divine power is infinite, as was shown in Book I. There
        cannot, then, be any mixture at all of each nature. The third reason is
        this: If a mixture were to come into being, neither nature would be
        preserved. For things subject to mixture are not preserved in the mixed
        product, if it be a true mixture. Given, then, a thorough mixture of
        each of the two natures—the divine, namely, and the human—neither of the
        two natures would remain, but some third. What Eutyches said, then,
        cannot be understood thus: There were two natures before the union, but
        after the union one nature in our Lord Jesus Christ, as though from two
        natures one nature has been established. Therefore, the understanding of
        it which remains is this: Either the one or the other remained after the
        union. Either, then, there was in Christ the divine nature only and what
        appeared human in Him was but phantasy as Mani said; or the divine
        nature was converted into the human as Apollinaris said. But against
        these we have previously disputed. The conclusion, then, is that it is
        impossible that before the union there were two natures in Christ; after
        the union, but one.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] There is more. One never finds one coming to be from two abiding
        natures, because any nature is a kind of whole, but its constituents are
        accounted for as parts. Hence, when one comes to be from a soul and a
        body, neither the soul nor the body can be called a nature (as we are
        now speaking of nature), because neither has the complete species, but
        each is a part of the one nature. Since human nature, then, is a kind of
        complete nature, and the divine nature is similarly, it is impossible
        that they concur in one nature without the corruption either of each of
        the two, or of one of the two. Now, this cannot be, since from our
        previous points” the one Christ clearly is both true God and true man.
        It is impossible, then, that in Christ there is only one nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] Again, from two abiding one nature is constituted: from bodily
        parts, if you like, as an animal is constituted of its members-which
        cannot be said in this case, since the divine nature is not something
        bodily; if you like, something one is constituted from matter and form,
        as an animal is constituted of its soul and body. Neither can this be
        said in the present discussion, for it was shown in Book II that God can
        neither be matter nor the form of anything. Then, if Christ is true God
        and true man, as was seen, it is impossible that in Him there be one
        nature only.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] The subtraction or addition of an essential principle, furthermore,
        varies the species of a thing; consequently, it changes the nature which
        is not other than “the essence which the definition signifies.”1 For
        this reason we see that a specific difference added to a definition or
        subtracted from it makes a difference in species; so the rational animal
        and the one lacking reason differ in species, just as in numbers the
        addition or subtraction of unity makes another species of number. But
        form is an essential principle. So, every addition of form makes another
        species and another nature (as we are now speaking of nature). If, then,
        the divinity of the Word be added to the human nature as a form, it will
        make another nature. And thus Christ will not be of the human nature but
        of some other, just as an animated body is of another nature than that
        which is body only.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [12] Then, again, things which do not agree in nature are not similar in
        species; man and horse, for example. But, if Christ’s nature be a
        composite of the divine and human, clearly Christ’s nature will not be
        in other men. Therefore, He will not be similar to us in species. And
        this is contrary to the Apostle’s word: “It behooved Him in all things
        to be made like unto His brethren” (Heb. 2:17).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [13] There is more. One species is always constituted of form and matter
        which is actually or potentially predicable of many according to the
        essentials of the species. If, then, the divine nature accrues to the
        human nature as a form, some common species must spring from the mixture
        of the two, and in this many should be able to share. And this is
        plainly false. For there is but one Jesus Christ (1 Cor. 8:6), God and
        man. Therefore, the divine and human natures have not established one
        nature in Christ.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [14] Moreover, even this saying of Eutyches seems foreign to the faith,
        that before the union there were two natures in Christ. For, since a
        human nature is constituted of a soul and a body, it would follow that
        the soul, or the body, or both were in being before Christ’s
        incarnation. And this the points made above show to be false. This,
        then, is contrary to the faith: to say that before the union there were
        two natures in Christ and, after the union, one.

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Now, the position of Macarius of Antioch seems to come to just about
        the same thing. He says that in Christ there is only one operation and
        will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Every nature, of course, has a proper operation of its own, for the
        form is the principle of operation, and in accord with its form every
        nature has the species proper to it. Hence, as of diverse natures there
        are diverse forms, there must be also diverse actions. If, then, in
        Christ there be one action, it follows that there is in him but one
        nature. This last belongs to the Eutychean heresy. We then conclude that
        it is false to say there is but one operation in Christ.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Again. In Christ there is the perfect divine nature by which He is
        consubstantial with the Father, and a perfect human nature by which He
        is one in species, with us. But the perfection of the divine nature
        includes having will (this was shown in Book I); similarly, also, the
        perfection of human nature includes having a will by which a man has
        free choice. There must, then, be in Christ two wills.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] The will, further, is one potential part of the human soul, as the
        intellect is. If, then, in Christ there was no other will than the will
        of the Word, by an equal account there was no other intellect than the
        intellect of the Word. Thus we return to the position of Apollinaris.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] If, moreover, there was in Christ but one will, surely it was only
        the divine will. For the divine will which the Word had from eternity He
        could not lose. But the divine will is unrelated to merit because he
        merits who is tending toward perfection. Thus, then, Christ by His
        passion would have merited nothing-whether for Himself, or for us. The
        contrary of this is taught by the Apostle: “He was made obedient to the
        Father even unto death, for which cause God also has exalted Him” (Phil.
        2:8-9).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] What is more, if there was no human will in Christ~ it follows that
        by His assumed nature He had no free choice. So, then, Christ used to
        act not after the fashion of man, but after the manner of the other
        animals who lack free choice. Then, nothing in His acts was virtuous or
        laudable, nothing a model for imitation by us. In vain, then, he says in
        Matthew (11:29): “Learn of Me because I am meek, and humble of heart”;
        and in John (13:15): “I have given you an example, that as I have done
        to you, so do you also.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Again, in one who is pure man, although he is one in supposit there
        are many appetites and operations according to the diversity of natural
        principles. For in his rational part there is will; in his sensitive,
        the irascible and concupiscible appetites; and, further, the natural
        appetite following on natural powers. In the same way he sees with the
        eye, bears with the ear, steps with the foot, speaks with the tongue,
        and understands with the mind, and these are diverse operations. The
        case is such because the operations are not multiplied according to
        diverse subjects operating only, but as well according to diverse
        principles by which one and the same subject operates, and from which
        the operations take their species. But the divine nature is much more
        removed from human nature than the principles of human nature are from
        one another. Therefore, the will and operation of the divine and the
        human nature in Christ are distinguished from one another, although
        Christ Himself is one in each of the natures.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] Furthermore, Scriptural authority clearly shows that in Christ there
        were two wills. He Himself says: “I came down from heaven, not to do My
        own will, but the will of Him that sent Me (John 6:38); and again: “Not
        My will, but Yours be done” (Luke 22:42). From these words it is clear
        that there was in Christ another will apart from the will of the Father.
        But clearly, there was in Him a will common to Him and the Father. For,
        just as the Father’s and the Son’s nature is one, so also is their will.
        Therefore, there are two wills in Christ.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] But this is as clear of their operations. For in Christ there was an
        operation common to Him and the Father, for He says: “Whatever the
        Father does the Son does likewise” (John 5:19). But there is another
        operation in Him which is not proper to the Father: to sleep, for
        example, to be thirsty, to eat, and others of this sort which Christ
        made man did or suffered; so the Evangelists tell us. Therefore, there
        was not one operation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] Now, the present position seems to have had its rise in this: its
        authors did not know how to distinguish between what is simply one, and
        what is one by order. For they saw the human will in Christ ordered
        entirely beneath the divine will, so that Christ willed nothing with His
        human will except that which the divine will disposed Him to will. In
        like manner, also, Christ did nothing in His human nature, whether by
        acting or by suffering, except as the divine will disposed; hence we
        read: “I do always the things that please Him” (John 8:29). The human
        operation of Christ, also, achieved a kind of divine efficacy by union
        with the divinity, just as the action of a secondary agent achieves a
        kind of efficacy from the principal agent; and this resulted: every
        action or suffering of Hit was salutary. For this reason Dionysius calls
        the human operation of Christ “theandric,” that is, “God-mannish”; and
        also because it is of God and a man. So, those men, seeing the human
        operation and will of Christ ordered beneath the divine in an infallible
        order, decided that there was in Christ only one will and operation,
        although there is no identity (as was said) between one by order and one
        simply.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From the foregoing it is clear that there is only one Person in
        Christ as the faith maintains; and that there are two natures,
        contrarily to what Nestorius and Eutyches held. Yet this appears foreign
        to what natural reason experiences, and therefore there were some later
        on who took a position on this union such as the following. The soul and
        body union constitutes a man, but the union of this soul and this body
        constitutes this man. And this is the designation of person or
        hypostasis. Wishing, then, to avoid being pushed into asserting in
        Christ some hypostasis or person other than the hypostasis or Person of
        the Word, these men said that the soul and body were not united in
        Christ, nor was a substance made from them. In saying this they were
        trying to avoid the Nestorian heresy. This also seemed impossible: that
        one thing be substantial to another, yet not be of the nature which that
        other previously had, without any mutation taking place; and the Word,
        of course, is entirely immutable. Therefore, lest they be forced to make
        the assumed soul and body belong to the nature which the Word had
        eternally, they laid it down that the Word assumed the human soul and
        body in an accidental fashion, just as a man puts on his clothes. By
        this they wished to exclude the error of Eutyches.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] But this position is entirely repugnant to the teaching of the
        faith. For a soul and body by their union constitute a man, since a form
        which accrues to matter constitutes a species. If, then, soul and body
        were not united in Christ, Christ was not a man. This goes against the
        Apostle’s words: The mediator of God and men, the man Christ Jesus” (1
        Tim. 2:5).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Again, everyone of us is said to be a man on this account that he is
        constituted of a rational soul and a body. But, if Christ is not called
        man on that account but only because He had a soul and a body, although
        not united, He will be called man equivocally and will not be in the
        same species with us. This is against the Apostle’s words: “It behooved
        Him in all things to be made like unto His brethren” (Heb. 2:17).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Furthermore, not every body belongs to human nature, but the human
        body alone. Of course, it is not a human body except for the fact that
        it has been vivified by union with the rational soul. For one says
        neither eye, nor hand, nor foot, nor flesh, nor bone—with the soul
        gone—except by equivocation. Therefore, one will not be able to say that
        the Word assumed human nature if He did not assume a body united to a
        soul.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] What is more, the human soul by its nature has a capacity for union
        with the body. Therefore, a soul which is never united to a body to
        constitute something is not a human soul, for “what is apart from nature
        can never be.” If then, the soul of Christ is not united to His body to
        constitute something, we conclude that it is not a human soul. And,
        thus, in Christ there was no human nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] There is more. If the Word was united to the soul and body
        accidentally, as one is to clothing, the human nature was not the nature
        of the Word. Then the Word, after the union, was not subsisting in two
        natures; just as a man in his clothing is not said to subsist in two
        natures. It was for saying this that Eutyches was condemned at the
        Council of Chalcedon.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Again, what the clothes suffer is not referred to the wearer. One
        does not say a man is born when he is dressed, nor wounded if his
        clothes are torn. If the Word, then, took on a soul and a body, as a man
        does his clothes, no one will be able to say that God was born, or that
        He suffered by reason of the body He assumed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] If the Word, moreover, assumed human nature only as a garment in
        which to be apparent to the eyes of men, He would have assumed the soul
        in vain. This by its nature is invisible.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] Furthermore, in this fashion the Son’s assumption of the flesh would
        not have differed from the Holy Spirit’s assumption of the form of a
        dove in which He appeared (Mat. 3:16). And this is plainly false. For
        one does not say the Holy Spirit has “become dove” or is “less than the
        Father,” as one says that the Son “has become man” and is less than the
        Father in the nature, assumed (John 14:28).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] Again, when it is earnestly weighed, the awkwardness of a diversity
        of heresies follows on this position. For in saying that the Son of God
        is united to the soul and the flesh in an accidental mode as a man is to
        his garments, it agrees with the opinion of Nestorius, who claimed the
        union took place by the indwelling of God’s Word in a man. God’s being
        clothed, of course, cannot be understood through bodily touch but only
        through indwelling grace. And in saying that the union of the Word to
        the soul and human flesh was accidental, one must be saying that the
        Word after the union was not subsistent in two natures. And this
        Eutyches said. For nothing subsists in that to which it is accidentally
        united. But, when this position says that the soul and body are not
        united to constitute something, it partially agrees with Arius and
        Apollinaris: they held that the body of Christ was not animated by the
        rational soul; and it partially agrees with Mani: he held that Christ
        was not true man, but a phantasy only. For, if the soul is not united to
        the flesh for the constitution of something, it was but phantasy when
        Christ appeared similar to other men constituted by the union of soul
        and body.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] This position, of course, had as its occasion the words of the
        Apostle: “In habit found as a man” (Phil. 2:70). They did not understand
        that this was said metaphorically. But things said metaphorically need
        not be similar in every respect. So, the human nature assumed by the
        Word has a kind of likeness to clothing, in that the Word was seen in
        His visible flesh just as a man is seen in his clothing; but the
        likeness is not in this, that the union of the Word to human nature in
        Christ was in an accidental mode.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Others, indeed, have avoided this position by reason of the
        awkwardness described above. They have held that soul and flesh in our
        Lord Jesus Christ constitutes one substance, namely, a certain man of
        the same species as other men. They call this man united to the Word of
        God, not in nature, indeed, but in person, so that there is one person
        of the Word of God and of that man. But, since that man is a kind of
        individual substance—and this is to be an hypostasis and supposit—some
        say that in Christ the hypostasis and supposit of that man is one and
        that of the Word of God another, but that there is one person of each of
        the two. On account of this unity, the Word of God, as they say, is
        predicated of that man and that man of the Word of God. This sense
        results: “The Word of God is man,” and that is: “The person of the Word
        of God is the person of the man,” and conversely. And in this account
        whatever is predicated of the Word of God is, they say, able to be
        predicated of that man; and, conversely, although with a kind of
        reduplication, so that when it is said “God has suffered,” the sense is
        “A man who is God by unity of person has suffered,” and “A man created
        the stars” means “He who is man.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] But, of necessity, this position lapses into the error of Nestorius.
        For, if the difference of person and hypostasis be marked, one finds
        that person is not foreign to hypostasis, but a kind of part of
        hypostasis. For a person is nothing else than a hypostasis of a certain
        nature; namely, rational. This is clear from Boethius’ definition:
        “person is the individual substance of a rational nature.” Clearly,
        then, although not every hypostasis is a person, every hypostasis of
        human nature is, nonetheless, a person. If, therefore, from the mere
        union of soul and body in Christ there is constituted a certain
        particular substance which is the hypostasis-namely, that man-it follows
        that from the same union a person is constituted. There will be, then,
        in Christ two persons: one, and newly constituted, of that man; the
        other, eternal, of the Word of God. And this belongs to the Nestorian
        impiety.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Again, even if the hypostasis of that man could not be called a
        person, the hypostasis of the Word of God is nonetheless the same as His
        Person. If, therefore, the hypostasis of the Word of God is not that of
        the man, neither will the Person Of the Word of God be the person of the
        man. This will falsify their own assertion that the person of that man
        is the Person of the Word of God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] If one were to grant, further, that person is other than the
        hypostasis of God’s Word or of the man, one could find no difference
        save one: person adds some property to hypostasis. Nothing, of course,
        pertaining to the genus of substance can he added, since hypostasis is
        the most complete thing in the genus of substance, and it is called
        “first substance.” If, then, the union is made in person and not in
        hypostasis, it follows that the union takes place only according to some
        accidental property. This, too, comes again back to the error of
        Nestorius.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Cyril, moreover, in his letter to Nestorius approved by the Council
        of Ephesus, has this to say: “If anyone does not confess that the Word
        from the Father is united to the flesh in subsistence, that Christ is
        one with his flesh, that is to say, that the same one is God and man at
        the same time, let him be anathema.” And almost everywhere in the
        synodal writings this is assigned as the error of Nestorius, who put two
        bypostases in Christ.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Damascene, moreover, in Book III, says: “It was from a two perfect
        natures, we say, that the union took place, and not in a prosopic,” that
        is, personal way, “as God’s enemy Nestorius says, but according to the
        hypostasis.” Thus, clearly and expressly, this was the position of
        Nestorius: to confess one person and two hypostases.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Again, hypostasis and supposit must be identified. Everything else
        is predicated of the first substance, which is the hypostasis: namely,
        the universals in the genus of substance as well as accidents, as the
        Philosopher says in his <i>Categories</i> [3]. If, therefore, there are
        not two hypostases in Christ, neither are there two supposits.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] If the Word and that man, furthermore, differ in supposit, it must
        be that when that man is supposed the Word of God is not supposed, nor
        is the converse true. But, if the supposits are distinct, what is said
        of them must be distinguished, for the divine predicates mentioned are
        disproportionate to the man’s supposit except by reason of the Word; and
        the converse is true. Therefore, one must take separately the things
        said of Christ in Scripture; namely, the divine and the human. And this
        is contrary to the opinion of Cyril confirmed by the Synod: “If one
        divides between two persons or subsistences the words said in the
        evangelical and apostolic Scriptures-whether they be said about Christ
        by the saints, or by Him about Himself, and marks off some of them,
        indeed, as for a man especially understood alongside that Word from God,
        and marks off others as capable of being said by God, for that Word from
        God the Father alone: let him be anathema.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] Moreover, in the position described, things proportioned to the Word
        of God by nature would not be said of that man except by a certain
        association in one person; this is what -the interposed reduplication
        means when they expound thus: “That man created the stars,” that is,
        “the Son of God, who is that man,” and similarly with others of that
        sort. Hence, when one says: “That man is God,” one understands it thus:
        “That man exists by the Word of God.” But it is this kind of expression
        that Cyril condemns when he says: “If anyone dares to say that the man
        assumed ought to be co-adored with God’s Word, co-glorified, and
        co-named God, a second of two with the first, so to speak (for that is
        what “co” forces us to understand as often as it is added), and does not
        honor Emmanuel with one adoration and offer Him one glorification,
        inasmuch as the Word was made flesh; let him be anathema.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] There is more. If that man is other than the Word in supposit, he
        cannot belong to the person of the Word except by the assumption by
        which He was assumed by the Word. But this is foreign to a correct
        understanding of the faith, for the Council of Ephesus says in the words
        of Felix, Pope and martyr: “We believe in God our Jesus, born of the
        Virgin Mary: that He is God’s everlasting Son and Word, and not a an
        assumed by God so that there is another beside Him. Nor did God’s Son
        assume a man that there be another beside Him; but the perfect existing
        God was made at the same time perfect man, made flesh of the Virgin.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] Again, things which are many in supposit are many simply, and they
        are but incidentally one. If, then, in Christ there are two supposits,
        it follows that He is two simply and not incidentally. And this is “to
        dissolve Jesus” (1 John 4:3), for everything, in so far as it is, is
        one.”

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From what has been set down above it is clear that according to the
        tradition of the Catholic faith we must say that in Christ there is a
        perfect divine nature and a perfect human nature, constituted by a
        rational soul and human flesh; and that these two natures are united in
        Christ not by indwelling only, nor in an accidental mode, as a man is
        united to his garments, nor in a personal relation and property only,
        but in one hypostasis and one supposit. Only in this way can we save
        what the Scriptures hand on about the Incarnation. Since, then, sacred
        Scripture without distinction attributes the things of God to that man,
        and the things of that man to God (as is plain from the foregoing), He
        of whom each class is said must be one and the same.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] But opposites cannot be said truly of the same thing in the same
        way: the divine and human things said of Christ are, of course, in
        opposition, suffering and incapable of suffering, for example, or dead
        and immortal, and the remainder of this kind; therefore, it is
        necessarily in different ways that the divine and the human are
        predicated of Christ. So, then, with respect to the “about which” each
        class is predicated no distinction must be made, but unity is
        discovered. But with respect to what is predicated, a distinction must
        be made. Natural properties, of course, are predicated of everything
        according to its nature; thus to be home downward is predicated of this
        stone consequently on its nature as heavy. Since, then, there are
        different ways of predicating things human and divine of Christ one must
        say there are in Christ two natures neither confused nor mixed. But that
        about which one predicates natural properties consequently on the proper
        nature pertaining to the genus of substance is the hypostasis and
        supposit of that nature. Since, then, that is not distinct and is one
        about which one predicates things divine and human concerning Christ,
        one must say that Christ is one hypostasis and one supposit of a human
        and a divine nature. For thus truly and properly will things divine be
        predicated of that man in accord with the fact that the man bears the
        supposit not only of the human but of the divine nature; conversely, one
        predicates things human of God’s Word in that He is the supposit of the
        human nature.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] It is clear also from this that, although the Son is incarnate,
        neither the Father nor the Holy Spirit, for all that, need be incarnate,
        since the Incarnation did not take Place by a union in the nature in
        which the three divine Persons are tog. ether, but in hypostasis or
        supposit, wherein the three Persons are distinguished. And thus, as in
        the Trinity there is a plurality of Persons subsisting in one nature, so
        in the mystery of the Incarnation there is one Person subsisting in a
        plurality of natures.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] But against this statement of the Catholic faith many difficulties
        come together, and by reason of these the adversaries of the faith
        attack the Incarnation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] We showed in Book I that God is neither a body nor a power in a
        body. But, if He assumed flesh, it follows either that He was changed
        into a body or that He was a power in a body after the Incarnation. It
        seems, then, impossible that God was incarnate.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Again, whatever acquires a new nature is subject to substantial
        change; for in this is a thing generated, that it acquires a nature.
        Then, if the hypostasis of the Son of God becomes a subsistent anew in
        human nature, it appears that it was substantially changed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Furthermore, no hypostasis of a nature extends outside that nature;
        rather, indeed, the nature is found outside the hypostasis, since there
        are many hypostases under the nature. If, then, the hypostasis of the
        Son of God becomes by the Incarnation the hypostasis of a human nature,
        the Son of God—one must conclude—is not everywhere after the
        Incarnation, since the human nature is not everywhere.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Once again; one and the same thing has only one what-it-is, for by
        this one means a thing’s substance and of one there is but one. But the
        nature of any thing at all is its what-it-is, “for the nature of a thing
        is what the definition signifies.” It seems impossible, then, that one
        hypostasis subsist in two natures.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Furthermore, in things which are without matter, the quiddity of a
        thing is not other than the thing, as was shown above. And this is
        especially the case in God, who is not only His own quiddity, but also
        His own act of being. But human nature cannot be identified with a
        divine hypostasis. There, fore, it seems impossible that a divine
        hypostasis subsist in human nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Once again; a nature is more simple and more formal than the
        hypostasis which subsists therein, for it is by the addition of
        something material that the common nature is individuated to this
        hypostasis. If, then, a divine hypostasis subsists in human nature, it
        seems to follow that human nature is more simple and more formal than a
        divine hypostasis. And this is altogether impossible.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] It is, furthermore, only in matter and form composites that one
        finds a difference between the singular thing and its quiddity. This is
        because the singular is individuated by designated matter, and in the
        quiddity and nature of the species the latter is not included. For, in
        marking off Socrates, one includes this matter, but one does not in his
        account of human nature. Therefore, every hypostasis subsisting in human
        nature is constituted by signate matter. This cannot be said of the
        divine hypostasis. So, it does not seem possible that the hypostasis of
        God’s Word subsist in human nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] Furthermore, the soul and body in Christ were not less in power than
        in other men. But in other men their union constitutes a supposit an
        hypostasis, and a person. Therefore, in Christ the union of soul and
        body constitutes a supposit, hypostasis, and person of the Word of God;
        this is eternal. Therefore in Christ there is another supposit,
        hypostasis, and person beside the supposit, hypostasis, and person of
        the Word of God. Or so it seems.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] There is more. Just as soul and body constitute human nature in
        common, so this soul and this body constitute this man, and this is the
        hypostasis of a man. But this soul and this body were in Christ.
        Therefore, their union constitutes an hypostasis, it seems. And we
        conclude exactly as before.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] Again, this man who is Christ, considered as consisting of soul
        alone and body, is a certain substance; not, of course, a universal one;
        therefore, a particular one. Therefore, it is an hypostasis.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [12] Moreover, if the supposit of the human and the divine nature in
        Christ is identified, then in one’s understanding of the man who is
        Christ there ought to be a divine hypostasis. Of course, this is not in
        one’s understanding of other men. Therefore, man will be said
        equivocally of Christ and others. Hence, He will not belong to the same
        species with us.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [13] In Christ, what is more, one finds three things, as is clear from
        what was said: a body, a soul, and divinity. The soul, of course, since
        it is nobler than the body, is not the supposit of the body, but its
        form. Neither, then, is what is divine the supposit of the human nature;
        it is, rather, formally related to that nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [14] Furthermore, whatever accrues to something after its being is
        complete accrues to it accidentally. But, since the Word is from
        eternity, plainly the flesh assumed accrues to Him after His being is
        complete. Therefore, it accrues to Him accidentally.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Now, to get at the solution of these objections, one must begin
        somewhat more fundamentally. Since Eutyches set it down that the union
        of God and man took place in nature; Nestorius, that it was neither in
        nature nor in person; but the Catholic faith holds this: that the union
        takes place in Person, not in nature-it seems necessary to know first
        what it is “to be made one in nature,” and what it is “to be made one in
        person.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Grant, then, that nature is a word used in many ways: the generation
        of living things, and the principle of generation and of motion, and the
        matter and the form are all called nature. Sometimes, also, nature is
        said of the what-it-is of a thing, which includes the things that bear
        on the integrity of the species; in this way we say that human nature is
        common to all men, and say the same in all other cases. Those things,
        therefore, are made one in nature from which the integrity of a species
        is established; just as the soul and human body are made one to
        establish the species of the animal, so, universally, whatever the parts
        of a species are.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Of course, it is impossible that to a species already established in
        its integrity something extrinsic be united for the unity of its nature
        without losing the species. For, since species are like numbers, and in
        these any unity added or subtracted makes the species vary, if to a
        species already perfected something be added, necessarily it is now
        another species; thus, if to animate substance one adds only sensible,
        one will have another species, for animal and plant are different
        species. It does happen, nonetheless, that one finds something which is
        not integral to the species; in an individual included under that
        species—white and dressed, for instance, in Socrates or in Plato, or a
        sixth finger, or something of the sort. Hence, nothing prevents some
        things being made one in the individual which are not united in one
        integrity of species; thus, human nature and whiteness and music in
        Socrates; and things of this kind are united and are called “one by
        subject.” Now, the individual in the genus of substance is called
        <i>hypostasis</i>, and even in rational substances is called
        <i>person</i>; therefore, all things such as those mentioned are
        suitably said to be, united “in the hypostasis” or even “in the person.”
        Clearly, then, nothing prevents some things not united in nature from
        being united in hypostasis or person.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] But when the heretics heard that in Christ a union of God and man
        took place, they approached the exposition of this point in contrary
        ways, but neglected the way of the truth. For some thought of this union
        after the mode of things united into one nature: so Arius and
        Apollinaris, holding that the Word stood to the body of Christ as soul
        or as mind, and so Eutyches, who held that before the Incarnation there
        were two natures of God and man, but after the Incarnation only one.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] But others, seeing the impossibility of this position, went off on a
        contrary road. Now, the things which accrue to one having a nature, but
        do not belong to the integrity of that nature, seem either to be
        accidents—say, whiteness and music; or to stand in an accidental
        relation—say, a ring, a garment, a house, and the like. Of course, they
        weighed this: Since the human nature accrues to the Word of God without
        belonging to the integrity of His nature, it is necessary (so they
        thought) that the human nature have an accidental union with the Word.
        To be sure, it clearly cannot be in the Word as an accident: both
        because God is not susceptible to an accident (as was previously
        proved); and because human nature, being in the genus of substance,
        cannot be the accident of anything. Hence there appeared to be this
        remaining: Human nature accrues to the Word, not as an accident, but as
        a thing accidentally related to the Word. Nestorius, then, held that the
        human nature of Christ stood to the Word as a kind of temple, so that
        only by indwelling was the union of the Word to the human nature to be
        understood. And because a temple possesses its individuation apart from
        him who dwells in the temple, and the individuation suitable to human
        nature is personality, this was left: that the personality of the human
        nature was one, and that of the Word another. Thus, the Word and that
        man were two persons.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] To be sure, others wished to avoid this awkwardness. So, regarding
        the human nature they introduced a disposition such that personality
        could not be properly suitable to it. They said that the soul and the
        body, in which the integrity of human nature consists, were so assumed
        by the Word that the soul was not united to the body to establish any
        substance, lest they be forced to say that the substance so established
        fulfilled the account of person. But they held the union of the Word to
        soul and body to be like a union to things in an accidental relation,
        for instance, of the clothed to his clothes. In this they were somehow
        imitating Nestorius.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Now, with these accounts set aside by the foregoing, it must be laid
        down that the union of the Word and the man was such that one nature was
        not breathed together out of two; and that the union of the Word to the
        human nature was not like that of a substance-a man, say-to those
        externals which are accidentally related to him, like a house and a
        garment. But let the Word be set down as subsisting in a human nature as
        in one made His very own by the Incarnation; and in consequence that
        body is truly the body of the Word of God, and the soul in like manner,
        and the Word of God is truly man.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] And although to explain this union perfectly is beyond man’s
        strength, nonetheless, in accord with our measure and power, we will try
        to say something “for the upbuilding of the faith” (cf. Eph. 4:29), so
        that concerning this mystery the Catholic faith may be defended from the
        infidels.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] Now, in all created things nothing is found so like this union as
        the union of soul to body. And the likeness would be greater, as
        Augustine also says, in Against Felician, if there were one intellect in
        all men. So some have held, and according to them one ought to say that
        the pre-existing intellect is in such wise united anew to a man’s
        conception that from each of these two a new person is made, just as we
        hold that the pre-existing Word is united to the human nature in a unity
        of person. Accordingly, and by reason of the likeness of these two
        unions, Athanasius says in the Creed: “as the rational soul and flesh
        are one man, so God and man are one Christ.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] However, since the rational soul is united to the body both as to
        matter and as to an instrument, there cannot be a likeness so far as the
        first mode of union is concerned, for thus from God and man one nature
        would be made, since the matter and the form properly establish the
        nature of a species. Therefore, what is left is to look upon the
        likeness so far as the soul is united to the body as an instrument. With
        this, also, there is the concordance of the ancient Doctors, who held
        that the human nature in Christ was “a kind of organ of the divinity,”
        just as the body is held to be an organ of the soul.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] Now, the body and its parts are the organ of the soul in one
        fashion; external instruments in quite another. For this axe is not the
        soul’s very own instrument, as this hand is, for by an axe many can
        operate, but this hand is deputy to this soul in its very own operation.
        For this reason the hand is an instrument of the soul united to it and
        its very own, but the axe is an instrument both- external and common.
        This is the way, then, in which even the union of God and man can be
        considered. For all men are related to God as instruments of a sort, and
        by these He works: “for it is God who works in you both to will and to
        accomplish according to His good will” (Phil. 2:3), as the Apostle says.
        But other men are related to God as extrinsic and separated instruments,
        so to say; for God does not move them only to operations which are His
        very own, but to the operations common to every rational nature, to
        understand the truth, for example, to love the good, to do what is just.
        But the human nature in Christ is assumed with the result that
        instrumentally He performs the things which are the proper operation of
        God alone: to wash away sins, for example, to enlighten minds by grace,
        to lead into the perfection of eternal life. The human nature of Christ,
        then, is compared to God as a proper and conjoined instrument is
        compared, as the hand is compared to the soul.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [12] Nor is there departure from the course of natural things because
        one thing is by nature the proper instrument of another, and this other
        is not its form. For the tongue, so far as it is the instrument of
        speech, is the intellect’s very own organ; and the intellect is
        nevertheless, as the Philosopher proves, not the act of any part of the
        body. In like manner, too, one finds an instrument which does not
        pertain to the nature of the species, which is, nevertheless, on the
        material side fitted to this individual; a sixth finger, for example, or
        something of the sort. Therefore, nothing prevents our putting the union
        of the human nature to the Word in this way: that the human nature be,
        so to speak, an instrument of the Word-not a separated, but a conjoined,
        instrument; and the human nature, nonetheless, does not belong to the
        nature of the Word, and the Word is not its form; nevertheless the human
        nature belongs to His person.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [23] But the examples mentioned have not been set down so that one
        should look in them for an all-round likeness; for one should understand
        that the Word of God was able to be much more sublimely and more
        intimately united to human nature than the soul to its very own
        instrument of whatever sort, especially since He is said to be united to
        the entire human nature with the intellect as medium. And although the
        Word of God by His power penetrates all things, conserving all, that is,
        and supporting all, it is to the intellectual creatures, who can
        properly enjoy the Word and share with Him, that from a kind of kinship
        of likeness He can be both more eminently and more ineffably united.

        ultimate salvation of man is to be perfected in his intellective part by

        [2] There especially seems to be, furthermore, a kind of kinship of the
        Word for human nature. For man gets his proper species from being
        rational. But the Word is kin to the reason. Hence, among the Greeks
        “word” and reason” are called logos. Most appropriately, then, was the
        Word united to the reasonable nature, for by reason of the kinship
        mentioned the divine Scripture attributes the name “image” to the Word
        and to man; the Apostle says of the Word that He is “the image of the
        invisible God” (Col. 1:15); and the same writer says of man that “the
        man is the image of God” (1 Cor. 11:7). [3] The Word also has a kind of
        essential kinship not only with the rational nature, but also
        universally with the whole of creation, since the Word contains the
        essences of all things created by God, just as man the artist in the
        conception of his intellect comprehends the essences of all the products
        of art. Thus, then, all creatures are nothing but a kind of real
        expression and representation of those things which are comprehended in
        the conception of the divine Word; wherefore all things are said (John
        1: 3) to be made by the Word. There, fore, suitably was the Word united
        to the creature, namely, to human nature.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] However, since the Word assumed the human nature into a unity of
        person (this is clear from the things already said), necessarily the
        human nature did not pre-exist before its union to the Word.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Now, if it were pre-existing, since a nature cannot preexist except
        in an individual, there would have had to be some individual of that
        human nature pre-existing before the union. But the individual of human
        nature is an hypostasis and person. Then one will be saying that the
        human nature to be assumed by the Word had pre-existed in some
        hypostasis or person. If, then, that nature had been assumed with the
        previous hypostasis or person remaining, two hypostases or persons would
        have remained after the union: one of the Word, the other of a man. And
        thus the union would not have taken place in the hypostasis or person.
        This is contrary to the teaching of the faith. But if that hypostasis or
        person in which the nature to be assumed by the Word had pre-existed
        were not remaining, this could not have happened without corruption, for
        no singular ceases to be what it is except through corruption. Thus,
        then, would that man have had to be corrupted who pro-existed the union
        and, in consequence, the human nature, as well, which was existing in
        him. It was impossible, then, that the Word assume into a unity of
        person some preexisting man.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        13] But at the same time it would detract from the perfection of the
        incarnation of God’s Word, if something natural to man were lacking to
        it But it is natural to man to he born in a human birth. But God’s Word
        would not have this if He had assumed a pre-existing man, for that man
        in his birth would have existed as pure man, and so his birth could not
        be attributed to the Word, nor could the Blessed Virgin be called the
        Mother of the Word. But what the Catholic faith confesses regarding
        natural things is that He is “in all things like as we are, without sin”
        (Heb. 4:15); and it says that the Son of God was “made of a woman,”
        following the Apostle (Gal. 4:4), that He was born and that the Virgin
        is the Mother of God. This, then, was not seemly, that He assume a
        pre-existing man.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Hence, also, it is clear that from the first moment of conception He
        united human nature to Himself. Just as God’s Word’s being human demands
        that the Word of God be born by a human birth, in order to be a true and
        natural man in complete conformity with us in respect to nature, so,
        too, it requires that God’s Word be conceived by a human conception,
        for, in the order of nature, no man is born unless first he be
        conceived. But, if the human nature to be assumed had been conceived in
        any state whatever before it was united to the Word, that conception
        could not be so attributed to the Word of God that one might call Him
        conceived by a human conception. Necessarily, then, from the first
        moment of conception the human nature was united to the Word of God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Again, the active power in human generation acts toward the
        completion of human nature in a determined individual. But, if the Word
        of God had not assumed human nature from the first moment of His
        conception, the active power in the generation would, before the union,
        have ordered its action to an individual in human nature, and this is a
        human hypostasis or person. But after the union the entire generation
        would have had to be ordered to another hypostasis or person, namely, to
        God’s Word who was being born in the human nature. Arid such a
        generation would not have been numerically one, if thus ordered to two
        persons. Neither would it—in its entirety—have been one in form; this
        seems foreign to the order of nature. Therefore, it was not suitable
        that the Word of God assume human nature after the conception, but in
        the conception itself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Once again, this seems to be required by the order of human
        generation: the one who is born must be the same as the one conceived,
        not another, for conception is ordered to birth. Hence, if the Son of
        God was born by a human birth, it must be that it was the Son of God who
        was conceived in a human conception, and not a pure man.

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Now, this further point is also clear: In the very beginning of
        conception the rational soul was united to the body.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] The Word of God, of course, assumed the body through the soul’s
        mediation, for the body of a man is not more subject to assumption by
        God than other bodies except because of the rational soul. The Word of
        God, then, did not assume the body without the rational soul. Therefore,
        since the Word of God assumed the body in the very beginning of
        conception, necessarily the rational soul was united to the body in the
        very beginning of conception.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Moreover, one who grants what is posterior in a generation must
        grant also that which is prior in the order of generation. But the
        posterior in a generation is that which is most perfect. But the most
        perfect is the generated individual, and this in human generation is an
        hypostasis or person, and it is toward constituting this that the body
        and soul are ordered. Granted, then, a personality of the man generated,
        there must needs exist a body and a rational soul. But the personality
        of the man Christ is not different from the personality of God’s Word.
        But the Word of God united a human body to Himself in the very
        conception. Therefore, the personality of that man was there. Therefore,
        the rational soul must also have been there.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] It would also have been awkward if the Word, the fount and origin of
        all perfections and forms, were united to a thing. not formed, which
        still was lacking the perfection of nature. Now, anything corporeal that
        comes into being is, before its animation, formless and still lacking
        the perfection of nature. It was, therefore, not fitting for the Word of
        God to be united to a body not yet animated. Thus, from the moment of
        conception that soul had to be united to the body.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Hence, this point too, is clear: The body assumed in the moment of
        conception was a formed body, if the assumption of something not formed
        was improper for the Word. But the soul demands its proper matter, just
        as any other natural form does. But the proper matter of the soul is the
        organized body, for a soul is “the entelechy of a natural organic body
        having life potentially.” If, then, the soul from the beginning of the
        conception was united to the body (this has been shown), the body from
        the beginning of the conception was of necessity organized and formed.
        And even the organization of the body precedes in the order of
        generation the introduction of the rational soul. Here, again, if one
        grants what is posterior, he must grant what is prior.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] But there is no reason why a quantitative increase up to the due
        measure should not follow on the body’s being animated. And so,
        regarding the conception of the man assumed, one should hold that in the
        very beginning of conception the body was organized and formed, but had
        not yet its due quantity.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] It is, of course, now plain that of necessity that man was born from
        a Virgin Mother without natural seed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] For the seed of the man is required in human generation as an active
        principle by reason of the active power in it. But the active power in
        the generation of the body of Christ could not be a natural power, in
        the light of the points we have seen. For the natural power does not of
        a sudden bring about the entire formation of the body, it requires time
        for this, but the body of Christ was in the first moment of conception
        formed and organized as was shown. Therefore, one concludes that the
        generation of Christ was without natural seed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Again, the male seed, in the generation of any animal at all,
        attracts to itself the matter supplied by the mother, as though the
        power which is in the male seed intends its own fulfillment as the end
        of the entire generation; hence, also, when the generation is completed,
        the seed itself, unchanged and fulfilled, is the offspring which is
        born. But the human generation of Christ had as ultimate term union with
        the divine Person, and not the establishment of a human person or
        hypostasis, as is clear from the foregoing. In this generation,
        therefore, the active principle could not be the seed of the man; it
        could only be the divine power. Just as the seed of the man in the
        common generation of men attracts to its subsistence the matter supplied
        by the mother, so this same matter in the generation the Word of God has
        assumed into union with Himself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] In like manner, of course, it was manifestly suitable that, even in
        the human generation of the Word of God, some spiritual property of the
        generation of a word should shine out. Now, a word as it proceeds from a
        speaker—whether conceived within or expressed without—brings no
        corruption to the speaker, rather, the word marks the plenitude of
        perfection in the speaker. It was in harmony with this that in His human
        generation the Word of God should be so conceived and born that the
        wholeness of His Mother was not impaired. And this, too, is clear: It
        became the Word of God, by whom all things are established and by whom
        all things are preserved in His wholeness, to be born so as to preserve
        His Mother’s wholeness in every way. Therefore, suitably this generation
        was from a virgin.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] And for all that, this mode of generation detracts in nothing from
        the true and natural humanity of Christ, even though He was generated
        differently from other men. For clearly, since the divine power is
        infinite, as has been proved, and since through it all causes are
        granted the power to produce an effect, every effect whatever produced
        by every cause whatever can be produced by God without the assistance of
        that cause of the same species and nature. Then, just as the natural
        power which is in the human seed produces a true man who has the human
        species and nature, so the divine power, which gave such power to the
        seed, can without its power produce that effect by constituting a true
        man who has the human species and nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] But let someone object: a naturally generated man has a body
        naturally constituted from the seed of the male and what the female
        supplies—be that what it may; therefore, the body of Christ was not the
        same in nature as ours if it was not generated from the seed of a male.
        To this an answer may be made in accordance with a position of
        Aristotle, he says that the seed of the male does not enter materially
        into the constitution of what is conceived; it is an active principle
        only, whereas the entire matter of the body is supplied by the mother.
        Taken thus, in respect of matter the body of Christ does not differ from
        ours; for our bodies also are constituted materially of that which is
        taken from the mother.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] But, if one rejects the position of Aristotle just described, then
        the objection just described has no efficacy. For the likeness or
        unlikeness of things in matter is not marked off by the state of the
        matter in the principle of generation, but by the state of the matter
        already prepared as it is in the term of the generation. There is no
        difference in matter between air generated from earth and that from
        water, because, although water and earth are different in the principle
        of generation, they are nonetheless reduced by the generating action to
        one disposition. Thus, then, by the divine power the matter taken from
        the woman alone can be reduced at the end of the generation to a
        disposition identical with that which matter has if taken simultaneously
        from the male and female. Hence, there will be no unlikeness by reason
        of diversity of matter between the body of Christ which was formed by
        the divine power out of matter taken from the mother alone, and our
        bodies which are formed by the natural power from matter, even though
        they are taken from both parents. Surely this is clear; the matter taken
        simultaneously from a man and a woman and that “slime of the earth”
        (Gen. 2:7) of which God formed the first man (very certainly a true man
        and like us in everything) differ more from one another than from the
        matter taken solely from the female from which the body of Christ was
        formed. Hence, the birth of Christ from the Virgin does not at all
        diminish either the truth of His humanity or His likeness to us. For,
        although a natural power requires a determined matter for the production
        of a determined effect therefrom, the divine power, the power able to
        produce all things from nothing, is not in its activity circumscribed
        within determinate matter.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] In the same way, that she as a virgin conceived and gave birth
        diminishes not at all the dignity of the Mother of Christ—so that she be
        not the true and natural mother of the Son of God. For, while the divine
        power worked, she supplied the natural matter for the generation of the
        body of Christ-and this alone is required on the part of the mother; but
        the things which in other mothers contribute to the loss of virginity
        belong not to the process of being a mother, but to that of being a
        father, in order to have the male seed arrive at the place of
        generation.

        [1] Although, of course, every divine operation by which something is
        accomplished in creatures is common to the entire Trinity (as has been
        shown in the points made above), the formation of Christ’s body, which
        was perfected by the divine power, is suitably ascribed to the Holy
        Spirit although it is common to the entire Trinity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Now, this seems to be in harmony with the Incarnation of the Word.
        For, just as our word mentally conceived is invisible, but is made
        sensible in an external vocal expression, so the Word of God in the
        eternal generation exists invisibly in the heart of the Father, but by
        the Incarnation is made sensible to us. Thus, the Incarnation of God’s
        Word is like the vocal expression of our word. But the vocal expression
        of our word is made by our spirit, through which the vocal formation of
        our word takes place. Suitably, then, it is through the Spirit of the
        Son Of God that the formation of His flesh is said to have taken place.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] This is also in harmony with human generation. The active power
        which is in the human seed, drawing to itself the matter which flows
        from the mother, operates by the spirit, for this kind of power is
        founded on the spirit, and by reason of its control the seed must be
        cloudy and white. Therefore, the Word of God taking flesh to Himself
        from the Virgin is suitably said to do this by His Spirit—to form flesh
        by assuming it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Ths also helps to suggest a cause moving to the Incarnation of the
        Word. And this could, indeed, be no other than the unmeasured love of
        God for man whose nature He wished to couple with Himself in unity of
        person. But in the divinity it is the Holy Spirit who proceeds as love,
        as was said. Suitably, then, was the task of Incarnation attributed to
        the Holy Spirit.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Sacred Scripture, too, is accustomed to attributing every grace to
        the Holy Spirit, for what is graciously given seems bestowed by the love
        of the giver. But no greater gift has been bestowed on man than union
        with God in person. Therefore, suitably is this work marked as the Holy
        Spirit’s own.

        [3] It would, furthermore, be productive of error to say that Christ is
        the son of the Holy Spirit. Plainly, God’s Word has a distinct Person in
        that He is the Son of God the Father. If, then, He were in His human
        nature called the son of the Holy Spirit, one would have to understand
        Christ as being two sons, since the Word of God cannot be the son of the
        Holy Spirit. And thus, since the name of sonship belongs to a person and
        not to a nature, it would follow that in Christ there are two Persons.
        But this is foreign to the Catholic faith.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] It would be unsuitable, also, to transfer the name and the authority
        of the Father to another. Yet this happens if the Holy Spirit is called
        the father of Christ.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] It is clear, moreover, that, although the human nature assumed by
        the Word is a creature, it cannot, for all that, be said without
        qualification that Christ is a creature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] For to be created is to become something. Now, since becoming is
        terminated in being simply, a becoming is of that which has subsistent
        being, and it is a thing of this kind which is a complete individual in
        the genus of substance, which, indeed in an intellectual nature is
        called a person or even an hypostasis. But one does not speak of forms
        and accidents and even parts becoming, unless relatively, since they
        have no subsistent being in themselves, but subsist in another; hence,
        when one becomes white, this is not called becoming simply, but
        relatively. But in Christ there is no other hypostasis or person save
        that of God’s Word, and this person is uncreated, as is clear from the
        foregoing. Therefore, one cannot say without qualification: “Christ is a
        creature;” although one may say it with an addition, so as to say a
        creature “so far as man” or “in His human nature.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Granted, however, that one does not, in the case of a subject which
        is an individual in the genus of substance, refer to that as becoming
        simply which belongs to it by reason of accidents or parts, but that one
        calls it becoming only relatively, one does predicate simply of the
        subject whatever follows naturally on the accidents or parts in their
        own intelligibility; for one calls a man “seeing” simply: this follows
        the eye; or “curly” because of his hair; or “visible” because of his
        color. Thus, then, the things which follow properly on human nature can
        be asserted of Christ simply: that He is “man”; that He is “visible”;
        that He “walked,” and that sort of thing. But what is the person’s very
        own is not asserted of Christ by reason of His human nature, unless with
        some addition whether expressed or implied.

          >SOLUTION OF THE ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE INCARNATION GIVEN ABOVE</span
        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] With what has now been said the points made previously against faith
        in the Incarnation are easily disposed of.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] For it has been shown that one must not understand the Incarnation
        of the Word thus: that the Word was converted into flesh or that He is
        united to the body as a form. Hence, it is not a consequence of the
        Word’s Incarnation that He who is truly God is a body or a power in a
        body as the first argument was trying to proceed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Neither does it follow that the Word was substantially changed by
        the fact that He assumed human nature. For no change was made in the
        Word of God Himself, but only in the human nature which was assumed by
        the Word, in accord with which it is proper that the Word was both
        temporally generated and born, but to the Word Himself this was not
        fitting.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] What is proposed in the third argument is also without necessity.
        For an hypostasis is not extended beyond the limits of that nature from
        which it has subsistence. The Word of God, of course, has no subsistence
        from the human nature, rather, He draws the human nature to His
        subsistence or personality. It is not through, but in, human nature that
        He subsists. Hence, nothing prevents the Word of God from being
        everywhere, although the human nature assumed by the Word of God is not
        everywhere.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Thus, also, the fourth is answered. For in any subsistent thing
        there must be only one nature by which it has being simply. And so, the
        Word of God has being simply by, the divine nature alone, not, however,
        by the human nature, by human nature He has being this—namely, being a
        man.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] The fifth also is disposed of in the very same way. For it is
        impossible that the nature by which the Word subsists be other than the
        very person of the Word. Of course, He subsists by the divine nature and
        not by the human nature, but He draws the latter to His own subsistence
        that He may subsist in it, as was said. Hence, it is not necessary that
        the human nature be identical with the person of the Word.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] From this also follows the exclusion of the sixth objection. For an
        hypostasis is less simple—whether in things or in the understanding—than
        the nature through which it is established in being: in the thing,
        indeed, when the hypostasis is not its nature, or in the understanding
        alone in the cases in which the hypostasis and the nature are
        identified. The hypostasis of the Word is not established simply by the
        human nature so as to have being through the human nature, but through
        it the Word has this alone: that He be man. It is, then, not necessary
        that the human nature be more simple than the Word so far as He is the
        Word, but only so far as the Word is this man.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] From this also the way is open to solving the seventh objection. For
        it is not necessary that the hypostasis of the Word of God be
        constituted simply by signate matter, but only so far as He is this man.
        For only as this man is He constituted by the human nature, as was said.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] Of course, that the soul and body in Christ are drawn to the
        personality of the Word without constituting a person other than the
        person of the Word does not point to a lessened power, as the eighth
        argument” would have it, but to a greater worthiness. For everything
        whatever has, when united to what is worthier, a better being than it
        has when it exists through itself; just so, the sensible soul has a
        nobler being in nun than it has in the other animals in which it is the
        principal form, for all that it is not such in man.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] Hence, also, comes the solution to the ninth objection. In Christ
        there was, indeed, this soul and this body, for all that there was not
        constituted from them another person than the person of God’s Word,
        because they were assumed unto the p6rsonality of God’s Word; just as a
        body, too, when it is without the soul, does have its own species, but
        it is from the soul, when united to it, that it receives its species.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] Thus, also, one answers what the tenth argument proposed. It is
        clear that this man who is Christ is a certain substance which is not
        universal, but particular. And He is an hypostasis; nevertheless, not
        another hypostasis than the hypostasis of the Word, for human nature has
        been assumed by the hypostasis of the Word that the Word may subsist in
        human as well as in divine nature. But that which subsists in human
        nature is this man. Hence, the Word itself is supposed’s when one says
        “this man.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [12] But, let one move the very same objection over to human nature and
        say it is a certain substance, not universal but particular and
        consequently an hypostasis-he is obviously deceived. For human nature
        even in Socrates or Plato is not an hypostasis, but that which subsists
        in the nature is an hypostasis.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [13] But to call a human nature a substance and particular is not to use
        the meaning in which one calls an hypostasis a particular substance.
        “Substance” we speak of with the Philosopher [ <i>Categories</i> 5] in
        two ways: for the supposit, namely, in the genus of substance which is
        called hypostasis; and for the what-it-is which is “the nature of a
        thing.” But the parts of a substance are not thus called particular
        substances—subsisting, so to say, in themselves; they subsist in the
        whole. Hence, neither can one call them hypostases, for none of them is
        a complete substance. Otherwise, it would follow that in one man there
        are as many hypostases as there are parts.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [14] Now, to the eleventh argument in opposition. The solution is that
        equivocation is introduced by a diversity of the form signified by a
        name, but not by diversity of supposition. For this name “man” is not
        taken as equivocal because sometimes it supposes Plato, sometimes
        Socrates. Therefore, this name “man” said of Christ and of other men
        always signifies the same form; namely, human nature. This is why it is
        predicated of them univocally; but it is only the supposition which is
        changed, and, to be sure, in this: when it is taken for Christ it
        supposes an uncreated hypostasis, but when it is taken for others it
        supposes a created hypostasis.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [15] Nor, again, is the hypostasis of the Word said to be the supposit
        of the human nature, as though subjected to the latter as to a more
        formal principle, as the twelfth argument proposed. This would, of
        course, be necessary if it were the human nature which establishes the
        hypostasis of the Word in being simply. This is obviously false: for the
        hypostasis of the Word is the subject of the human nature so far as He
        draws this latter unto His own subsistence, just as something drawn to a
        second and nobler thing to which it is united.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [16] For all that, it does not follow that the human nature accrues to
        the Word accidentally, because the Word pre-exists from eternity, as the
        final argument was trying to conclude. For the Word assumed human nature
        so as to be truly man. But to be man is to be in the genus of a
        substance. Therefore, since by union with human nature the hypostasis of
        the Word has the being of man, this does not accrue to the Word
        accidentally. For accidents do not bestow substantial being.

        [1] It has been shown, then, in the points set down that what the
        Catholic faith preaches about the Incarnation of the Son of God is not
        impossible. And the next thing is to make plain the suitability of the
        Son of God’s assumption of human nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Now, the reason for this suitability the Apostle seems to situate in
        original sin, which is passed on to all men; be says: “As by the
        disobedience of one man many were made sinners: so also by the obedience
        of one many shall be made just” (Rom. 5:19). However, since the Pelagian
        heretics denied original sin, we must now show that men are born with
        original sin.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] First, indeed, one must take up what Genesis (2:15-17) says: “The
        Lord God took man and put him into the paradise of pleasure, saying: Of
        every tree of paradise you shall eat but of the tree of knowledge of
        good and evil you shall not eat. For in what day soever you shall eat of
        it, you shall die the death.” But, since it was not on the very day that
        he ate that Adam actually died, one has to understand the words “you
        shall die the death” as “you will be handed over to the necessity of
        death.” And this would be said pointlessly if man from the institution
        of his nature had the necessity of dying. One must, then, say that death
        and the necessity of dying is a penalty inflicted on man for sin. But a
        penalty is not justly inflicted except for a fault. Therefore, in every
        single one of those in whom one finds this penalty one must of necessity
        find a fault. But this penalty is found in all men, even from the very
        moment of birth, for since that day man is born handed over to the
        necessity of death. Hence, too, some are immediately after birth,
        “carried from the womb to the grave” (Job 10:19). In them, therefore,
        there is some sin. But it is not actual sin, for children do not have
        the use of free will, and without this nothing is imputed to man as sin
        (which is clear from the things said in Book II). One must, therefore,
        say that sin is in them, passed on to them in their origin.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] This is also, made clear and explicit by the Apostle’s words: “As by
        one man sin entered into this world and by sin death, and so death pawed
        upon all men, in whom all sinned” (Rom. 5:12).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Of course, one cannot say that by one man sin entered the world by
        way of imitation. For, thus, sin would have reached only those who in
        sinning imitate the first man; and, since death entered the world by
        sin, death would reach only those who sin in the likeness of the first
        man sinning. It is to exclude this that the Apostle adds that “death
        reigned from Adam unto Moses even over them also who have not sinned
        after the similitude of the transgression of Adam” (Rom. 5:14).
        Therefore, the understanding of the Apostle is not that sin entered the
        world through one man by way of imitation, but by way of origin.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] There is more. If the Apostle were speaking of the entry of sin into
        the world by way of imitation, he should rather have said that sin
        entered the world by the devil than by one man; as is said also
        expressly in Wisdom (2:24-25): “By the envy of the devil death came into
        the world: they follow him that are of his side.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] David says furthermore, in a Psalm (50:7): “Behold I was conceived
        in iniquities and in sins did my mother conceive me “ But this cannot be
        understood of actual sin, since David is said to be conceived and born
        of a legitimate marriage. Therefore, this must be referred to original
        sin.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] Moreover, Job says (14:4): “Who can make him clean that is conceived
        of unclean seed? Is it not You only?” One gathers clearly from this that
        from the uncleanness of human seed there extends an uncleanness to the
        man conceived of the seed. One must understand this of the uncleanness
        of sin, the only one for which a man is brought into judgment, for Job
        (14:3) had already said: “And dost You think it meet to open your eyes
        upon such a one, and to bring him into judgment with You.” Thus, then,
        there is a sin contracted by man in his very origin which is called
        “original.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] Once again; baptism and the other sacraments of the Church are
        remedies of a sort against sin, as will be clarified later. But baptism,
        according to the common custom of the Church, is given to children
        recently born. It would be given quite in vain unless there were sin in
        them. But there is no actual sin in them, for they lack the exercise of
        free will—without which no act is imputed to a man as a fault.
        Therefore, one must say that there is in them a sin pissed on by their
        origin, since in the works of God and the Church there is nothing futile
        or in vain.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] But one may say: Baptism is given to infants not to cleanse them
        from sin, but to admit them to the kingdom of Cod, to which there is no
        admission without baptism, since our Lord says: “Unless a man be born
        again of water and the Holy Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of
        God” (John 3:5). This objection is in vain. For no one is excluded from
        the kingdom of God except for some fault. The end of every rational
        creature is to arrive at beatitude, and this cannot be save in the
        kingdom of God. And this, in turn, is nothing but the ordered society of
        those who enjoy the divine vision, in which true beatitude consists,
        which is clear from the points made in Book III. But nothing fails its
        end except through a sin. Therefore, if children not yet baptized cannot
        reach the kingdom of God, one must say there is some sin in them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] Thus, then, according to the tradition of the Catholic faith one
        must hold that men are born with original sin.

        [1] There are, of course, certain things which appear to be adversaries
        of this truth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] For the sin of one man is not imputed as fault to others. So Ezekiel
        (18:7.0) says: “the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father.” And
        the reason for this is that we are neither praised nor blamed except for
        the things which are in ourselves. But these are the things to which we
        are committed by will. Therefore, the sin of the first man is not
        imputed to the entire human race.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] But let one answer that when one sinned, “all sinned in him,” as the
        Apostle seems to say and so the sin of one is not imputed to another,
        but the sin is his own. Yet even this, it seems, cannot stand. For those
        born of Adam were, when Adam sinned, not yet in him actually, but only
        in his power, as in their first origin. But to sin, since it is to act,
        is proportionate only to one who actually exists. Therefore, we did not
        all sin in Adam.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] But let it be said that we sinned in Adam as though originally the
        sin comes from him to us along with the nature. Even this seems
        impossible. For an accident, since it does not pass from one subject to
        another, cannot be passed on unless the subject is passed on. But the
        subject of sin is the rational soul, which is not passed on to us from
        our first parent, but is created by God in each and one by one, as was
        shown in Book II. Therefore, it is not by origin that the sin of Adam
        flowed on to us.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Further, if the sin of our first parent flows into others because
        they take their origin from him, then, since Christ took His origin from
        our first parent, He, also, it seems, was subject to original sin. And
        this is foreign to the faith.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Moreover, what follows on a thing from its natural origin is natural
        to that thing. But what is natural to a thing is not a sin in it, thus,
        the lack of vision is not a sin in a mole. Therefore, sin could not flow
        into others by reason of their origin from the first man.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] But let it now be said that the sin flows from the first parent into
        his descendants by way of origin, not inasmuch as the origin is natural,
        but inasmuch as the origin is vitiated; this also, it seems, cannot
        stand. For a failure in nature’s work takes place only through the
        failure of some natural principle, due to some corruption in the seed,
        for example, monstrous births in animals are caused. But one cannot
        grant the corruption of a natural principle in human seed. It seems,
        then, that a sin does not flow from the first parent into his
        descendants by a vitiated origin.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] Once again; the sins of nature, appearing among its works by the
        corruption of a principle, take place neither always nor frequently
        except in a few cases. Therefore, if by a vitiated origin sin flows from
        the first parent into his descendants, it will not flow into all, but
        into some few.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] And if, furthermore, due to a vitiated origin, a failure appears in
        the offspring, that failure ought to be of the same genus as the vice
        which is in the origin, for effects are conformed to their causes. The
        origin, of course, of human generation, since it is a perfection of the
        generative power, which shares reason not at all, can have no vice in it
        which belongs to the genus of fault. For only in those acts can there be
        virtue or vice, which are subject to reason in some fashion. And so one
        does not call it a man’s fault if, due to a vitiated origin, he is born
        a leper or blind. Therefore, there is no way for a blameworthy failure
        to come down from the first parent to his descendant by origin.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] Yet again; nature’s good is not taken away by sin. Wherefore, even
        in the demons natural goods remain, as Dionysius says. But generation is
        an act of nature. Therefore, the sin of the first man could not vitiate
        the origin of human generation so that the sin of the first man should
        flow into his descendants.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] Man, moreover, generates one like himself in species. In things,
        then, which have no bearing on the generation of the species, the son
        need not be made like his parents. But sin cannot bear on the essentials
        of the species, for sin is not among the things of nature; rather, it is
        a corruption of the natural order. There is, then, no necessity that
        from a first man sinning other sinners be born.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [12] There is more. Sons are more likened to their proximate than to
        their remote parents. But at times it happens that the proximate parents
        are without sin and even in the act of generation no sin takes place. It
        is not, therefore, by the sin of the first parent that all are born
        sinners.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [13] And again, if the sin of the first man flowed into others, and—on
        the other hand—the good is more powerful in acting than the evil (as was
        shown above), then by so much the more was the satisfaction of Adam, and
        his justice, transferred through him to others.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [14] If the sin of the first man, moreover, was by origin propagated to
        his descendants, by an equal reason the sins of other parents pass down
        to their descendants. And in this way the later would always be more
        burdened with sins than the earlier generations. Especially must this
        follow if, in fact, the sin passes on from the parent to the offspring,
        and the satisfaction cannot pass on.

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Now, for the solution of these points one should first set down that
        certain signs of the original sin appear with probability in the human
        race. For, since God takes care of human acts so as to give reward for
        good works and set a penalty for bad works, as was previously shown, it
        is from the very penalty that we can assure ourselves of the fault. Now,
        the human race commonly suffers various penalties, both bodily and
        spiritual. Greatest among the bodily ones is death, and to this all the
        others are ordered: namely, hunger, thirst, and others of this sort.
        Greatest~ of course, among the spiritual penalties is the frailty of
        reason: from this it happens that man with difficulty arrives at
        knowledge of the truth; that with ease he falls into error, and that he
        cannot entirely overcome his beastly appetites, but is over and over
        again beclouded by them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] For all that, one could say that defects of this kind, both bodily
        and spiritual, are not penalties, but natural defects necessarily
        consequent upon matter. For, necessarily, the human body, composed of
        contraries, must be corruptible; and the sensible appetite must be moved
        to sense pleasures, and these are occasionally contrary to reason. And,
        since the possible intellect is in potency to all intelligibles,
        possessing none of them actually, but by nature acquiring them from the
        senses, one must arrive at knowledge of the truth with difficulty, and
        due to the phantasms one with ease deviates from the truth. But, for all
        that, let one weigh matters rightly, and he will be able to judge with
        probability enough—granted a divine providence which for every
        perfection has contrived a proportionate perfectible—that God united a
        superior to an inferior nature for this purpose: that the superior rule
        the inferior, and that, if some obstacle to this dominion should happen
        from a failure of nature, it would be removed by His special and
        supernatural benefaction. And the result would be, since the rational
        soul is of a higher nature than the body, belief that the rational soul
        was united to the body under such a condition that in the body there can
        be nothing contrary to the soul by which the body lives; and, in like
        fashion, if reason in man is united to the sensual appetite and other
        sensitive powers, that the reason be not impeded by the sensible powers,
        but be master over them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Thus, then, according to the teaching of the faith, we set it down
        that man from the beginning was thus established by God: As long as
        man’s reason was subject to God, not only did the inferior powers serve
        reason without obstacle, but the body also could not be impeded in
        subjection to reason by any bodily obstacle—God and His grace supplying,
        because nature had too little for perfecting this establishment. But,
        when reason turned away from God, not only did the inferior powers rebel
        from reason, but the body also sustained passions contrary to that life
        which is from the soul.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Of course, although defects of this kind may seem natural to man in
        an absolute consideration of human nature on its inferior side,
        nonetheless, taking into consideration divine providence and the dignity
        of human nature on its superior side, it can be proved with enough
        probability that defects of this kind are penalties. And one can gather
        thus that the human race was originally infected with sin.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] These things now seen, one must answer to the points made as
        contrary objections.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Now, there is no awkwardness in saying that when one sins the sin is
        propagated to all in their origin, even though each is praised or blamed
        according to his own act; as the first argument attempted to proceed.
        For things go one way in matters of a single individual, and another way
        in matters of the entire nature of a species, since “by participation in
        the species many men are as one man,” as Porphyry says. A sin, then,
        which refers to an individual man or his person is not imputed to
        another as fault unless he be the sinner, since personally one is
        divided off from another. But, if there is a sin which looks to the
        nature of the species itself, there is nothing awkward about its
        propagation from one to another, just as the nature of the species is
        communicated through one to others. But, since sin is a kind of evil of
        rational nature, and evil a privation of good, one judges on the basis
        of the missing good whether a sin is related to a nature commonly or to
        a person
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Of course, actual sins which are committed by all men commonly deprive
        the person of the sinner of a good: grace, for instance, and the due
        order of the parts of the soul. This is why they are personal, and why,
        when one sins, the sin is not imputed to another. But the first sin of
        the first man not only deprived him of his proper and personal
        good—namely, grace, and the due order of the parts of the soul—he was
        deprived as well of a good related to the common nature. For—as we said
        above—human nature was established in its first beginning so that the
        inferior powers were perfectly subject to reason, the reason to God, the
        body to the soul, and God was by His grace supplying what nature lacked
        for this arrangement. Now, this kind of benefit which some call
        “original justice” was conferred on the first man in such wise that he
        was to propagate it to his descendants along with human nature. But in
        the sin of the first man reason withdrew itself from the divine
        subjection. And it has followed thereon that the lower powers are not
        perfectly subject to the reason nor is the body to the soul; and this is
        not only the case for the first sinner, but the same consequent defect
        follows into his posterity and to the posterity in whom the original
        justice mentioned was going to follow. Thus, then, the sin of the first
        man from whom all other men are derived according to the teaching of
        faith was not only personal in that it deprived the first man of his own
        good, but natural, also, in that it deprived him and consequently his
        descendants of the benefit bestowed on the entire human nature. Thus,
        too, this kind of defect which is in others as a consequence from the
        first parent still has in others the essentials of fault so far as all
        men are counted as one man by participation in the common nature. For
        one discovers the voluntary character in a sin of this kind in the will
        of the first parent much as the action of the hand has the essentials of
        fault from the will of the first mover, which is the power of reason; as
        a result, in a sin of nature judgments are made about the diverse men as
        though parts of a common nature, much as they are made in a personal sin
        about diverse parts of one man.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] In this way, then, it is true to say that when one sinned, “all
        sinned in him,” as the Apostle says, and on this basis the second
        argument made its proposal. Other men were present in Adam, however, not
        in act, but only in his power as in an Original principle. Nor are they
        said to have sinned in him as exercising any act, but so far as they
        belong to Adam’s nature which was corrupted by sin.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] Let the sin be propagated from the first parent to his descendants.
        Nevertheless, it does not follow, although the subject of sin is the
        rational soul, that the rational soul is propagated along with the seed;
        as the progress of the third argument had it. For the manner of
        propagating this sin of nature which is called original is like that of
        the very nature of the species, and this nature, although it is
        perfected by the rational soul, is for all that not propagated with the
        seed; such propagation is only of the body fitted by nature to receive
        such a soul. It was in Book II that we showed this.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] We grant that Christ was a descendant of the first parent in the
        flesh. For all that, He did not incur the contamination of original sin
        as the fourth argument concluded. For it was only the matter of His
        human body which He received from the first parent; the power to form
        His body was not derived from the first parent, but was the power of the
        Holy Spirit, as was shown. Accordingly, He did not receive human nature
        from Adam as an agent although He did receive it from Adam as from a
        material principle.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] One should consider this, also: The natures origin passes along the
        defects mentioned because the nature has been stripped of that help of
        grace which had been bestowed on it in the first parent to pass on to
        his descendants along with the nature. Now, since this stripping came
        from a voluntary sin, the consequent defect has the character of fault.
        Hence, defects of this kind are faulty when referred to their first
        principle, which is the sin of Adam; and they are natural when referred
        to the nature already stripped. Accordingly, the Apostle says: ‘We were
        by nature children of wrath” (Eph. 2:3). In this way one answers the
        fifth objection.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] Clearly, then, from what has been said, the vice of origin in which
        the original sin is caused comes from the failure of a principle,
        namely, the gratuitous gift which human nature at its institution had
        had bestowed upon it. To be sure, this gift was in a sense natural: not
        natural as caused by the principles of the nature, but natural because
        it was given to man to be propagated along with his nature. But the
        sixth objection” was dealing with the natural which is caused by the
        principles of the nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [12] The seventh objection proceeds in the same way, from a defect of a
        natural principle belonging to the nature of the species. Of course,
        what comes from a defect of a natural principle of this kind happens in
        but few cases. But the defect of original sin comes from the defect of a
        principle added over and above the principles of the species, as we
        said.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [13] Be it observed, also, that in the act of the generative powers
        there can be no vice in the genus of actual sin which depends on the
        will of a single person, because the act of the generative power is not
        obedient to reason or to will, as the eighth objection went. But nothing
        prevents our finding the vice of original sin—this refers to nature-in
        an act of the generative power, since acts of the generative powers are
        called natural.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [14] The ninth objection, of course, can readily be answered from the
        points already made. For sin does not take away that good of nature
        which belongs to the nature’s species. But that good of nature which
        grace added over and above nature could be removed by the sin of our
        first parent. This was said before.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [15] From the same points one easily answers the tenth objection. For,
        since privation and defect correspond to one another mutually, in that
        characteristic in original sin are the children made like to the parents
        in which the gift also, granted the nature in the beginning, would have
        been propagated to their descendants; for, although the gift did not
        belong to the essentials of the species, it was given by divine grace to
        the first man to flow from him into the entire species.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [16] This, too, must be considered: Let one by the sacraments of grace
        be cleansed from original sin so that it is not imputed a fault in him
        (and for him personally this is to be freed from original sin); for all
        that~ the nature is not entirely healed; therefore, in an act of the
        nature the original sin is transmitted to his descendants. Thus, then,
        in a man who generates there is no original sin in so far as he is a
        given person; and it also happens that in the act of generation there is
        no actual sin, which the eleventh argument was proposing. But so far as
        the man who generates is the natural principle of generation, the
        infection of the original sin which bears on nature remains in him and
        in his act of generation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [17] Be it observed, also, that the actual sin of the first man passed
        over into nature because the nature in him had been further perfected by
        the benefit bestowed on the nature. But, when by his sin the nature was
        stripped of the benefit, his act was simply personal. Hence, he could
        not satisfy for the entire nature, nor could he make the good of nature
        whole once more by his act. But the only satisfaction of which he was
        somewhat capable was that which had a bearing on his own person. Therein
        the answer to the twelfth argument appears.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [18] In like manner, of course, one answers the thirteenth, for the sins
        of later parents find a nature stripped of the benefit which was at the
        outset granted to the nature itself. Hence, from those sins no defect
        follows which is propagated to the descendants, but only a defect which
        infects the person of the one sinning.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [19] Thus, then, it is neither unsuitable nor irrational to affirm the
        presence of original sin in men, and thus the heresy of the Pelagians,
        which was a denial of original sin, is confounded.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Faith in the Incarnation, of course, is counted foolishness by
        unbelievers, as the Apostle has it: “It pleased God by the foolishness
        of our preaching to save them that believe” (1 Cor. 1:21); and it seems
        foolish to preach a thing which is not just impossible, but also
        unbecoming; therefore, the unbelievers press on their fight against the
        Incarnation, and they try not only to show that what the Catholic faith
        preaches is impossible, but also that it is inharmonious, and that it
        ill befits the divine goodness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] For it does befit the divine goodness that all things stand fast in
        order. Now, the order of things is this: that God be exalted above all
        things, but man hemmed in among the lowest creatures. Therefore, it ill
        befits the divine majesty to be united to human nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Once more; if it was suitable for God to become man, this had to be
        for some usefulness coming therefrom. But whatever be the usefulness
        granted, since God is omnipotent He could produce this usefulness merely
        by His will. Therefore, since it becomes everything whatever to be done
        as quickly as possible, it was unnecessary for a utility of this sort
        that God unite human nature to Himself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Since God is, moreover, the universal cause of all things. He should
        especially attend the usefulness of things in their universal entirety.
        But the assumption of human nature looks only to the usefulness of man.
        It was, therefore, not seemly for God, if He was to take on a foreign
        nature, to assume only human nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Moreover, the more one thing is like another, the more suitably it
        is united to the other. But the angelic nature is more like God and
        closer to Him than human nature. Therefore, it was not suitable to
        assume human nature and pass over the angelic.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] There is more. The chief thing in man is his understanding of the
        truth. And in this man seems to be impeded if God assumed human nature,
        for man is thus given an occasion of error, its result is agreement with
        those who held that God is not exalted above all bodies. Therefore, it
        contributed nothing useful to human nature for God to assume human
        nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Again, we can learn from experience that many an error concerning
        the Incarnation of God has arisen. It seems, then, that it was not
        becoming human salvation that God should be incarnate.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] Furthermore, among all the things that God has done, that appears
        the greatest: His own assumption of flesh. But from the greatest work
        one should look for the greatest usefulness. If, then, the Incarnation
        of God is ordered to the salvation of men, it appears that it was
        becoming that He should have saved the entire human race, since even all
        men’s salvation scarcely seems to be useful enough that so great a work
        should have been done for it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] What is more, if God assumed human nature for the salvation of men,
        apparently it was suitable that there be enough indications for men of
        His divinity. But it seems this did not happen, for some other men
        simply assisted by the divine power and without God’s union to their
        nature are discovered doing miracles like or even greater than those
        which Christ did (cf. John 24:12). It seems, then, that Gods,
        Incarnation did not take place with enough care for human salvation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] There is more. If it was necessary for human salvation that God
        take on flesh, since there were men from the beginning of the world, it
        appears that from the beginning of the world He ought to have assumed
        human nature, and not, so to say, in the last days, for it seems that
        the salvation of all the preceding men was passed over.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] For the same reason, also, He should have dwelt among men to the
        very end of the world, in order to instruct men by His presence and
        govern them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [12] Then, too, this is, above all, useful to men: to solidify in them
        the hope of future beatitude. But this hope would have been better
        conceived from an incarnate God if He had assumed an immortal,
        impassible, and glorious flesh and had displayed this to all men.
        Therefore, it seems not suitable to have assumed a mortal and frail
        flesh.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [13] Apparently it was suitable, furthermore, to show that whatever is
        in the world is from God, He should have put to use the abundance of
        earthly things, living in riches and the greatest honors. It is the
        contrary we read of Him: that He. led a poor and abject life, that He
        suffered a shameful death. Therefore, what the faith preaches about the
        incarnate God is not suitable.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [14] The fact, moreover, that He suffered abjectly did most to obscure
        His divinity. Nonetheless, the most necessary thing for men all the
        while was this: that they know His divinity—if He was God incarnate. It
        seems, then, that what the faith preaches,.is not in harmony with human
        salvation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [15] Let a man say that the Son of God underwent death by reason of His
        obedience to the Father—this also appears unreasonable. For obedience
        consists in one’s conforming himself to the will of him who commands.
        But the will of God the Father cannot be unreasonable. If, then, it was
        unbecoming for God made man to suffer death because death seems contrary
        to divinity which is life, the reason for this thing cannot suitably be
        found in obedience to the Father.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [16] God’s will, moreover, is not for the death of men, even sinners,
        but for life, as Ezekiel (18:23, 32) says: “I will not the death Of the
        sinner, but rather that he be converted and live.” By so much the less,
        then, could it have been the will of God that the most perfect man be
        subject to death.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [17] It seems, furthermore, impious and cruel to command an innocent to
        be led to death, especially on behalf of the impious who are worthy of
        death. But the man Christ Jesus was innocent. Therefore, it would have
        been impious if at the command of God the Father He had undergone death.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [18] But let a man say that this was necessary as a demonstration of
        humility, as the Apostle appears to say, that Christ “humbled Himself,
        becoming obedient unto death” (Phil. 2:8)—this reason is not suitable
        either, because, in the first place, one must commend humility in him
        who has a superior to whom he can be subject. This cannot be said of
        God. Therefore, it was not suitable for God’s Word to be humbled unto
        death.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [19] Again, men were able to be informed sufficiently about humility by
        the divine words-to which faith must wholly cling-and by human examples.
        Therefore, to set an example of humility it was not necessary for the
        Word of God either to assume flesh or to undergo death.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [20] But, again, let one say that it was necessary for the cleansing of
        our sins that Christ undergo death and the other seemingly abject
        things; as the Apostle says: “He was delivered up for our sins” (Rom.
        4:25); and again: “He was offered once to exhaust the sins of many”
        (Heb. 9:28). This, too, seems awkward, because, in the first place, only
        by God’s grace are men cleansed of sins.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2]] In the next place, because, if satisfaction was required, it was
        suitable that he should give satisfaction who had sinned. For in the
        just judgment of God “every one shall bear his own burden” (Gal. 6:5).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [22] Again, if it was becoming for someone greater than, pure man to
        satisfy for man, it seems it would have been sufficient for an angel to
        take flesh and fulfill this sort of satisfaction, since an angel is by
        nature superior to a man.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [23] What is more, sin is not expiated by sin, but increased. Then, if
        Christ had to satisfy by death, His death should have been such that no
        man sinned therein; that is to say, He should have died not a violent,
        but a natural, death.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [24] If Christ, moreover, had to die for the sins of men, since men sin
        frequently He should have had to undergo death frequently.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        125] Now, let one say that it was especially because of original sin
        that Christ had to be born and to suffer, and that sin had infected the
        whole human race when the first man sinned. But this seems impossible.
        For, if other men are not equal to satisfying for original sin, neither
        does the death of Christ seem to have been satisfactory for the sins of
        the human race, since He Himself died in His human, not in His divine
        nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [26] Furthermore, if Christ made satisfaction enough for the sins of the
        human race, it seems unjust that men still suffer the penalties which
        were brought in, Scripture says, by sin.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [27] There is more. If Christ made satisfaction enough for the sins of
        the human race, no further remedies for the absolution of sins need be
        sought. But they are constantly sought by all who have care for their
        salvation. Therefore, it seems that Christ did not sufficiently take
        away the sins of men.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [28] These and similar points, then, can make it appear to a man that
        what the Catholic faith preaches about the Incarnation has not been
        harmonious with the divine majesty and wisdom.

        [1] However, if one earnestly and devoutly weighs the mysteries of the
        Incarnation, he will find so great a depth of wisdom that it exceeds
        human knowledge. In the Apostle’s words: “The foolishness of God is
        wiser then men” (1 Cor. 1:25). Hence it happens that to him who devoutly
        considers it, more and more wondrous aspects of this mystery are made
        manifest.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] First, then, let this be taken into consideration: The Incarnation
        of God was the most efficacious assistance to man in his striving for
        beatitude. For we have shown in Book IIII that the perfect beatitude of
        man consists in the immediate vision of God. It might, of course, appear
        to some that man would never have the ability to achieve this state:
        that the human intellect be united immediately to the divine essence
        itself as an intellect is to its intelligible; for there is an
        unmeasured distance between the natures, and thus, in the search for
        beatitude, a man would grow cold, held back by very desperation. But the
        fact that God was willing to unite human nature to Himself personally
        points out to men with greatest clarity that man can be united to God by
        intellect, and see Him immediately. It was, then, most suitable for God
        to assume human nature to stir up man’s hope for beatitude. Hence, after
        the Incarnation of Christ, men began the more to aspire after heavenly
        beatitude; as He Himself says: “I have come that they may have life and
        may have it more abundantly” (John 10:10).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] At the same time, too, some obstacles to acquiring beatitude are
        removed from man. For, since the perfect beatitude of man consists in
        the enjoyment of God alone, as shown above, necessarily every man is
        kept from participation in the true beatitude who cleaves as to an end
        to these things which are less than God. But man was able to be misled
        into this clinging as to an end to things less than God in existence by
        his ignorance of the worthiness of his nature. Thus it happens with
        some. They look on themselves in their bodily and sentient nature-which
        they have in common with other animals—and in bodily things and fleshly
        pleasures they seek out a kind of animal beatitude. But there have been
        others who considered the excellence of certain creatures superior to
        man in some respects. And to the cult of these they bound themselves.
        They worshiped the universe and its parts because of the greatness of
        its size and its long temporal duration; or spiritual substances, angels
        and demons, because they found these greater than man both in
        immortality and in sharpness of understanding. They judged that in
        these, as existing above themselves, the beatitude of man should be
        sought. Now, although it is true, some conditions considered, that man
        stands inferior to some creatures, and even that in certain matters he
        is rendered like to the lowest creatures, nothing stands higher in the
        order of end than man except God alone, in whom alone man’s perfect
        beatitude is to be found. Therefore, this dignity of man—namely, that in
        the immediate vision of God his beatitude is to be found—was most
        suitably manifested by God by His own immediate assumption of human
        nature. And we look upon this consequence of God’s Incarnation: a large
        part of mankind passing by the cult of angels, of demons, and all
        creatures whatsoever, spurning, indeed, the pleasures of the flesh and
        all things bodily, have dedicated themselves to the worship of God
        alone, and in Him only they look for the fulfillment of this beatitude;
        and so the Apostle exhorts: “Seek the things that are above where Christ
        is sitting at the right hand of God. Mind the things that are above, not
        the things that are upon the earth” (Col. 5:1-2).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Since man’s perfect beatitude, furthermore, consists in the sort of
        knowledge of God which exceeds the capacity of every created intellect
        (as was shown in Book III), there had to be a certain foretaste of this
        sort of knowledge in man which might direct him to that fullness of
        blessed knowledge; and this is done through faith, as we showed in Book
        III. But the knowledge by which man is directed to his ultimate end has
        to be most certain knowledge, because it is the principle of everything
        ordered to the ultimate end; so, also, the principles naturally known
        are most certain. But there cannot be a most certain knowledge of
        something unless the thing be known of itself, as the first principles
        of demonstration are known to us; or the thing be resolved into what is
        known of itself, in the way in which the conclusion of a demonstration
        is most certain for us. Of course, what is set forth for us to hold
        about God by faith cannot be known of itself to man, since it exceeds
        the capacity of the human intellect. Therefore, this had to be made
        known to man by Him to whom it is. known of itself. And, although to all
        who see the divine essence this truth is somehow known of itself,
        nevertheless, in order to have a most certain knowledge there had to be
        a reduction to the first principle of this knowledge—namely, to God. To
        Him this truth is naturally known of itself, and from Him it becomes
        known to all. And just so the certitude of a science is had only by
        resolution into the first indemonstrable principles. Therefore, man, to
        achieve perfect certitude about the truth of faith, had to be instructed
        by God Himself made man, that man might in the human fashion grasp the
        divine instruction. And this is what John (1: 18) says: “No man has seen
        God at any time; the only-begotten Son who is in the bosom of the
        Father, He has declared Him: And our Lord Himself says: “For this was I
        born and for this came I into the world, that I should give testimony to
        the truth” (John 18:37). And for this reason we see that after Christ’s
        Incarnation men were the more evidently and the more surely instructed
        in the divine knowledge; as Isaiah (11:9) has it: “The earth is filled
        with the knowledge of the Lord.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Again, since man’s perfect beatitude consists in the enjoyment of
        divinity, man’s love had to be disposed toward a desire for the
        enjoyment of divinity, as we see that there is naturally in man a desire
        of beatitude. But the desire to enjoy anything is caused by love of that
        thing. Therefore, man, tending to perfect beatitude, needed inducement
        to the divine love. Nothing, of c6urse, so induces us to love one as the
        experience of his love for us. But God’s love for men could be
        demonstrated to man in no way more effective than this: He willed to be
        united to man in person, for it is proper to love to unite the lover
        with the beloved so far as possible. Therefore, it was necessary for man
        tending to perfect beatitude that God become man.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Furthermore, since friendship consists in a certain equality, things
        greatly unequal seem unable to be coupled in friendship. Therefore, to
        get greater familiarity in friendship between man and God it was helpful
        for man that God became man, since even by nature man is man’s friend;”
        and so in this way, “while we know God visibly, we may [through Him] be
        home to love of things invisible.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] In like fashion, too, it is clear that beatitude is the reward of
        virtue. Therefore, they who tend to beatitude must be virtuously
        disposed. But we are stimulated to virtue both by words and by examples.
        Of course, his examples and words of whose goodness we have the more
        solid opinion induce us the more effectively to virtue. But an
        infallible opinion of goodness about any pure man was never tenable-,
        even the holiest of men, one finds, have failed in some things. Hence,
        it was necessary for man to be solidly grounded in virtue to receive
        from God made human both the teaching and the examples of virtue. For
        this reason our Lord Himself says: “I have given you an example that as
        I have done to you do also” (John 13:15).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] By virtues, again, man is disposed to beatitude, and so by sin he is
        blocked therefrom. Sin, of course, the contrary of virtue, constitutes
        an obstacle to beatitude; it not only induces a kind of disorder in the
        soul by seducing it from its due end, but it also offends God to whom we
        look for the reward of beatitude, in that God has the custody of human
        acts. And sin is the contrary of divine charity, as we showed more fully
        in Book III. What is more, man, being aware of this offense, loses by
        sin that confidence in approaching God which is necessary to achieve
        beatitude. Therefore, the human race, which abounds in sins, needed to
        have some remedy against sin applied to it. But this remedy can be
        applied only by Cod, who can move the will of man to good and bring it
        back to the order due; who can, as well, remit the offense committed
        against Him-for an offense is not remitted except by him against whom
        the offense is committed. But, if man is to be freed from awareness of
        past offense, he must know clearly that God has remitted his offense.
        But man cannot be clear on this with certainty unless God gives him
        certainty of it. Therefore, it was suitable and helpful to the human
        race for achieving beatitude that God should become man; as a result,
        man not only receives the remission of sins through God, but also the
        certitude of this remission through the man-God. Hence, our Lord Himself
        says: “But that you may know that the Son of Man has power to forgive
        sins” (Mat. 9:6), and the rest; and the Apostle says that “the blood of
        Christ will cleanse our conscience from dead works to serve the living
        God” (Heb. 9:14).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] The tradition of the Church, moreover, teaches us that the whole
        human race was infected by sin. But the order of divine justice—as is
        clear from the foregoing—requires that God should not remit sin without
        satisfaction. But to satisfy for the sin of the whole human race was
        beyond the power of any pure man, because any pure man is something less
        than the whole human race in its entirety. Therefore, in order to free
        the human race from its common sin, someone had to satisfy who was both
        man and so proportioned to the satisfaction, and something above man
        that the merit might be enough to satisfy for the sin of the whole human
        race. But there is no greater than man in the order of beatitude, except
        God, for angels, although superior to man in the condition of nature,
        are not superior in the order of end, because the same end beatifies
        them. Therefore, it was necessary for man’s achievement of beatitude
        that God should become man to take away the sin of the human race. And
        this is what John the Baptist said of Christ: “Behold the Lamb of God,
        behold Him who takes away the sin of the world” (John 1:79). And the
        Apostle says: “As by the offense of one, unto all men to condemnation;
        so also by the justice of one, unto all men to justification” (Rom.
        5:16).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] These points, then, and similar ones make us able too conceive that
        it was not out of harmony with the divine goodness for God to become
        man, but extremely helpful for human salvation.

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Now, then, the points opposed to this doctrine above are disposed of
        easily.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] It is not contrary to the order of things for God to become man, as
        the first argument proceeded. This is the case because, although the
        divine nature exceeds the human nature to infinity, man in the order of
        his nature has God Himself for end and has been born to be united to God
        by his intellect And this union had as example and testimony of a sort
        the union of God to man in person; nonetheless, what was proper to each
        nature was preserved, so that nothing of the excellence of the divine
        nature was lost, nor was there an exaltation which drew the human nature
        beyond the bounds of its species.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] There is the following to be considered, also. By reason of the
        perfection and immobility of the divine goodness, God loses no dignity
        no matter how closely a creature draws near to Him, although this makes
        the creature grow in dignity. For He communicates His goodness to
        creatures in such wise that He Himself suffers no loss.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] In like fashion, too, one grants that God’s will suffices for doing
        all things; nevertheless, the divine wisdom requires that provision be
        made for the various classes of things in harmony with themselves, for
        He has suitably established the proper causes of various things. Be it
        granted, accordingly, that God was able by His will alone to effect in
        the human race every useful good which we are saying came from God’s
        Incarnation, as the second argument was proposing; nevertheless, it was
        in harmony with human nature to bring about these useful goods through
        God made man, just as the arguments giveng make apparent to some extent.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] The answer to the third argument is also plain. For, since man is
        constituted of a spiritual and of a bodily nature, and stands, so to
        say, on the boundary of each nature, that appears to belong to the whole
        of creaturehood which is done for the salvation of man. For the lesser
        bodily creatures seem to yield to man’s use and are in some way subject
        to him. But the superior spiritual, namely the angelic, creature has the
        achievement of the ultimate end in common with man (this is plain from
        the foregoing). Thus, it seems suitable that the universal cause of all
        things assume that creature into unity of person in which the cause
        shares more with other creatures.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] This fact should be considered, also: To act of itself belongs only
        to the rational creature, for irrational creatures are more acted upon
        by a rational force than they are acting of themselves. Hence, they are
        rather in the order of instrumental causes than bearing themselves as
        principal agents. But the assumption of a creature by God had to be of
        the kind which could act of itself as a principal agent. For whatever
        acts as an instrument acts as moved into action, but a principal agent
        acts of itself. If, then, something was to be done divinely by an
        irrational creature, it sufficed, the creature’s condition considered,
        that it merely be moved by God. But it would not be assumed in person
        for the person to actq since its natural condition was not susceptible
        of this, it was only the condition. of the rational nature which was so
        susceptible. Therefore, for God to assume an irrational creature was not
        suitable, whereas to assume a rational one, whether human or angelic,
        was.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] And, although one finds in the angelic nature natural properties
        making it more excellent than the human nature, as the fourth argument
        was proposing, the human nature was nevertheless assumed with greater
        fitness. First, indeed, this is because in man sin is subject to
        expiation; and this is so because his choice is not unchangeably fixed
        on something, but can be perverted from good to evil, and from evil
        restored to good. In man’s reason, also, this happens: Since it gathers
        the truth from sensible things and certain signs, the way lies open to
        contradictory positions. But an angel, just as he has an unchangeable
        grasp of truth because he knows by simple understanding, so also he has
        an unchangeable choice. Accordingly, he is either not fixed upon evil at
        all, or, if he is fixed on evil, is fixed so immutably. Hence, his sin
        is not subject to expiation. Since, then, the chief cause of the divine
        incarnation appears to be the expiation of sin, as divine Scripture
        teaches us, it was more fitting that God assume a human than an angelic
        nature. Second, the assumption of the creature by God is in person, not
        in nature-as the foregoing makes clear. It was, therefore, more suitable
        to assume the human than the angelic nature because in man the nature is
        other than the person, for man is composite of matter and form; but this
        is not so in the angel, who is immaterial. Third, the angel, in what is
        proper to his nature, is closer to the knowledge of God than man is
        whose knowledge arises from the senses. Therefore, it was sufficient for
        the angel to be intelligibly instructed by God regarding divine truth.
        But the condition of man required that God instruct man sensibly about
        Himself as Man. This was done by the Incarnation. Then, again, the very
        distance of man from God seemed more repugnant to the divine enjoyment.
        Therefore, man needed to be assumed by God more than an angel did, that
        man’s hope for beatitude be stimulated. Lastly, man, since he is the
        term of creatures, presupposing, so to say, all other creatures in the
        natural order of generation, is suitably united to the first principle
        of things to finish a kind of cycle in the perfection of things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] But the fact that God assumed human nature gives no occasion of
        error, as the fifth argument was trying to show. For the assumption of
        humanity, as already said, took place in a unity of person, not in a
        unity of nature, which might result in our agreement with those who held
        that God is not exalted above all things, and said that God was the soul
        of the universe, or something of the sort.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] We grant, of course, that respecting God’s Incarnation certain
        errors have arisen, as the sixth argument objected; nevertheless, it is
        manifest that after the Incarnation many more errors were removed. For,
        just as in the creation of things which proceeded from the divine
        goodness some evils followed, and this was proportionate to the
        condition of creatures which are able to fail, so also in the
        manifestation of divine truth it is not astonishing that some errors
        have arisen from the failure of human minds. And these errors, for all
        that, exercised the talents of the faithful toward a more diligent
        penetration and understanding of divine truth, just as the evils which
        occur in creatures are ordered by God to some good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] Although, of course, every created good turns out to be negligible
        in comparison to the divine good, nevertheless, because in things
        created nothing can be greater than the salvation of the rational
        creature (which consists in the enjoyment of the divine goodness
        itself)—since human salvation has followed upon the divine
        Incarnation-it was no small usefulness which the Incarnation mentioned
        brought to the universe (so the seventh argument was proceeding). And it
        need not follow on this that all men should be saved, but only those who
        adhere to the Incarnation mentioned by faith and the sacraments of the
        faith. To be sure, the power of the divine Incarnation is equal to the
        salvation ‘of all men, but the fact that some are not saved thereby
        comes from their indisposition: they are unwilling to take unto
        themselves the fruit of the Incarnation; they do not cleave to the
        incarnate God by faith and love. For men were not intended to lose that
        freedom of choice by which they are able to cleave or not to cleave to
        the incarnate God, lest the good of man be produced by coercion—a good
        without merit and without praise.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] There have also been sufficient indications to make this
        Incarnation of God manifest to men. For there is no more suitable way to
        manifest divinity than by things which are God’s very own. But this is
        God’s very own: the power to change the laws of nature by doing
        something above that nature whose very author He is. Most suitably,
        then, is something proved divine by doing works above the laws of
        nature, to enlighten the blind, for instance, or to cleanse lepers, or
        to raise the dead. Works of this kind are what Christ did. Accordingly,
        when He was asked: “Are you He that is to come or look we for another?”
        by these works He Himself indicated His divinity in His reply: “The
        blind see, the lame walk, the deaf hear” (Mat. 11:15, 5), And so forth.
        But to create another world was not necessary; and this was not
        consonant either with the divine wisdom or with the nature of things.
        One may, of course, say—as the eighth argument was proposing—that we
        read of others also performing miracles of this kind, but it must be
        borne in mind that Christ performed them very differently and more
        divinely. For we read of others doing these things by praying; Christ
        did them by commanding by His very own power, so to say. And He not only
        did these things Himself, but even granted to others the power to do the
        same, and greater; and the latter used to do them by the mere invocation
        of the name of Christ. And not merely bodily miracles were worked
        through Christ, but spiritual ones as well, and these are much greater:
        namely, by Christ and at the invocation of His name the Holy Spirit is
        received, and so hearts are inflamed by the affection of divine charity;
        and minds suddenly are instructed in the knowledge of things divine; and
        the tongues of the unlettered are rendered skilled for setting divine
        truth forth to men. But works of this sort are express indications of
        the divinity of Christ; they are things so pare man was able to do.
        Hence, the Apostle says that the salvation of men “which, having begun
        to be declared by the Lord, was confirmed unto us by them that heard
        Him, God also bearing them witness by signs and wonders, and divers
        miracles, and distributions of the Holy Spirit” (Heb. 2:3-4).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [12] Granted, of course, that God’s Incarnation was necessary for the
        entire human race, it was not for all that, necessary that God be
        incarnate from the beginning of the world, as the ninth objection ran.
        Now first: by the incarnate God a remedy against sin had to be brought
        to men, as was shown above. But no one receives a suitable remedy
        against sin unless first he acknowledges his failure, so that man in his
        lowliness, not relying on himself, may put his ‘hope in God, by whom
        alone sin can be healed, as was said above. Man’s presumption was
        possible,of course, both in regard to knowledge and in regard to virtue.
        He had, then, to be left to himself for a while to discover that he was
        not equal to his own salvation: not equal by natural knowledge, for
        before the time of the written law man transgressed the law of nature;
        nor equal by his own virtue, for, when he was given knowledge of sin
        through the law, he still sinned out of weakness. Thus necessarily, man,
        presuming neither on his knowledge nor on his virtue, could at last be
        given efficacious help against sin by Christ’s Incarnation; namely, the
        grace of Christ by which he was not only to be instructed in doubtful
        matters lest he be deficient in knowledge, but also to be strengthened
        against the assaults of temptation lest he be deficient through frailty.
        And so it happened that there were three states of the human race: the
        first, before the Law; the second, under the Law; the third, under
        grace.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Then, again, by the incarnate God precepts and perfect testimonies were
        to be given to men. Now, the condition of human nature requires that it
        be not led immediately to the perfect, but that it be led by the hand
        through the imperfect so as to arrive at perfection. We see this in the
        instruction of children. They are first instructed minimally; for they
        cannot grasp perfect things in the beginning. In the same way, also, if
        to some multitude things unheard of were proposed as great, the
        multitude would not grasp them immediately unless it became accustomed
        to these things by something less great. Thus, then, was it suitable
        that from the beginning the human race be instructed in the matter of
        its salvation by some light and lesser testimonies through the
        Patriarchs, and the Law, and the Prophets; and that at last, at the
        consummate time, the perfect teaching of Christ be set forth on earth.
        Thus, the Apostle says: “When the fullness of the time was come “sent
        His Son” into the world. And we read in the same place: “The law was our
        pedagogue in Christ. But we are no longer under a pedagogue” (Gal. 4:4;
        3:24-2-5).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        One must also consider this: as the coming of a great king must be
        preceded by a number of envoys to prepare his subjects to receive him
        more reverently, so many things had to precede the coming of God to the
        earth: to prepare men for the reception of the incarnate God. Indeed,
        this did take place when, because of the promises and testimonies that
        had gone before, the minds of men were disposed the more readily to
        believe Him who had had envoys before Him, and the more eagerly to
        receive Him because of the previous promises.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [13] One may also grant that the coming of the incarnate God was
        extremely necessary for human salvation; nevertheless, it was not
        necessary for human salvation that He converse with men even unto the
        end of the world, as the tenth argument was proposing. For this would
        have worked against the reverence which men ought to show to the
        incarnate God, so long as, seeing Him clothed in flesh similar to other
        men, they esteemed Him nothing beyond other men. But He, after the
        wondrous things which He did upon the earth, withdrew His presence from
        men, and they began to revere Him the more. For this reason He did not
        even give His disciples the fullness of the Holy Spirit so long as He
        conversed with them, as though by His absence their souls were more
        prepared for spiritual gifts. Hence, He Himself said to them: “If I go
        not the Paraclete will not come to you; but if I go I will send Him to
        you” (John 16:7)
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [14] It was not right for God to take flesh incapable of suffering and
        death, as the eleventh argument was proposing, but, rather, capable of
        suffering and death. First, indeed, because it was necessary for men to
        know the beneficence of the Incarnation so as to be thereby inflamed in
        the divine love. But to manifest the truth of the Incarnation He had to
        same flesh like that of other men; namely, capable of suffering and
        death. For, if He had taken flesh incapable of suffering and death, it
        would have seemed to men who did not know such flesh that it was a
        phantom and not the reality of flesh. Second, because it was necessary
        that God assume flesh to satisfy for the sin of the human race. It
        happens, of course, that one does satisfy for another (as was shown in
        Book III) in such wise, however, that the penalty for sin due to the
        second, and not due to the first, the first voluntarily assumes. But the
        penalty consequent on the sin of the human race is death and the other
        capacities for suffering of the present life, as was said above. Hence,
        the Apostle says: “By one man sin entered this world and by sin death”
        (Rom. 5:17.). Th6refore, God had to assume without sin flesh capable of
        suffering and death, so that by suffering and dying He would satisfy for
        us and take away sin. And this is what the Apostle says, that “God sent
        His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh” (Rom. 8:3), that is, having
        flesh like that of sinners, namely, capable of suffering and death; and
        the Apostle adds “that of sin He might condemn sin in the flesh,” that
        is, in order that by the penalty which He sustained in the flesh for our
        sin He might take sin away from us.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Third, because by having flesh capable of suffering and death He gave us
        examples of virtue more effectively by overcoming bravely the sufferings
        of the flesh, and making virtuous use of them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Fourth, because we are by this the more strengthened in the hope of
        immortality: that He from a state of flesh capable of suffering and
        death was changed into a state of flesh incapable of suffering and
        death; and this we can hope for ourselves, we who bear a flesh capable
        of suffering and death. But if from the beginning He had assumed flesh
        incapable of suffering and death, no occasion to hope for immortality
        would be given those who experience in themselves mortality and
        corruptibility. This, also, was required by His mission as mediator:
        that, while He had in common with us flesh capable of suffering and
        death,. but in common with God power and glory, He should take away from
        us what He had in common with us—namely, suffering and death—in order to
        lead us to that which was common to Him and to God. For He was the
        mediator for uniting us to God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [15] In like fashion, also, it was not expedient that the incarnate God
        live in this world a life of riches, and one excelling in honors or
        dignities, as the twelfth argument was concluding. First, to be sure,
        because He had come to draw the minds of men, devoted to earthly things,
        away from earthly things and to lift them up to things divine. Hence,
        that His example might lead men to a contempt of riches and the other
        things which the worldly desire, He had to lead a needy and private life
        in this world. Second, because, if He had abounded in wealth and been
        established in some great dignity, what He did divinely would have been
        attributed more to secular power than to the virtue of the divinity.
        Hence, the most efficacious argument for His divinity has been this:
        Without the support of the secular power He has changed the whole world
        for the better.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [16] Accordingly, the solution is open to what was said in the
        thirteenth objection.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [17] It is not, of course, far from true to say that the incarnate Son
        of God bore His death in obedience to a command of His Father, according
        to the Apostle’s teaching (Phil. 2:8). For God’s commandment to men
        deals with the works of virtue; and the more perfectly one carries out
        an act of virtue, the more is he obedient to God. Among the other
        virtues, charity is the outstanding one to which all the other are
        referred. Christ then, when He fulfilled the act of charity most
        perfectly was most obedient to God. For there is no act of charity more
        perfect than the one by which a man bears even death for another; as our
        Lord Himself says: “Greater love than this no man has that a man lay
        down his life for his friends” (John 15:13). Therefore, one finds that
        Christ bearing death for the salvation of men and for the glory of God
        the Father was extremely obedient to God and carried out a perfect act
        of charity. Nor is this repugnant to His divinity, as the fourteenth
        argument ran. For the union in person took place in such wise that what
        was proper to each of the natures remained, namely to the divine and to
        the human, as was explained above. Therefore, even when Christ suffered
        death and other things proper to humanity, the divinity remained
        incapable of suffering, although by the unity of person we say that God
        suffered and died. And somewhat of an instance of this appears in us
        because, although the flesh dies, the soul remains immortal.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [18] This, too, should be understood: Although the will of God is not
        for the death of men, as the fifteenth argument” set down, the will of
        God is for virtue by which a man bears death bravely, and in charity
        exposes himself to the dangers of death. Thus, the will of God was for
        the death of Christ, in that Christ undertook that death in charity and
        bore it bravely.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [19] Hence, clearly, it was neither impiety nor cruelty that God the
        Father willed Christ to die, as the sixteenth argument was concluding,
        for He did not coerce one who was unwilling but was pleased with that
        will in whose charity Christ undertook His death. And God even wrought
        this charity in the soul of Christ.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [20] In the same way, too, there is no awkwardness in saying that Christ
        willed the death on the cross as a demonstration of humility. To be
        sure, the humility does not touch God, as the seventeenth argument was
        proposing. Truly, the virtue of humility consists in this, that one keep
        himself within his own limits; he does not stretch himself to what is
        above him, but he subjects himself to his superior. Hence, clearly, God
        can have no proportionate humility, for He has no superior; He Himself
        exists above all things. But, if a man at times subjects himself in
        humility to an equal or inferior, this is because the one who is his
        equal or inferior simply is held by the man as his superior in a certain
        respect. Therefore, although the virtue of humility was not fitting to
        Christ in His divine nature, it was fitting to Him in His human nature,
        and His humility was Tendered the more praiseworthy by His divinity. For
        the dignity of the person contributes to the praise humility deserves;
        for example, when out of some necessity a great man has to suffer
        something lowly. But there can he no dignity of man so great as this:
        that he be God. Hence, the humility of the God-man was praiseworthy in
        the extreme when He bore those abject things which He was called on to
        suffer for the salvation of men. For men were by reason of pride lovers
        of worldly glory. Therefore, to change the spirits of men over from love
        of worldly glory to love of divine glory He willed to bear death—not
        just any sort of death, but a death abject in the extreme. For there are
        some who, although they do not fear death, abhor an abject death. And
        even to the contempt of such a death did our Lord inspire men by the
        example of His death.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [21] One grants also that men instructed by the divine lessons were able
        to be informed about humility, as the eighteenth argument was proposing.
        For all that, deeds are more provocative of action than words; and deeds
        move the more effectively, the more certain is the opinion of the
        goodness of him who performs such deeds. Hence, although many examples
        of humility of other men are discoverable, it was most expeditious to
        arouse men to humility by the example of the God-man. He clearly could
        not make a mistake, and His humility is the more wondrous as His majesty
        is the more sublime.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [22] This, too, is clear from what has been said: Christ had to suffer
        death not only to give an example of holding death in contempt out of
        love of the truth, but also to wash away the sins of others. This indeed
        took place when He who was without sin willed to suffer the penalty due
        to sin that He might take on Himself the penalty due to others, and make
        satisfaction for others. And although the grace of God suffices by
        itself for the remission of sins, as the nineteenth argument was
        proposing, nonetheless in the remission of sin something is required on
        the part of him whose sin is remitted: namely, that he satisfy the one
        offended. And since other men were unable to do this for themselves,
        Christ did this for all by suffering a voluntary death out of charity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [23] Be it granted, also, that in the punishment of sins he who sinned
        ought to be punished, as the twenties argument was proposing, for all
        that, in the matter of satisfaction one can bear another’s penalty. For,
        when penalty is inflicted for sin, we weigh his iniquity who is
        punished; in satisfaction, however, when to placate the one offended,
        some other voluntarily assumes the penalty, we consider the charity and
        benevolence of him who makes satisfaction, and this most especially
        appears when one assumes the penalty of another. And, there. fore, God
        does receive from one satisfaction for another, as was shown in Book
        III.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [24] But to satisfy for the whole human race (this was shown previously)
        was beyond the power of any mere man; neither was an angel equal to
        this, as the twenty-first argument was proceeding. For, granted an angel
        in some natural properties has a power beyond man, nonetheless in the
        sharing of beatitude (and by the satisfaction man was to be restored to
        this) the angel is man’s equal. And again, there would be no full
        restoration of man’s dignity if man were rendered obnoxious to the angel
        satisfying for man.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [25] One should, of course, know that the death of Christ had its
        satisfying power from His charity in which He bore death voluntarily,
        and not from the iniquity of His killers who sinned in killing Him;
        because sin is not wiped out by sin, as the twenty-second argument
        proposed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [26] And although the death of Christ was satisfactory for sin, it was
        unnecessary for Him to die just as many times as men sinned, as the
        twenty-third argument was concluding. The death of Christ was sufficient
        for the expiation of all sins; and this by reason of the extraordinary
        charity in which He bore death, as well as by reason of the dignity of
        the satisfying person who was God and man. But even in human affairs it
        is clear that by as much as the person is higher, by so much is the
        penalty he bears reckoned for more, whether reckoned by the humility and
        charity of the one suffering or by the fault of the one incurring the
        penalty.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [27] Of course, for the satisfaction of the sin of the entire human race
        the death of Christ was sufficient. For, although He died only in His
        human nature, as the twenty-fourth argument” was proposing, the dignity
        of the person suffering—and this is the Person of the Son of God—renders
        His death precious. For, as was said above,8 just as it is a greater
        crime to commit an injury to a person who stands out more in dignity, so
        it is more virtuous and proceeds from greater charity that the greater
        person submit Himself voluntarily to suffering for others.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [28] But, although Christ has by His death satisfied sufficiently for
        original sin, there is nothing awkward in this: that the penalties
        consequent on original sin still remain in all, even in those who are
        given a share in Christ’s redemption, as the twenty-fifth argument was
        proceeding. For it was both fitting and useful to have the penalty
        remain even when the fault was taken away. First, indeed, to achieve
        conformity of the faithful to Christ as members to the head; hence, just
        as Christ first bore many sufferings, and thus arrived at the glory of
        immortality, it also was becoming to His faithful first to undergo
        sufferings and so to arrive at immortality, bearing in themselves, so to
        say, the marks of the passion of Christ, in order to achieve a likeness
        to His glory. So the Apostle says: “Heirs, indeed of God, and
        joint-heirs with Christ: yet so, if we suffer with Him, that we may be
        also glorified with Him” (Rom. 8:17). Second, because, if men coming to
        Jesus were forthwith to achieve immortality and impassibility, many men
        would approach Christ more for these bodily benefits than for spiritual
        goods. And this is against the intention of Christ who came into the
        world to change men from love of bodily things to love of spiritual
        things. Third, because, if those who come to Christ were forthwith
        rendered incapable of suffering and death, this would somehow compel men
        to accept faith in Christ. And thus the merit of faith would be
        diminished.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [29] Granted, of course, that Christ has sufficiently satisfied for the
        sins of the human race by His death, as the twenty-sixth argument
        proposed, every single one, for all that, must seek the remedies of his
        own salvation. For the death of Christ is, so to say, a kind of
        universal cause of salvation, as the sin of the first man was a kind of
        universal cause of damnation. But a universal cause must be applied
        specially to each one, that he may receive the effect of the universal
        cause. The effect then, of the sin of the first parent comes to each one
        in the origin of the flesh, but the effect of the death of Christ comes
        to each one in a spiritual regeneration in which the man is somehow
        conjoined with Christ arid incorporated into Him. And for this reason
        each must seek to be regenerated through Christ, and must himself
        undertake to do those things in which,the power of Christ’s death
        operates.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [30] From this it is clear that the flow of salvation from Christ to men
        is not through a natural propagation, but through the zeal of good will
        in which a man cleaves to Christ. Hence, that which each accomplishes by
        Christ is a personal good. Wherefore, it is not passed on to
        descendants, as is the sin of the first parent, which is produced with
        the propagation of the nature. Accordingly, although the parents are
        cleansed of original sin by Christ, there is nothing awkward about the
        birth of their children in original sin, requiring the sacraments of
        salvation, as the twenty-seventh argument was concluding.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [31] Thus, then, from what has been set down it is to some extent clear
        that what the Catholic faith preaches about the Incarnation contains
        nothing impossible and nothing inharmonious.

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Since, however (as has already been said), the death of Christ is,
        so to say, the universal cause of human salvation, and since a universal
        cause must he applied singly to each of its effects, it was necessary to
        show men some remedies through which the benefit of Christ’s death could
        somehow be conjoined to them. It is of this sort, of course, that the
        sacraments of the Church are said to be.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Now, remedies of this kind had to be handed on with some visible
        signs.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] First, indeed, because just as He does for all other things, so also
        for man, God provides according to his condition. Now, man’s condition
        is such that he is brought to grasp the spiritual and intelligible
        naturally through the senses. Therefore, spiritual remedies had to be
        given to men under sensible signs.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Second, because instruments must be proportioned to their first
        cause. But the first and universal cause of human salvation is the
        incarnate Word, as is clear from the foregoing. Therefore, harmoniously
        the remedies by which the power of the universal cause reaches men had a
        likeness to that cause-, that is, the divine power operates in them
        under visible signs.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Third, because man fell into sin by clinging unduly to visible
        things. Therefore, that one might not believe visible things evil of
        their nature, and that for this reason those clinging to them had
        sinned, it was fitting that through the visible things themselves the
        remedies of salvation be applied to men. Consequently, it would appear
        that visible things are good of their nature—as created by God—but they
        become damaging to men so far as one clings to them in a disordered way,
        and saving so far as one uses them in an ordered way.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Thus, of course, one excludes the error of certain heretics who want
        every visible thing of this kind removed from the sacraments of the
        Church. Nor need one marvel at this, for the very same men maintain that
        whatever is visible is evil in its nature, and is produced by an evil
        author. And this we rejected in Book II.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Nor is it unsuitable that by things visible and bodily a spiritual
        salvation is served. For visible things of this kind are the
        instruments, so to say, of a God who was made flesh and suffered. Now,
        an instrument does not operate by the power of its nature, but by the
        power of its principal agent who puts it into operation. Thus, also,
        then, do visible things of this kind work out a spiritual salvation-not
        by a property of their own nature, but by Christ’s institution, and from
        the latter they receive their instrumental power.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Next, this must be considered. Since the sacraments of this visible
        kind got their efficacy from the passion of Christ and in some way
        represent it, they must be such as to be in harmony with the salvation
        wrought by Christ. Now, this salvation was promised, indeed, before
        Christ’s Incarnation and death but not displayed, it was the incarnate
        and suffering Word who brought about this kind of salvation. Therefore,
        the sacraments which preceded Christ’s Incarnation had to be such as
        signified and somehow promised salvation. But the sacraments which
        follow the suffering of Christ ought to be such as deliver this
        salvation to men, not merely such as point to it by signs.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Of course, in this way one avoids the opinion of the Jews, who
        believe that the sacraments of the Law must be observed forever
        precisely because they were established by God, since God has no regrets
        and is not changed. But without change or regret one who disposes things
        may dispose things differently in harmony with a difference of times;
        thus, the father of a family gives one set of orders to a small child
        and another to one already grown. Thus, God also harmoniously gave one
        set of sacraments and commandments before the Incarnation to point to
        the future, and another set after the Incarnation to deliver things
        present and bring to mind things past.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] But more unreasonable still is the error of the Nazarenes and the
        Ebionites, who used to say that the sacraments of the Law should be
        observed simultaneously with those of the Gospel. An error of this kind
        involves a sort of contrariety. For, while they observe the evangelical
        sacraments, they are professing that the Incarnation and the other
        mysteries of Christ have already been perfected; but, when they also
        observe the sacraments of the Law, they are professing that those
        mysteries are in the future.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] However, since the spiritual remedies of salvation (as was said)
        have been given to men under sensible signs, it was suitable also to
        distinguish the remedies provided for the spiritual life after the
        likeness of bodily life.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Now, in bodily life we find a twofold order: for some propagate and
        order the bodily life in others; and some are propagated and ordered in
        the bodily life.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Now, in a bodily and natural life three things are necessary of
        themselves, and a fourth incidentally. For first, by generation or birth
        a thing must receive life; second, by growth it must arrive at its due
        size and strength; third, both for the preservation of life acquired by
        generation and for growth nourishment is necessary. And these are of
        themselves necessities for natural life, because without these bodily
        life cannot be perfected; wherefore, one assigns to the vegetative soul
        which is the principle of life the three natural powers: that of
        generation, that of growth, and that of nourishment. But, since there
        can be an impediment to natural life from which the living thing grows
        weak, a fourth thing is incidentally necessary; this is the healing of
        the sick living thing.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Thus, then, in the spiritual life, also, the first thing is
        spiritual generation: by baptism; the second is spiritual growth leading
        to perfect strength: by the sacrament of confirmation; the third is
        spiritual nourishment: by the sacrament of the Eucharist. A fourth
        remains, which is the spiritual healing; it takes place either in the
        soul alone through the sacrament of penance; or from the soul flows to
        the body when this is timely, through extreme unction. These, therefore,
        bear on those who are propagated and preserved in the spiritual life.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Now, those who propagate an! order in the bodily life are marked by
        two things: namely, natural origin, and t is refers to parents; and the
        political regime by which the peaceful life of man is conserved, and
        this refers to kings and princes.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] It is, then, also like this in the spiritual life. For some
        propagate and conserve the spiritual life in a spiritual ministry duly,
        and this belongs to the sacrament of orders; and some belong to the
        bodily and spiritual life simultaneously, which takes place in the
        sacrament of matrimony where a man and woman come together to beget
        offspring and to rear them in divine worship.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">ON BAPTISM</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] In this way, then, one can discern in the individual sacraments the
        proper effect of each one and the becoming matter. Now, first: Regarding
        the spiritual generation which takes place in baptism, one must consider
        that the generation of a living thing is a kind of change from
        non-living to life. But man in his origin was deprived of spiritual life
        by original sin, as was shown above; and still every single sin whatever
        which is added draws him away from life. Baptism, therefore, which is
        spiritual generation, had to have the power to take away both original
        sin and all the actual, committed sins.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Now, because the sensible sign of a sacrament must be harmonious
        with the representation of its spiritual effect, and since washing away
        filth in bodily things is done more easily and more commonly by water,
        baptism is, therefore, suitably conferred in water made holy by the Word
        of God.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] And since the generation of one is the corruption of another, and
        since what is generated loses both its previous form and the properties
        consequent on that form; necessarily through baptism, which is a
        spiritual generation, not only are sins taken away—these are contrary to
        a spiritual life—but also every guilt of sins. For this reason, too,
        baptism not only washes away the fault, but also absolves from all
        guilt. Hence, no satisfaction for their sins is enjoined on the
        baptized.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Again, when by generation a thing acquires a form, it acquires at
        the same time the operation consequent on the form and the place in
        harmony with it. For fire, as soon as generated, tends upward as to its
        proper place. Accordingly, since baptism is a spiritual generation, the
        baptized are forthwith suited for spiritual actions-the reception of the
        other sacraments, for example, and other things of the sort—and
        forthwith there is due to them the place harmonious to the spiritual
        life, which is eternal beatitude. Hence, we say that “Baptism opens the
        gate of heaven.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] One should also consider that one thing has but one generation.
        Hence, since baptism is a spiritual generation, a man is to be baptized
        once only.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Clearly, also, the infection which entered the world through Adam
        makes a man guilty but once. Hence, baptism, which is chiefly ordered
        against this infection, should not be repeated. There is also this
        common consideration: that, as long as a thing is once consecrated, it
        must not be consecrated again, so long as it endures, lest the
        consecration appear inefficacious. And so, since baptism is a kind of
        consecration of the one baptized, baptism must not be repeated. This
        excludes the error of the Donatists or Rebaptizers.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] The perfection of spiritual strength consists properly in a man’s
        daring to confess the faith of Christ in the presence of anyone at all,
        and in a man’s being not withdrawn therefrom either by confusion or by
        terror, for strength drives out inordinate terror. Therefore, the
        sacrament by which spiritual strength is conferred on the one born again
        makes him in some sense a front-line fighter for the faith of Christ.
        And because fighters under a prince carry his insignia, they who receive
        the sacrament of confirmation are signed with the sign of Christ; this
        is the sign of the cross by which He fought and conquered. This sign
        they receive on the forehead as a sign that without a blush they
        publicly confess the faith of Christ.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] This signing takes place with a mixture of oil and balm which is
        called chrism, and not without reason. For by the oil one designates the
        power of the Holy Spirit, from whom Christ, too, is called “anointed”
        (Ps. 44:8; Luke 4:18); and consequently from Christ they are called
        “Christians” (Acts 9:26), so to say, as fighting under Him. And by the
        balm, through its fragrance, good repute is indicated. For the public
        confession of faith in Christ this good repute must be had by those who
        dwell among men of this world, brought forth, so to say, from the hidden
        recesses of the Church onto the field of battle.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Suitably, too, this sacrament is conferred only by bishops, who are
        in some sense the leaders of the Christian army. For even in secular
        military forces it is the prerogative of the army leader to select some
        men to be enrolled; so, also, those who receive this sacrament seem to
        be enrolled somehow in the spiritual military forces. Hence, also, a
        hand is laid upon them to designate the derivation of manliness from
        Christ.

        [1] Now, bodily life needs material nourishment, not only for increase
        in quantity, but to maintain the nature of the body as well, lest it be
        dissolved by continuous resolutions and lose its power; in the same way
        it was necessary to have spiritual nourishment for the spiritual life
        that the reborn may both be conserved in virtues and grow in them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Spiritual effects were fittingly given under the likeness of things
        visible (as was said); therefore, spiritual nourishment of this kind is
        given to us under the appearances, of the things which men rather
        commonly use for bodily nourishment. Bread and wine are of this sort.
        Accordingly, this sacrament is given under the appearances of bread and
        wine.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] But consider this: He who begets is joined to the begotten in one
        way, and nourishment is joined to the nourished in another way in bodily
        things. For the one who begets need not be conjoined to the begotten in
        substance, but in likeness and in power only. But nutriment must be
        conjoined to the one nourished in substance. Wherefore, that the
        spiritual effects may answer the bodily signs, the mystery of the
        incarnate Word is joined to us in one way in baptism which is a
        spiritual rebirth, and in another way in this sacrament of the Eucharist
        which is a spiritual nourishment. In baptism the Word incarnate is
        contained in His power only, but we hold that in the sacrament of the
        Eucharist He is contained in His substance.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] And since the fulfillment of our salvation took place through the
        passion and death of Christ, in which His blood was separated from His
        flesh, we are given the sacrament of His body separately under the
        appearance of bread, and of His blood under the appearance of wine-, and
        so we have in this sacrament both memory and the representation of our
        Lord’s passion. And in this our Lord’s words are fulfilled: “My flesh is
        meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed” (John 6:56).

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Of course, just as when Christ spoke these words, some of the
        disciples were troubled and said: “This saying is hard, and who can bear
        it?” (John 6:61), so, also, against the teaching of the Church some
        heretics have arisen to deny this truth. They say that the body and
        blood of Christ are not really present in this sacrament, but by way of
        sign only; thus, one understands Christ’s saying when He indicated the
        bread: “This is My body” (Mat. 26:26) as though He were saying: “This is
        a sign or figure of My body.” And in this way the Apostle spoke: “And
        the rock was Christ” (1 Cor. 10:4), that is, “a figure of Christ”; and
        to such an understanding they refer whatever is said in the Scriptures
        in a similar way.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Of course, the occasion of this opinion is taken from our Lord’s
        words. Speaking of eating His flesh and drinking His blood, to quiet the
        scandal which had arisen among the disciples He, said-as, though
        explaining Himself: “The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and
        life” (John 6:64); as though His words were to be understood not
        literally, but in a spiritual sense.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] They are also induced to their dissent by the many difficulties
        which seem to follow this teaching of the Church; by reason of these
        “this saying” of Christ and the Church appears hard to them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] In the first place, there seems to be a difficulty in the way in
        which the true body of Christ begins to be on the altar. For a thing
        begins to be where it was not before in two ways: either by local
        motion, or by the conversion of another into itself. This is clear in
        the case of fire, which begins to be in some place either because it is
        newly lighted there or because it is newly carried there. Manifestly, of
        course, the true body of Christ was not always on the altar; for the
        Church confesses that Christ in His body ascended into heaven.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] But it seems impossible to say that here something is newly
        converted into the body of Christ. For nothing seems converted into the
        pre-existent, since what is converted into something begins to be by
        this sort of conversion. But, manifestly, the body of Christ
        pre-existed, let us say, as conceived in the virginal womb. Therefore,
        it does not seem possible that on the altar it begins to be anew by the
        conversion of another into itself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] In a similar fashion, it cannot be there by a change of place, since
        whatever is moved locally begins to be in one place in such wise that it
        ceases to be in another in which it was before. Therefore, one will have
        to say that when Christ begins to be on this altar whereon the sacrament
        is enacted He ceases to be in heaven where He arrived after His
        ascension. Furthermore, no local motion has two places simultaneously as
        its term. But, clearly, this sacrament is celebrated simultaneously on
        different altars. Therefore, it is not possible that the body of Christ
        begins to be thereon by local motion.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] The second difficulty comes from the place. For parts are not
        contained in separated places if a thing remains a whole. But,
        manifestly, in this sacrament the bread and wine, are apart from one
        another in separate places. Therefore, if the flesh of Christ is under
        the appearance of bread and the blood under the appearance of wine, it
        seems to follow that Christ does not remain whole; but whenever this
        sacrament is performed His blood is separated from His body.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] Furthermore, it seems impossible that a larger body be inclosed in
        the place of a smaller one. Clearly, of course, the true body of Christ
        is greater in quantity than the bread which is offered on the altar. It
        seems, then, impossible that the true body of Christ be whole and entire
        there where the bread is seen. Of course, if it is not the whole there,
        but one of its parts, then the first awkwardness recurs: Whenever this
        sacrament is performed the body of Christ is scattered into parts.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] It is further impossible that one body should exist in many places.
        But, manifestly, this sacrament is celebrated in many places. Therefore,
        it seems impossible that the body of Christ is truthfully contained in
        this sacrament—unless one says, perhaps, that the body is contained in
        one of its particles here, and in another there. And on this it follows,
        once again, that by the celebration of this sacrament the body of Christ
        is divided into parts; for all that, at the same time, the quantity of
        the body of Christ does not seem to suffice for the division of as many
        particles from the body as there are places where this sacrament is
        performed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] The third difficulty lies in the things which we perceive by our
        senses in this sacrament. For, clearly, in this sacrament we sense, even
        after the consecration, all the accidents of bread and wine: color,
        taste, odor, figure, quantity, and weight; and concerning these we
        cannot be deceived, for “the sense is never deceived about the proper
        sensibles.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] But accidents of this kind cannot be in the body of Christ as in a
        subject; in like fashion, neither can they be in the surrounding air;
        for, since many of them are natural accidents, they call for a subject
        of a determined nature, which is not like the nature of the human body
        or of the air.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [12] Nor can they subsist in themselves, since “the being of an accident
        is by inherence.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [13] Also, since accidents are forms, they cannot he individuated except
        through a subject. Wherefore, with the subject removed they would be
        universal forms. Therefore, this remains: Accidents of this kind are in
        their determined subjects; namely, in the substance of bread and wine.
        Therefore, the substance of bread and wine is there, and the substance
        of the body of Christ is not, since it seems impossible that the two
        bodies be there simultaneously.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [14] The fourth difficulty arises from the actions and passions which
        appear in the bread and wine after the consecration just as they did
        before it. For the wine, if taken in large quantity, would make one warm
        and would make one drunk; the bread, of course, would strengthen and
        would nourish. They seem, also, if kept long and carelessly, to rat or
        to be eaten by mice, they can even be burned, and reduced to ashes and
        smoke. But none of this agrees with the body of Christ, since the faith
        preaches that it is incapable of suffering. Therefore, it seems
        impossible that the body of Christ be contained substantially in this
        sacrament.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [15] A fifth difficulty seems to arise especially from the breaking of
        the bread; indeed, this breaking appears sensibly and cannot be without
        a subject. It even seems absurd to say that the subject of that breaking
        is the body of Christ. Therefore, the body of Christ seems not to be
        there, but only the substance of the bread and wine.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [16] These, then, and points of this kind are the reason why the
        teaching of Christ and the Church concerning this sacrament appears
        hard.

        [1] Although, of course, the divine power operates with a greater
        sublimity and secrecy in this sacrament than a man’s inquiry can search
        out, nonetheless, lest the teaching of the Church regarding this
        sacrament appear impossible to unbelievers, one must make the endeavor
        to exclude every impossibility.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] The first consideration we meet, then, is that of the way in which
        the true body of Christ begins to be under this sacrament.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] It is impossible, of course, that this take place by a local motion
        of the body of Christ. One reason is that it would follow that He ceases
        to be in heaven whenever this sacrament is performed. Another reason is
        that this sacrament could not be performed at the same time except in
        one place, since a local motion is not ended except at one term. Another
        reason, also, is that local motion cannot be instantaneous, but requires
        time. Consecration, however, is perfected in the ultimate instant of the
        pronouncement of the words.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Therefore, one concludes by saying that the true body of Christ
        begins to be in this sacrament by the fact that the substance of the
        bread is converted into the substance of the body of Christ, and the
        substance of the wine into the substance of His blood.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] But thus appears the falsity of the opinion: not only of those who
        say that the substance of the bread exists simultaneously with the
        substance of Christ in this sacrament, but also of those who hold that
        the substance of the bread is reduced to nothing or is resolved into
        prime matter. For on each of these positions it follows that the body of
        Christ does not begin to be in this sacrament except by local motion.
        And this is impossible, as we have shown.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Furthermore, if the substance of the bread is simultaneous in this
        sacrament with the true body of Christ, Christ should rather have said:
        “My body is here” than: “This is My body.” For by “here” one points to
        the substance which is seen, and this is indeed the substance of the
        bread, if it remains in the sacrament with the body of Christ.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        Similarly, also, it seems impossible that the substance of the bread
        returns to nothingness. For much of the bodily nature first created
        would have already returned into nothingness from the repetition of this
        mystery. Neither is it becoming that in a sacrament of salvation
        something be reduced to nothing by the divine power. Nor is it even
        possible that the substance of the bread is resolved into prime matter,
        since prime matter cannot be without form—except, perhaps, that one is
        to understand by “prime matter” the primary bodily elements. To be sure,
        if the substance of the bread were resolved into these, this very thing
        would necessarily be perceived by the senses, since the bodily elements
        are sensible. There would also be local transmutation in the place and
        bodily alteration of contraries. And these cannot be instantaneous.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Nonetheless, it must be recognized that the aforesaid conversion of
        the bread into the body of Christ is of another mode than any natural
        conversion whatever. For in any natural conversion a subject persists in
        which different forms succeed themselves: these are accidental—white,
        for example, is converted into black, or they are substantial—air, for
        example, is converted into fire; wherefore these are named formal
        conversions. But in the conversion under discussion a subject passes
        over into a subject, and the accidents persist; hence, this conversion
        is named substantial. Indeed, how these accidents persist, and why, must
        be closely examined later.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] But now we must consider how a subject is converted into a subject.
        And this, to be sure, nature cannot do. For every operation of nature
        presupposes matter which individuates the substance; wherefore, nature
        cannot bring it about that this substance ‘become that substance, that
        this finger, for example, become that finger. But matter is subject to
        the divine power, since the latter brings it into being. Hence, by
        divine power it can come about that this individual substance be
        converted into that pre-existing substance. Now, just as the power of a
        natural agent whose operation extends to the change of a form only—and
        the existence of the subject is supposed—changes this whole into that
        whole in a variation of the species and the form—this air, let us say,
        into that generated fire—so the divine power, which does not presuppose
        matter, but produces matter, converts this matter into that matter, and,
        in consequence, this individual into that individual; for the principle
        of individuation is matter, just as form is the principle of species.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] In this way, of course, it is clear that in the aforesaid conversion
        of bread into the body of Christ there is not a common subject
        persisting after the conversion, since a transmutation takes place in
        the first subject, and this is the principle of the individuation. It is
        necessary, for all that, that something persist to make true the words:
        “This is My body”; the very words, in fact, which are significative and
        effective of this conversion. And the substance of the bread does not
        persist; neither does any prior matter (as was shown). Therefore, one
        necessarily says that what persists is other than the substance of the
        bread. Of this sort, of course, is the accident of the bread. Therefore,
        the accidents of the bread do persist even after the conversion
        mentioned.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] Among accidents, however, there is a certain order to be considered.
        For, among all the accidents, that inhering more closely to the
        substance is the quantity which tends to measure. Then the qualities are
        received in the substance with the quantity as medium—color, for
        example, with the surface as medium; hence, even by the division of the
        quantity they are incidentally divided. But, in addition, the qualities
        are the principles of actions and passions, as well as of certain
        relations-father and son, let us say, or master and servant, and others
        of this kind. Of course, some relations follow immediately on the
        quantities—greater and less, for instance, or doubled and halved, and
        similar relations. Therefore, one ought to hold that the accidents of
        the bread persist after the conversion mentioned in such wise that only
        the quantity which tends to measure subsists without a subject, and on
        it the qualities are based as on a subject, and so in consequence are
        the accidents, passions, and relations. Therefore, in this conversion
        what takes place is the contrary of what usually takes place in natural
        mutations, for in these the substance persists as the subject of the
        mutation, whereas the accidents are varied; but here, conversely, the
        accident persists, the substance passes.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] Of course, a conversion of this kind cannot properly be called
        motion as that is considered by the natural philosopher, since that
        requires a subject, but it is a kind of substantial succession; so there
        is in creation a succession of being and non-being, as was said in Book
        II.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] This, then, is one reason why the accident of the bread must
        remain: that something be discoverable which persists in the conversion
        under discussion.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [12] But it is necessary for another reason. For, if the substance of
        the bread were converted into the body of Christ and the accidents were
        to pass on, it would not follow from such a conversion that the body of
        Christ in His substance would be where first there was bread, for no
        relationship between the body of Christ and the aforesaid place would be
        left. But since, after the conversion, the quantity of the bread which
        tends to measure does remain, and through this the bread acquired this
        place, the substance of the bread changed into the body of Christ
        becomes the body of Christ under the bread’s quantity tending to
        measure; in consequence, the body of Christ in some way acquires the
        place of the bread, with the measurements of the bread, nonetheless,
        mediating.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [13] Other reasons can also be given: respecting the essentials of
        faith, which deals with the invisible; respecting also its merit, which
        is so much the greater in connection with this sacrament, since it deals
        with the more invisible, for the body of Christ is hidden under the
        accidents of the bread; respecting, also, the more appropriate and
        worthy use of this sacrament, for it would be horrible for the
        receivers, and an abomination to those looking on, if the body of Christ
        were received by the faithful in its own appearance. Hence, it is under
        the appearance of bread and wine, which men use rather commonly for meat
        and drink, that the body of Christ is set forth to be eaten and His
        blood to be drunk.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Now, after we have considered these points about the mode of
        conversion, the way to solve the other arguments is opened up to us
        somewhat. For it has now been said that the place in which the sacrament
        is is ascribed to the body of Christ by reason of the measurements of
        the bread remaining after the conversion of the substance of the bread
        into the body of Christ. And in accord with this, that which is of
        Christ must be in the place mentioned so far as the essentials of the
        conversion mentioned require it.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Consideration, then, must be given this: There is something in this
        sacrament by force of the conversion and something by natural
        accompaniment. Now, by force of the conversion there is in the sacrament
        that in which the conversion is directly terminated: so, under the
        appearances of bread there is the body of Christ into which the
        substance of the bread is converted, as is clear from the words of the
        consecration when one says: “This is My body”; in like manner under the
        appearance of wine there is the blood of Christ when one says: “This is
        the chalice of My blood,” and so forth. But by natural accompaniment all
        the other things are there in which the conversion is not terminated,
        but which are, nonetheless, really conjoined to that in which the
        conversion is terminated. For it is clear that the conversion of the
        bread is not terminated in the divinity of Christ, nor in His soul;
        nonetheless, under the appearance of bread the soul of Christ is there,
        and His divinity by reason of the union of each of these to the body of
        Christ.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] However, if in the three-day period of the death of Christ this
        sacrament had been celebrated, the soul of Christ would not have been
        under the appearance of bread, because it was not really united to His
        body; in the same way, there would not have been blood under the
        appearance of bread, nor body under the appearance of wine, by reason of
        the separation of each of these in death. But now, since the body of
        Christ in His nature is not without blood, His body and blood are
        contained under each appearance: under the appearance of bread the body
        is contained by force of conversion, the blood by natural accompaniment;
        under the appearance of wine the converse is true.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] The same points give a solution to the objection about the
        inequality of the body of Christ to the place of the bread. For the
        substance of the bread is directly converted into the substance of the
        body of Christ, but the dimensions of the body of Christ are in the
        sacrament by natural accompaniment, and not from force of conversion,
        since the dimensions of the bread remain. In this way, then, the body of
        Christ is not related to this place with its own dimensions as medium,
        so that the place need be equated to those dimensions, but His body is
        here with the persisting dimensions of the bread as medium, and to these
        the place is equated.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Therein, also, the solution is open to what was objected to about
        the plurality of places. For the body of Christ in His own dimensions
        exists in one place only, but through the mediation of the dimensions of
        the bread passing into it its places are as many as there are places in
        which this sort of conversion is celebrated. For it is not divided into
        parts, but is entire in every single one; every consecrated bread is
        converted into the entire body of Christ.

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Thus, then, with the difficulty solved arising from place, one ought
        to look into the one which seems to arise from the accidents which
        remain. For it cannot be denied that the accidents of bread and wine
        remain, since the senses infallibly point this out.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Neither the body of Christ nor His blood is: affected by these
        accidents, because without changing Him this could not be; nor has He
        the capacity for such accidents. Much the same can he said of the
        substance of the air. Hence, one concludes that they are without a
        subject. Nevertheless, they are without a subject in the manner
        mentioned: namely, that only the quantity tending to measure subsists
        without a subject,.and this supplies a subject to the other accidents.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Neither is it impossible that by the divine power an accident can
        subsist without a subject. For one ought to make the same judgment about
        the creation of things and about their conservation in being. The divine
        power, of course, can produce the effects of any second causes whatever
        without the second causes themselves; so it was able to form a man
        without seed, and to cure a fever without the operation of nature. And
        this happens by reason of the infinity of His power, and be, cause He
        grants to all second causes their power to act. Wherefore, also, He can
        conserve the effects of second causes in being without the second
        causes. And in this way in this sacrament He conserves an accident in
        being, even after the removal of the substance which was conserving it.
        And this, indeed, can especially be said of the quantities tending to
        measure; these even the Platonists held to subsist of themselves, for
        this reason: They are separated in the understanding. But it is clear
        that God can do more in operation than the intellect can in
        apprehension.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Of course, the quantity tending to measure has among the remaining
        accidents this property: that it is in itself individuated. And the
        reason is this: Position, which is “the order of parts in the whole,” is
        essentially included in this quantity, for quantity is “that which has
        position.” But wherever a diversity of parts of the same species is
        understood, individuation is necessarily understood, for things which
        are of the same species are not multiplied except in the individual;
        accordingly many whitenesses cannot be apprehended except as they are in
        different subjects, but many lines can be apprehended, even if they are
        considered in themselves. For diversity of site which is in the line of
        itself is sufficient for the plurality of lines. And because only the
        quantity tending to measure has in its essentials a possible source of
        the multiplication of individuals in the same species, the first root of
        this kind of multiplication seems to be from measurement, because even
        in the genus of substance the multiplication is made according to the
        division of matter. And this could not even be understood save by the
        consideration of matter under measurements, for with the quantity gone
        all substance is indivisible, as is clear from the Philosopher in
        <i>Physics</i> I [2].
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] It is, of course, manifest that in the other genera of accidents,
        individuals are multiplied in the same species on the part of the
        subject. And thus one is left to conclude: Since we hold that in this
        sacrament the measurements subsist of themselves and that the other
        accidents are founded on these as on a subject, we need not say that
        accidents of this kind are not individuated; for there persists in the
        measurements themselves the root of individuation.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] After the consideration of these points, one should consider those
        belonging to the fourth difficulty. And concerning these there is,
        indeed, something which can be dealt with easily; something else,
        however, offers a greater difficulty.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] The fact that in this sacrament the same actions appear which
        previously appeared in the substance of the bread and wine (they change
        the senses in the same way, let us say; they even in the same way alter
        the surrounding air, or anything else, by odor or color) now seems
        fitting enough from what has been set down. For we said that in this
        sacrament the accidents of the bread and wine persist. And among these
        are the sensible qualities which are the principles of actions of this
        sort.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Again, concerning some passions (those, for instance, which take
        place in alterations of accidents of this kind), the difficulty which
        occurs is not so great, if the premises be granted. For, since it was
        premised that the other accidents are based on the measurements as on a
        subject, the alteration of the other accidents can be considered in the
        same way with respect to this subject as they would be if the substance
        were there; for example, if the wine had been warmed and became cold, or
        if it should change its flavor, or something of this kind.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] But a very great difficulty appears regarding the generation and
        corruption which seems to take place in this sacrament. For if one were
        to use this sacramental food in large quantity he could be sustained,
        and by the wine even made drunk, as the Apostle has it: "One indeed is
        hungry and another is drunk" (1 Cor. 11:21). And these things could not
        take place unless, from this sacrament, flesh and blood were generated,
        for nourishment is converted into the substance of the one nourished.
        Some may, of course, say that a man is not nourished by this sacramental
        food, but only invigorated and refreshed, as when one is invigorated by
        the fragrance of wine. But this invigoration can happen for an hour; it
        does not, of course, suffice to sustain a man if he remains long without
        food. But a trial would readily show that a man can be sustained for a
        long time by the sacramental food.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] It also seems a wonder why they should deny that a man can be
        nourished by this sacramental food, refusing to this sacrament the
        possible conversion into flesh and blood, when it appears to the senses
        that by putrefaction or combustion it is turned into another substance;
        namely, dust and ashes.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] And this, indeed, seems nonetheless difficult, since it does not
        seem possible to make a substance out of accidents; nor is it right to
        believe that the substance of Christ's body—which is not capable of
        suffering—be converted into another substance.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] However, if one wishes to say that as the bread is miraculously
        converted into the body of Christ, so the accidents are converted
        miraculously into substance: first, indeed, this does not seem suitable
        for a miracle, the putrefaction of this sacrament, or its dissolution by
        combustion; and then that putrefaction and combustion are found taking
        place in this sacrament in the usual order of nature, which is not
        usually the case in things done miraculously.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] To remove this hesitation a certain famous position was invented,
        which is held by many. They hold thus: When this sacrament happens to be
        converted into flesh or blood by nutrition, or into ashes by combustion
        or putrefaction, the accidents are not converted into substance; nor is
        the substance of the body of Christ converted; but by a divine miracle
        the substance of the bread which was there previously returns, and from
        it are generated the things into which we find the sacrament converted.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] But this, to be sure, simply cannot stand. For we have shown above
        that the substance of the bread is converted into the substance of the
        body of Christ. But that which is converted into another cannot return
        unless, conversely, that other be reconverted into it. If, therefore,
        the substance of the bread returns, it follows that the substance of the
        body of Christ is reconverted into bread. And this is absurd. What is
        more, if the substance of the bread returns, it must return either while
        the appearances of bread persist or when the appearances of bread are
        already destroyed. In fact, while the appearances of bread persist, the
        substance of the bread cannot return, because, as long as the
        appearances remain, thereunder remains the substance of the body of
        Christ; it would follow, therefore, that simultaneously present there
        would be both the substance of the bread and the substance of the body
        of Christ. In like manner, also, if the appearances of the bread are
        corrupted, the substance of the bread cannot return-for this reason: The
        substance of the bread is not without its own appearances; and for this
        reason, as well: When the appearances of the bread are destroyed,
        another substance has already been generated, and it was for the
        generation of this second substance that (so they were holding) the
        substance of the bread should return.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] Therefore, it seems better to say that in the consecration itself,
        just as the substance of the bread is miraculously converted into the
        body of Christ so this is miraculously conferred on the accidents: that
        they subsist which is proper to substance, and, as a consequence, are
        able to do and to suffer the things which the substance could do and
        suffer if the substance were present. And so, without a new miracle,
        they are able to inebriate and to nourish, to be burned and to rot, in
        the same way and order they would if the substance of the bread and wine
        were present.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] It remains to speculate on the points which belong to the fifth
        difficulty. It is manifest, of course, from the aforesaid that we can
        set down as subject of the breaking the dimensions subsisting of
        themselves. For all that, when dimensions of this kind are broken, the
        substance of the body of Christ is not broken, because the whole body of
        Christ remains under every portion.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Now, to be sure, although this appears difficult, it has an
        explanation in accord with the things premised. For we said above that
        the body of Christ is in this sacrament in His substance by force of the
        sacrament, but the dimensions of the body of Christ are there by their
        natural accompaniment to the substance; the situation here is contrary
        to the one in which a body is naturally in a place, for the natural body
        is in place with those dimensions mediating by which it is measured in
        the place.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] But something substantial is related to that in which it is in one
        way, and something quantified is related in another way. For the
        quantified whole is in some whole so that the whole is not in the part,
        but the part is in the part as the whole is in the whole. Hence, too, a
        natural body is thus in the whole place a whole which is not whole in
        every part of the place, but the parts of the body are fitted to the
        parts of the place. This is because it is in the place by -the mediating
        dimensions. Of course, if a substantial thing is whole in some whole, it
        is also whole in every part thereof. So, the whole nature and species of
        water is in every part of water, and the whole soul is in every part of
        the body.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Since, then, the body of Christ is in the sacrament by reason of His
        substance into which the substance of the bread—the dimensions thereof
        remaining—has been converted, as the whole species of bread was in every
        part of its dimensions, so the entire body of Christ is in every part of
        the same dimensions. Therefore, that breaking or division does not touch
        on the body of Christ so as to be in it as in a subject, but the subject
        thereof is the persisting dimensions of the bread or wine; so also we
        called those dimensions the subject of the other accidents therein
        persisting.

        [1] With these difficulties removed, then, it is clear that what
        ecclesiastical tradition holds about the sacrament of the altar contains
        nothing impossible for God, who can do all things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Neither is there anything contrary to the teaching of the Church in
        the word which our Lord spoke to His disciples, who seemed scandalized
        by His teaching: “The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and
        life” (John 6:64). For by these words He did not give them to understand
        this: in this sacrament His true flesh was not being given to the
        faithful to eat, but that it is not given to be eaten in an ordinary
        manner, with the result that, like earthly foods it might be received as
        macerated in its own appearances. He gave them to understand that it is
        received in a certain spiritual fashion, apart from the manner of
        earthly carnal foods.

          >ON THE KIND OF BREAD AND WINE THAT ARE TO BE USED IN THIS
          SACRAMENT</span
        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Now, because, as was said above, this sacrament is accomplished with
        bread and wine, those conditions necessarily must be observed to,
        accomplish this sacrament therefrom which belong to the essentials of
        bread and wine. But one calls wine only that liquid which is pressed
        from grapes, and one calls bread, properly speaking, only that which is
        made from grain wheat. But other so-called breads, for lack of wheat
        bread and to supplement it, have come into use; in a like way, other
        liquids have come into use with wine. Hence, neither from some other
        bread nor from some other wine could this sacrament be accomplished,
        especially not if the mixture of foreign matter with bread or wine be so
        considerable that the species is lost.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] However, if things happen to this sort of bread and wine which do
        not touch the essentials of bread and wine, manifestly one may pass
        these things over, and truly accomplish the sacrament. Wherefore, since
        to be leavened or unleavened is not essential to bread-rather, whichever
        of the two is the case, the species of bread is preserved-the sacrament
        can be accomplished from either of the two breads. This is the reason
        why different churches have different customs in this matter, but each
        of the two can be in harmony with the significance of the sacrament.
        For, as Gregory puts it in his Register: “The Roman Church offers
        unleavened bread because our Lord took on flesh without any mixture. But
        the rest of the Churches offer leavened bread, since the Word of God was
        clothed with flesh, and is true God and true man, just as the leaven is
        mixed with the paste.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Nonetheless, there is greater harmony with the purity of the
        mystical body, that is, the Church, of which there is also a figure in
        this sacrament, in the use of unleavened bread; as the Apostle has it:
        “Christ our pasch is sacrificed. Therefore let us feast... with the
        unleavened bread of sincerity and truth” (1 Cor. 5:7-8).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Thus does one exclude the error of certain Greeks, who deny that
        this sacrament can be celebrated with unleavened bread. And this is even
        clearly destroyed by the Gospel’s authority, for we read in Matthew
        (26:17), in Mark (14:12), and in Luke (22:7) that on the first day of
        the unleavened bread our Lord ate the pasch with His disciples, and at
        that time instituted this sacrament. Now, since it was not permitted by
        the Law that from the first day of the unleavened bread anything
        leavened be found in the homes of the Jews (which is clear from Exodus
        12:15), and since our Lord as long as He was in the world kept the Law,
        clearly He converted unleavened bread into His body and gave it to His
        disciples to receive. It is stupid, then, to attack in the use of the
        Latin Churches what our Lord observed in the very institution of this
        sacrament.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] For all that, one must acknowledge that some say He anticipated the
        day of the unleavened bread with His passion so near, and, then, used
        leavened bread. Indeed, to support this they rely on two things. First,
        there is what John (13:1) says, that “before the festival day of the
        pasch” our Lord celebrated the feast with His disciples, and at this
        feast consecrated His body, as the Apostle tells us (1 Cor. 11:23).
        Hence, it seems that Christ celebrated the feast before the day of the
        unleavened bread, and so, in the consecration of His body, used leavened
        bread. Also, they want to confirm this by what is found in John (18:28):
        that on the Friday on which Christ was crucified the Jews did not enter
        the pretorium. of Pilate, “that they might not be defiled but might eat
        the pasch.” But the pasch is called the unleavened bread. Therefore,
        they conclude that the feast had been celebrated before the unleavened
        bread.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Now, to this one answers that, as the Lord commands in Exodus 12,
        “the feast of the unleavened bread was celebrated for seven days, and of
        these the first day was especially holy and solemn among the others, and
        it was the fifteenth day of the month.” But, since among the Jews the
        solemnities used to begin on the preceding evening, they therefore on
        the evening of the fourteenth day began to eat the unleavened bread and
        they ate it for seven days following. And, therefore, we read in the
        same chapter (Ex. 12:18-19): “The first month, the fourteenth day of the
        month in the evening you shall eat unleavened bread until the one and
        twenties day of the month in the evening. Seven days there shall not be
        found any leaven in your houses.” And on the same fourteenth day in the
        evening they used to sacrifice the paschal lamb. Therefore, the first
        day of the unleavened bread is the way the three Evangelists—Matthew,
        Mark, and Luke—name the fourteenth day of the month, because in the
        evening they used to eat the unleavened bread, and then “they sacrificed
        the pasch,” that is, “the paschal lamb”; and this, according to John,
        was before the festival day of the pasch,” that is, the day before the
        fifteenth day of the month which was the most solemn day of all, and on
        this day the Jews wanted to eat the pasch, that is, “the unleavened
        paschal bread,” not, of course, the paschal lamb. And thus, since no
        discord exists among the Evangelists, it is plain that Christ
        consecrated His body from unleavened bread at the feast. Hence it
        becomes clear that the Church of the Latins reasonably uses unleavened
        bread in this sacrament.

          >ON THE SACRAMENT OF PENANCE, AND, FIRST, THAT MEN AFTER RECEIVING
          SACRAMENTAL GRACE ARE ABLE TO SIN</span
        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Now, although grace is bestowed upon men by the aforesaid
        sacraments, they are not, for all that, rendered incapable of sin.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] For gratuitous gifts are received in the soul as habitual
        dispositions; it is not always, then, that a man acts according to those
        gifts. Nothing stops him who has a habit from acting in accord with the
        habit or against it; thus, a grammarian can in accord with grammar speak
        rightly, or even against grammar speak awkwardly. It is also like this
        with the habits of the moral virtues, for one who has the habit of
        justice can also act against justice. This is the case because the use
        of habits in us depends on the will, but the will is related to each of
        two opposites. Manifestly, then, he who receives gratuitous gifts can
        sin by acting against grace.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] What is more, there can be no impeccability in a man unless there is
        immutability of will. But immutability of will does not become man
        except so far as he attains his ultimate end. For what renders the will
        immutable is its complete fulfillment, so that it has no way to turn
        away from that on which it is made firm. But the fulfillment of will is
        not proportioned to a man except as attaining his ultimate end, for, as
        long as something remains to be desired, the will has not been
        fulfilled. Thus, then, impeccability is not proper for a man before he
        arrives at the ultimate end. And this, to be sure, is not given man in
        the grace which is bestowed in the sacraments, because the sacraments
        are for man’s assistance along the road to the end. Therefore, no one is
        rendered impeccable from the grace received in the sacraments.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Furthermore, every sin comes about from a kind of ignorance. Thus,
        the Philosopher says that “every evil man is ignorant”; and we read in
        Proverbs (14:22): “They err that work evil.” Therefore, then, a man can
        be secure from sin in the will, only when his intellect is secure from
        ignorance and from error. But, manifestly, a man is not rendered immune
        from every ignorance and error by the grace received in the sacraments;
        for such is a man whose intellect is beholding that truth which is the
        certitude of all truths; and this very beholding is the ultimate end of
        man, as was shown in Book III. It is not, then, by the grace of the
        sacraments that man is rendered impeccable.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Again, to that change in a man which accords with malice and virtue
        much is contributed by that change which accords with the soul’s
        passions. For by a reason curbing and ordering the soul’s passions a man
        becomes virtuous or is preserved in virtue, but by a reason following
        the passions a man becomes vicious. So long, then, as a man can be
        altered in the soul’s passions, he can also be altered in vice and
        virtue. But alteration in the soul’s passions is not taken away by the
        grace conferred in the sacraments; it persists in a man as long as the
        soul is united to the body, which is capable of passion. Manifestly,
        then, the sacramental grace does not render a man impeccable.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] There is more. It seems superfluous to warn those not to sin who
        cannot sin. But in the evangelical and apostolic teaching the faithful
        are so admonished, although they have already received the grace of the
        Holy Spirit through the sacraments, for we read in Hebrews (12:15):
        “Looking diligently, lest any man be wanting to the grace of God; lest
        any root of bitterness springing up do hinder”; and in Ephesians (4:30):
        “Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you are sealed”; and again:
        “He that thinks himself to stand, let him take heed lest he fall” (1
        Cor. io=). Even the Apostle himself says of himself: “I chastise my body
        and bring it into subjection, lest perhaps when I have preached to
        others, I myself should become a castaway” (1 Cor. 9:27). Therefore, men
        are not rendered impeccable by the grace received in the sacraments.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] This excludes the error of certain heretics who say that man, after
        he has received the grace of the Spirit, is unable to sin, and that, if
        he sins, he never had the grace of the Holy Spirit.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] They take, however, as a prop for their error the saying of 1
        Corinthians (13:8): “Charity never falls away.” And 1 John (3:6, 9)
        says: “Whosoever abides in Him sins not; and whosoever sins has not seen
        Him nor known Him.” And later on, more expressly: “Whosoever is born of
        God commits not sin; for His seed abides in him, and he cannot sin use
        he is born of God.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] But for establishing their proposition these texts are not
        effective. For one does not say: “charity never falls away” on the
        ground that he who has charity does not sometimes lose it, since the
        Apocalypse (2:4) says: “I have somewhat against you because you hast
        left your first charity.” But “charity never falls away” was said
        because, when all other gifts of the Holy Spirit (which essentially
        contain some imperfection—the spirit of prophecy, for example, and this
        kind of thing) “shall be made void... when that which is perfect is
        come” (1 Cor. 13:8, 10), then in that state of perfection charity shall
        abide.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] But the remarks taken from the Epistle of John are said for this
        reason: The gifts of the Holy Spirit by which a man is adopted or born
        again as a son of God have of themselves power enough to be able to
        preserve a man without sin, and a man cannot sin who lives by those
        gifts. He can, for all that, act against them, and sin by departing from
        them. For “whosoever is born of God... cannot sin” was said just as
        though one should say that “the hot cannot cool.” What is hot,
        nevertheless, can be made cool, and then it will make cool. Or it was
        said as though one should say that “the just man does no unjust things”;
        namely, in so far as he is just.

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] However, from what has been said it further appears that a man
        falling into sin after receiving sacramental grace can once more be
        restored to grace.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] For, as we showed, so long as we live here the will is mutable in
        the matter of vice and virtue. Therefore, as one can sin after grace is
        received, so also from sin, it seems, one can return to virtue.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Manifestly, again, good is more powerful than evil: for “evil acts
        only in the power of the good,” as was shown above in Book III. If,
        then, the will of man is turned away from the state of grace by sin,
        much more can grace call him back from sin.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Immobility of will, furthermore, is not proper to anyone so long as
        he is on the way. But, so long as man lives here, he is on the way which
        tends towards the ultimate end. He does not, then, have a will unmovable
        in evil, so that he is not able to return to the good by divine grace.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] There is more. Manifestly, a man who committed sins before he
        received grace in the sacraments is delivered from those sins by the
        grace of the sacraments, for the Apostle says: “Neither fornicators nor
        idolaters, nor adulterers,” and so forth, “shall possess the kingdom of
        God. And such some of you were; but you are washed, but you are
        sanctified, but you am justified in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
        and the Spirit of our God” (1 Cor. 6:9-11). Manifestly, also, the grace
        bestowed in the sacrament does not diminish, but increases, nature’s
        good. Yet this belongs to the good of nature, that it can be led back
        from sin into the state of justice, for the capacity for good is a kind
        of good. If, then, sin takes place after grace is received, man can
        still be led back to the state of justice.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] If those, moreover, who sin after baptism cannot return to grace,
        their hope of salvation is entirely lost. But despair is the way to
        sinning freely, for the Apostle speaks of some who “despairing have
        given themselves up to lasciviousness, unto the working of all
        uncleanness, unto covetousness” (Eph. 4:19). This is, then, a very
        dangerous position which leads men to so great a cesspool of vices.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] There is more. We showed above that the grace received in the
        sacraments does not make a man unable to sin. Therefore, if one who sins
        after receiving grace in the sacraments could not return to the state of
        justice, it would be dangerous to receive the sacraments. And this is
        obviously unsuitable. Therefore, to those who sin after receiving the
        sacraments the return to justice is not denied.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] This also is confirmed by the authority of sacred Scripture, for we
        read in John: “My little children, these things I write to you, that you
        may not sin. But if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father,
        Jesus Christ, the just. And He is the propitiation for our sins” (1 John
        2:1-2). And these very words were clearly being set forth to the
        faithful already reborn. Paul also writes about the Corinthian
        fornicator: “To him who is such a one, this rebuke is sufficient which
        is given by many: so that on the contrary you should rather forgive him
        and comfort him.” And later he says: “I am glad: not because you were
        made sorrowful, but because you were made sorrowful unto penance” (2
        Cor. 2:6-7; 7:9). We also read in Jeremiah (3:1): “You prostituted
        yourself to many lovers; nevertheless, return to Me, says the Lord”; and
        in his Lamentations (5:21): “Convert us, O Lord, and we shall be
        converted: renew our days, as from the beginning.” And from all these
        one sees that if the faithful fall after receiving grace, there is open
        to them a second time a way back to salvation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] In this way, of course, one excludes the error of the Novatians, who
        used to deny forgiveness to those who sinned after baptism.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] Now, they used to set down as the occasion of their error the
        saying in Hebrews (6:4-6): “It is impossible for those who were once
        illuminated, have tasted also the heavenly gift, and were made partakers
        of the Holy Spirit, have moreover tasted the good word of God, and the
        powers of the world to come, and are fallen away: to be renewed again to
        penance.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] But the sense in which the Apostle said this is apparent from what
        is immediately added: “Crucifying again to themselves the Son of God and
        making Him a mockery.” Therefore, the reason why those who have fallen
        after receiving grace cannot be renewed again to penance is that the Son
        of God must not be crucified again. One, therefore, denies to them that
        renewal again to penance in which a man is crucified along with Christ.
        And this indeed is in baptism, for we read: “All we who are baptized in
        Christ Jesus are baptized in His death” (Rom. 6:3). Therefore, as Christ
        must not be crucified once again, so he who sins after baptism must not
        be baptized again. Nonetheless, he can be converted to grace once again
        by penance. Hence, the Apostle did not say it was impossible that those
        once fallen should again be recalled or converted to penance, but
        impossible that they be “renewed”—which one usually attributes to
        baptism—as in Titus (3:5): “According to His mercy, He saved us, by the
        laver of regeneration and renovation of the Holy Spirit.”

          >ON THE NECESSITY OF PENANCE AND OF ITS PARTS</span
        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From this, then, it is evident that if a man sins after baptism, he
        cannot have the remedy against his sin in baptism. And since the
        abundance of the divine mercy and the effectiveness of Christ’s grace do
        not suffer him to be dismissed without a remedy, there was established
        another sacramental remedy by which sins are washed away. And this is
        the sacrament of penance, which is spiritual healing of a sort. For just
        as those who receive a natural life by generation can, if they incur
        some disease which is contrary to the perfection of life, be cured of
        their disease: not, indeed, so as to be born a second time, but healed
        by a kind of alteration; so baptism, which is a spiritual regeneration,
        is not given a second time against sins committed after baptism, but
        they are healed by penance which is a kind of spiritual alteration.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Let this, however, be considered: bodily healing is at times wholly
        from within, as when one is cured by the power of nature alone. But
        there are times when one is cured from within and from without
        simultaneously, for example, when the operation of nature is helped by
        the external benefit of medicine. But it never happens that one is cured
        entirely from without, for he still has within himself the principles of
        life, and from these the healing is somehow caused within him. But
        spiritual healing, it happens, cannot be brought about entirely from
        within, for we showed in Book III that man cannot be delivered from
        fault except by the help of grace. In like fashion, also, neither can
        his spiritual cure be entirely from an external thing; for the soundness
        of his mind would not be restored unless ordered movements of will were
        caused in man. Therefore, the spiritual health in the sacrament of
        penance must proceed both from something internal and from something
        external.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] This comes about in this way. For a man to be perfectly cured of a
        bodily disease, he necessarily must be freed from all the inconveniences
        which the disease involves. Thus, then, even the spiritual cure of
        penance would not be perfected unless a man were relieved of all the
        damages into which he has been led by sin. Now, the first damage which
        man sustains from sin is the disordering of the mind; in that man is
        turned away from the incommutable good—namely, God—and is turned toward
        sin. But the second damage is that he incurs the guilt of punishment,
        for, as was shown in Book III, God the most just ruler requires a
        punishment for every fault. The third damage is a certain weakening of
        the natural good, in that man by sinning is rendered more prone toward
        sinning and more reluctant toward doing well.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Therefore, the first thing required in penance is the ordering of
        the mind; namely, that the mind be turned toward God, and turned away
        from sin, grieving at its commission, and proposing not to commit it;
        and this belongs essentially to contrition.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] But this reordering of the mind cannot be without grace, for our
        mind cannot duly be turned toward God without charity, but one cannot
        have charity without grace, as is clear from what was said in Book III.
        Thus, then, by contrition the offense to God is removed and one is also
        freed from that guilt of eternal punishment which cannot be
        simultaneously with grace and charity; for there is no eternal
        punishment except by separation from God, and by grace and charity man
        is united with Him. Therefore, this reordering of the mind, which
        consists of contrition, proceeds from within, that is, from the free
        will with the help of divine grace.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Since, however, it was established above that the merit of Christ
        suffering for the human race works for the expiation of all sins, if a
        man is to be healed of sin his mind must necessarily cleave not only to
        God, but also to the mediator of God and men, Jesus Christ, in whom
        rests the remission of all sins. For spiritual health consists in the
        turning of the mind to God, and, to be sure, we cannot achieve this
        health except through the physician of our souls, Jesus Christ, “who
        shall save His people from their sins” (Mat. 1:21). Indeed, His merit is
        sufficient to take away all sins altogether, for it is He “‘who takes
        away the sins of the world” as John (1:29) says. Nonetheless, not all
        achieve perfectly the effect of remission; each achieves it in the
        measure in which he is conjoined with Christ suffering for sins.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Our conjunction, then, with Christ in baptism is not in accord with
        our operation (from within, so to say), because nothing generates itself
        in being, but it is from Christ, who “regenerated us unto a lively hope”
        (1 Peter 1:3); therefore, the remission of sins in baptism is made in
        accord with the power of Christ conjoining us perfectly and entirely
        with Himself, so as not only to take away every impurity of sin, but
        also to free us entirely from every guilt of punishment; except
        incidentally, perhaps, in the case of those who do not get the effect of
        the sacrament because they approach with a false attitude.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] In the later spiritual healing we are conjoined to Christ in accord
        with our own operation informed by divine grace. Hence, we do not always
        entirely, nor do we all equally, achieve the effect of remission by this
        conjunction. For there can be a turning of the mind toward God, and to
        the merit of Christ, and to the hatred of sin which is so vehement that
        a man perfectly achieves the remission of sin, not only with regard to
        wiping out the fault, but even with regard to remission of the entire
        punishment. But this does not always happen. Hence, after the fault is
        taken away by contrition and the guilt of eternal punishment is relieved
        (as was said), there sometimes persists an obligation to some punishment
        to maintain the justice of God which requires that fault be ordered by
        punishment.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] Since, however, to undergo punishment for a fault calls for a kind
        of judgment, the penitent who has committed himself to Christ for
        healing must look to Christ’s judgment for fixing the punishment; and
        this, indeed, Christ does through His ministers, just as He does in the
        other sacraments. But no one can judge of faults which he does not know.
        It was necessary, then, that confession be instituted, the second part
        of this sacrament, so to say, in order to make the fault of the penitent
        known to the minister of Christ.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] The minister, therefore, to whom confession is made must have
        judiciary power representing Christ, “who was appointed to be judge of
        the living and the dead” (Acts 10:42). For judiciary power two things
        are required: namely, the authority to know about the fault, and the
        power to absolve or condemn. And these two are called the “two keys of
        the Church,” namely, the knowledge to discern and the power to bind and
        loose which our Lord committed to Peter as Matthew (16:19) has it: “I
        will give to you the keys of the kingdom of heaven.” He is not
        understood to have committed these to Peter so that he alone might have
        them, but so that they might through him be passed on to others;
        otherwise, sufficient provision for the salvation of the faithful would
        not have been made.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] Of course, keys of this kind have their effectiveness from the
        suffering of Christ by which, we know, Christ opened for us the door of
        the kingdom of heaven. Accordingly, just as without baptism, in which
        the suffering of Christ works, there cannot be salvation for men—whether
        the baptism be really received, or desired to the purpose “when
        necessity, but not contempt, excludes the sacrament”—so for those
        sinning after baptism there can be no salvation unless they submit
        themselves to the keys of the Church, whether it be by actually
        confessing and undergoing the judgment of the ministers of the Church,
        or at least having this as a purpose to be fulfilled at the opportune
        time; because, as Peter says: “There is no other name given to men
        whereby we must be saved except by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ”
        (Acts 4:10-12).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [12] In this way one avoids the error of some who held that a man can
        achieve forgiveness of sins without confession and without the purpose
        of confessing, and that the prelates of the Church can dispense one from
        the obligation of confessing. For the prelates of the Church are unable
        “to make vain the keys of the Church” in which their entire power
        consists, and they cannot bring it about that one achieve the remission
        of his sins apart from a sacrament which has power from the passion of
        Christ. This belongs only to Christ, who established the sacraments and
        is their author. Thus, then, as there can be no dispensation from the
        prelates of the Church allowing one to be saved without baptism, neither
        can there be one allowing a man to achieve the remission of his sins
        without confession and absolution.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [13] Nonetheless, there is this consideration. Baptism has some
        effectiveness for the remission of sins even before it is actually
        received, while one has the purpose of receiving it. We grant that
        afterwards—when it is actually received—it bestows a fuller effect both
        in the achievement of grace and in the remission of fault. Sometimes,
        too, grace is bestowed in the very reception of baptism and a fault is
        remitted for which previously there was no remission. And thus the keys
        of the Church have effectiveness in one before he actually submits
        himself to them, provided that he has the purpose of submitting himself
        to them; nevertheless, he achieves fuller grace and forgiveness when he
        actually submits himself to the keys by confessing and receiving
        absolution; and nothing prevents our thinking that sometimes a grace is
        conferred by the power of the keys on one who has confessed, in the
        course of the absolution itself, and that by this grace his fault is
        dismissed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [14] Therefore, since even in the very confession and absolution a
        fuller effect of grace and remission is bestowed on him who—by reason of
        his good purpose—had previously obtained both, manifestly the minister
        of the Church, absolving by the power of the keys, dismisses. something
        of the temporal punishment for which the penitent remains in debt after
        contrition. He does, however, oblige the penitent to the balance by his
        command. And this fulfillment of the obligation is called satisfaction,
        which is the third part of penance. By this a man is entirely freed from
        the guilt of punishment when he pays the penalty which he owed; further,
        the weakness of the natural good is cured when a man abstains from bad
        things and accustoms himself to good ones: by subjecting his spirit to
        God in prayer, or by taming his flesh by fasting to make it subject to
        the spirit, and in external things by uniting himself by giving alms to
        the neighbors from whom his fault had separated him.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [15] Thus, clearly, then, the minister of the Church exercises a certain
        judgment in the use of the keys. But judgment is not granted to one
        unless it be judgment on those who are his subjects. Hence, it is
        manifest that it is not any priest at all who can absolve any man at all
        from sin—as some falsify it; he can absolve only one over whom he has
        received power.

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Now, the body is the instrument of the soul, and an instrument is
        for the use of the principal agent: therefore, the disposition of the
        instrument necessarily must be such as becomes the principal agent.
        Hence, the body is disposed in harmony with the soul. Therefore, from
        the infirmity of the soul which is sin infirmity sometimes flows into
        the body, when the divine judgment so disposes. To be sure, this bodily
        infirmity is at times useful for the soundness of the soul: so far as a
        man bears bodily infirmity humbly and patiently, and so far as it is
        reckoned as satisfying punishment for him. At times, also, it tends to
        hinder spiritual health: so far as bodily infirmity hinders the virtues.
        Therefore, it was suitable to employ some spiritual medicine against
        sin, in accord with the fact that bodily infirmity flows out of sin;
        indeed, this spiritual medicine cures the bodily infirmity at times,
        namely, when this is helpful to salvation. And for this a sacrament was
        established-extreme unction, about which James (5:14-15) says: “Is any
        man sick among you? Let him bring in the priests of the Church, and let
        them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. And
        the prayer of faith shall heal the sick man.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Nor is the power of this sacrament prejudiced if at times the sick
        on whom it is conferred are not wholly cured of this bodily infirmity,
        for the restoration of bodily health—even in those who receive the
        sacrament worthily—sometimes is not useful for salvation. And they do
        not, for all that, receive it in vain, although bodily health may not
        follow on it. For, since this sacrament is set against bodily infirmity
        so far as this follows on sin, this sacrament manifestly was established
        against the other consequences of sin, which are proneness to evil and
        difficulty in good, and it is set so much the more as the soul’s
        infirmities of this sort are closer neighbors to sin than bodily
        infirmity is. Indeed, spiritual infirmities of this sort are to be cured
        by penance, in that the works of virtue which the penitent performs when
        he makes satisfaction withdraw him from evils and incline him to good.
        But, since man, whether due to negligence, or to the changing
        occupations of life, or even to the shortness of time, or to something
        else of the sort, does not perfectly heal within himself the weaknesses
        mentioned, a healthful provision for him is made by this sacrament: it
        completes the healing aforesaid, and it delivers him from the guilt of
        temporal punishment; as a result, nothing remains in him when the soul
        leaves the body which can obstruct the soul in the perception of glory.
        And therefore James adds: “And the Lord shall raise him up.” Perhaps,
        also, a man has neither awareness nor memory of all the sins which he
        has committed, so that they may be washed away individual by penance.
        There are also those daily sins without which one does not lead this
        present life. And from these a man ought to be cleansed at his departure
        by this sacrament, so that nothing be found in him which would clash
        with the perception of glory. And therefore James adds: “If he be in
        sins, they shall be forgiven him.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Hence, it is clear that this sacrament is the last, that it somehow
        tends to consummate the entire spiritual healing, and that in it a man
        is, as it were, prepared for the perception of glory. For this reason
        also it is named extreme unction.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] From this it is apparent that this sacrament is not to be given to
        anyone at all who is sick, but only to those who seem in their weakness
        to be approaching the end. Nevertheless, if they get well, the sacrament
        can be conferred on them again if they return to a similar situation.
        For the anointing in this sacrament involves no consecration, as does
        the anointing in confirmation, or the washing in baptism, and certain
        other anointings which are never repeated—simply because the
        consecration always remains, so long as the thing consecrated endures,
        because of the effectiveness of the divine power which consecrates. But
        the anointing of this sacrament is-ordered toward healing, and healing
        medicine ought to be repeated as often as the weakness is repeated.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] We grant that some are in a state close to death even without
        infirmity—this is clear in the case of those condemned to death—and they
        nevertheless would need the spiritual effects of this sacrament, but it
        is not to be given unless such a one is sick, since it is given under
        the appearance of bodily medicine, which is fitting only for one who has
        been weakened in the body. For in the sacraments the character of the
        sign must be maintained. Therefore, just as baptism requires that
        washing be used on a body, so this sacrament requires that medicine be
        applied for bodily weakness. Hence, also, oil is the special matter of
        this sacrament, because it has effectiveness for bodily healing by
        alleviating pain; just as water which cleans the body is the matter of
        the sacrament in which spiritual cleansing takes place.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Therein one also sees that, just as bodily medicine must be applied
        at the source of the infirmity, so this anointing is used on those parts
        of the body from which the weakness of sin proceeds: such are the organs
        of the senses, and the hands and feet by which the works of sin are
        carried On, and—in accord with the custom of some—the loins in which the
        libidinous force is strong.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] But, since sins are forgiven by this sacrament, and no sin, of
        course, is forgiven except by grace, manifestly grace is conferred in
        this sacrament.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] Now, when things bestow enlightening grace on the mind, their use is
        proper only to priests, for their order tends to enlighten, as Dionysius
        says. Neither does this sacrament require a bishop, since this sacrament
        does not confer a state of excellence, as is the case with those whose
        minister is a bishop.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] Nonetheless, since this sacrament has a perfect cure as its effect,
        and an abundance of grace is required in it, it becomes this sacrament
        to have many priests present, and to have the prayer of the whole Church
        help in the effect. Hence, James says: “Let him bring in the priests of
        the Church... and the prayer of faith shall save the sick man.” If,
        nonetheless, only one priest is present, it is understood that he
        fulfills this sacrament in the power of the entire Church whose minister
        he is, and which, in person, he represents.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] Of course, the effect of this sacrament is obstructed by pretense
        in the receiver, just as can be the case with the other sacraments.

        [1] It is, of course, clear from what has been said that in all the
        sacraments dealt with a spiritual grace is conferred in a mystery of
        visible things. But every action ought to be proportioned to its agent.
        Therefore, the sacraments mentioned must be dispensed by visible men who
        have spiritual power. For angels are not competent to dispense the
        sacraments; this belongs to men clothed in visible flesh. Hence, the
        Apostle says: “Every high priest taken from among men is ordained for
        men in the things that appertain to God” (Heb. 5:1).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] This argument can be derived in another way. The institution and the
        power of the sacraments has its beginning in Christ. For the Apostle
        says of Him: “Christ loved the Church and delivered Himself up for it:
        that He might sanctify it, cleansing it by the laver of water in the
        word of life” (Eph. 5:75-26). It is also clear that Christ gave the
        sacrament of His body and blood at the Last Supper, and ordered it to be
        frequented; and these are the principal sacraments. Therefore, since
        Christ was about to withdraw His bodily presence from the Church, it was
        necessary that Christ should establish other ministers in His place who
        would dispense the sacraments to the faithful; in the Apostle’s words:
        “Let a man so account of us as ministers of Christ and dispensers of the
        mysteries of God” (1 Cor. 4:1). And so He committed the consecration of
        His body and blood to the disciples, saying: “Do this in commemoration
        of Me” (Luke 2:19); the same received the power of forgiving sins, in
        the words of John (20:2.3): “Whose sins you shall forgive, they are
        forgiven them”; the same also were given the duty of teaching and
        baptizing, when He said: “Going, therefore, teach ye all nations,
        baptizing them” (Mat. 28:19). But a minister is compared to his lord as
        an instrument to its principal agent, for, as an instrument is moved by
        the agent for making something, so the minister is moved by his lord’s
        command to accomplish something. Of course, the instrument must be
        proportionate to the agent. Hence, the ministers of Christ must be in
        conformity with Him. But Christ, as the Lord, by His very own authority
        and power wrought our salvation, in that He was God and man: so far as
        He was man, in order to suffer for our redemption; and, so far as He was
        God, to make His suffering salutary for us. Therefore, the ministers of
        Christ must not only be men, but must participate somehow in His
        divinity through some spiritual power, for an instrument shares in the
        power of its principal agent. Now, it is this power that the Apostle
        calls “the power which the Lord bath given me unto edification and not
        unto destruction” (2 Cor. 13:10).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] One must not say, of course, that power of this sort was given by
        Christ to His disciples in such a way as not to flow on through them to
        others; it was given “for building up the Church,” in the Apostle’s
        phrase. So long, then, must this power be perpetuated as it is necessary
        to build up the Church. But this is necessary from the death of the
        disciples of Christ to the very end of the world. Therefore, the
        spiritual power was given to the disciples of Christ so as to pass on
        from them to others. Hence, also, our Lord used to address His disciples
        in the person of other believers. Thus, we have in Mark (13:37): “What I
        say to you, I say to all”; and in Matthew (28:20) our Lord said to the
        disciples: “Behold, I am with you all days even to the consummation of
        the world.” [4] This spiritual power from Christ, then, flows into the
        ministers of the Church; the spiritual effects on us, of course, derived
        from Christ, are fulfilled under certain sensible signs, js is clear
        from the foregoing; therefore, this spiritual power also had to be
        passed on to men under certain sensible signs. But fixed forms of words
        and determined acts are of this sort: the imposition of hands, for
        example, the anointing, and the offering of the book or the chalice, or
        of something of this sort which belongs to the execution of the
        spiritual power. But, whenever something spiritual is transferred under
        a bodily sign, we call it a sacrament. Clearly, then, in conferring the
        spiritual power, a certain sacrament is enacted which is called the
        sacrament of orders.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Now, this belongs to the divine liberality: that, if the power for
        some operation is conferred on one, there be conferred also those things
        without which this operation cannot suitably be exercised. But the
        administration of the sacraments to which the spiritual power is ordered
        is not suitably done unless one be helped to it by divine grace.
        Accordingly, grace is bestowed in this sacrament as it is in the other
        sacraments.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Now, the power of orders is established for the dispensation of the
        sacraments. But among the sacraments that which is most noble and tends
        most to complete the others is the sacrament of the Eucharist as is
        clear from what has been said. Therefore, the power of orders must be
        weighed chiefly by reference to this sacrament, for “everything is
        denominated from its end.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] It seems, of course, to be the same power which grants a perfection,
        and which prepares matter for the reception of that perfection. just so,
        fire has the power both to pass its form on to another, and to dispose
        that other for the reception of the form. Since, then, the power of
        orders is extended to performing the sacrament of the body of Christ and
        handing it on to believers, the same power must extend itself to this:
        making the believers ready for this sacrament and in harmony with its
        reception. But a believer is made ready for the reception of this
        sacrament and in harmony with it by his freedom from sin; otherwise, he
        cannot be united spiritually with that Christ to whom he is
        sacramentally conjoined by the reception of this sacrament. Therefore,
        the power of orders must extend itself to, the remission of sins by the
        dispensation of those sacraments which are ordered to the remission of
        sins; baptism and penance are of this kind, as is clear from what has
        been said. Hence, as was said, our Lord’s disciples, to whom He
        committed the consecration of His body, were also given the power to
        forgive sins. This, indeed, is the power we understand by the “keys”
        about which our Lord said to Peter: “I will give to you the keys of the
        kingdom of heaven” (Mat. 16:19). For to every man heaven is closed or is
        opened by this: he is subject to sin, or he is cleansed from sin; hence,
        too, the use of these keys is called “to bind and to loose”, namely,
        from sins. It was of these, indeed, keys that we spoke above.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">ON THE DISTINCTION OF ORDERS</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Let us now take this into consideration: The power ordered to some
        principal effect by nature has under it inferior powers which serve it.
        This is especially clear in the arts, for the are which introduces into
        a thing its artificial form is served by the are which prepares the
        material; in turn, the one which introduces the form serves the are to
        which the end of the artificial thing belongs; the one in turn ordered
        to a further end serves the one ordered to the ultimate end. just so,
        the are of the, wood-cutter serves that of the ship-builder, and the
        latter that of navigation, and this in turn the are of economy, or of
        warfare, or something of this sort, since the navigator’s are can be
        ordered to different ends. Since, then, the power of orders is
        principally ordered to consecrating the body of Christ and dispensing it
        to the faithful, and to cleansing the faithful from their sins, there
        must be some principal order whose power extends principally to this;
        this is the order of the priesthood; and there must be other orders
        which serve this one by preparing the material, and these are the
        ministerial orders. Now, since the priestly power, as was said, is
        extended to two things-namely, the consecration of the body of Christ
        and making the faithful ready for the Eucharist by absolution from their
        sins—the lesser orders must serve the priestly power either in both of
        these things, or else in one or the other. And, manifestly, an order is
        superior among the inferior orders by just as much as it serves the
        superior order in many things or in some worthier one.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Therefore, the lowest orders serve the priestly order merely in the
        preparation of the people: doorkeepers, by actually keeping unbelievers
        out of the gathering of believers; readers, by instructing catechumens
        in the rudiments of the faith—hence, the Old Testament Scripture is
        assigned them for reading, exorcists, however, by cleansing those who
        are already instructed, but to some extent are obstructed by the devil
        from the reception of the sacraments.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] The superior orders serve the priestly order both in the preparation
        of the people and in the consummation of the sacrament. Acolytes have
        supervision over vessels which are not sacred and in which the material
        of the sacrament is prepared; hence, the cruets are handed to them
        during their ordination. Subdeacons, however, have supervision over
        sacred vessels and the disposal of material not yet consecrated. But
        deacons, beyond this, have supervision over consecrated material in that
        they dispense the blood of Christ to the faithful. Accordingly, these
        three orders—the priesthood, the diaconate, and the subdiaconate—are
        called sacred orders because they receive a ministry over something
        sacred. The superior orders serve also in the preparation of the people.
        Hence, deacons are entrusted with the Gospel teaching to present it to
        the people, and subdeacons with the apostolic teaching; acolytes are
        entrusted with the performance in each of the two cases with what
        belongs to the solemnity of the teaching, namely, that they carry the
        lights and administer tasks of this kind.

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Now, the bestowal of all of these orders accompanies some sacrament,
        as was said, and the sacraments of the Church require some ministers for
        their dispensing; there must, therefore, be a superior power in the
        Church with a higher ministry which dispenses the sacrament of orders.
        And this is the episcopal power, which, although it does not exceed the
        power of the priest in the consecration of the body of Christ, does
        exceed the priestly power in what touches the faithful. For the priestly
        power itself flows from the episcopal power, and anything particularly
        difficult to be performed for the faithful is reserved to the bishops;
        by their authority, even priests are empowered to do that which is
        committed to them to be done. Hence, even in the tasks which priests
        perform they employ things consecrated by bishops; thus, in the
        Eucharistic consecration they use a chalice, an altar, and a pall
        consecrated by the bishop. Clearly, then, the chief direction of the
        faithful belongs to the dignity of the bishops.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] But this, too, is clear: Although people are set apart according to
        differing dioceses and states, yet, as the Church is one, so must the
        Christian people be one. Therefore, as for the specific congregation of
        one Church one bishop is called for who is the head of that Church; so
        for the entire Christian people there must be one who is head of the
        entire Church.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Then, too, the unity of the Church requires that all the faithful
        agree as to the faith. But about matters of faith it happens that
        questions arise. A diversity of pronouncements, of course, would divide
        the Church, if it were not preserved in unity by the pronouncement of
        one. Therefore, the unity of the Church demands that there be one who is
        at the head of the entire Church. But, manifestly, in its necessities
        Christ has not failed the Church which He loved and for which He shed
        His blood, since even of the synagogue the Lord says: ‘What is there
        that I ought to do more to My vineyard that I have not done to it?”
        (Isa. 5:4). Therefore, one must not doubt that by Christ’s ordering
        there is one who is at the head of the entire Church.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] No one should doubt, furthermore, that the government of the Church
        has been established in the best way, since He has disposed it by whom
        “kings reign, and lawmakers decree just things” (Prov. 8:15). But the
        best government of a multitude is rule by one, and this is clear from
        the purpose of government, which is peace; for peace and the unity of
        his subjects are the purpose of the one who rules, and one is a better
        constituted cause of unity than many. Clearly, then, the government of
        the Church has been so disposed that one is at the head of the entire
        Church.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] The militant Church, moreover, derives from the triumphant Church by
        exemplarity, hence, John in the Apocalypse (21:2) saw “Jerusalem coming
        down out of heaven”; and Moses was told to make everything “according to
        the pattern that was shown you in the mount” (Ex. 25:40; 26:30). But in
        the triumphant Church one presides, the one who presides over the entire
        universe—namely, God—for we read in the Apocalypse (21:3): “They shall
        be His people and God Himself with them shall be their God.” Therefore,
        in the militant Church, also, there is one who presides over things
        universally.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Hence it is that we read in Hosea (1:11): “The children of Judah and
        the children of Israel shall be gathered together; and they shall
        appoint themselves one head.” And our Lord says: “There shall be one
        fold and one shepherd” (John 10:16).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] But let one say that the one head and one shepherd is Christ, who is
        one spouse of one Church; his answer does not suffice. For, clearly,
        Christ Himself perfects all the sacraments of th Church: it is He who
        baptizes; it is He who forgives sins; it is He, the true priest, who
        offered Himself on the altar of the cross, and by whose power His body
        is daily consecrated on the altar—nevertheless, because He was not going
        to be with all the faithful in bodily presence, He chose ministers to
        dispense the things just mentioned to the faithful, as was said above.
        By the same reasoning, then, when He was going to withdraw His bodily
        presence from the Church, He had to commit it to one who would in His
        place have the care of the universal Church. Hence it is that He said to
        Peter before His ascension: “Feed My sheep” (John 21:17); and before His
        passion: “You being once converted confirm your brethren” (Luke 22:32);
        and to him alone did He promise: “I will give to you the keys of the
        kingdom of heaven” (Mat. 16:19), in order to show that the power of the
        keys was to flow through him to others to preserve the unity of the
        Church.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] But it cannot be said that, although He gave Peter this dignity, it
        does not flow on to others. For, clearly, Christ established the Church
        so that it was to endure to the end of the world; in the words of Isaiah
        (9:7): “He shall sit upon the throne of David and upon His kingdom to
        establish and strengthen it with judgment and with justice from
        henceforth and forever.” It is clear that He so established therein
        those who were then in the ministry that their power was to be passed on
        to others even to the end of time; especially so, since He Himself says:
        “Behold I am with you all days even to the consummation of the world”
        (Mat. 28:20).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] By this, of course, we exclude the presumptuous error of some who
        attempt to withdraw themselves from the obedience and the rule of Peter
        by not recognizing in his successor, the Roman Pontiff, the pastor of
        the universal Church.

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From what we have Premised it is clear that the ministers of the
        Church, when they receive their orders, receive a certain power for
        dispensing the sacraments.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] But what is acquired by a thing through consecration persists in
        that thing forever; hence, nothing consecrated is consecrated a second
        time. Therefore, the power of their orders persists in the ministers of
        the Church perpetually. Therefore, it is not taken away by sin.
        Therefore, even sinners and evil men, provided they have orders, are
        able to confer the sacraments of the Church.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Then, too, nothing has power over that which exceeds its capacities
        unless the power be received from some other source. This is clear in
        natural as well as in civil matters: Water cannot heat unless it
        receives the power of beating from fire, nor can a bailiff coerce
        citizens unless he receives power from a king. But the things
        accomplished in sacraments exceed human capacity, as the foregoing made
        clear. Therefore, no man can dispense the sacraments, no matter how good
        he is, unless he receives the power to dispense them. Now, goodness is
        in man the opposite of malice and sin. Therefore, one who has received
        the power to dispense the sacraments is not blocked by sin from
        dispensing them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] A man, furthermore, is called good or bad in accord with virtue or
        vice, which are habits of a sort. Habit differs from power in this way:
        By a power we are able to do something, but by a habit we are not
        rendered able or unable to make something, but ready or unready in doing
        well or badly what we are able to do. Habit, therefore, neither gives us
        an ability nor removes one, rather, by habit we acquire this: to do
        something well or badly. Therefore, a man’s being good or bad does not
        make him able or unable to dispense the sacraments, but suitable or
        unsuitable for dispensing them well.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Moreover, that which acts by the power of another likens the thing
        modified not to itself, but to the principal agent. For a house is riot
        made like the instrument which a builder uses; it is made like his art.
        The ministers of the Church do not perform the sacraments in their own
        power, but in the power of Christ, of whom John (1:33) says: “He it is
        who baptizes.” Hence, also, ministers are said to act as instruments,
        for a minister is an “animate tool.” Therefore, the malice of the
        ministers does not block the faithful from achieving in the sacraments
        the salvation which is from Christ.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] There is more. The goodness or malice of another man cannot be
        judged by man; this is God’s alone, who scans the secrets of the heart.
        If, then, the malice of the minister could block the effect of the
        sacrament, a man could not have a sure confidence about his salvation,
        and his conscience would not remain free from sin. It seems awkward,
        also, that one put the hope of his salvation in the goodness of a mere
        man, for Jeremiah (17:5) says: “Cursed be the man that trusts in man.”
        But, if a man were not to hope for the achievement of his salvation
        through the sacraments—except through those conferred by a good
        minister—he would appear to put the hope of his salvation to some extent
        in a man. That we may, therefore, put the hope of our salvation in
        Christ, who is God and man, we must confess that the sacraments are for
        salvation by the power of Christ, whether they are good ministers or bad
        ministers who confer them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] This is apparent as well from the fact that our Lord teaches us to
        obey even bad prelates, whose works we must not imitate. For He says:
        “The Scribes and the Pharisees sit on the chair of Moses. All things,
        therefore, that they say to you, observe and do. But according to their
        works, do not do” (Mat. 23:2-3). But there is much more reason to obey
        people who have received a ministry from Christ than there was to obey
        “the chair of Moses.” Therefore, one must obey even bad ministers. And
        this would not be the case unless the power of their orders persisted in
        them-which is the reason one obeys them. Even bad men, therefore, have
        the power of dispensing the sacraments.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        18]. In this way one excludes the error of some who say that all good
        men have the power of dispensing the sacraments and no bad men have it.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">ON THE SACRAMENT OF MATRIMONY</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Now, we grant that by the sacraments men are restored to grace;
        nonetheless, they are not immediately restored to immortality. We have
        given the reason for this. But things which are corruptible cannot be
        perpetuated except by generation. Since, then, the people of the
        faithful had to be perpetuated unto the end of the world, this had to be
        done by generation, by which, also, the human species is perpetuated.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] But let us consider this: When something is ordered to different
        ends there must be differing principles directing it to the end, for the
        end is proportioned to the agent. Human generation, of course, is
        ordered to many things; namely, to the perpetuity of the species and to
        the perpetuity of some political good—the perpetuity of a people in some
        state for example. It is also ordered to the perpetuity of the Church,
        which consists in the collection of the faithful. Accordingly,
        generation of this kind must be subject to a diversity of directions.
        Therefore, so far as it is ordered to the good of nature, which is the
        perpetuity of the species, it is directed to the end by nature inclining
        to this end; thus, one calls it a duty of nature. But, so far as
        generation is ordered to a political good, it is subject to the ordering
        of civil law. Then, so far as it is ordered to the good of the Church,
        it must be subject to the government of the Church. But things which are
        dispensed to the people by the ministers of the Church are called
        sacraments. Matrimony, then, in that it consists in the union of a
        husband and wife purposing to generate and educate offspring for the
        worship of God, is a sacrament of the Church; hence, also, a certain
        blessing on those marrying is given by the ministers of the Church.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        13] And as in the other sacraments by the thing done outwardly a sign is
        made of a spiritual thing, so, too, in this sacrament by the union of
        husband and wife a sign of the union of Christ and the Church is made;
        in the Apostle’s words: “This is a great sacrament, but I speak in
        Christ and in the church” (Eph. 5:32).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] And because the sacraments effect that of which they are made signs,
        one must believe that in this sacrament a grace is conferred on those
        marrying, and that by this grace they are included in the union of
        Christ and the Church, which is most especially necessary to them, that
        in this way in fleshly and earthly things they may purpose not to be
        disunited from Christ and the Church.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Since, then, the union of husband and wife gives a sign of the union
        of Christ and the Church, that which makes the sign must correspond to
        that whose sign it is. Now, the union of Christ and the Church is a
        union of one to one to be held forever. For there is one Church, as the
        Canticle (6:8) says: “One is My dove, My perfect one.” And Christ will
        never be separated from His Church, for He Himself says: “Behold I am
        with you all days even to the consummation of the world” (Mat. 28:20);
        and, further: “we shall be always with the Lord” (1 Thes. 4:16), as the
        Apostle says. Necessarily, then, matrimony as a sacrament of the Church
        is a union of one man to one woman to be held indivisibly, and this is
        included in the faithfulness by which the man and wife are bound to one
        another.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Thus, then, there are three goods of matrimony as a sacrament of the
        Church: namely, offspring to be accepted and educated for the worship of
        God; fidelity by which one man is bound to one wife; and the
        sacrament—and, in accord with this—there is indivisibility in the
        marriage union, in so far as it is a sacrament of the union of Christ
        and the Church.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Now, all the other things one ought to consider in matrimony we have
        dealt with in Book III.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Now, we have shown above that we have been freed by Christ from what
        we incurred by the sin of the first man; and, when the first man sinned,
        not only was the sin itself passed on to us, but also, death, which is
        the punishment of sin, in the Apostle’s words: “By one man sin entered
        into this world and by sin death” (Rom. 5:12). Therefore, it necessarily
        is by Christ that we are freed from each of these; namely, from the
        fault and from death. Accordingly, the Apostle says in the same place:
        “If by one man’s offence death reigned through vie; much more they who
        receive abundance... of the gift and of justice shall reign in life
        through one, Jesus Christ” (Rom. 5:37).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Therefore, in order to make each of these clear to us in Himself, He
        chose both to die and to rise. He chose to die, indeed, to cleanse us
        from sin; hence, the Apostle says: “As it is appointed unto men once to
        die, so also Christ was offered once to exhaust the sins of many” (Heb.
        9:77-2.8). But He chose to rise to free us from death; hence, the
        Apostle says: “Christ is risen from the dead, the firstfruits of them
        that sleep. For by a man came death and by a man the resurrection of the
        dead” (1 Cor. 15:20-21).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] It is, then, the effect of the death of Christ in regard to the
        remission of sin which we achieve in the sacraments, for, it has already
        been said, the sacraments work in the power of the passion of Christ.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] But the effect of the resurrection of Christ in regard to our
        liberation from death we shall achieve at the end of the world, when we
        shall all rise by the power of Christ. Hence, the Apostle says: “If
        Christ be preached that He arose again from the dead, how do some among
        you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? If there be no
        resurrection of the dead, then Christ is not risen again. And if Christ
        be not risen again then is our preaching vain and our faith is vain (1
        Cor. 15:12`14). It is, then, a necessary tenet of faith to believe that
        there will be a resurrection of the dead.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] There are, however, some who are perverse in their understanding of
        this and they do not believe in the future resurrection of bodies, but
        attempt to ascribe what we read about the resurrection in the Scriptures
        to a spiritual resurrection in which some arise from the death of sin by
        grace.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] But this error is rejected by the Apostle himself, he says: “But
        shun profane and vain babblings: for they grow much towards ungodliness,
        And their speech spreads like a canker: of whom are Hymenaeus and
        Pbilebus: who have erred from the truth of the faith, saying that the
        resurrection is past already” (2 Tim. 2:16-18). And this was not
        understandable except of a spiritual resurrection. It is, therefore,
        contrary to the truth of the faith to accept a spiritual resurrection
        and deny a bodily one.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] There is more. It is clear from what the Apostle says to the
        Corinthians that the words cited are to be understood of a bodily
        resurrection. For, after a bit, he adds, “It is sown a natural body, it
        shall rise a spiritual body,” wherein, manifestly, the body’s
        resurrection is touched on; and a little later he adds: “This
        corruptible must put on incorruption; and this mortal must put on
        immortality” (1 Cor. 15:44, 53). But the corruptible and the mortal mean
        the body. Therefore, it is the body that will rise.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] Moreover, our Lord promises both resurrections, for He says: “Amen,
        Amen, I say unto you that the hour comes and now is when the dead shall
        hear the voice of the Son of God and they that hear shall live.” And
        this seems to pertain to the spiritual resurrection of souls, which even
        then was beginning to be completed, when some were cleaving to Christ in
        faith. But, later, it is the bodily resurrection He expresses, saying:
        “The hour is coming, when all who are in the graves shall hear the voice
        of the Son of God” (John 5:25, 28). For, clearly, souls are not in the
        graves, but bodies. Therefore, this predicts the bodily resurrection.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] The bodily resurrection was also expressly foretold by Job. For he
        says: “I know that my Redeemer lives, and on the last day I shall rise
        out of the earth, and shall be clothed again with my skin, and in my
        flesh I shall see my God” (Job 19:75-76).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] Moreover, to establish that there will be a resurrection of the
        flesh there is an evident supporting argument which is based on the
        points made earlier. For we showed in Book II that the souls of men are
        immortal. They persist, then, after their bodies, released from their
        bodies. It is also clear from what was said in Book II that the soul is
        naturally united to the body, for in its essence it is the form of the
        body. It, then, contrary to the nature of the soul to be without the
        body. But nothing which is contrary to nature can be perpetual.
        Perpetually, then, the soul will not be without the body. Since, then,
        it persists perpetually, it must once again be united to the body; and
        this is to rise again. Therefore, the immortality of souls seems to
        demand a future resurrection of bodies.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] Furthermore, there was shown in Book III the natural desire of man
        to tend to happiness. But ultimate happiness is the perfection of the
        happy one. Therefore, anyone to whom some perfection is wanting does not
        yet have perfect happiness, because his desire is not entirely at rest,
        for every imperfect thing naturally desires to achieve its perfection.
        But the soul separated from the body is in a way imperfect, as is every
        part existing outside of its whole, for the soul is naturally a part of
        human nature. Therefore, man cannot achieve his ultimate happiness
        unless the soul be once again united to the body, especially since it
        was shown that in this life man cannot arrive at his ultimate happiness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [12] Moreover, as was shown in Book III, by divine providence sinners
        deserve punishment, and those who do well a reward. But in this life
        men, composed of soul and body, sin or act rightly. Therefore, in both
        the soul and the body men deserve reward or punishment. But that in this
        life they cannot achieve the reward of ultimate happiness is clear from
        the points made in Book III. And time after time sins are not punished
        in this life; rather, in fact, as we read in Job (21:7) here “the wicked
        live, are advanced, and are strengthened with riches.” Necessarily,.
        then, we must assert a repeated union of the soul with the body, so that
        man can be rewarded and punished in the body as well as in ths soul.

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] There are, of course, some things which seem to be opposed to faith
        in the resurrection. Thus: in no natural thing does one find that which
        has been corrupted returning to being with numerical identity; neither
        does it seem possible to go back again from privation of a thing to
        possessing it. Accordingly, since things which are corrupted cannot be
        repeated with an identity in number, nature intends that the thing which
        is corrupted be preserved with an identity in species by generation.
        Since, then, man is corrupted by death, and the very body of man
        resolved even into the primary elements, it does not seem possible for a
        man with identity in number to be restored to life.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Again, numerical identity is impossible to a thing if one of its
        essential principles cannot be numerically identical, for, if an
        essential principle is varied, that essence of the thing is varied by
        which the thing, as it is, is also one. But what is returned altogether
        to nothingness cannot be taken up again with numerical identity; this
        will be the creation of a new thing rather than the restoration of an
        identical thing. But there seem to be several of the essential
        principles of man returning to nothingness by his death. And first, to
        be sure, his very corporeity and the form of the compound, since the
        body is manifestly dissolved. Then, too, a part of the sensitive soul,
        and the nutritive, which cannot he without bodily organs, seem lost.
        Further, of course, there seems to return to nothingness the humanity
        itself-which is said to be the form of the whole—once the soul is
        separated from the body. It seems, then, impossible that man should rise
        again being identical in number.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Furthermore, what is not continuous seems not to he numerically
        identical. And this is manifest not only in sizes and motions, but even
        in qualities and forms, for if, after healing, a man becomes sick and is
        healed again, the health which returns will not be the same in number.
        Now, clearly, man’s being is taken away by death, since corruption is a
        change from being to non-being. It is, then, impossible that man’s being
        be repeated with numerical identity. Then, neither will the man be the
        same in number, for things which are the same in number are the same in
        being.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] If, furthermore, a man’s identical body is restored to life, by
        equal reasoning whatever was in the man’s body ought to be returned to
        the same man. But on this something extremely unseemly follows—not only
        by reason of the beard and the nails and the hair which are openly
        removed by daily trimming, but also by reason of other parts of the body
        which are covertly resolved by the action of the natural heat—and if
        these all are restored to the man rising again, an unseemly enormity
        will rise with him. It seems, then, that man will not rise after death.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] There is more. It happens, occasionally, that some men feed on human
        flesh, and they are nourished on this nutriment only, and those so
        nourished generate sons. Therefore, the same flesh is found in many men.
        But it is not possible that it should rise in many. And the resurrection
        does not seem otherwise to be universal and entire if there is not
        restored to every man what he has had here.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Again, that which is common to all those existing in a species seems
        to he natural to that species. But the resurrection of man is not
        natural, for there is not a natural power of man which suffices to do
        this. Therefore, not all men will rise in common.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Furthermore, if by Christ we are freed from fault and from death,
        which is the effect of sin, it seems that those alone ought to be freed
        who had a share in the mysteries of Christ by which they would be freed
        from sin. But this is not true of all men. Therefore, not all men will
        rise, it seems.

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Now, toward a solution of these difficulties this consideration is
        required: God, as was said, above, when He established human nature,
        granted the human body something over and above that which was its due
        in its natural principles: a kind of incorruptibility, namely, by which
        it was suitably adapted to its form, with the result that, as the life
        of the soul is perpetual, so the body could live perpetually by the
        soul.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] And this sort of incorruptibility, although not, of course, natural
        in its. active principle, was somehow natural in its order to the end;
        namely, as matter would be ordered to its natural form, which is the end
        of the matter.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] When the soul, then, outside the order of its nature, was turned
        away from God, that disposition was lost which had been divinely
        bestowed on the soul’s body to make it proportionally responsive to the
        soul; and death followed. Death, therefore, is something added as an
        accident, so to say, to man through sin, if one considers the
        establishment of human nature.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4]. But this accident was taken away by Christ, who by the merit of His
        passion our “death by dying did destroy.” From this, then, it follows
        that by the divine power which gave the body incorruption the body may
        once again be restored from death to life.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] In this way, then, one must answer the first argument that the power
        of nature fails the divine power, as the power of an instrument fails
        the principal agent. Granted, then, that the operation of nature cannot
        bring it about that a corrupted body be restored to life, the divine
        power can bring it about. The reason nature is unable to do this is that
        nature always operates by a form. But what has a form, already is. When
        it was corrupted, of course, it lost the form which was able to be the
        principle of the action. Hence, by natures operation, what was corrupted
        cannot be restored with a numerical identity. But the divine power which
        produced things in being operates by nature in such wise that it can
        without nature produce natures effect, as was previously shown. Hence
        since the divine power remains the same even when things are corrupted,
        it can restore the corrupted to integrity.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] What is stated in the second objection, however, cannot be an
        obstacle to man’s ability to rise with numerical identity. For none of
        man’s essential principles yields entirely to nothingness in death, for
        the rational soul which is man’s form remains after death, as was shown
        above; the matter, also, which was subject to such a form remains in the
        same dimensions which made it able to be the individual matter.
        Therefore, by conjunction to a soul numerically the same the man will be
        restored to matter numerically the same.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Corporeity, however, can be taken in two ways. In one way, it can be
        taken as the substantial form of a body as it is located in the genus of
        substance. Thus, the corporeity of any body is nothing else but its
        substantial form; in accord with this it is fixed in genus and species,
        and to this the bodily thing owes its having three dimensions. For there
        are not different substantial forms in one and the same thing, by one of
        which it is placed in the supreme genus—substance, say; by another in
        its proximate genus—body or animal, say; and by another in its
        species—say man or horse. Since, if the first form were to make the
        being substance, the following forms would be accruing to that which
        already is actually a definite something (<i>hoc aliquid</i>), and
        subsisting in nature; thus, the later forms would not make a definite
        something, but would be in the subject which is a definite something as
        accidental forms. Therefore, corporeity, as the substantial form in man,
        cannot be other than the rational soul, which requires in its own matter
        the possession of three dimensions, for the soul is the act of a body.
        Another way of taking corporeity is as an accidental form; in accord
        with this one says a body is in the genus of quantity. And corporeity
        thus is nothing other than the three dimensions which constitute the
        character of body. Therefore, although this corporeity yields to
        nothingness when the human body is corrupted, it cannot, for all that,
        be an obstacle to the body’s rising with numerical identity; the reason
        is that corporeity taken in the first way does not yield to nothingness,
        but remains the same.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] In the same fashion, also, the form of a compound can be taken in
        two ways. In one way it is so taken that by form of a compound one
        understands the substantial form of the compound body. And thus, since
        there is not in man any other substantial form than the rational soul,
        as was shown, one will not be able to say that the form of the compound,
        as it is the substantial form, yields to nothingness when man dies.
        Taken in a second way, a form of the compound is called that certain
        quality which is composed and balanced from the mixture of the simple
        qualities, and stands to the substantial form of the compound body as
        the simple quality stands to the substantial form of the simple body.
        Hence, although the form of the compounding when thus stated yields to
        nothingness, this is not prejudicial to the unity of the body arising.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] Thus, also, must one speak of the nutritive part and the sensitive
        part. For, if by sensitive part and nutritive part one understands those
        very capacities which are the natural properties of the soul, or,
        better, of the composite, then, when the body is corrupted, they are
        corrupted; nonetheless, this is no obstacle to the unity of the one
        arising. But, if by the parts mentioned the very substance of the
        sensitive and nutritive soul is understood, each of those parts is
        identified with the rational soul. For there are not three souls in man,
        but only one, as was shown in Book II.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] But, in speaking of humanity, one should not understand it as a
        kind of form coming forth from the union of the form to the matter, as
        though it were, really other than each of the two, because, since by the
        form the matter is made this actual something, as <i>De anima</i> II [
        1] says, that third form following would be not substantial, but
        accidental. Of course, some say that the form of the part is the same as
        the form of the whole: it is called form of the part in that it makes
        the matter actual being, but it is called form of the whole in that it
        completes the species essentially. In this way, humanity is not really
        other than the rational soul. Hence, clearly, when the body is corrupted
        it does not yield to nothingness. But humanity is the essence of man.
        The essence of a thing, of course, is, what the definition signifies;
        and the definition of a natural thing does not signify the form alone,
        but the form and the,matter. Therefore, necessarily, humanity signifies
        something composite of matter and form, just as “man” does. Differently,
        nevertheless; for “humanity” signifies the essential principles of the
        species, both formal and material, prescinding from the individual
        principles. Humanity is used so far as one is a man; one is not a man by
        reason of having the individual principles, but only by having the
        essential principles of the species. Humanity, therefore, signifies only
        the essential principles of the species. Hence, it is signified in the
        way in which a part is signified. “Man” truly signifies the essential
        principles of the species, but does not exclude the individuating
        principles from.its signification, for he is called man who has
        humanity, and this does not shut out the ability to have other things.
        For this reason, man is signified as a whole is, for it signifies the
        essential principles actually, but the individuating principles
        potentially. “Socrates,” however, signifies each set of principles
        actually, just as the genus contains the difference in potency, but the
        species contains it actually. Hence, it is clear that man returns
        numerically the same both by reason of the permanence of the rational
        soul and by reason of the unity of matter.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] However, what is said in the third argument—that being is not one
        because it is not continuous—rests on a false foundation. For, clearly,
        the being of matter and form is one; matter has no actual being except
        by form. Nonetheless, in this respect the rational soul differs from
        other forms. For there is no being of other forms except in their
        concrete union with matter, since they exceed matter neither in being
        nor in operation. But the rational soul plainly exceeds matter in its
        operation, for it has an operation in which no bodily organ takes part;
        namely, the act of understanding. Hence, its being, also, is not merely
        in its concrete union with matter. Its being, therefore, which is that
        of the composite, remains in the soul even when the body is dissolved;
        when the body is restored in the resurrection, it is returned to the
        same being which persisted in the soul.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [12] The fourth objection, also, fails to remove the unity of the one
        who rises. For what is no obstacle to a man’s numerical unity while he
        continues to live manifestly cannot be an obstacle to the unity of one
        who rises. But in the body of man, so long as he is alive, it is not
        with respect to matter that he has the same parts, but with respect to
        his species. In respect to matter, of course, the parts are in flux, but
        this is not an obstacle to his being numerically one from the beginning
        of his life to the end of it. An example of this can be taken from fire:
        While it continues to bum, it is called numerically one because its
        species persists, yet wood is consumed and -new wood is applied. It is
        also like this in the human body, for the form and species of its single
        parts remain continuously through a whole life; the matter of the parts
        is not only resolved by the action of the natural heat, but is
        replenished anew by nourishment. Man is not, therefore, numerically
        different according to his different ages, although not everything which
        is in him materially in one state is also there in another. In this way,
        then, this is not a requirement of man’s arising with numerical
        identity: that he should assume again whatever has been in him during
        the whole time of his life; but he need assume from that matter only
        what suffices to complete the quantity due, and that especially must be
        resumed which was more perfectly consistent with the form and species of
        humanity. But, if something was wanting to the fulfillment of the
        quantity due, either because one was overtaken by death before nature
        could bring him to the quantity due or because mutilation perhaps
        deprived him of so-me member, the divine power will supply this from
        another source. This, however, will be no obstacle to the unity of the
        body of the one rising, for even the work of nature adds to what a boy
        has from some other source to bring him to his perfect quantity. And
        this addition does not make him numerically other, for the man is the
        same in number whether he is boy or adult.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [13] From this it is clear, also, that there is no obstacle to faith in
        the resurrection—even in the fact that some men eat human flesh, as the
        fifth objection was maintaining. For it is not necessary, as has just
        been shown, that whatever has been in man materially rise in him;
        further, if something is lacking, it can be supplied by the power of
        God. Therefore, the flesh consumed will rise in him in whom it was first
        perfected by the rational soul. But in the second man, if he ate not
        only human flesh, but other food as well, only that will rise in him
        which came to him materially from the other food, and which will be
        necessary to restore the quantity due his body. But if he ate human
        flesh only, what rises in him will be that which he drew from those who
        generated him, and what is wanting will be supplied by the Creator’s
        omnipotence. But let it be that the parents, too, have eaten only human
        flesh, and that as a result their seed—which is the superfluity of
        nourishment—has been generated from the flesh of others; the seed,
        indeed, will rise in him who was generated from the seed, and in its
        place there will be supplied in him whose flesh was eaten something from
        another source. For in the resurrection this situation will obtain: If
        something was materially present in many men, it will rise in him to
        whose perfection it belonged more intimately. Accordingly, if something
        was in one man as the radical seed from which he was generated, and in
        another as the superfluity of nourishment, it will rise in him who was
        generated therefrom as from seed. If something was in one as pertinent
        to the perfection of the individual, but in another as assigned to the
        perfection of the species, it will rise in him to whom it belonged as
        perfection of the individual. Accordingly, seed will arise in the
        begotten, not in his generator; the rib of Adam will arise in Eve, not
        in Adam in whom it was present as in a principle of nature. But, if
        something was in both in the same degree of perfection, it will rise in
        him in whom it was the first time.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [14] Now, however, what is said in the sixth objection can be answered
        from what has been said. Resurrection is natural if one considers its
        purpose, for it is natural that the soul be united to the body. But the
        principle of resurrection is not natural. It is caused by the divine
        power alone.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [15] Nor must one deny that there will be a resurrection of all,
        although not all cleave to Christ by faith, and are not imbued with His
        mysteries. For the Son of God assumed human nature to restore it.
        Therefore, what is a defect of nature will be restored in all, and so
        all will return from)death to life. But the failure of the person will
        not be restored except in those who have adhered to Christ; either by
        their own act, believing in Him; or at least through the sacrament of
        faith.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From this it is clear, also, that in the resurrection to come men
        will not so rise that they are to die again.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] For the necessity of dying is a deficiency brought upon human nature
        by sin. But Christ, by the merit of His passion, repaired the
        deficiencies of nature which sin had brought upon nature. For, as the
        Apostle says: “Not as the offence, so also the gift. For if by the
        offence many died, much more the grace of God, and the gift, by the
        grace of one man, Jesus Christ, has abounded unto many” (Rom. 5:15).
        From this one gathers that the merit of ‘Christ is more effective for
        removing death than the sin of Adam for introducing it. Therefore, those
        who will rise by the merit of Christ, freed from death, will suffer
        death no more.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Furthermore, that which is to last forever has not been destroyed.
        Therefore, if the men who rise will still die again so that death lasts
        forever, in the death of Christ death has by no means been destroyed.
        But it is destroyed: right now in its cause, as the Lord had foretold in
        Hosea (13:14): “O death, I will be your death”; at the end it will be
        actually destroyed, according to the word: “The enemy death shall be
        destroyed last” (1 Cor. 15:26). One must, then, hold with the faith of
        the Church that those who rise will not die again.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] An effect, moreover, is likened to its cause. But the resurrection
        of Christ is the cause of the future resurrection, as was said. But
        Christ so rose from the dead as to die no longer, in the Apostle’s
        words: “Christ rising again from the dead dies now no more” (Rom. 6:9).
        Therefore, men will so rise as to die no longer.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Moreover, if the men who rise are to die a second time, they will
        either rise again from that second death or they will not. If they do
        not rise, they will remain forever as separated souls-and this is
        awkward, as was said above In fact, to avoid this awkwardness, they were
        held to rise the first time; in other words, if after the second death
        they are not going to rise, there will be no argument for their rising
        after the first death. On the other hand, if after the second death they
        do rise again, they will either rise to die again or they will not. If
        they are not to die again, the same reasoning will have to hold for the
        first resurrection. But, if they are to die again, the alternation of
        death and life in the same subject goes on to infinity-and this seems
        awkward, for the intention of God ought to have a determinate term. But
        the successive alternation of life and death is a kind of changing back
        and forth, so to say, and this cannot be an end, for it is essentially
        contrary to motion that it be an end; every motion tends toward another.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] There is more. In action, the intention of an inferior nature bears
        on perpetuity. For every action of an inferior nature is ordered to
        generation, and its very end is safeguarding the perpetual being of the
        species; wherefore, nature does not intend this individual as ultimate
        end, but the conservation in him of the species. And nature has this
        end, in that it acts by the power of God who is the first root of
        perpetuity. Hence, even the end of generation is held by the Philosopher
        [ <i>De gen. et corr.</i> II, 10] to be this: that the generated share
        in the divine being by perpetuity. All the more, then, does the action
        of God Himself tend to something perpetual. But the resurrection is not
        ordered to the perpetuity of the species, for this could be safeguarded
        by generation. It must, then, be ordered to the perpetuity of the
        individual: but not in the soul alone, for the soul already had
        perpetuity before the resurrection; therefore, in the composite. Man
        rising, therefore, will live forever.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Again, the soul and body appear to be related in a different order
        in the first generation of man and in his resurrection. Now, in the
        first generation the creation of the soul follows the generation of the
        body, for, when the bodily matter is prepared by the power of the
        separated seed, God infuses the soul by an act of creation. But in the
        resurrection the body is adapted to the pre-existing soul. Of course,
        that first life which man acquires by generation follows the condition
        of the corruptible body in this: man is deprived of that life by death.
        Then, the life which man acquires by resurrection will be perpetual
        according to the condition of the incorruptible soul.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] Again, if life and death succeed one another to infinity in the same
        subject, the alternation of life and death will in species be a kind of
        circular motion. But every circular motion in generable and corruptible
        things is caused by the first circular motion of the incorruptible
        bodies. For the first circular motion is found in local motion, and in
        its likeness is transferred to other motions. The alternation of death
        and life, therefore, will be caused by a celestial body. And this cannot
        be, because the restoration of a dead body to life is beyond the
        capacities of an action of nature. Therefore, that there is such
        alternation of life and death cannot be asserted, and, consequently,
        that the bodies which rise may die.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] Furthermore, whenever things succeed one another in the same subject
        they have a fixed measure of their duration in time. Everything of this
        kind is subject to the celestial motion on which time follows. But the
        separated soul is not subject to the celestial, for it exceeds the whole
        of bodily nature Therefore, an alternation of its separation from the
        body and union to it is not subject to celestial motion. Therefore,
        there is no circular motion in the alternation of death and life such as
        that which follows if those who rise are to die again. They will rise,
        then, never again to die.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] Hence, we read in Isaiah (25:8): “The Lord shall cast death down
        headlong forever”; and in the Apocalypse (21:4): “Death shall be no
        more.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] Thus, of course, one avoids the error of certain ancient Gentiles,
        who used to hold that “the same periods and events of time are repeated;
        as if, for example, the philosopher Plato having taught at the school in
        Athens which is called the Academy, so numberless ages before, at long
        but certain intervals, this same Plato and the same school, and the same
        disciples existed, and so also are to be repeated during the endless
        cycles yet to come”; so Augustine describes the position in the City of
        God. To this position, so he himself tells us in the same place, some
        like to refer the words of Ecclesiastes (1:9-10): “What is it that has
        been? The same thing that shall be. What is it that has been done? The
        same thing that shall be done. Nothing under the sun is new, neither is
        any man able to say: Behold this is new: for it has already gone before
        in the ages that were before us.” This is not, indeed, to be understood
        as though things numerically the same are repeated through various
        generations, but things similar in species. So Augustine explains in the
        same place. And Aristotle at the end of <i>De generatione</i> [II, 11],
        taught the same thing, speaking against the group mentioned.

        food to avoid the corruption which can follow on the consumption of

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Again, the life of those who rise will not be less ordered than the
        present life, but better ordered. For man will reach that life only
        through God’s action, but he leads this life with nature co-operating.
        In this life the use of food is ordered to an end, for one takes food to
        convert it into the body by digestion. If, then, there is to be food at
        that time, it will be for the purpose of converting it into the body.
        Therefore, since nothing will be resolved from the body, because it will
        be an incorruptible body, we will have to say that everything converted
        into the body from nourishment must be devoted to its growth. However,
        man will rise in his due quantify, as was said above. Therefore, he will
        achieve a size beyond moderation, for an immoderate size is that which
        exceeds the quantity due.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] The man who rises, furthermore, will live forever. Therefore, either
        he will use food always, or not always but during a fixed time. But let
        him use food always: since the food will be converted into a body in
        which no dissolution takes place, it necessarily will cause an increase
        in some dimension and we will have to say that the body of the man who
        rises will be increased to infinity. And this cannot be, because
        increase is a natural motion and the intention of a natural moving power
        is never infinity, but is always something fixed. For, as the
        <i>De anima</i> [II, 4] says, “in everything established by nature there
        is a term of size and increase.” If the man who rises will not always
        use food, but will always live, one must grant a time in which he does
        not use food. Accordingly, this must be done from the beginning.
        Therefore, the man who rises will not use food.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] But if he will not use food, it follows that neither will he have
        sexual union for which the separation of the seed is required. Of
        course, the seed will not be separable from the body of the one who
        rises, nor from his substance. There is this reason: It is contrary to
        the seed in its essentials, for it would be seed as corrupted and as
        withdrawing from nature, and so it could not be the principle of a
        natural action, which the Philosopher makes clear in his
        <i>De generatione animalium</i> [I, 18]. And there is this reason as
        well: Out of the substance of those existing incorruptible bodies
        nothing will be able to be resolved. Finally, the seed cannot be the
        superfluity of nutriment if those who rise do not use food, as was
        shown. Therefore, among those who rise there will be no sexual union.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Again, sexual union is ordered to generation. If, then, after the
        resurrection there is to be sexual union, it follows—unless it is to be
        in vain—that there will be human generation then just as there is now.
        Therefore, there will be many men after the resurrection who were not
        before the resurrection. In vain, then, does the resurrection effect
        this great difference: that all who have the same nature receive life at
        the same time.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] And again, if after the resurrection there is to be human
        generation, those who are generated will either be once again corrupted
        or they will be incorruptible and immortal. But, if they are to be
        incorruptible and immortal, the awkward consequences are many. First,
        indeed, one will have to hold that those men are born without original
        sin, since the necessity of dying is a punishment that follows on
        original sin. This is contrary to the Apostle’s word: “By one man came
        sin to all and by sin death” (Rom. 5:12). Next, it follows that not all
        would require the redemption which is from Christ, and so Christ will
        not be the bead of all men. And this is contrary to the Apostle’s
        teaching: “As in Adam all die so also in Christ all will live again” (1
        Cor. 15:22). There would also be this awkward result: Men whose
        generation is the same would not have the same term of generation, for
        by generation from seed they achieve a corruptible life now, but then
        they would achieve an immortal one. Allow, on the other hand, that the
        men who will then be born will be corruptible and will die: if they do
        not rise again, it will follow that their souls will remain forever
        separated from their bodies. And this is awkward, since they are of the
        same species as the souls of the men who do rise. But if they, too, are
        to rise, their resurrection has to be waited for, by the others, that
        all who share the same nature may simultaneously receive that benefit of
        resurrection which is proper to the restoration of that nature (as is
        clear from what has been said). And, what is more, there does not seem
        to be a reason for waiting for the simultaneous resurrection of some, if
        one does not wait for the resurrection of all.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] Again, if the men who rise will use sexual union and generate, this
        will always take place or it will not always take place. If it always
        takes place, the multiplication of men will go on to infinity. The
        intention of the generating nature after the resurrection cannot be for
        any other end than the multiplication of men; it will not be for the
        conservation of the species by generation, since men are going to live
        incorruptibly. It will follow, therefore, that the intention of the
        generating nature is infinity; and this is impossible. But, if they do
        not generate always, but only for a fixed time, they will not generate
        after that time. For this reason one should attribute to them right from
        the start no use of sexual union and no generation.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] Now, let one say that in those who rise there will be eating and
        sexual union, not for the preservation and growth of the body, nor for
        the preservation of the species and multiplication of men, but simply
        for the pleasure which there is in these acts, so that no pleasure will
        be lacking in man’s final reward: in many ways, indeed, is it clear that
        such is an awkward position.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] The first reason is this: The life of those who rise will be better
        ordered than our life, as was said above. But in the present life it is
        a disordered and vicious thing to use food and sexual union for mere
        pleasure and not for the necessity of sustaining life and begetting
        offspring. And this is reasonable, for the pleasures which are in the
        activities mentioned are not the ends of those activities. It is,
        rather, the converse, for nature ordered the pleasure of those acts for
        this reason: lest the animals, in view of the labor, desist from those
        acts necessary to nature, which is what would happen if they were not
        stimulated by pleasure. Therefore, the order is reversed and
        inharmonious if those operations are carried out merely for pleasure. By
        no means, therefore, will such a thing be found among those who rise;
        their life is held to be one of perfect order.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] The life of the risen, moreover, is ordered to the preservation of
        perfect beatitude. But the beatitude and felicity of man do not consist
        in bodily pleasures, and such am the pleasures of eating and of sexual
        union as was shown. in Book III. One should not, therefore, hold that
        there are pleasures of this kind in the life of those who rise.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [12] Furthermore, the acts of the virtues are ordered to beatitude as to
        an end. If, then, in the state of beatitude to come there be the
        pleasures of eating and sexual love, as constituents, so to say, of this
        beatitude, it would follow that in the intention of those who perform
        virtuous acts the pleasures mentioned are somehow or other present. And
        this excludes temperance by essence, for it is contrary to the essence
        of temperance that one abstain now from pleasures to become able to
        enjoy them the more later on. This would, therefore render all chastity
        wanton, and all abstinence gluttonous. But allow that the pleasures
        mentioned are to be, and are, nonetheless, not to be as constituents, so
        to say, of beatitude, so that they are in the intentions of those who
        act virtuously: even this cannot be. For whatever is, is for another or
        for itself. But the pleasures mentioned are not for another; they are
        not for the actions ordered to the end of nature, as was already shown.
        It follows, then, that they are for themselves. But everything like this
        is either beatitude or a part of beatitude. Therefore, if the pleasures
        mentioned are to be in the life of those who rise, it must be that they
        belong to its beatitude.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        And this cannot be, as was shown.” There is, then, no way for pleasures
        of this kind to be in the future life.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [13] There is more. It seems ridiculous to search for. bodily pleasures
        which the brute animals share with us there where the loftiest pleasures
        which we share with the angels are expected—the pleasures in the vision
        of God which will be common to us and the angels, as was shown in Book
        III. Unless, perhaps, someone wants to say that the beatitude of the
        angels is imperfect because the angels lack the pleasures of the
        brutes—which is completely absurd. Pertinent to this is our Lord’s
        saying in Matthew (22:30), that “in the resurrection they shall neither
        marry nor be married, but shall be as the angels of God.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [14] By this, of course, one avoids the error of the Jews and of the
        Saracens, who hold that in the resurrection men will have use for food
        and sexual pleasure as they do now. And even certain Christian heretics
        have followed them; they hold that there will be on earth for a thousand
        years an earthly kingdom of Christ, and in that space of time “they
        assert that those who rise again shall enjoy the leisure of immoderate
        carnal banquets, furnished with an amount of meat and drink such as not
        only to shock the feeling of the temperate, but even to surpass the
        measure of credulity itself, such assertions can be believed only by the
        carnal. Those who do believe them are called by the spiritual Chiliasts,
        a Greek word, which we may literally reproduce by the name
        Millenarians”; so Augustine says in the <i>City of God</i> [XX, 7, 1].
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [15] Some points, however, seem to favor this opinion. First, indeed,
        there is this: Before his sin Adam had an immortal life; nevertheless,
        eating and sexual love were in his power while in that state, for before
        his sin he was told: “Increase and multiply” and “Of every tree of
        paradise thou shalt eat” (Gen. 1:28; 2:16).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [16] Again, one reads of Christ Himself that He ate and drank after His
        resurrection. For Luke (24:43) says that “when He had eaten before them,
        taking the remains, He gaw to them.” And in Acts (10:40-41) Peter says:
        “Him,” namely Jesus, “God raised up the third day, and gave Him to be
        made manifest, not to all the people but to witnesses preordained by
        God, even to us, who did eat and drink with Him after He arose again
        from the dead.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [17] There are also some authorities which seem to promise men the use
        of food in the state of which we speak. For Isaiah (25:6, 8) says: “The
        Lord of hosts shall make unto all people in this mountain a feast of fat
        things full of marrow, of wine purified from the lees.” And we are to
        understand this of the state of those who rise, as is clear from the
        addition: “He shall cast death down for ever: And the Lord God shall
        wipe away tears from every face.” Isaiah (65:13, 17) also says: “Behold
        my servants shall eat, and you shall be hungry; behold, my servants
        shall drink, and you shall be thirsty.” And that this refers to the
        future life is clear from the addition: “Behold, I create new heavens
        and a new earth,” and so forth. Our Lord also says: “I will not drink
        from henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when I shall
        drink it with you new in the kingdom of My Father” (Matt. 26:29); and He
        says in Luke (22:29-30): “I dispose to you as My Father hath disposed to
        Me, a kingdom; that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom.”
        And we read in the Apocalypse (22:4) that “on both sides of the river”
        which will be in the City of the Blessed, there will be “the tree of
        life bearing twelve fruits.” It also says: “I saw... the souls of them
        that were beheaded for the testimony of Jesus... and they lived and
        reigned with Christ a thousand years” (Apoc. 20:4-5). From all of which
        the opinion of the heretics mentioned seems to be confirmed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [18] But the solution of these points is not difficult. The first
        objection, about Adam, is not effective. For Adam did have a certain
        personal perfection, but human nature was not yet perfected when the
        human race was not yet multiplied. Adam, therefore, was established in
        the kind of perfection which suited the first source of the entire human
        race. Accordingly, he had to generate for the multiplication of the
        human race, and consequently had to take food. But the perfection of
        those who rise will be at a time when human nature is arriving at the
        fullness of its perfection and the number of the elect is already
        complete. Accordingly, generation will have no place, and neither will
        the use of food. For this reason the immortality and incorruption of
        those who rise will be of one kind; those which were in Adam were of
        another. For those who rise will be immortal and incorruptible in such
        wise that they cannot die; nor can any dissolution take place within
        their bodies. Adam, however, was immortal thus: he could not die if he
        did not sin; and be could die if he did sin. And the preservation of his
        immortality could take place not by the exclusion of dissolution within
        the body; rather, it could be helped by preventing loss of the natural
        moisture through the assumption of food, lest his body arrive at
        corruption.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [19] With regard to Christ, however, we ought to say that He ate after
        the resurrection not out of necessity, but to establish the truth of His
        resurrection. Hence, that food of His was not changed into flesh, but
        returned to the prior material state. But there will be no such reason
        for eating in the general resurrection.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [20] Now, as for the authorities which appear to promise the use of food
        after the resurrection: one must understand them spiritually. For divine
        Scripture proposes intelligible things to us in the likeness of sensible
        things, “so that the soul from what it knows may learn to love the
        things it knows not.” And in this fashion the pleasure of contemplation
        of wisdom and the assumption of the intelligible truth into our
        intellect is customarily indicated in sacred Scripture as the use of
        food; the saying of Proverbs (9:2, 4-5), for example, about wisdom: “She
        has mingled her wine and set forth her table... And to the unwise she
        said: Come, eat my bread and drink the wine I have mingled for you”; and
        Sirach (15:3): “With the bread of life and understanding, she shall feed
        him, and give him the water of wholesome wisdom to drink.” And of the
        same wisdom we read in Proverbs (3:18): “She is a tree of life to those
        who lay hold of her: and he who retains her is blessed.” Therefore, the
        authorities mentioned above do not require us to say that those who rise
        will make use of food.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [21] Of course, the words of our Lord in Matthew (26:29) can be
        understood in another sense. Thus, they can refer to the fact that He
        ate with His disciples after His resurrection and actually drank new
        wine, that is, “newly” namely not out of necessity, but as proof of His
        resurrection. He then says “in the kingdom of My Father” because in the
        resurrection of Christ there is a demonstrable beginning of the kingdom
        of immortality.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [22] Now, the saying of the Apocalypse (22:2) about “the thousand years”
        and the “first resurrection of the martyrs” must be understood of that
        first resurrection of souls from their sins, of which the Apostle says:
        “Arise from the dead and Christ shall enlighten you” (Eph. 5:14). And by
        the thousand years one understands the whole time of the Church in which
        the martyrs as well as the other saints reign with Christ, both in the
        present Church which is called the kingdom of God, and also—as far as
        souls are concerned—in the heavenly country: for “the thousand” means
        perfection, since it is the cube whose root is ten, which also usually
        signifies perfection.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [23] Thus, then, it becomes clear that those who rise will not spend
        their time eating and drinking and in acts of sexual union.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [24] From this one can see, finally, that all the business of the active
        life—it seems ordered to the use of food, to sexual activity, to the
        other necessities of the corruptible life—will come to a halt.
        Therefore, only the occupation of the contemplative life will persist in
        the resurrection. This is the reason one reads in Luke (10:42) of Mary’s
        contemplation that she “has chosen the best part which shall not be
        taken away from her.” Hence, too, we read in Job (7:9-10): “He that
        shall go down to hell shall not come up. Nor shall be return any more
        into his house, neither shall his place know him any more.” In these
        words Job is denying the kind of resurrection some have asserted who
        said that after the resurrection a man will return to the kind of
        business he has now: to building houses, fm example, and carrying on
        other duties of this kind.

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] For some, of course, the points mentioned have been an occasion of
        error about the conditions of those who rise. For there were some who
        held that, since a body composed of contraries seems necessarily subject
        to corruption, those who rise do not have bodies composed of contraries
        in this way.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Some among these held that our bodies do not rise in a bodily
        nature, but are changed into spirit. They were moved by what the Apostle
        says: “It is sown a natural body; it shall rise a spiritual body” (1
        Cor. 15:44). But others were moved by the same words to say that our
        bodies in the resurrection would be subtle bodies, similar to the air
        and the winds. For air is called a “spiration”, so that airy things may
        be called “spiritual.” But others said that in the resurrection the
        souls will assume bodies: not earthly ones, to be sure, but heavenly.
        Their occasion is this word of the Apostle speaking of the resurrection:
        “There are bodies celestial and bodies terrestrial.” And all this seems
        supported by what the Apostle says in the same place: “Flesh and blood
        cannot possess the kingdom of Cod” (1 Cor. 15:40, 50). It thus appears
        that the bodies of those who rise will not have flesh and blood and,
        consequently, no other humors.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] But the error of these opinions is quite evident. For our
        resurrection will conform to the resurrection of Christ, as the Apostle
        has it: “He will reform the body of our lowness, made like to the body
        of His glory” (Phil. 3:21). After His resurrection, of course, Christ
        had a body one could touch, constituted of flesh and bones, because
        after His resurrection—so we read in Luke (24:39)—He said to the
        disciples: “Handle and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as you
        see me to have.” Therefore, when other men rise, they will have bodies
        one can handle, composed of flesh and bones.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] The soul is, furthermore, united to the body as form to matter. Of
        course, every form has its determined matter, for there must be
        proportion between act and potency. Since, therefore, the soul is the
        same in species, it appears that its matter must be the same in species.
        Therefore, the body will be the same in species after the resurrection
        as before. And so it has to consist of flesh and bones and other parts
        of this kind.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Again, in the definition of a natural thing which signifies the
        essence of the species, one includes the matter; necessarily, then,
        whenever the matter is varied in species, the species of the natural
        thing is varied. But man is a natural thing. If, therefore, after the
        resurrection he is not to have a body consisting of flesh and bones and
        parts of this kind as he has now, he who rises will not belong to the
        same species, but will be called man only equivocally.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] There is, moreover, a greater differentiation between the soul of a
        man and a body of some other species than there is between one human
        body and that of another man. But no soul can be united in turn to the
        body of a second man, as was shown in Book II. Much less, then, will it
        be able in the resurrection to be united to a body of another species.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] There is more. For a man to rise with numerical identity there must
        also be numerical identity in his essential parts. Therefore, if the
        body of the man who rises is not to be composed of the flesh and bones
        which now compose it, the man who rises will not be numerically the same
        man.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] But all these false opinions are most clearly rejected by the words
        of Job (19:26-27) who says: “Once again I shall be clothed with my skin,
        and in my flesh I shall see my God. Whom I myself shall see and not
        another.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] Of course, each of the opinions mentioned has its own awkward
        consequence.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] For to hold that a body changes into a spirit is altogether
        impossible. Things do not change into one another unless they have
        matter in common. But spiritual things and bodily things can have no
        communication by matter, because spiritual substances are entirely
        immaterial, as was shown in Book II. Therefore, it is impossible that
        the human body is changed into a spiritual substance.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [11] Again, if the human body is changed into a spiritual substance, it
        will be changed either into the same spiritual substance which the soul
        is or into some other. But, if it is into the soul itself, then after
        the resurrection there would be in a man only his soul, just as there
        was before the resurrection. Therefore, the condition of man would not
        be altered by the resurrection. But, if the body is to be changed into
        another spiritual substance, it will follow that from two spiritual
        substances some unit in nature is effected. And this is entirely
        impossible, for every spiritual substance subsists of itself.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [12] In like fashion, it is impossible that the body of man who rises be
        like air and kindred to winds.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [13] For the body of man and of any animal must have a determined figure
        both in the whole and in the parts. But a body which has a determinate
        figure must be terminable of itself, for figure is that which is
        comprised by a term or terms. Air, however, is not terminable in itself,
        but is terminated only by the term of something else. It is, therefore,
        not possible that the body of man when he rises be like the air or the
        winds.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [14] There is more. The body of man when he rises must have the capacity
        to touch, for without touch there is no animal. But that which rises
        must be animal if it is to be man. But an aerial body can have no
        capacity for touch, just as no simple body can, for the body in which
        the touch sensation takes place must be midway between the tangible
        qualities so as to be in potency to them, as the Philosopher prom in
        <i>De anima</i> [II, 11]. It is impossible, then, that the body of man
        who rises be like the air or the winds.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [15] From this it is also apparent that it will not be able to be a
        celestial body.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [16] For the body of manor of any animal must be receptive to tangible
        qualities, as was just said. But so to be is impossible for a celestial
        body which is not hot or cold, nor wet or dry, nor anything else of the
        sort, whether actually or potentially, as the Philosopher proves in
        <i>De caelo</i> [I, 3]. Therefore, the body of the man who rises will
        not be a celestial body.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [17] Celestial bodies, moreover, are incorruptible and cannot be changed
        from their natural disposition. But the figure due to them naturally is
        the spherical, as the Philosopher proves. It is not possible, then, for
        them to receive the figure which is naturally due to the human body. It
        is, then, impossible that the bodies of the risen be in nature those of
        celestial bodies.

          >THAT THE BODIES OF THE RISEN WILL HAVE ANOTHER DISPOSITION</span
        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Although the bodies of the risen are to be the same in species as
        our bodies are now, they will have a different disposition.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] First, to be sure, in this respect: All the bodies of those who
        rise, both the good and the evil, will be incorruptible.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] And the reason for this is threefold.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] One reason is taken from the very purpose of the resurrection. For
        both the good and the evil will rise for this: that in their very own
        bodies they may receive their reward or their punishment for the deeds
        they performed while they lived in the body. But the reward of the good,
        felicity, that is, will be everlasting; in like fashion, too,
        everlasting punishment is due to mortal sin. Each of these points was
        established in Book III. Necessarily, then, in each case an
        incorruptible body must be assumed.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] The second reason is taken from the formal cause of those who rise
        which is the soul. We said above that, lest the soul remain forever
        separated from the body after the resurrection, the soul will once again
        assume the body. Since, then, this reception of the body is provided for
        the perfection of the soul, it is suitable that the disposition of the
        body be proportioned to that of the soul. But the soul is incorruptible.
        Hence, the body restored to the soul will be incorruptible.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] The third reason can be found in the active cause of the
        resurrection. For God, who will restore the already corrupted bodies to
        life, will be able to grant this so much more firmly by preserving
        forever the life regained in them. And by way of example of this, when
        He chose He preserved even corruptible bodies from corruption unharmed,
        as He did the bodies of the three youths in the fiery furnace (see
        Daniel 3:93-94).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Thus, then, must one understand the incorruptibility of the state to
        come: that this body, corruptible now,, will be made incorruptible by
        the divine power, so that the soul will have perfect dominion over the
        body in the course of vivifying the body; nor will this communication of
        life be subject to any obstacle at all. Hence, also, the Apostle says:
        “This corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on
        immortality” (1 Cor. 15:53).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] Therefore, man when he rises will be immortal, not for this reason:
        he has assumed another body which is incorruptible (as the opinions
        mentioned held); but for this reason: This same body which now is
        corruptible will become incorruptible.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] One must, therefore, understand the Apostle’s saying”Flesh and blood
        cannot possess the kingdom of God” (I Cor. 15:50)—in this way: that the
        corruption of flesh and blood will be taken away in the state of the
        resurrection, while the substance of flesh and blood nevertheless
        persists. Hence, he adds: “neither shall corruption possess
        incorruption.”

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] Grant, of course, that in the resurrection the merit of Christ does
        remove the deficiency of nature commonly from all men—from both the good
        and the evil; nonetheless, a difference will persist between the good
        and the evil in respect to what is suitable to each group personally.
        Now, it is an essential of nature that the human soul is the form of the
        body which vivifies the body and preserves it in being, but by its
        personal acts the soul merits to be elevated to the glory of the divine
        vision or to be excluded from the order of that glory by reason of its
        sin. The body, then, will be commonly disposed in all men in harmony
        with the soul, with this result: The incorruptible form bestows an
        incorruptible being on the body in spite of its composition from
        contraries, because in respect to corruption the matter of the human
        body will be entirely subject to the human soul. But the glory and power
        of the soul elevated to the divine vision will add something more ample
        to the body united to itself. For this body will be entirely subject to
        the soul—the divine power will achieve this—not only in regard to its
        being, but also in regard to action, passion, movements, and bodily
        qualities.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Therefore, just as the soul which enjoys the divine vision will be
        filled with a kind of spiritual lightsomeness, so by a certain overflow
        from the soul to the body, the body will in its own way put on the
        lightsomeness of glory. Hence, the Apostle says: “It is sown in
        dishonor. It shall rise in glory” (1 Cor. 15:43); for our body is dark
        now, but then it will be lightsome; as Matthew (13:43) has it: “The just
        shall shine as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Moreover, the soul which will enjoy the divine vision, united to its
        ultimate end, will in all matters experience the fulfillment of desire.
        And since it is out of the soul’s desire that the body is moved, the
        consequence will be the body’s utter obedience to the spirit’s slightest
        wish. Hence, the bodies of the blessed when they rise are going to have
        agility. This is what the Apostle says in the same place: “It is sown in
        weakness, it shall rise in power.” For weakness is what we experience in
        a body found wanting in the strength to satisfy the desire of the soul
        in the movements and actions which the soul commands, and this weakness
        will be entirely taken away then, when. power is overflowing into the
        body from a soul united to God. For this reason, also, Wisdom (3:7) says
        that the just “shall run to and fro like sparks among the reeds”; this
        is not said because there is motion in them by reason of necessity—since
        they who have God want nothing—but as an indication of their power.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Of course, just as the soul which enjoys God will have its desire
        fulfilled in the achievement of every good, so also will its desire be
        filled in the removal of every evil, for with the highest good no evil
        has a place. Therefore, the body perfected by the soul will be,
        proportionally to the soul, immune from every evil, both in regard to
        act and in regard to potency. This will be actually so, indeed, because
        there will not be in them any corruption, any deformity, any deficiency.
        It will be potentially so, however, because they will not be able to
        suffer anything which is harmful to them. For this reason they will be
        incapable of suffering. Nonetheless, this incapability of suffering will
        not cut them off from the modification essential to sense knowledge, for
        they will use their senses for pleasure in the measure in which this is
        not incompatible with their state of incorruption. It is, then, to show
        their incapacity for suffering that the Apostle says: “It is sown in
        corruption, it shall rise in incorruption” (1 Cor. 15:42).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Furthermore, the soul which is enjoying God will cleave to Him most
        perfectly, and will in its own fashion share in His goodness to the
        highest degree; and thus will the body be perfectly within the soul’s
        dominion, and will share in what is the soul’s very own characteristics
        so far as possible, in the perspicuity of sense knowledge, in the
        ordering of bodily appetite, and in the all-round perfection of nature;
        for a thing is the more perfect in nature, the more its matter is
        dominated by its form. And for this reason the Apostle says: “It is sown
        a natural body, it shall rise a spiritual body” (1 Cor. 15:44) The body
        of the risen will be spiritual, indeed, but not because it is a
        spirit—as some have badly understood the point—whether in the sense of a
        spiritual substance, or in the sense of air or wind; it will be
        spiritual because it will be entirely subject to the spirit. just so,
        the Apostle calls it now an “animal body,” not because it is a soul, but
        because it is subject to animal passions and requires nourishment.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] This, then, is clear from the points now made: Just as the soul of
        man will be elevated to the glory of heavenly spirits to see God in His
        essence, as was shown in Book III, so also will his body be raised up to
        the characteristics of heavenly bodies: it will be lightsome, incapable
        of suffering, without difficulty and labor in movement, and most
        perfectly perfected by its form. For this reason the Apostle speaks of
        the bodies of the risen as heavenly, referring not to their nature, but
        to their glory. Hence, after he had said that “there are bodies
        celestial and bodies terrestrial,” he added: “one is the glory of the
        celestial, and another of the terrestrial” (1 Cor. 15:40). just as, of
        course, the glory to which the human soul is exalted exceeds the natural
        power of the heavenly spirits, as was shown in Book III, so does the
        glory of the risen bodies exceed the natural perfection of the heavenly
        bodies so as to have a greater lightsomeness, a more stable incapacity
        for suffering, an easier agility, and a more perfect worthiness of
        nature.

        [1] Now, because place must be in proportion to that which is in place,
        there is this consequence: Since the bodies of the risen will achieve
        the characteristics of heavenly bodies, they, too, will have a place in
        the heavens, or, rather, “above all the heavens,” so as to be at once
        with Christ, whose power will lead them to this glory. The Apostle says
        of Him: “He ascended above all the heavens that He might fill all
        things” (Eph. 4:10).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] It seems frivolity, of course, to make an argument against this
        divine promise out of the natural position of the elements, alleging the
        impossibility of elevating the body of man, since it is earthly and by
        its nature holds the lowest place, to a place above the lighter
        elements. For, manifestly, by the power of the soul the body which it
        perfects need not follow the inclinations of the elements. For even now,
        by its power, so long as we live the soul holds the body together lest
        it be dissolved by the contrariety of the elements; and also by the
        power of the soul to move the body is raised high; and it will be raised
        the more fully, as the motive power will have the greater strength. But,
        manifestly, it will be then a soul of perfect power when it will be
        united to God by vision. Therefore, it ought not be looked on as
        difficult if the body be then preserved by the power of the soul immune
        from every corruption and be lifted up above every body whatever.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Neither does this divine promise meet an impossibility in the
        assertion that celestial bodies are unbreakable so the glorious bodies
        may not be elevated above them. For the divine power will bring it about
        that the glorious bodies can be simultaneously where the other bodies
        are; an indication of this was given in the body of Christ when He came
        to the disciples, “the doors being shut” (John 20:26).

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] One ought, nevertheless, not bold that among the bodies,of the risen
        the feminine sex will be absent, as some have thought. For, since the
        resurrection is to restore the deficiencies of nature, nothing that
        belongs to the perfection of nature will be denied to the bodies of the
        risen. Of course, just as other bodily members belong to the integrity
        of the human body, so do those which serve for generation—not only in
        men but also in women. Therefore, in each of the cases members of this
        sort will rise.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Neither is this opposed by the fact that there will be no use for
        those members, as was shown above. For, if for this reason such members
        are not to be in the risen, for an equal reason there would be no
        members which serve nutrition in the risen, because neither will there
        be use of food after the resurrection. Thus, then, a large portion of
        the members would be wanting in the body of the risen. They will, them,
        fore, have all the members of this sort, even though there be no use for
        them, to re-establish the integrity of the natural body. Hence, they
        will not be in vain.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] In like fashion, also, the frailty of the feminine sex is not in
        opposition to the perfection of the risen. For this frailty is not due
        to a shortcoming of nature, but to an intention of nature. And this very
        distinction of nature among human beings will point out the perfection
        of nature and the divine wisdom as well, which disposes all things in a
        certain order.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Nor is this position forced on us by the words of the Apostle:
        “Until we all meet into the unity of faith, and of knowledge of the Son
        of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the age of the fulness
        of Christ” (Eph. 4:13). For he did not say this because everyone in that
        meeting when the risen shall go forth “to meet Christ into the air” (1
        Thes. 4:16) will have the male sex. He said it to point out the
        perfection of the Church and its power. For the whole Church when
        meeting Christ will be like a perfect man,—as is clear from the words
        which precede and follow.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] But all must rise in the age of Christ, which is that of youth, by
        reason of the perfection of nature which is found in that age alone. For
        the age of boyhood has not yet achieved the perfection of nature through
        increase; and by decrease old age has already withdrawn from that
        perfection.

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From these points one can, of course, reasonably consider what sort
        of condition there will be in the risen bodies of those to be damned.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] For those bodies, too, must be proportioned to the souls of those to
        be damned. Of course, the souls of the wicked have a good nature,
        indeed, since it is created by God, but they will have a disordered will
        which will be failing its very own end. Their bodies, then, so far as
        nature is concerned, will be restored to integrity; because, as one can
        see, they will rise in the perfection of age, without any members
        diminished, without any deficiency or corruption which the error or the
        weakness of nature has introduced. Hence, the Apostle says: “The dead
        shall rise again incorruptible” (1 Cor. 15-52); and clearly this ought
        to be understood of all, both the good and the evil, according to what
        precedes and follows in his text.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] But because in its will their soul will be turned away from God, and
        deprived of its own end, their bodies will not be spiritual, that is to
        say, entirely subject to the spirit; rather, by its affection their soul
        will be carnal.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Nor will their bodies have agility obeying the soul, so to say, with
        no difficulty, rather, they will be burdensome and heavy, and in some
        way hard for the soul to carry, just as their very souls are tamed away
        from God by disobedience.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] They will also remain capable of suffering, as they now are, or even
        more so; in such wise, nonetheless, that they will indeed suffer
        affliction from sensible things; and, for all that, no corruption; just
        as their souls also will be wracked, frustrated entirely in their
        natural desire for beatitude.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Their bodies also will be dense and darksome, just as their souls
        will be foreign to the light of divine knowledge. And this is what the
        Apostle says: “We shall all indeed rise again we shall not all be
        changed” (1 Cor. 15:51). For the good alone shall be changed for glory;
        it will be without glory that the bodies of the wicked shall rise.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] There is a chance, of course, that someone may see an impossibility
        in the fact that the bodies of the wicked are capable of suffering and,
        for all that, are not corruptible, because “every passion when
        intensified takes something away from substance.” For we see that a
        body, if it remains in a fire a long time, is finally consumed; and
        sorrow, if it be too intense, separates the soul from the body. But this
        entire process takes place on the basis of the transmutability of matter
        from form to form. But after the resurrection the human body will not be
        transmutable from form to form, in the case of the good or of the
        wicked; for in each class the body will be entirely perfected by the
        soul so far as its natural being is concerned. Thus, it will no longer
        be possible to remove this form from such a body, nor to introduce
        another form, when the divine power is subjecting the body entirely to
        the soul. Hence, also, that potency for every form which is in prime
        matter will be somehow bound by the power of the soul, lest it be able
        to be reduced to the act of another form. But, in regard to some
        conditions, the bodies of the damned will not be entirely subject to the
        soul; therefore, they will be sensibly afflicted by the contrariety of
        the sensibles. For they will be afflicted by bodily fire, so far as the
        quality of fire by its own excellence is the contrary of the equal
        balance and harmony that is connatural to the sensibility although it is
        unable to dissolve it. Nevertheless, such an affliction will not be able
        to separate the soul from the body, since the body necessarily must
        persist under the same form.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] Now, just as the bodies of the blessed, by reason of the newness of
        their glory, will be lifted above the heavenly bodies, so also the
        lowest place, one of darkness and punishment, will in proportion be set
        aside for the bodies of the damned. Hence the Psalmist says: “Let death
        come upon them and let them go down alive into hell” (Ps. 54:16). And
        the Apocalypse (20:9-10) says that “the devil who reduced them was cast
        into the pool of fire and brimstone where both the beast and the false
        prophet shall be tormented day and night for ever.”

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] But a doubt can arise as to the manner in which the devil, who has
        no body, and the souls of the damned before the resurrection, can suffer
        from the bodily fire by which the bodies of the damned will suffer in
        hell. As our Lord says: “Depart from Me you cursed into everlasting fire
        which was prepared for the devil and his angels” (Mat. 25:41).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] One must not, then, judge the matter thus: that non-bodily
        substances can suffer from bodily fire so that their nature is corrupted
        by fire, or altered, or in any other way at all transmuted, as our
        corruptible bodies do now suffer by fire; because non-bodily substances
        have no bodily matter so as to be able to be changed by bodily things,
        and they are not even receptive to sensible forms except
        intelligibly—such reception, of course, is not proper to punishment, but
        tends, instead, to perfect and to please.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Neither can it be said that they suffer affliction from bodily fire
        by reason of any contrariety, as the bodies will suffer after the
        resurrection, because the non-bodily substances do not have organs of
        sense and do not use sense powers.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Therefore, the non-bodily substances suffer from bodily fire in the
        manner of a certain bondage. For spirits are able to be bound by bodies:
        this can be by way of form, as the soul is bound to the human body to
        give it life; or it can be without being the form of a something, as the
        necromancers by the power of devils bind spirits by images or that sort
        of thing. Therefore,~,much Inore can the divine power bind the spirits
        to be damned by bodily fire. And this is to them the greater affliction:
        they know they are in bondage to the lowliest things as a punishment.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] It is also becoming that the damned spirits should be punished by
        bodily penalties. For the sin of every rational creature grows out of
        this: It is not subject to God in obedience. Punishment, of course,
        should answer to fault proportionally, with this result: that in its
        punishment the will suffer an affliction which is the contrary of that
        for whose love it sinned. Therefore, a befitting punishment to a sinning
        rational nature is this: to be subject somehow to the bondage of things
        which are its own inferiors, namely, bodily things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Again, the sin committed against God deserves not only the
        punishment of loss, but the punishment of sense, as we showed in Book
        III, for the punishment of sense answers to the fault in regard to the
        soul’s disordered turning toward a changeable good, as the punishment of
        loss answers to the fault in regard to its taming away from the
        unchangeable good. But the rational creature, and especially the human
        soul, sins by its disordered taming to bodily things. Therefore, its
        becoming punishment is affliction by bodily things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] It furthermore, an afflicting punishment be due to sin, the one we
        call “the pain Of sense,” such punishment ought to come from that which
        can bring on affliction. But nothing brings on affliction except so far
        as it is the contrary of the will. But it is not contrary to the natural
        will of a rational nature that it be united to a spiritual substance.
        Say, rather, this is a pleasure to it, and belongs to its perfection,
        for it is a union of like to like and of intelligible to intellect,
        since every spiritual substance is intelligible in itself. But it is
        contrary to the natural will of a spiritual substance to be in
        subjection to a body from which in the order of its own nature it ought
        to be free. It is, then, fitting to punish a spiritual substance with
        bodily things.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] In consequence, this, too, is clear: Grant that one understands the
        bodily aspects of the rewards of the blessed mentioned in Scripture
        spiritually, as was said about the promise of food and drink,
        nonetheless, when Scripture threatens certain bodily punishments to
        sinners, these are to be understood in a bodily fashion and taken in
        their own meaning. For there is nothing suitable about rewarding a
        superior nature by the use of an inferior one-the reward, rather, is in
        the union to the superior—but a superior nature is suitably punished by
        being turned over to its inferiors.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] For all that, there is no reason why even some of the things we read
        in Scripture about the punishments of the damned expressed in bodily
        terms should not be understood in spiritual terms, and, as it were,
        figuratively. Such is the saying of Isaiah (66:24): “Their worm shall
        not die”: by worm can be understood that remorse of conscience by which
        the impious will also be tortured, for a bodily worm cannot eat away a
        spiritual substance, nor even the bodies of the damned, which will be
        incorruptible. Then, too, the “weeping” and “gnashing of teeth” (Mat.
        8:12) cannot be understood of spiritual substances except
        metaphorically, although there is no reason not to accept them in a
        bodily sense in the bodies of the damned after the resurrection. For all
        that, this is not to understand weeping a loss of tears, for from those
        bodies there can be no loss, but there can be only the sorrow of the
        heart and the irritation of the eyes and the head which usually
        accompany weeping.

          >THAT IMMEDIATELY AFTER THEIR SEPARATION FROM THE BODY THE SOULS WILL
          RECEIVE PUNISHMENT OR REWARD</span
        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From these points, of course, we can gather that immediately after
        death the souls of men receive either punishment or reward according to
        their merits.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] For the separated souls are susceptible to punishment, not only to
        spiritual, but even to bodily, punishment, as has been shown. That they
        are susceptible to glory is manifest from the points treated in Book
        III. For the separation of the soul from the body makes it capable of
        the divine vision, and it was unable to arrive at this so long as it was
        united to the corruptible body. Now, in the vision of God consists man’s
        ultimate beatitude, which is the “reward of virtue.” But there would be
        no reason why punishment should differ from reward, in each of which the
        soul can share. Therefore, immediately after its separation from the
        body the man’s soul receives its reward or punishment “according as he
        bath done in the body (see 2 Cor. 5:10).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] In that life, too, there is the state of being paid or docked;
        hence, the comparison to “warfare” and “the days of the hireling,” as is
        clear in Job (7:1): “The life of man upon earth is a warfare, and his
        days are like the days of a hireling.” But, after the state of warfare
        and the labor of the hireling, the reward or punishment is straightway
        due those who have fought well or badly; hence, we read in Leviticus
        (19:13): `The wages of him that bath been hired by you shall not abide
        with you until the morning”; and in Joel (3:4): “I will very soon return
        you a recompense upon your own head.” Immediately after death,
        therefore, the souls receive either reward or punishment.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] There is, moreover, in the order of fault and merit a harmony with
        the order of punishment and reward. But merit and fault are fitted to
        the body only through the soul, since there is essentially no merit or
        demerit except so far as a thing is voluntary. Therefore, both reward
        and punishment flow suitably from the soul to the body, but it does not
        belong to the soul by reason of the body. There is, therefore, no reason
        in the infliction of punishment or bestowal of reward why the souls
        should wait for the resumption of their bodies; rather, it seems more
        fitting that, since the souls had priority in the fault or merit, they
        have priority also in being punished or rewarded.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Then, too, the same providence of God owes rational creatures their
        reward or punishment which bestows on the natural things the perfections
        due them. But it happens this way in natural things: Everything
        immediately receives the perfection for which it has capacity unless
        there is an obstacle and the part of the one receiving or of the one
        giving the perfection. Therefore, since the souls immediately after they
        are separated from the body have a capacity for glory or punishment,
        they will straightway receive one or the other, and neither the reward
        of the good nor the punishment of the evil is put off until the souls
        take up their bodies again.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Nonetheless, one must weigh the fact that in the case of the good
        there can be an obstacle to keep the souls from receiving their ultimate
        reward, which consists in the vision of God, right after their release
        from the body. To that vision no rational creature can be elevated
        unless it be thoroughly and entirely purified, since that vision exceeds
        the whole of the creatures natural powers. Hence, Wisdom (7:25) says of
        wisdom that “no defiled thing comes into her”; and Isaiah (55:8) says of
        “the holy way, the unclean shall not pass over it.” But by sin the soul
        is unclean in its disordered union to inferior things. To be sure, the
        soul is purified from this uncleanness in this life by penance and the
        other sacraments. as was said above, but it does at times happen that
        such purification is not entirely perfected in this life, one remains a
        debtor for the punishment, whether by reason of some negligence, or
        business, or even because a man is overtaken by death. Nevertheless, he
        I not entirely cut off from his”reward, because such things can happen
        without mortal sin, which alone takes away the charity to which the
        reward of eternal life is due. And this is clear from what was said in
        Book III. They must, then, be purged after this life before they achieve
        the final reward. This purgation, of course, is made by punishments,
        just as in this life their purgation would have been completed by
        punishments which satisfy the debt; otherwise, the negligent would be
        better off than the solicitous, if the punishment which they do not
        complete for their sins here need not be undergone in the future.
        Therefore, if the souls of the good have something capable of purgation
        in this world, they are held back from the achievement of their reward
        while they undergo cleansing punishments. And this is the reason we hold
        that there is a purgatory.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] This position, of course, is supported by the Apostle’s saying: “If
        any man’s work burn, he shall suffer loss; but he himself shall be saved
        yet so as by fire (1 Cor. 5: 15). There is also support in the universal
        custom of the Church which prays for the dead, such prayers would be
        useless, indeed, if one holds there is no purgatory after death. For the
        Church does not pray for those who are already at the goal of good or of
        evil, but for those who have not yet arrived at the goal.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] Now, the attainment immediately after death of -the punishment or of
        the reward if there be no obstacle is established by Scriptural
        authorities. For Job (21:3) says of the wicked: “They spend their days
        in wealth, and in a moment they go down to hell”; and Luke (16:22): “And
        the rich man,died and he was buried in hell.” Hell, of course, is the
        place where souls are punished. The same point is clear about the good,
        for, as Luke (23:43) has it, our Lord hanging on the cross said to the
        thief: “This day you shall be with Me in paradise.” By paradise one
        understands the reward which is promised to the good, as in the
        Apocalypse (2:7): “To him that overcomes I will give to eat of the tree
        of life which is in the paradise of My God.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] However, some do say that by “paradise” one understands not the
        ultimate reward which will be in heaven, as in Matthew (5:12): “Be glad
        and rejoice for your reward is very great in heaven,” but an equal
        reward upon earth. For “paradise seems to be an earthly place, from what
        Genesis (2:8) says: “The Lord God had planted a paradise of pleasure
        wherein He placed man whom He had formed.” But let a man consider
        rightly the words of sacred Scripture and he will find that the final
        recompense promised to the saints in heaven is given immediately after
        this life. For the Apostle, after he had spoken of the final glory,
        said: “That which is at present momentary and light of our tribulation
        works for us above measure exceedingly an eternal weight of glory, while
        we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not
        seen. For the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which
        are not seen are eternal” (2 Cor. 4: 17-18). Clearly, he is speaking of
        the final glory which is in heaven, and to show when and how this glory
        is had he adds: “For we know, if our earthly house of this habitation be
        dissolved, that we have a building of God, a house not made with hands,
        eternal in heaven” (2 Cor. 5: 1). By this he manifestly gives us to
        understand that when the body is dissolved the soul is led to an eternal
        and heavenly mansion which is nothing bbutt the enjoyment of divinity as
        the angels enjoy it in heaven.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [10] But someone may choose to contradict and to assert that the Apostle
        did not say that immediately on the dissolution of the body we are to
        have an eternal home in heaven in fact, but merely in hope, and at long
        last we are to have it in fact. Clearly, however, this is contrary to
        the Apostle’s intention, for, even while we live here, we are to have
        the heavenly mansion according to divine predestination; and we already
        have it in hope, as Romans (8:24) says: “For we are saved by hope.”
        Vainly, then, he added: “if our earthly house of this habitation be
        dissolved,” for it would have been enough to say: “We know that we have
        a building of God,” and so forth. The point is again and more expressly
        clear in the addition: “Knowing that while we are in the body we are
        absent from the Lord. For we walk by faith and not by sight. But we are
        confident and have a good will to be absent rather from the body, and to
        be present to the Lord” (2 Cor. 5:6-8). But we should be willing in vain
        “to be absent from the body,” meaning “separated,” unless we were to be
        straightway present to the Lord. But we are not present except when we
        behold by sight, for as long as we walk by faith and not by sight “we
        are absent from the Lord,” as he says there. Straightway, therefore,
        when the holy soul is separated from the body, it sees God by sight. And
        this is the ultimate beatitude, as was shown in Book III. The same truth
        is also made manifest by the words of the same Apostle: “Having a desire
        to be dissolved and to be with Christ” (Phil. 1:23). Now, Christ is in
        heaven. Therefore, the Apostle was hoping that immediately after the
        dissolution of his body he would arrive in heaven.

        [11] In this way one avoids the error of some of the Greeks, who deny
        purgatory and say that before the resurrection souls neither ascend into
        heaven nor descend into hell.

          >THAT THE SOULS OF THE SAINTS HAVE AFTER DEATH AN UNCHANGEABLE WILL IN

        >
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From these points this is clear: souls immediately after their
        separation from the body become unchangeable in will, with the result
        that the will of man cannot further be changed, neither from good to
        evil, nor from evil to good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] As long as the soul can be changed from good to evil or evil to
        good, it is in a state of struggle and warfare, for it must with
        solicitude resist evil lest it be conquered by evil, or it must try to
        be freed from it. Immediately after the soul is separated from the body
        it will not be in a state of warfare or struggle, but in a state of
        receiving reward or punishment, because it “has lawfully or unlawfully
        striven” (2 Tim. 2:5). For it was shown that reward or punishment
        follows immediately. No longer, then, is the soul able to be changed in
        its willing, whether from good to evil, or from evil to good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] Then, too, in Book III it was shown that beatitude which consists in
        the vision of God is everlasting; and in like fashion we showed in the
        same Book that mortal sin deserves eternal punishment. But a soul cannot
        be blessed if its will is not going to be right—and it ceases to be
        right by being tamed away from the end—but it cannot simultaneously be
        turned away from the end and enjoying the end. Necessarily, then, the
        rectitude of the will in the blessed soul is everlasting; as a result,
        it cannot be changed from good to evil.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] The rational creature, furthermore, naturally desires to be happy;
        hence, it cannot wish not to be happy. For all that, its will can be
        deflected from Him in whom its true beatitude consists; this is the
        perversity of will. And this takes place because that in which there is
        the true beatitude is not grasped essentially as beatitude, but
        something else is, and toward this the disordered will is deflected as
        though to an end. For example, take the man who puts his end in bodily
        pleasures; he thinks they are the greatest good, and this is essential
        to his beatitude. But those who are already happy grasp that in which
        there truly is beatitude essentially as beatitude and as ultimate end;
        otherwise, there would be therein no quiet of the appetite and, in
        consequence, they would not be happy. Therefore, all those who are happy
        cannot turn their wills away from Him in whom the true happiness is.
        Therefore, they can have no perversity of will.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Then, too, when what one has suffices him, he seeks nothing beyond
        it. But whoever is happy has what suffices him in the true beatitude;
        otherwise, his desire would not be fulfilled. Therefore, whoever is
        happy seeks nothing which does not belong to that in which true
        beatitude consists. But no one has a perverse will unless he wills
        something repugnant to Him in whom true beatitude consists. Therefore,
        there is no one of the blessed whose will can be changed to evil.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] There is more. Sin cannot take place in the will-without some sort
        of ignorance in the intellect, for we will nothing but the good whether
        true or apparent. For this reason Proverbs (14:27) says: “They err who
        work evil”; and in the Ethics the Philosopher says “every evil man is
        ignorant.” But the soul which is truly happy cannot be in ignorance at
        all, since in God it sees everything which belongs to its. perfection.
        Therefore, there is no way for it to have a bad will, especially since
        that vision of God is always actual, as was shown in Book III.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Our intellect, again, can be in error about some conclusion before a
        resolution into the first principles is made; once the resolution into
        the principles is made, one has knowledge of the conclusions in which
        there can be no falsity. “But what the principle of demonstration is in
        speculative matters, so the end is in matters of appetite.” Therefore,
        as long as we do not achieve the ultimate end our will can be perverted,
        but not after it arrives at the enjoyment of the ultimate end which is
        desirable in itself, just as the first principles of demonstration are
        known in themselves.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] The good, furthermore, is precisely as good the lovable. Therefore,
        that which is grasped as the best is the most lovable. But a happy
        rational substance that sees God grasps Him as the best. Therefore, it
        loves Him the most. But this is an essential of love: the wills of those
        who love each other are in conformity. Therefore, the wills of the
        blessed are most in conformity with God, and this makes rightness of
        will, since the divine will is the first rule of all wills. Therefore,
        the wills of those who see God cannot be rendered perverse.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] Once more: So long as a thing is by nature changeable to another it
        does not have its ultimate end. Therefore, if the blessed soul can still
        be changed from good to evil, it is not yet in its ultimate end. And
        this is against the essentials of beatitude. It is clear, then, that the
        souls which immediately after death are beatified become immutable in
        their wills.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] In the same way, also, the souls which immediately after death are
        made miserable in punishment become unchangeable in their wills.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] For we showed in Book III that mortal sin deserves everlasting
        punishment. But there would be no everlasting punishment of the souls of
        the damned if they were able to change their will for a better will; it
        would be unjust, indeed, if from the moment of their having a good will
        their punishment would be everlasting. Therefore, the will of the damned
        soul cannot be changed to good.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] There is more. The very disorder of the will is a kind of punishment
        and one of extreme affliction. The reason: So far as one has a
        disordered will he is displeased by whatever is done rightly, and the
        damned souls will be displeased because God’s will is fulfilled in all
        those who by sinning have sided against Him. Therefore, their disordered
        will shall never be taken away from them.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] The change of a will, furthermore, from sin to good takes place only
        by the grace of God, as what was said in Book III makes clear. But, just
        as the souls of the good are admitted to a perfect sharing in the divine
        goodness, so the souls of the damned are entirely excluded from grace.
        Therefore, they will not be able to change their will for the better.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Then again: just as the good when living in the flesh make God the
        end of all their works and desires, so also the wicked do with some
        improper end which turns them away from God. But the separated souls of
        the good will cleave unchangeably to the good they have set before
        themselves in this life; namely, to God. Therefore, the souls of the
        wicked will cleave unchangeably to the end which they themselves have
        chosen. Therefore, as the will of the good will not be able to become
        evil, so the will of the evil will not be able to become good.

        [1] There are some souls, however, which do not attain beatitude
        immediately after separation, and for all that are not damned, such are
        those who carry with them something subject to purging, as was said;
        therefore, one ought to show that not even souls of this kind after
        separation from the body are able to be changed in their wills. Now, the
        blessed and the damned souls have an unchangeable will by reason of the
        end to which they adhered, as what was said makes clear; but the souls
        which carry with them something subject to purging do not differ in end
        from the blessed souls, for they depart in charity by which we cleave to
        God as to an end. Those very souls, then, will have an unchangeable
        will.

      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] That the unchangeable character of will follows from the end in all
        the separated souls can be made clear this way. [2] “For the end,” as
        was said, “acts in matters of appetite as the first principles of
        demonstration do in speculative matters.” Of course, principles of this
        kind are known naturally, and, should there be an error about principles
        like these, it would come from the corruption of nature. Hence, a man
        could not change from a true acceptance of these principles to a false
        one—or conversely—except by a change in his nature, for he who errs in
        the principles cannot be called back by something more certain, as a man
        is called back from his error about a conclusion. In the same way, one
        could not be led away from his acceptance of the principles by something
        more evident. Thus, then, it is with regard to the end, for every man
        has by nature a desire of the ultimate end.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] To be sure, it follows universally on rational nature to desire
        beatitude, but the desire of this thing or that thing under the aspect
        of beatitude and ultimate end arises from some special disposition of
        nature; hence, the Philosopher says that “as a man is, so also the end
        appears to him.” Therefore, if that disposition in which something is
        desired as ultimate end cannot he removed from the man, neither will his
        will be able to be changed in respect to desire of that end.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Dispositions like these, of course, can be removed from us so long
        as the soul is united to -the body. For, that we desire a thing as the
        ultimate end sometimes happens from our being so disposed by a passion
        which quickly passes; hence, too, this desire of the end is easy to
        remove, as appears among the continent. Sometimes, however, we are
        disposed to the desire of a good end or a bad one by a habit, and that
        disposition is not easily taken away; hence, such a desire for an end
        persists rather strongly, as is clear among the temperate. For all that,
        an habitual disposition can be removed in this life.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] Thus, therefore, it is manifest that so long as the disposition
        persists in which a thing is desired as ultimate end, the desire of that
        end is not changeable, because the desire of the ultimate end is an
        extreme; hence, one cannot be called from desire of the ultimate end by
        something more desirable. The soul is, of course, in a mutable state so
        long as it is united to the body, but it will not be after it has been
        separated from the body. A disposition of the soul is changed
        incidentally with some change in the body, for, since it is at the
        service of the soul for its very own operations, the body was given to
        the soul by nature with this in view: that the soul existing within the
        body be perfected, be, as it were, moved toward its perfection. When it
        shall, then, be separated from the body it will not be in a state of
        motion toward the end, but in a state of rest in the end acquired. The
        soul’s will, therefore, will be immovable regarding a desire for the
        ultimate end.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] Now, on the ultimate end the entire goodness or wickedness of the
        will depends, for whatever goods one wills in an order toward a good end
        he wills well; whatever evil he wills in an order toward an evil end he
        wills badly. Therefore, there is not in the separated soul a will
        changeable from good to evil, although it is changeable from this object
        of will to that so long as the order to the same ultimate end is
        preserved.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] It is now apparent that such immutability is not in conflict with
        the power of free will whose act it is to choose, for choice is of the
        things for the end; choice is not of the ultimate end. Therefore, just
        as there is now no conflict with free will in the fact that with an
        immutable will we desire beatitude and fly from misery in general, so
        there will be no contrariety to free will in the fact that the will is
        unchangeably fixed upon some definite thing as upon an ultimate end. The
        reason: just as there now inheres in us unchangeably that common nature
        by which we desire beatitude in general, so then there will persist in
        us unchangeably that special disposition by which this thing or that is
        desired as ultimate end.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [8] On the other hand, the separate substances—namely, angels—are in the
        nature in which they are created closer neighbors to their ultimate
        perfection than human souls are, for they do not need to acquire
        knowledge from the senses nor to arrive at conclusions by reasoning from
        principles as souls do; rather, they are able by infused species to
        arrive straightway at the contemplation of truth. And therefore, just at
        the moment they adhered to the end which was due, or that which was not
        they persisted unchangeably therein.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [9] For all that, one should not think that the souls, after they take
        up their bodies again in the resurrection, lose the immutability of
        will; rather, they persevere therein, because, as was said above, the
        bodies in the resurrection will be disposed as the soul requires, but
        the souls will not be changed by means of the bodies.

        <span style="font-weight: bold">THE LAST JUDGMENT</span>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [1] From the foregoing it is clear, then, that there is a twofold
        retribution for what a man does in life: one for the soul—and this he
        receives as soon as the soul has been separated from the body, but there
        will be another retribution when the bodies are assumed again—and some
        will receive bodies which are incapable of suffering and glorious; but
        others, bodies capable of suffering and ignoble. The first retribution
        is made to men singly and one by one, in that men die separately and one
        by one. But the second retribution will be made to all and at the same
        time in that all will rise at the same time. Every retribution, of
        course, wherein different decisions are rendered according to differing
        merits demands a judgment. Necessarily, therefore, the judgment is
        twofold: There is one, regarding the soul, in which separately and one
        by one punishment or reward is determined; there is another common one,
        however, regarding the soul and body-in it there will be determined for
        all at the same time what they have earned.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] And since by His humanity in which He suffered and rose again Christ
        earned for us both resurrection and eternal life, it is to Him that
        universal judgment belongs, in which those who rise are rewarded or
        punished. For this reason we read of Him in John (5:27): “He has given
        Him power to do judgment, because He is the Son of man.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] A judgment, of course, ought to be proportional to the matters
        judged. And because the last judgment will be about the reward or
        punishment of visible bodies, it is suitable that it be carried on
        visibly. Hence, also, Christ will carry out that judgment in the form of
        humanity which all may be able to see, both the good and the wicked. The
        sight of His divinity, however, makes men blessed, as was shown in Book
        III. Accordingly, this will be visible only to the good. The judgment of
        the soul, of course, since it is about invisible things, is carried on
        invisibly.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Granted, of course, that Christ has the authoritative act of judging
        in that last judgment nonetheless at the same time those will judge with
        Him—sitting with the judge, as it were—who adhered to Him more than
        others. These are the Apostles, of whom it was said: “You, who have
        followed Me, shall sit on twelve seats judging the twelve tribes of
        Israel” (Mat. 19:2.8); and this promise is extended also to those who
        follow in the footprints of the Apostles.

        [1] When, therefore, the last judgment is completed, human nature will
        be entirely established in its goal. However, since everything bodily is
        somehow for the sake of man (as was shown in Book III), at that time,
        also, the entire bodily creation will be changed—and suitably—to be in
        harmony with the state of the men who then will be. And because men will
        then be incorruptible, the state of generation and corruption will then
        be taken away from the whole bodily creation. And this is what the
        Apostle says: that “the creature also itself shall be delivered from the
        servitude of corruption, into the liberty of the glory of the children
        of God” (Rom. 8: 21).
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [2] Now, generation and corruption in inferior bodies are caused by the
        movement of the heavens. Therefore, that generation and corruption may
        come to a stop in the inferior bodies, the movement of the heavens must
        also come to a stop. And on this account the Apocalypse (10:6) says
        “that time shall be no longer.”
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [3] It ought not, of course, seem impossible that the movement of the
        heavens come to a stop. For the movement of the heavens is not natural
        in the way the movement of heavy and light bodies is—that is, they are
        inclined to movement by an interior active principle—but it is called
        natural in that the heavenly body has an aptitude for such movement; the
        principle of that motion, however, is an intellect, as was shown in Book
        III. The heaven is moved, therefore, as are things moved by a will. But
        a will moves for a purpose. Of course, the purpose of the motion of the
        heavens cannot be the very movement itself, for motion, since it always
        tends toward another, does not have the character of an ultimate end.
        Neither can one say that the end of the heavenly motion is this: the
        reducing of the heavenly body from potency to act in place where. This
        potency can never be entirely reduced to act, for, while the heavenly
        body is actually in one place where, it is in potency to another such,
        just as is the case of prime matter with respect to forms. Therefore,
        just as nature in generation does not have as end the reduction of
        matter from potency to act, but something consequent on this
        reduction—namely, that perpetuity in things by which they approach a
        divine likeness—so the end of heavenly motion is not the being reduced
        from potency to act, but something consequent on this reduction: namely,
        to be made like to God in the act of causing. But all things generable
        and corruptible caused by the motion of the heaven are somehow ordered
        to man as to an end, a s was shown in Book III. Therefore, the motion of
        the heaven is especially on account of the generation of men; in this it
        does most to accomplish a divine likeness in the act of causing, since
        man’s form—namely, the rational soul—is immediately created by God, as
        was shown in Book II. But the multiplication of souls to infinity cannot
        be an end, for infinity is contrary to the notion of end. Nothing
        awkward, then, ensues if we hold that, when a fixed number of men is
        filled out, the motion of the heavens ceases.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [4] Nonetheless, when the motion of the heavens and generation and
        corruption in the elements have come to a stop, their substance will
        continue to be by reason of the changelessness of the divine goodness,
        “for He created all things that they might be” (Wis. 1:14). Hence, the
        being of things which have an aptitude for perpetuity will remain in
        perpetuity. Both wholly and in part, of course, the heavenly bodies have
        the nature to be everlasting. The elements, however, have it wholly, but
        not in part, for in part they are corruptible. Man, of course, has it in
        part, but not wholly: for the rational soul is incorruptible; the
        composite, corruptible. These, then, which in any way at all have an
        aptitude for being everlasting will abide in their substance in that
        last state of the world, and God in His power will supply what is
        wanting in their own weakness.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [5] But the other animals, the plants, and the mixed bodies, those
        entirely corruptible both wholly and in part, will not remain at all in
        that state of incorruption. In this way, then, must the saying of the
        Apostle be understood: “The fashion of this world passes away” (1 Cor.
        7:31), that this appearance of the world which now is will cease to be,
        but the substance will remain. Thus, also, is understood what Job
        (24:12) says: “Man, when he is fallen asleep, shall not rise again: till
        the heavens be broken” that is, until that disposition of the heaven
        ceases to be, that in which it is moved and causes motion in others.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [6] But since among the other elements fire is the most active, and
        tends to consume the corruptible, the consumption of the things which
        ought not remain in the future state will most suitably take place by
        fire. Hence, one holds in accord with the faith that at the last the
        world will be purified by fire, not from corruptible bodies alone, but
        from that infection which the place incurred by serving as the dwelling
        of sinners. And this is what is said in 2 Peter (3:7): “The heavens and
        the earth which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved
        unto, fire against the day of judgment,” so that we may understand by
        “heavens” not the very firmament in which the stars are, whether fixed
        or wandering, but those heavens of air which are close to the earth.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">
        [7] Since, then, the bodily creation will at the last be disposed in
        harmony with the state of man—since men, of course, will not only be
        freed from corruption but also clothed with glory, as what has been said
        makes clear—necessarily even the bodily creation will achieve a kind of
        resplendence in its own way.
